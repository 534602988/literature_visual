The results show that a portfolio size of 11 stocks is generally sufficient to generate reasonable risk rewards. The results, confirmed by holdout validation, also suggest that the conditional optimal and minimized variance allocation methods yield high risk reward, while the equal weight method has the poorest performance.","[Ng, Keat-Yung; Goh, Kim-Leng] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Ng, KY (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"Goh, Kim-Leng/B-3949-2009","Goh, Kim-Leng/0000-0002-2367-8303",,,,,5,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,538,542,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700102,0

Following the analysis made it can be concluded that the average efficiency of health spending at EU level is sub unitary, revealing that the level of benefits is lower than the level of funding. Countries that have reached the level of efficiency are considered those with a ratio between effect and effort larger than 1, namely Slovenia and Luxembourg. Romania, although it does not reach the minimum level of efficiency, recorded a roughly balance between effects and efforts.

Nearly all EU countries subsidise such areas. Less Favoured Areas are characterised by comparatively poor natural conditions for agricultural production. This can result from poor soil quality, or, in mountainous areas, from the prevailing altitude and slope. Above all, it is the objective of the subsidies to maintain the agricultural production in these areas. At present, the funding is implemented within the framework of the Programmes for the Development of Rural Areas 2007 to 2013. The support of affected agricultural businesses shows significant impacts in mainly four areas. One such area is the income of affected farmers. Payments compensate them for differences in income resulting from the natural disadvantages that may force them to abandon farming. The other areas relate to maintaining a continuous land use, to impacts on the rural society and to effects on the environment. The latter are subject of this article. Research has shown that agricultural practices within Less Favoured Areas are more environmentally friendly than in other areas. Environmentally friendly in this regard means e.g. lower use of fertilizers and pesticides, but also a higher participation rate in agri-environmental measures. More detail is given for various such regions in Germany. While the results presented in this paper relate mainly to Germany, information on European level is also taken into consideration. Finally, based on these investigations, recommendations for the revision of the funding programmes following 2013 are given.","Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, D-18059 Rostock, Germany",University of Rostock,"Rudow, K (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Justus von Liebig Weg 7, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",Katja.rudow@uni-rostock.de,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,117,125,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100012,0

The assessment framework allows to compare power generation technologies based on social costs. The Main indicators selected for technologies assessment are: private costs and external costs of GHG emissions. The ranking of energy technologies based on total social costs allows to identify the most perspective technologies in future taking into account international climate change mitigation constraints in 2020 and 2050 and to promote these technologies by specific policy tools. The main results presented in this paper were obtained during EU financed Framework 7 project PLANETS dealing with probabilistic long-term assessment of new energy technology scenarios. For all policy scenarios electricity generation technologies ranking in 2020 and 2050 based on external GHG costs provides the same results as the same data on life cycle GHG emissions were applied for technologies ranking. The most competetive technology according all policy scenarios based on external GHG costs in 2020 and 2050 is biomass IGCC with CO2 capture biomass followed by other biomass technologies.

Both models explicitly take account of output risk in determining efficient benchmarks. Output risk is measured and included in both models as standard deviation of total farm gross margin but different assumptions are formulated with respect to the correlation of the output among observations. Contrasting the results of the two risk-adjusted models to those of the standard DEA model reveals significant differences in efficiency scores.

Because in farming commodity and non-commodity outputs are jointly produced this requires careful analysis of whether the bundle of outputs is socially optimal. In case of non-optimal provision of public goods, it means that governance structures or institutions have to be developed for correcting the composition of the output bundle. In the article we argue that hybrid governance structures, which are defined as structures in which actors with autonomous property rights transfer part of their rights to other stakeholders or to the public sector, may play an important role. Based on the theory of hybrid governance structures for private goods, the concept of hybrid organisations in public good markets is conceptualised and illustrated for the provision of non-market or public goods or services such as landscape services.","[Van Huylenbroeck, Guido; Mettepenningen, Evy] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Van Huylenbroeck, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Guido.vanhuylenbroeck@ugent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017",,,,,,36,4,4,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,377,386,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100040,0

Based on a primary survey of rural handloom clusters in Ethiopia, this article examines the mechanism and performance of clustering. Given weak financial institutions, clustered producers and traders use trade credits to ease working capital constraints. Moreover, geographical clustering enables entrepreneurs with limited capital to enter the business through shared workspaces and fine division of labour. An improvement in infrastructure can further enhance firm performance in a cluster. In towns with electricity access, producers work longer hours by sharing lit workspaces at lower rental cost.","[Zhang, Xiaobo; Moorman, Lisa] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Ayele, Gezahegn] Ethiopian Dev Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Zhang, XB (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",x.zhang@cgiar.org,"zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023","zhang, xiaobo/0000-0002-4981-9565",,,,,21,11,12,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

The results of the analysis show that the jobs-housing balance has a statistically significant association with a worker's commuting time when the factors of transport accessibility, population density and worker's socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. The higher the jobs-housing balance, the shorter the worker's commuting time. The finding suggests that the jobs-housing balance still has significant implications for commuting time, although the recent market-oriented reforms in housing are changing the jobs-housing balance in the danwei system that prevailed in the socialist era. As the housing markets are imperfect, with strong government intervention in Beijing, the finding implies that the co-location hypothesis - which believes development management would create 'barriers' to a jobs-housing balance and increase commuting time - needs to be rethought before it can be generalized and applied to China's cities. The results of the analysis also show that the workers living in danwei housing still have shorter commuting time. The finding indicates that the housing marketization is likely to induce a local jobs-housing imbalance and thereby increase commuting time. In this sense, a deterioration in the jobs-housing imbalance and increased commuting time in Beijing may owe much to the adoption of market-based housing supply. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An announcement of being underwritten by the firm's lending-relationship bank reduces ex post information asymmetry, thereby improving the announcement return. Further, because this reduction in information asymmetry effectively disseminates what was previously the lending bank's private information, it decreases its affiliated market maker's information advantage, thus reducing its contribution to price discovery and liquidity.

In laboratory experiments, participants often exhibit social preferences such as altruism, spite, reciprocity and notions of fairness. In contrast, traditional neoclassical theory assumes that people act rationally in a way that maximises their self-interest. In environmental markets, social preferences and self-interest interact. We apply experimental economics to test the hypothesis that social preferences are not maintained in the presence of a competitive market institution. In the initial public goods game, many participants were prepared to make costly voluntary contributions. However the introduction of the market institution triggered a 'market instinct' in experimental participants. They abandoned the social preferences they were previously expressing and became self-interested profit maximisers. This self-interested behaviour persisted even after the market institution was discontinued. These findings are important to understanding the role and impact of markets for environmental policy.","[Reeson, Andrew F.] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Tisdell, John G.] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania,"Reeson, AF (通讯作者)，CSIRO, GPO Box 284, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",andrew.reeson@csiro.au; john.tisdell@utas.edu.au,"Reeson, Andrew/A-1207-2011","Reeson, Andrew/0000-0002-1603-2731; Tisdell, John/0000-0001-9949-1644",,,,,24,23,27,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A general finding is that when MPC members are not too diverse in terms of expertise and experience, policy discussions should not be based on preprepared policy options. Instead, interest rate proposals should arise endogenously as a majority of views expressed by the members, as is the case at the Bank of England and appears to be the case in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) under Chairman Bernanke.

Using insights from a number of bodies of literature, the article interprets business services outsourcing as corporate restructuring involving the administrative functions of the firm. Propositions are developed around the following. First, the existing corporate structure and the nature of supplier markets affect the paths chosen to create shared business services and to move to outsourcing. Second, the trajectory of the move to shared services and outsourcing affects the distribution of capabilities between users and suppliers. The study examines these propositions through a comparison of human resource outsourcing in two leading consumer products companies, Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Unilever. We find that a relatively high degree of centralization at P&G led it to create an internal shared services center before outsourcing, whilst a more decentralized Unilever utilized outsourcing as an occasion for globally standardizing its systems and processes. The article draws implications of these different paths for core capabilities.","[Gospel, Howard] Univ Oxford, Univ London Kings Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Gospel, Howard; Sako, Mari] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of London; King's College London; University of Oxford,"Gospel, H (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Univ London Kings Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",howard.gospel@sbs.ox.ac.uk; mari.sako@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,"Gospel, Howard Frederick/0000-0003-0037-542X","ESRC [ES/G020183/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020183/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,53,64,72,2,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Indeed, because of differentiation, the incumbent's inferior product is not eliminated upon entry. Due to the resulting competitive pressure, a retailer who considers rejecting the exclusivity contract expects to earn much less than the incumbent's monopoly rents. Thus, in equilibrium, the incumbent can always offer high enough an upfront payment to induce all retailers to sign the contract and achieve exclusion. This is true under linear pricing for intermediate levels of entry costs, and with two-part tariffs even in the absence of entry costs.","[Argenton, Cedric] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Argenton, Cedric] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Argenton, C (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands.",c.argenton@tilburguniversity.nl,,"Argenton, Cedric/0000-0002-1701-3188",,,,,24,14,14,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1821,,,J IND ECON,J.

Tri-variate VAR-GARCH(1,1)-in-mean models are estimated for 41 emerging market economies (EMEs) in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. The models capture a range of possible transmission channels: spillovers in mean returns, volatility, and cross-market GARCH-in-mean effects. Hypotheses about the importance of different channels are tested. The results suggest that spillovers from regional and global markets are present in the vast majority of EMEs. However, the nature of cross-market linkages varies across countries and regions. While spillovers in mean returns dominate in emerging Asia and Latin America, spillovers in variance appear to play a key role in emerging Europe. There is also some evidence of cross-market GARCH-in-mean effects.

We conclude that the EITC's welfare-enhancing properties are undermined by the interaction of the program's fixed national rules and geographic variation in wages and the cost-of-living.

Data were processed following a Differences-in-Differences (DID) method. Then we use the estimation of the impact on academic achievement to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis and take a reduction of the class size program as a benchmark.

New lending for real investment (such as working capital and capital expenditures) fell by only 14% in the last quarter of 2008, but contracted nearly as much as new lending for restructuring (LBO5, M&As, share repurchases) relative to the peak of the credit boom. After the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, there was a run by short-term bank creditors, making it difficult for banks to roll over their short term debt. We find that there was a simultaneous run by borrowers who drew down their credit lines, leading to a spike in commercial and industrial loans reported on bank balance sheets. We examine whether these two stresses on bank liquidity led them to cut lending. In particular, we show that banks cut their lending less if they had better access to deposit financing and thus, they were not as reliant on short-term debt. We also show that banks that were more vulnerable to credit-line drawdowns because they co-syndicated more of their credit lines with Lehman Brothers reduced their lending to a greater extent.

The model incorporates travel by auto, microbus, public bus, and rail, as well as externalities from local and global air pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents. In our benchmark case, the optimal gasoline tax is $2.72 per gallon, or 16 times the current tax. However, a per mile toll would reduce traffic congestion, the largest externality, more directly, and we put the optimized auto toll at 20.3 cents per mile. Tolls on microbuses also improve efficiency, though the gains are on a smaller scale, as are those from reforming public transit fares. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Parry, Ian W.

In our model, a payment platform allocates the total cost of a card transaction between a monopolistic issuer and a monopolistic acquirer by choosing an interchange fee. We determine how the level of the interchange fee impacts a merchant's decision to issue private cards, if there are strategic interactions between merchants. We prove that the payment platform can only deter entry by lowering the level of the interchange fee. If the payment platform chooses to accommodate entry, we find that the total user surplus increases, but that entry is beneficial to social welfare only if the entry cost is sufficiently low.

Based on the analysis of local changes relative to these mean-variance and higher moment (in casu, mean-variance-skewness and mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis) frontiers, this methodology allows to neatly separate between on the one hand performance changes due to portfolio strategies and on the other hand performance changes due to the market evolution.

The degree of catch-up is measured in terms of the TFP gap between each Korean firm and the industry average of the Japanese firms in each sector. Regressions are then employed to establish the determinants of the TFP gap or catch-up. These determinants are classified into two groups: sectoral- and firm-level variables. Sectoral-level variables, drawn from the sectoral innovation system literature, test the hypothesis that catch-up is more likely to occur in certain sectors than in others. It is found that TFP catch-up by Korean firms is more likely to occur in sectors where technologies are more explicit and easily embodied in imported equipment. This discovery helps explain why the TFP of Korean firms is now close to, or even higher than those of Japanese firms in the electronics sector, and why TFP gaps still remain after some catch-up in the automobile sectors associated with more tacit knowledge regimes. Second, the degree of the sectors' top firm dominance is positively related to the TFP catch-up, implying that catch-up is more likely to occur in sectors with more monopolistic market structures. It is also shown that firms in a monopolistic market structure should be subjected to the world market discipline to attain better performance in the productivity catch-up. Third, sector-level variables only affect international TFP catch-up, whereas firm-level variables determine intranational catch-up. Important results remain consistent in some robustness tests using different proxies for sectoral variables and catch-up as measured in labor productivity, as well as in the results obtained from using period average variables rather than yearly variables.","[Jung, Moosup] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",Samsung; Seoul National University (SNU),"Jung, M (通讯作者)，Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",moosup.jung@samsung.com; kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",,,,,59,58,61,5,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Trade structure variables show strong evidence of positive effects on growth. Free-trade agreements/areas (FTAs) also enhance economic growth.

For the six components of CAMELS system, 17 financial ratios were chosen and with these ratios; reference values, index values and CAMELS scores are obtained. No e of the banks could obtain an improvement in all of the six CAMELS components for the five years period. It has been observed that each of the banks achieved improvements for different CAMELS components. As a result of the analysis, an improvement in the CAMELS ratings is observed for the 88% of the banks analyzed. It is determined that the improvement obtained is mainly from the component of Liquidity. Nonetheless, the banks which had descending CAMELS ratings are because of the components as Asset Quality, Management Quality and predominant Sensitivity to Market Risk. None of the banks showed an integrated improvement for each of the component for five years. The banks that analyzed showed improvement for different components, nonetheless bank strategies have fragility and effects of crisis.","[Tukenmez, Mine; Kutay, Nilguen] Dokuz Eylul Univ, IIBF, Isletme Bolumu, Iletisimden Sorumlu Yazar, TR-35210 Alsancak, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Tükenmez, M (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, IIBF, Isletme Bolumu, Iletisimden Sorumlu Yazar, TR-35210 Alsancak, Turkey.",mine.tukenmez@deu.edu.tr; nilgun.kutay@deu.edu.tr; cenk.akkaya@dcu.edu.tr,,,,,,,6,2,3,2,27,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

A common dynamic that is very favorable to the development of combined transport is shared among the actors of the transport chain but with different starting positions considering the ports of the Northern Range. But combined transport must still demonstrate that it can compete with road transport. Road transport and combined transport are not directly comparable because they do not offer the same physical transport service. The organizational patterns of road and combined transport are investigated. The example of hinterland services to and from the port of Le Havre to the Paris region is a particularly interesting case because of the very short distance. It is shown that the competitiveness of combined transport in terms of price varies greatly according to the way road transport it competes with is organized and that the commercial policy of combined transport operators plays a key role for explaining this competitiveness. Additional services such as additional dwelling times and specific custom advantages are paramount of importance to encourage the shift from road transport to combined transport.

The paper identifies the technical features of water control systems and the institutional features of the Indian (water) governance structure as the material conditions of that polarization and the source of the deadlock. I argue that the form and content of agricultural water use debates and struggles reflect and help to reproduce their material conditions of existence rather than to transform them.

But, how can reductions in tariffs ceilings, i.e. tariff rates that no exporter may ever actually be confronted with, generate market access? The answer to this question relates to the effects of tariff bindings on the risk that exporters face in destination markets. The present paper formalizes the underlying interaction of risk, fixed export costs and firms' market entry decisions based on techniques known from the real options literature; doing so we highlight the important role of bound tariffs at the extensive margin of trade. We find that bound tariffs are more effective with higher risk destination markets, that a large binding overhang may still command substantial market access, and that reductions in bound tariffs generate effective market access even when bound rates are above current and long-term applied rates.","[Sala, Davide; Schroder, Philipp J.

The impact of home market, host market and parent bank characteristics are considered within the frameworks offered by comparative advantage and new trade theories. Parametric distance functions are used to estimate the efficiency of foreign banks in Australia, and the robustness of model specification is tested using both general-to-specific modelling and extreme bounds analysis. It is found that following clients reduces the efficiency of profit creation. Incumbent bank's market share acts as a barrier to entry, while parent bank profits do not improve host nation efficiency. The limited global advantage hypothesis was found to be relevant for banks from the United Kingdom, while banks from the United States were generally less efficient.

We also employ an augmented model that includes trading volume as a technical indicator to improve the ability of the model to time bubble collapses and to better capture the temporal variations in returns. We find that well over half of the S&P 500 index by market capitalization and seven of its ten sector component indices exhibited at least some bubble-like behavior over our sample period. Thus the speculative bubble that grew in the 1990s and subsequently collapsed was surprisingly pervasive in the US equity market and it affected numerous sectors including financials and general industrials, rather than being confined to information technology, telecommunications and the media. In addition, we develop a joint model for cross-sectional contagion of bubbles across the sectors and we examine whether there is evidence for bubble spillovers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using a 10-year student-level panel data set from North Carolina, we examine how school-specific pressure associated with status and growth approaches to school accountability affect student achievement at different points in the prior-year achievement distribution. Achievement gains for students below the proficiency cut point emerge in schools failing either type of accountability standard, with the effects clearer for math than for reading. In contrast to prior research highlighting the possibility of educational triage, we find little or no evidence that Wing schools in North Carolina ignore the students far below proficiency under either approach. Importantly, we find that the status, but not the growth, approach reduces the reading achievement of higher performing students. Our analysis suggests that the distributional effects of accountability pressure depend not only on the type of pressure fir which schools are held accountable (status or growth), but also the tested subject.

However, because income and wealth inequalities exist to some degree in all societies, these two key motives can point to different decisions. In particular, when a beneficiary is less wealthy than the benefactor, a reciprocal action can lead to greater inequality. In this paper, we report data from a trust game variant where trustees' responses to kind intentions generate inequality in favor of investors. In relation to a standard trust game treatment where trustees' responses reduce inequality, the proportion of non-reciprocating decisions is twice as large when reciprocity promotes inequality. Moreover, we find that investors expect that this will be the case.

Evidence from US cities,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Markov switching; Time varying transition probabilities; Leading indicator; Recession,MONETARY-POLICY; PRICES; STATES,"In a recent paper, Learner (2007) identified housing as an important precursor of the national business cycle. Previous work, on the other hand, has shown that regional cycles may not be synchronous with the aggregate cycle. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between housing and the business cycle at the MSA-level for a set of 51 US cities. We find that declines in house prices are often not followed by declines in that city's employment. While the growth rates in housing variables appeared to slow ahead of city-level peaks, we find no consistent statistical relationship suggesting a city's permits or prices influences its business cycle. in fact, we find that national permits are a better leading indicator for a city's employment than a city's own permits. This suggest the possibility that housing is merely a proxy for other consumption or wealth indicators. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Taking the intertemporal consumption choices given, corporate investors are expected to prefer time-preference-fitted dividends if tax rates remain constant over time; otherwise they confront a larger amount of tax obligation. If dividend shortfalls exist, they must realize capital gains and thereby suffer unfavorable tax treatment, whereas excessive payments cause intertemporal double taxation on reinvested dividends.

This paper develops a replacement rate measure that better corresponds with a replacement of consumption by properly accounting Ear savings, taxes, and owner-occupied housing. Savings and investment behavior judged by standard analysis to be inadequate is shown to result in high real consumption during retirement relative to pre-retirement consumption. For example, the simulated savings and investment behavior of single individuals M this study results in retirement income of about 60% of final earnings, well below the typical adequacy threshold of 75-80%. However. this corresponds to replacing about 90% of pre-retirement consumption for renters and over 100% for homeowners who have paid off their mortgage.","Investment Co Inst, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Brady, PJ (通讯作者)，Investment Co Inst, 1401 H St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",pbrady@ici.org,,,,,,,26,17,22,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Both categories are treated independently in the calculation of risk capital. But many financial positions depend simultaneously on both market risk and credit risk factors. In this case, an approximation of the portfolio value function separating value changes into a pure market risk plus pure credit risk component can result not only in an overestimation, but also in an underestimation of risk.

Through exploring this case and contrasting it with Cuba's repeasantization programme in the 1990s, I draw conclusions that extend our understanding of what makes such a state-led development programme work. The state in Venezuela played an indispensable role by providing many forms of necessary support for launching such an ambitious project - e.g. financial resources and legal title to the land - but failed to truly increase participation in decision-making. Increased participation by those affected by the Vuelta al Campo programme could have prevented or minimized some of the problems that arose. Moreover, the programme had the unintended consequence of demobilizing participants who had previously been politically engaged. This demobilization undermined the larger national social project - building '21st-century socialism'.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Page, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",paget@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,28,14,16,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1471-0358,,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The motivation for such support is predicated on the view that small firms create more jobs per unit of investment by virtue of being more labor intensive and that the jobs so created are concentrated among the low-skilled and hence the poor. To assess whether the program has succeeded in biasing technology adoption in favor of labor and thereby contributed to poverty reduction, the impact of the program on technology usage, labor intensity, and earnings is investigated using a unique matched workers-firms dataset, the Addis Ababa Construction Enterprise Survey (AACES), collected specifically for the purpose of analyzing the impact of the program. We find that program firms do not adopt different technologies and are not more labor intensive than nonprogram firms. There is an earnings premium for program participants, who tend to be relatively well educated, which is heterogeneous and highest for those at the bottom of the earnings distribution.

The results show that overall social spending is able to smooth about 15 percent of a shock to GDP. Among its sub-categories, social spending devoted to Old Age, Health and Unemployment are those that contribute more to provide smoothing. Moreover, the stabilization effects of social spending are significantly larger in those countries where the size of social spending is higher, and in countries in which social spending is less volatile.

Tax morale is modeled as asocial norm for tax compliance. The strength of the norm is shaped endogenously. depending on the share of evaders in the society. Taxpayers act conditionally cooperative as their evasion depends on the others' compliance. We characterize the equilibrium which accounts for this interdependence and study the implications for tax and enforcement policies. The analysis is extended to the case of a society consisting of heterogenous communities. Individual evasion decisions are then embedded in a complex social structure and behavior is influenced by the norm compliance among morale reference groups. Within this framework, we highlight the role of belief management as an alternative policy tool. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing the Federal Reserve's Responses to the Crises of 1929-1933 and 2007-2009,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LIQUIDITY,"The financial crisis of 2007-09 is widely viewed as the worst financial disruption since the Great Depression of 1929-33. However, the accompanying economic recession was mild compared with the Great Depression, though severe by postwar standards. Aggressive monetary, fiscal, and financial policies are widely credited with limiting the impact of the recent financial crisis on the broader economy. This article compares the Federal Reserve's responses to the financial crises of 1929-33 and 2007-09, focusing on the effects of the Fed's actions on the composition and size of the Fed balance sheet, the monetary base, and broader monetary aggregates. The Great Depression experience showed that central banks should respond aggressively to financial crises to prevent a collapse of the money stock and price level. The modern Fed appears to have learned this lesson; however, some critics argue that, in focusing on the allocation of credit, the Fed was too slow to increase the monetary base. The Fed's response to the financial crisis has raised new questions about the appropriate role of a lender of last resort and the long-run implications of actions that limit financial losses for individual firms and markets.

We find several Measures of risk-taking decline significantly for US versus non-US firms after SOX. The magnitudes of the declines are related to several firm characteristics, including pre-SOX board structure, firm size, and R&D expenditures.

This paper then demonstrates that the use of personality measures, in a new technique developed by Plumper and Troeger (2007). can help researchers obtain improved estimates for important characteristics such as marital status, disability and income. The paper argues that this has important practical implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We use a new and unique data set based on the EBRD Banking Environment and Performance Survey (BEPS), which was conducted for 220 banks in 20 transition countries. We show that bank ownership, bank size, and legal creditor protection are important determinants of the composition of banks' loan portfolios.

This discussion highlights three main issues. First, the hypothesized links between conservatism and future investments are potentially incomplete. In particular, the possibility that conservatism can have dysfunctional outcomes if acquisition decisions are based on anticipated earnings effects is ignored. Second, the evidence is insufficient to infer a causal relation between conservatism and acquisition profitability. Third, the hypothesis development fails to indicate whether timely loss recognition or the asymmetric timeliness of loss versus gain recognition is the more appropriate measure of conservatism given the context.

Studies on gender and environmental governance have focused mainly on women's limited participation in local institutions. Both bodies of work leave important aspects unexplored. The former neglects the in-between process - the impact of women's numbers on their effective participation, such as attending and speaking up at meetings, and holding office. The latter neglects to ask: what impact would increasing women's proportions have on participation and what proportions are effective? Rigorous empirical analysis is also scarce. Addressing these gaps, this paper, based on primary data for community forestry institutions in India and Nepal, statistically tests if a group's gender composition affects women's effective participation, and if there are any critical mass effects. The results support the popularly emphasized proportions of one-quarter to one-third, but women's economic class also matters, as do some factors other than women's numbers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The essential features include centrality of actors, fragmentation and cliques,as well as density of the networks. Furthermore, conclusions are drawn concerning network governance. Data for the research were collected from four cases in Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands. The goal of the research is to discover which types of networks exist in seniors' housing industry as well as the roles of public-and private-sector actors in different networks. The study shows that business networks in seniors' housing industry are end-customer centralized and fragmented into housing and service networks. Besides that the end-customer is the most central actor in the network, it is the only significant connector between the two sub-networks. Central producers in the sub-networks are either public or non-profit actors. However, it was discovered that, no unambiguous lead organization governed network exist in seniors' housing industry.

Then, we obtain lower bounds for American option prices and the optimal exercise boundary which improve the bounds of Broadie and Detemple (1996). With the tight lower bound for the optimal exercise boundary, we further derive a tight upper bound for the American option price using the early exercise premium integral of Kim (1990) [Kim, I.j., 1990. The analytic valuation of American options. Review of Financial Studies 3, 547-572]. The numerical results show that our lower and upper bounds are very tight and can improve the pricing errors of the lower bound and upper bound of Broadie and Detemple (1996) by 83.0% and 87.5%, respectively. The tightness of our upper bounds is comparable to some best accurate/efficient methods in the literature for pricing American options.

We show that trading restrictions are essential because they prevent the manager from undoing the incentive effects of performance-based fees.

In this context more and more attention is being paid to private risk-managing instruments such as storage. The effects of storage have already been widely studied in the economic literature. But hardly any of these studies take account of the links between producers', households' and stockholders' intertemporal decisions and, in particular, they do not use a dynamic CGE model. Furthermore, a large number of previous studies focus on the effect of stockholding on price volatility due to exogenous shocks and assume rational expectations. It is more the endogenous aspect of risk, induced by expectation errors, that has often been used to justify public intervention in agricultural markets. In this paper we construct a model addressing these issues and we conduct some illustrative simulations. Some of our results are at variance with the conclusions of previous economic studies concerning the effects of speculative storage on market volatilities. We also reveal the vital role played by the form of economic agents' expectations and by the links between the intertemporal decisions of market participants.","[Femenia, Fabienne] INRA, F-35011 Rennes, France; [Femenia, Fabienne] Agrocampus Ouest, UMR SMART 1302, F-35011 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; INRAE; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest,"Femenia, F (通讯作者)，INRA, 4 Allee Adolphe Bobierre,CS 61103, F-35011 Rennes, France.",fabienne.femenia@rennes.inra.fr,,"Femenia, Fabienne/0000-0001-7804-1847",Pluriagri; European Commission [212036],Pluriagri; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Financial support received from Pluriagri and the New Issues in Agricultural, Food and Bio-energy Trade (AGFOODTRADE) (Small and Medium Scale Focused Research Project, Grant Agreement no. 212036) research project, funded by the European Commission, is gratefully acknowledged.

Consistent with previous results, we find that large firms linearly lead small firms. We also find a significant linear causality in the direction from small firms to large firms, particularly in the more recent time period where the impact from small firms to large firms is greater than from large to small. More important, in contrast to the received literature, we find significant nonlinear causality that is bi-directional and of the same duration in either direction. Using the BEKK asymmetric GARCH model we are able to capture most of the detected nonlinear relationship. This indicates that volatility spillovers are largely responsible for the observed nonlinear Granger causality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Many companies would like to operate companies they acquired as separate legal entities rather than a whole company. However, from a financial reporting point of view, statement users want to see the entire economic entity's financial statement result. Accounting principles require consolidated financial statements when a parent company owns more than 50% of a Subsidiary company. Consolidated statements are basically used to present for the benefit of the shareholders, creditors and other resource providers of the parent. It is first necessary to obtain a conceptual understanding of goodwill in order to understand its composition, and measurement is then a separate issue. Goodwill is not simply a residual, the difference between an amount paid and something acquired.","[Guo Qin] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,4,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54627-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,301,306,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYZ54,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799000048,0

Estimation results strongly support our model of production and supply of BMI (body-mass index) and weight. The analysis indicates strong links between dietary patterns, individual characteristics, environmental factors and obesity in Russia. Understanding these relationships is important for designing effective public policies aiming to improve overall nutritional wellbeing and reduce obesity and mortality of the Russian population.

The SMEs have an important position in the world wide economy. The accounting information provided by them must have the same role. On the enterprise level, IFRS application to Small and Medium-Sized Entities (SMEs) is an issue of comparability and cost. On the other hand the development of a global accounting system involves the preservation of national financial accounting practices. We sustain the idea of an accounting system that allows the small entity to choose between an IFRS for SMEs and the national accounting regulations. However, this global accounting standard may represents a very significant step on the path to global convergence of financial reporting practices by SMEs. We consider that IFRS for SMEs may still be considered too complex for micro-entities. We encourage a classification of the entities in small and medium-sized entities and micro-entities and we condition the accounting regulation for these categories of entities, by a public debate.","[Neag, Ramona] Univ Petru Maior, Targu Mures, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures",,ramonaneag@yahoo.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",2223-5779,,978-960-474-184-7,WOR MULTIC APP ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,1,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300068000005,0

This paper shows a combined effort between academics and business environment with a view to increasing the competitiveness and productivity of a well-known local firm on the basis of a proved reputation technology, as it was acknowledged not only in the origin country, but in many other contexts as well. Therefore, the KANBAN system proved to be the appropriate solution for the firms' survival and the development in the present turbulent economic environment. In the perfect logics of the Japanese management techniques, the present authors' proposal is a software system (that is, its professional version) which realizes the application of the algorithm that synchronizes the final assembly line of an industrial firm, in order to allow the small-batch production. There are presented the principles of the Toyota system, the way of functioning of the KANBAN technique as a useful tool of the Just in Time system.

Emphasis is placed on the comparative advantages of separate aggregations in terms of their use on the internal EU market (intrastate only), and on the world market (extrastat only). The analysis is based on the assessment of comparative advantages by means of the modified Ballas index. This is performed on two levels, for the internal EU market, and also for the world market, after which the results of the analysis are displayed graphically. The authors then implement an idea originating from the BCG matrix on the results of this graphical display. Considering mainly those from (SITC, rev. 3) aggregations, the goal is to show which are or have the potential to become the pillar of agrarian trade (i.e. cash cows and stars), and to show on the other hand those aggregations, which are not perspective in the long run or problematic (the dogs and question marks). Stars are considered those from the aggregation, which are characterised by the highest rate of growth and comparative advantage. The analysis is conducted on two levels, in order to view the differences in commodity structure of the agrarian trade in the case of the old (EU15), as well as in the case of the new member states EU12 (member states, which accessed the EU in 2004 and 2007). Changes are also visible from the results of the analysis if we compare the commodity structure of the trade in the EU15 and EU12 countries.

The crisis has highlighted an urgent need for improved banks' risk management procedures. Internal audit is asked to provide to the bank's supervisory board members the assurance that risk management processes are working effectively and that significant risks are being managed to an acceptable level. The present paper objective is to emphasize how internal audit can respond to this requirement in the new context of the dynamic regulatory environment and the special context generated by the economic and financial crisis still characterizing the Romanian society.

Here, the value of a work of art can be simplified down to two essential elements the work's economic value, and its cultural value, measured in terms of criteria of artistic worth such as aesthetic, spiritual, symbolic, and other types of value. In regard to the weights on economic and cultural value in the objective function, the model will allow for a range of financial and artistic motivations as stimuli to creative work. At one extreme, a unitary weight attached to cultural value and a zero weight to economic value would indicate that the artist's aims relate purely to the quality of the artwork itself, with complete disregard for its financial prospects. At the other extreme, a unitary weight on economic value and a zero weight on cultural value would imply that the artist is in the game solely for the money.

We argue that an inability to make credible commitments, due largely to a lack of trust between public and private sectors, contributes to this dynamic. Empirical policy analysis can facilitate resolution only within a consultative process involving a broad range of stakeholders. The policies emerging from such a process are not likely to approximate first best recommendations. Yet the precise policies may be less important than the fact that they exist and that main stakeholders find them credible. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The study also investigates the variation in the stock price judgments of these two groups as a result of a differential reliance on the affective reaction. It contributes to the literature by providing a further understanding of the differential interpretation and reaction to financial data by investors with varying levels of knowledge and experience. In the experiment, participants were asked to review background financial information about a company, evaluate the company's earnings announcement and make stock price judgments. Results indicate that unsophisticated investors interpret a positive earnings announcement as more favorable than do sophisticated investors. The affective reaction to the earnings announcement was more influential on the stock price judgments of unsophisticated investors when compared to the stock price judgments made by sophisticated investors. This differential effect leads unsophisticated investors to make stock price judgments that exceed stock price judgments made by sophisticated investors. From a back to basics standpoint, these results suggest that investment-related knowledge and experience play a significant role in how individual investors react to and rely on basic financial information, which may be of interest to standard setters and regulators.","Univ Denver, Daniels Coll Business, Sch Accountancy, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Victoravich, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Daniels Coll Business, Sch Accountancy, 2101 S Univ Blvd, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",lvictora@du.edu,,,,,,,42,16,22,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Our findings also reveal that flights are not merely country-specific events but occur simultaneously across countries.

Earlier literature has shown significant diversification discounts: firms that engage in multiple activities are valued lower. Various factors are important in determining the size of the discount, for example cross-subsidization and agency problems. The existing literature, however, generally focuses on non-financial firms or on banks combining investment and commercial banking. Our paper focuses specifically on the valuation of bank-insurance conglomerates. We find no universal diversification discount but significant variability. The discount is explained by the size (increasing), the familiarity with the conglomerate business model (decreasing) and the risk profile (decreasing). Our results are robust to the historical origin, the merger record and the age of the conglomerate, as well as peer group specification and outlier elimination. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

From a financial viewpoint, they represent idiosyncratic risks, diversifiable at the world level. But for various reasons, reinsurance markets are unable to cope with this risk completely. Insurance-linked securities, such as catastrophe (cat) bonds, have been issued to complete the international risk transfer process, but their development is disappointing so far. This article argues that downside risk aversion and ambiguity aversion explain their limited success. Hybrid cat bonds, combining the transfer of cat risk with protection against a stock market crash, are proposed to complete the market. The article shows that replacing simple cat bonds with hybrid cat bonds would lead to an increase in market volume.","[Barrieu, Pauline] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Louberge, Henri] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Geneva,"Barrieu, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",p.m.barrieu@lse.ac.uk; Henri.Louberge@unige.ch,,,ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,25,21,24,1,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We model dependence with one Gaussian and one canonical vine copula regime. Canonical vines are constructed from bivariate conditional copulas and provide a very flexible way of characterizing dependence in multivariate settings. We apply the model to returns from the G5 and Latin American regions, and document three main findings. First, we discover that models with canonical vines generally dominate alternative dependence structures. Second, the choice of copula is important for risk management, since it modifies the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of international portfolios and produces a better out-of-sample performance. Third, ignoring asymmetric dependence and regime-switching in portfolio selection leads to significant costs for an investor.","[Heinen, Andreas] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Valdesogo, Alfonso] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Heinen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, 126 Calle Madrid, Madrid 28903, Spain.",aheinen@est-econ.uc3m.es,,"Valdesogo, Alfonso/0000-0002-9108-8444; Heinen, Andreas/0000-0002-3717-7892",,,,,38,166,194,0,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

We compare the first best outcome obtained when farmers cooperate with that for non-cooperative farmers. By accounting for grassland dynamics, we challenge conventional results from the common pool literature. Although we do identify situations where the standard result holds-a tragedy of the commons unless farmers cooperate-we also find examples where a tragedy is exacerbated due to ecosystem dynamics as well as cases where a non-cooperative regime under-exploits the grassland compared to the first best outcome.","[Crepin, Anne-Sophie; Lindahl, Therese] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics,"Lindahl, T (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",therese@beijer.kva.se,,"Crepin, Anne-Sophie/0000-0002-7370-2973; Lindahl, Therese/0000-0003-4089-1509",,,,,37,34,36,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Departing from the seminal paper by Farrell and Shapiro [2008], we consider innovations of any size and not only 'small' innovations, and we allow the number of licensees to be less than the number of firms in the downstream industry. It is shown that the optimal two-part tariff license from the patent holder's perspective may either deter or trigger litigation, and conditions under which each case arises are provided. We also reexamine the claim that the licensing revenues from 'weak' patents overcompensate the patent holder relative to what a natural benchmark would command.

Fiscal centralization reduces the extent of electoral discipline. as a corrupt (rent-seeking) incumbent can target good behavior only at a minimum winning coalition of regions (selective rent-diversion) in order to retain office, but thus makes it more profitable for bad incumbents to pool with good ones, thus increasing the probability of electoral discipline occurring at all.

We find that the correlation and covariance are higher when there is a negative shock to labor income and a positive shock to returns. The combined effect is that the correlation and covariance are countercyclical and so is the equity premium. We test asset pricing models with time-varying consumption risk and find that the conditional price of risk is generally positive. These results survive several robustness checks.

Controlling for the effect of default risk, call risk has a negative effect on duration, which diminishes as bond ratings decline.

They did, however, significantly reduce the quarterly variability in market share changes. We find that Regulation FD and the Global Research Analyst Settlement reduce the importance of an all-star analyst, issuer affiliation, and analyst optimism for gaining brokerage market share.

The authors review the literature on the impact of land administration interventions in specific contexts, highlighting the dependence of outcomes on the governance environment, the effectiveness of the state apparatus, and the distribution of socio-economic power. There is evidence, albeit not uniform, of enhancement of tenure security through land registration with benefits manifesting themselves in higher levels of investment and productivity and a reduced need to defend land rights. Land registration has also been shown to increase activity in land rental markets, leading to higher efficiency overall. Evidence of improved access to credit, due to formalization of land rights, is scant. Even in situations where land registration had positive benefits, the literature contains little rigorous analysis of cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability of impacts. The authors conclude that formalization of land rights should not be viewed as a panacea and that interventions should be decided only after a careful diagnosis of the policy, social, and governance environment. If intervention is justified, the performance of land administration systems needs to be benchmarked in terms of coverage, cost-effectiveness, and quality of service provision.","[Deininger, Klaus] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Feder, Gershon] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Deininger, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",kdeininger@worldbank.org,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012","Deininger, Klaus/0000-0003-3198-0083",,,,,131,182,204,6,103,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Economists have paid relatively little attention to such markets. We consider evidence from the activity of hill-walking. The Munros are a list of Scottish hills over 3000 feet in height. We analyse completions of both the Munros themselves, and the Munro Tops, a difficult and time-consuming extension of the Munros. The classic Bass diffusion model incorporates the imitation of others as a part of the behavioural rules used by consumers in making choice. We extend the Bass model to be able to apply it to long-term case studies where substantial changes over time in the population making choices at any given point have to be taken into account. The Munros are a particular illustration of this, but the extension can be used in other situations where such population changes are important. Our results show that Top completions are dominated by the 'fashion' component, suggesting there was a cohort among which Tops completions became fashionable, but which has not been sustained. Both our extended model and the standard model can account for this. In contrast, our extension is needed to explain why Munro completions have remained close to their peak level for a decade now, a fact for which the standard Bass model is unable to account.","[Bentley, Alex] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Ormerod, Paul] Volterra Consulting Ltd, London, England; [Ormerod, Paul] Univ Durham, Inst Adv Study, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University; Durham University,"Bentley, A (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",,,"Bentley, R.

By examining the network structures of six successful LCCs, the paper moves away from the idea of a low cost carrier model and instead highlights the range of spatial strategies employed by budget airlines in liberalized marketplaces. Findings show that significantly different spatial models are employed by the six carriers examined in this study. Unlike previous studies on the networks structures of LCCs, this paper moves beyond any one specific region and looks at the networks of budget airlines in Asia, Europe, and North America. Fundamental differences in the network structures of LCCs on these three continents indicate that liberalization has allowed for the utilization of a variety of spatial operating models rather than a singular optimal model.

This paper investigates why this is the case. Using household data from the World Bank and information on rainfall for the various rural districts of Nepal, we find that occupational choice is highly correlated to the uncertainty associated with historical rainfall patterns. Where the head is employed in agriculture, other family members are less likely to choose agriculture as an occupation in districts where rain is more uncertain. Estimates indicate that for a 1 percent increase in the coefficient of variation of rain, there is a 0.61 per cent decrease in the probability of choosing the same occupation as the household head, where the head is classified as self-employed in agriculture. The negative affect of rainfall uncertainty on occupational choice is less evident in households that have access to credit, and in households with relatively high levels of human capital.","Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA",Brandeis University,"Menon, N (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Dept Econ, MS 021, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",nmenon@brandeis.edu,,"Menon, Nidhiya/0000-0002-3871-1081",,,,,26,12,18,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

S. external debt, first in a portfolio balance model, and then empirically. Perhaps surprisingly, financial deepening and falling home bias in industrialized countries explain a large share of external financing. The savings glut hypothesis (including difficult-to-track petrodollar recycling) and U.S. financial innovation also play a role, in part as a cause of declining home bias in industrialized countries. The latter underscores the importance of not looking at these factors in isolation, but rather as a constellation of forces that can be self-reinforcing.

This paper provides a model that explains the success of certain trading rules that are based on patterns in past prices. We point to the importance of confirmation bias, which has been shown to play a key role in other types of decision making. Traders who acquire information and trade on the basis of that information tend to bias their interpretation of subsequent information in the direction of their original view. This produces autocorrelations and patterns of price movement that can predict future prices, such as the head-and-shoulders and double-top patterns. The model also predicts that sequential price jumps for a particular stock will be positively autocorrelated. We test this prediction and find that jumps exhibit statistically and economically significant positive autocorrelations. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, in this paper, we develop a structural model of innovation that incorporates information on innovation success from firm surveys along with the usual R&D expenditures and productivity measures. We then apply the model to data on Italian SMEs from the Survey on Manufacturing Firms conducted by Mediocredito-Capitalia covering the period 1995-2003. The model is estimated in steps, following the logic of firms' decisions and outcomes. We find that international competition fosters R&D intensity, especially for high-tech firms. Firm size and R&D intensity, along with investment in equipment, enhances the likelihood of having both process and product innovation. Both these kinds of innovation have a positive impact on firm's productivity, especially process innovation.

Texas administrative data show that the overall growth in the achievement gap between third and eighth grades is larger for students with higher initial achievement and that specific teacher and peer characteristics explain a substantial share of the widening. The adverse effect of attending school with a high black enrollment share appears to be an important contributor to the larger growth in the achievement differential in the upper part of the test score distribution. This evidence reaffirms the major role played by peers and school quality, but also presents a policy dilemma. Teacher labor market complications, current housing patterns, legal limits to desegregation efforts, and uncertainty about the overall effects of specific desegregation programs indicate that effective policy responses will almost certainly involve a set of school improvements beyond simple changes in peer racial composition and the teacher experience distribution.

Our first finding is that R&D is more important to high-growth SMEs in countries that are closer to the technological frontier. The second finding is that high-growth SMEs are only more innovative than non-high-growth SMEs in countries close to the technological frontier. This suggests that gazelles derive much of their drive from the exploitation of comparative advantages.

Such a shift in focus seemingly suggests that discrimination in intra-family allocation of resources has reduced substantially in India. In this context, an attempt has been made to decompose the observed lowness of the sex ratio in India vis-a-vis that of the stable population into that attributable to: (1) age structure difference, (2) excess female mortality, and (3) abnormalities in sex ratios at birth in India. Estimated contributions by each factor suggest that, as late as 2001, excess female mortality or the lowness of the relative survival advantage of women is the single most important determinant of missing women in India. The results also point to the importance of age structure difference, which accounts for a little more than 17% of the lowness of the sex ratio in India in 2001.","Madras Inst Dev Studies, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Jayaraj, D (通讯作者)，Madras Inst Dev Studies, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

In this Study, we examine the characteristics of surviving and non-surviving plants to determine if maquila losses are concentrated in low-, medium-, or high-quality segments. Based on a unique firm-level data set made up of 101 plants in five major industrial centers, we find that larger maquilas and plants producing auto parts enjoyed lower mortality rates. Controlling for these two factors, we find no statistically significant relationship between the use of technology-intensive production systems, just-in-time inventory practices, total quality management, attractive human resource management practices, and maquila survival. Contrary to much of the literature that appeared from 2000 to 2005 and statements made by Mexican policy makers, our results suggest that China's export surge has contributed to relatively high rates of maquila mortality in low-, medium-, and high-quality maquila segments. We conclude with policy recommendations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents empirical evidence on the effects of research and development (R&D) on new product development, interfirm alliances and employment growth during the early life course of firms. We use a dataset that contains a sample of new firms that is representative of the whole population of start-ups. This dataset covers the first 6 years of the life course of firms. It is revealed that R&D plays several roles during the early life course of high-tech as well as high-growth firms. The effect of initial R&D on high-tech firm growth is through increasing levels of interfirm alliances in the first post-entry years. R&D efforts enable the exploitation of external knowledge. Initial R&D also stimulates new product development later on in the life course of high-tech firms, but this does not seem to affect firm growth. R&D does not affect the growth rate of new low-tech firms, which seem to be driven mainly by the growth ambitions of the founding entrepreneur. The results show that R&D matters for a limited but important set of new high-tech and high-growth firms, which are key in innovation and entrepreneurship policies.","[Stam, Erik] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stam, Erik] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Technol Management, Cambridge, England; [Stam, Erik] Sci Council Govt Policy WRR, The Hague, Netherlands; [Wennberg, Karl] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Innovat & Entrepreneurship Grp, London, England",Utrecht University; University of Cambridge; Imperial College London,"Stam, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.stam@uu.nl; k.wennberg@imperial.ac.uk,"Stam, Erik/E-6605-2017","Stam, Erik/0000-0001-9827-0516; Wennberg, Karl/0000-0001-7279-1006",,,,,64,238,264,10,109,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We test herd behavior in a transparent and order-driven market using intraday data. We propose (1) a modification in the herding measure, (2) that investors tend to herd more based on fundamental analysis relative to technical analysis, and (3) that informational asymmetry can be identified by applying the informational cascade model to herding. In general, our analyses agree with the existing literature that herding tends to be more prevalent with small stocks and in economic downturns and that investors are more likely to herd when selling rather than buying stocks. Most importantly, our results reveal the existence of informational cascades, which highlights the crucial role played by so-called fashion leaders, especially when more informed investors trade with noise.

By using iterated cumulated sum of squares algorithm, symmetric and asymmetric autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models with structural breaks are estimated. The results suggest that the volatility of exports, imports, total credit volume and stock price index is affected by de jure exchange rate regimes; whereas the volatility of foreign exchange reserves, nominal exchange rate, real exchange rate, exports and total Tukish Lira deposits is influenced by de facto exchange rate regimes.

This is because smart-money traders initially profit more by front-running optimistic investor sentiment than by disciplining prices. When short selling is not possible, competitive pressures among arbitrageurs rapidly drive prices to the equilibrium. However, the risk of margin calls slows the convergence process, because arbitrageurs who sell short too early face substantial losses if they are unable to synchronize their trades with other arbitrageurs (as in Abreu and Brunnermeier. 2002.

If firms are more likely to acquire when there is more free cash or lower required rates of return, the targets become more sensitive to shocks to cash flows or the price of risk. Ceteris paribus, firms exposed to takeovers have different rates of return than protected firms. Using takeover likelihood estimates, we create a takeover factor, buying (selling) firms with a high (low) takeover likelihood, which generates abnormal returns.

It begins with a summary of Guthman's study of organic agriculture in California and her conclusion that it has come to resemble conventional, industrial agriculture in its agrarian structures and its supply chains. The article raises questions about both the evidence that smaller alternative producers have been squeezed out, and the assumptions underlying the analysis of relations between capitalist and non-capitalist forms. The issues are contextualized through a summary of earlier debates about the fate of non-capitalist producers in the 'development' process, and through reference to studies in economic anthropology, including research on household farming strategies in Italy. The article concludes that alternative food chains do not follow a simple linear trajectory, and that we need to include an ethnographic approach to understand both their economic values and political objectives.","Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Sch Social Sci & Cultural Studies, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Brighton,"Pratt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Anthropol, Sch Social Sci & Cultural Studies, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",J.C.Pratt@sussex.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F033567/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F033567/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,19,22,25,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

These factors belong to the sphere of social resources rather than to those of natural, physical, human or financial assets.

The influence of inequity aversion on the optimal income tax scheme depends on whether taxpayers are concerned about inequality in wages or in rents (i.e., wages minus effort costs). If agents compare wages, then a more productive agent who is averse to inequity produces more output than the first-best level of output, while a less productive agent produces less than the second-best level of the output in a standard adverse-selection model. Therefore, the trade-off between efficiency and equity becomes more serious than the trade-off in a reference case without inequity aversion. Conversely, when agents' disutility from inequity arises from inequality in rents, the trade-off between efficiency and equity may become either more serious or milder than in the reference case.","Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Pusan 609735, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Choi, K (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",choipnu@pusan.ac.kr,"Choi, Kangsik/I-5231-2013",,,,,,48,2,2,0,5,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2009,65.0,1,,,,,1,20,,10.1628/001522109X444152,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,457BA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266898600001,0

A prominent idea is to combine LTCI and annuities to alleviate both supply (selection) and demand (liquidity) problems in these markets. This article shows that if consumers typically liquidate home equity only in the event of illness or very old age, then LTCI and annuities become less attractive and may become substitutes rather than complements. The reason is that the marginal utility of wealth drops when an otherwise illiquid home is sold, an event correlated with the payouts of both annuities and LTCI. Simulations confirm that demand for LTCI and annuities is highly sensitive to the liquidity and magnitude of home equity.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Davidoff, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",davidoff@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,26,49,51,1,32,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

It finds that economic fundamentals, financial and political institutional variables provide relevant guidance for de jure regime choices. However, shocks are found to be the determinants of a de facto regime choice. The analysis shows that only a highly financially liberalized economy can sustain a corner regime. A partial financial liberalization increases the probability of divergence from the de jure regime in the face of various shocks, but an increase in the level of financial reforms decreases the probability of divergence. Moreover, regime choices are influenced by the IMF and regional financial architecture. The political institutions play an important role in the choice of a regime; however, their role varies with the level of financial development. J.Japanese Int. Economies 23 (1) (2009) 56-70.

Using Current Population Survey data and a difference-in-differences estimation technique, we find strong evidence of worse labor market outcomes among recent Latin American immigrants in the post-9/11 period relative to natives and prior Latin American immigrants. The results indicate a decline in employment, hours worked, and earnings among recent male Latin American immigrants relative to similarly low-skilled black and Hispanic natives and vis-a-vis Latin American immigrants who have been in the U.S. longer. Our findings arc, consistent with firms increasingly substituting legal workers for undocumented labor in the years following 9/11.

Theory suggests, however, that unfettered competition is not necessarily best given the special features of financial services. The author discusses these analytical complications before reviewing how to assess competition in the financial sector and its determinants. It is shown that competitiveness varies greatly across countries, in perhaps surprising ways, and that it is not driven by financial system concentration. Rather, systems with greater foreign entry and fewer entry and activity restrictions tend to be more competitive, confirming that contestability-025EFthe lack of barriers to entry and exit-025EFdetermines effective competition. The author then analyzes how competition policy in the financial sector has generally been conducted and how changes in competition in the financial services industries should affect competition policy going forward. In part based on comparison with other industries, the author provides some suggestions on how competition policy in the financial sector could be better approached as well as what institutional arrangements best fit a modern view of competition policy in the sector. The specific competition challenges for developing countries is also highlighted. The author concludes that practices today fall far short of the need for better competition policy in the financial sector.","[Claessens, Stijn] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,,SClaessens@imf.org,,,,,,,77,66,77,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Despite the fact that women business owners comprise a significant portion of the economy, women face challenges in acquiring the resources needed to expand their businesses. This article details both the myths and realities associated with women's entrepreneurship in their quest for growth. In particular, we examine the strategies that women entrepreneurs use to position their firms for growth, especially those strategies related to growth capital. Our results show that women seeking venture capital (VC) have degrees, graduate degrees, and experience that should not preclude them from obtaining financing. We also found that even though women-led businesses are frequently clustered in industries less attractive to financiers, women seeking equity funding are in the appropriate industries. Further, women spend a considerable amount of time using both formal and informal networks in their search for capital and in seeking capital. Because of the importance of the VC industry as a provider of growth capital and its reliance on its network for investment referrals, we also examined the participation and role of women as decision-makers in industry. Women's participation in the VC industry has not kept pace with industry growth, and women have exited the industry at a faster rate than men, thus creating a significant barrier for women entrepreneurs in that it is less likely that their networks will overlap with the financial supplier networks, despite any effort they may expend networking and seeking capital.","[Gatewood, Elizabeth J.] Wake Forest Univ, Calloway Sch Business & Accountancy, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Brush, Candida G.; Greene, Patricia G.] Babson Coll, Wellesley, MA 02482 USA; [Carter, Nancy M.] Catalyst Inc, San Jose, CA 95134 USA; [Carter, Nancy M.] Univ St Thomas, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Hart, Myra M.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Business Sch, Soldier Field, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Wake Forest University; Babson College; University of St Thomas Minnesota; Harvard University,"Gatewood, EJ (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Calloway Sch Business & Accountancy, POB 7229, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",gatewoej@wfu.edu,,,,,,,22,87,104,1,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

J,"Collins, R; Baker, GA",,,,"Collins, Robert; Baker, Gregory A.",,,Of Junk Food and Junk Science,INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,obesity; junk food; Granger-causality,,"The popular press has triumphantly announced that the cause of the obesity epidemic is junk food. After a moment's reflection, however, it seems likely that the true causal structure of the obesity epidemic can be neither single-equation nor univariate. Therefore, while the hypothesis that junk food is the cause of obesity has little a priori plausibility, these articles in the popular press present a testable hypothesis that, in spite of some measurement impossibilities, is tested here. While one can always argue about p values etc., it is safe to say that the results show no evidence to indicate support for a causal link. The second section of the paper explains this result and suggests a rudimentary structural model of obesity that begins to address the issues of specification error, simultaneity, etc., that plague much of the obesity research. This model shows that because of the dynamic nature of weight status, there is no necessary reason to expect to find a statistical relation between a person's observed weight and the amount he or she is currently eating or exercising. Therefore, studies which regress weight, obesity, or the probability of obesity on eating and exercise patterns have serious specification error. Further development of structural econometric models of obesity may lead to consistent estimates of the partial effects of exogenous variables on obesity levels. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for policy development and industry.","[Baker, Gregory A.] Santa Clara Univ, Food & Agribusiness Inst, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Baker, GA (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Food & Agribusiness Inst, Leavey Sch Business, 500 Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",rcollins@scu.edu; gbaker@scu.edu,,,"Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University","Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University","Funding for this research was provided by a Leavey Grant from the Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.",,10,2,3,3,10,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

It also finds that the politically connected firms have lower probabilities in departure from loan contract, the incidence of illegal events, and obtaining severe auditing opinions, but the firms' government and bank backgrounds do not weaken the function of accounting information, and the probabilities in departure from loan contract, the incidence of illegal events, and obtaining severe auditing opinions are not being declined by government and bank backgrounds. In summary, the substitution effect stems from the reputation of enterprises which provides potential guarantee for the loan contract, but not from the political interference on the banks' loan decision-making.","[Pan Keqin] Henan Univ Finance & Econ, Accountancy Sch, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",,,pankq2005@126.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1341,1349,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000167,0

The nature of tourism product seems to be rather complex. The main reasons are the significant number of services provided and the large number of small businesses that comprise this product The importance of developing quality tourism products has been recognised both by the public and private tourism sectors. To this end, some initiatives aimed at quality improvement in tourism have been undertaken at different levels. Therefore, the aim of this paper is the analysis of current work in this area. A secondary research directed at the regulation and standardisation in tourism service quality has been undertaken to attain this goal. It includes the activities and recommendations of World Tourism Organisation from the international point of view. The level of the European Union is primarily represented by the European Commission with its directives and published research reports. The Ministry of Regional Development and the Czech tourist authority CzechTourism stand in the position at the Czech national level - they should act in cooperation with other authorities representing the tourism industry in regions. In this paper the Swiss quality programme in tourism which has been already accepted by other European countries, is presented as a practical example of an efficient quality system. In the national area of quality assurance and improvement there is still a need for things to be done such as the launch of an integrated quality certification programme that would be applicable for various companies in tourism. A quality label obtained through the certification can serve as an important marketing instrument for differentiation.","[Pulpanova, Lenka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,lenka.pulpanova@tul.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,327,335,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000037,0

The aim of this contribution is to highlight some aspects of the European budget having specific regard to the structural funds policies. The analysis starts with short remarks about the resources of the budget, having specific regard to the lack of direct connection between the system of own resources, and the position of the taxpayer and the following wrong perception about the nature of the EU funds. The subsidiarity principle and the shared management approach leave to the Commission very little influence, in the meantime increasing the risk that concerns about the maximum take-up of funding will take precedence over the implementation of a coherent strategy aiming at the efficient, effective and economic use of the expenditure. If the spending rate becomes the main index of implementation of programmes, only an effective capacity of control can guarantee the implementation of the EU policies.

Thus, entities active in the agricultural sector, had the opportunity to promote investment projects which could be financed from SAPARD funds (for the pre-accession period) or from funds of the National Program for Rural Development (NPRD for the post-accession period). To attract both funds, the beneficiaries must prove the existence of their own funds which has to be at least 50% of the value of eligible projects. Absorption of both European funds available to Romania was a key issue, both in pre-accession period and after 2007. Romania's experiences after 2005 proved that the absorption of EU funds can be provided only if the government subsidize the interest rate on loans provided by the commercial banks to ensure the co-financing of the eligible projects. Thus, the Romanian Government through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has made available to commercial banks significant amounts of money for them to give loans with subsidized interest for beneficiaries who did not have their own funds to co-finance the projects. These amounts have resulted in the Farmer Program that was started in 2006 and exists so far. Although the Farmer Program started in 2006 and contributed to the growth rate of absorption of SAPARD funds, the 2008 Farmer Program, created for absorption of post-accession funds, although created by the same architecture, has difficulties in implementation. In this paper I tried to capture the differences between the two national programs created for the absorption of European funds and the reasons underlying the inability of the 2008 Farmer Program to start.","[Sbarcea, Ioana Raluca] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,ioana.sbarcea@ulbsibiu.ro,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,4,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,586,591,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000089,0

This behavior was tested under different conditions, among them restrictions on asset holdings or different information conditions. Basic financial theory suggests that subjects buy and sell according to expectations regarding the future prices of assets. On the other hand, behavioral biases, such as the disposition effect, suggest that subjects are affected by past performance of assets. In a series of experiments, subjects were asked to allocate a given endowment among six assets. All the assets had the same normal distribution with positive mean. The results show no disposition effect in the simple case with no restrictions. A reverse disposition effect was found in case 2, where subjects were required to hold only three assets and change one asset on each round. However, when subjects received information on the market return each period, they showed disposition effect when gain and losses are measured relatively to the market. We explain these results by the disappointment effect and momentum trading behavior. The main contribution of the current research is to demonstrate that the disposition effect or momentum behavior can be a product of trading conditions.","[Shavit, Tal] Coll Management, Sch Business Adm, IL-75190 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Shafran, Sharon; Benzion, Uri] Open Univ, Dept Management & Econ, Raanana, Israel",Open University Israel,"Shavit, T (通讯作者)，Coll Management, Sch Business Adm, 7 Izhak Rabin Blvd, IL-75190 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",shavittal@gmail.com,"Shavit, Tal/GLU-8700-2022","Shavit, Tal/0000-0003-2966-302X",,,,,33,9,12,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Industrialization and the modernization stimulated by it in the second half of the twentieth century have changed the village image, from the dominating profession and professional structure of its inhabitants to the new qualities of social interaction. Slavonia and Baranja, as the traditionally most rural regions in the Republic of Croatia, are experiencing changes not just through the marginalization of the meaning of agriculture for the social development altogether, but also through the changes in the rural areas. This can be monitored through changes of the educational and professional structure of village inhabitants, through their comprehension of the quality of life in the village and in the city, as well as through their perception of facilities characteristic for villages and facilities characteristic for cities. The conducted research in twenty villages in Slavonia and Baranja and in the city of Osijek partly confirm these changes, but also deny the hypothesis that the future of this region is without agriculture, at least in the opinion of the examinees.

'Livelihood' programs were intended to help tsunami-affected households quickly resume productive activities and return to 'normal' life. They formed an important component of the tsunami recovery portfolios of the Indonesian government and many international donors, distributing millions of dollars worth of equipment, cash and other forms of support to tsunami victims. This article queries the effectiveness and impact of some of these programs in Acehnese villages, particularly during the early phases of recovery. It is unlikely that an international response on the scale witnessed in Aceh over the last four years will occur again with future disasters. Nonetheless, the 'livelihoods' approach is probably here to stay, and many important lessons can be drawn from the Aceh experience.","Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Thorburn, C (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,18,29,34,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

First, it develops a theoretical model of international joint ventures to suggest a new approach to the determination of profit allocation between the partners in the joint venture. Second, we examine the issue of tax competition between two countries for an international joint venture. We find that even in the absence of any bargaining power for the domestic firms, the foreign firm would like to give up more than half of profits to its partner. Furthermore, the foreign firm would like to locate in a country in which the partner firm is more efficient. We also find. with numerical simulations, that the domestic firm will accept the joint venture if the foreign firm's technology is significantly more superior than its own.

The distinction between federal and state-local fiscal indicators yields useful insights and helps define a new set of stylized facts for U.S. macroeconomic conditions. First, we find that variations in state-local indirect taxes as well as state government surplus or deficit help predict output growth. Next, the federal counterparts of these indicators contain valuable information for inflation. Finally, state-local expenditures help predict U.S. inflation. A set of formal and informal stability tests confirm that these relationships are stable.

This process of creation and destruction of product varieties has important implications for competition in goods markets and consumer welfare. According to Bernard et al. (2009), product creation typically accounts for a large share of national output. Since it also crucially affects the dynamics of inflation through its effect on competition, taking this process into account may challenge traditional views on monetary policy design and transmission. In this paper, we find that changes in the range of products available to consumers matter for our understanding of business cycles and the conduct of monetary policy in open economies. Our evaluation of the welfare implications of alternative monetary policy rules shows the importance of product varieties in the design of monetary policy. Much theoretical literature has found that price stability should be the key objective of monetary policy. Considering product creation in an open economy changes this policy recommendation, since welfare is higher when central banks respond moderately to output fluctuations in addition to responding to inflation.","[Auray, Stephane] Univ Lille Nord France ULCO, CREST Ensai, Lille, France; [Eyquem, Aurelien] Univ Lyon, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, Lyon, France",Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI); Universite du Littoral-Cote-d'Opale; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Auray, S (通讯作者)，ENSAI, Campus Ker Lann,Rue Blaise Pascal,BP 37203, F-35172 Bruz, France.",stephane.auray@ensai.fr,,,,,,,28,8,8,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

J,"Popp, D",,,,"Popp, David",,,"International Technology Transfer, Climate Change, and the Clean Development Mechanism",REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; CDM; PRODUCTIVITY,"As the developed world begins efforts to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases, economic growth in developing countries is causing increased emissions from the developing world. Reducing these emissions while still enabling developing countries to grow requires the use of climate-friendly technologies in these countries. In most cases, these technologies are first created in high-income countries. Thus, the challenge for climate policy is to encourage the transfer of these climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. This article reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer and discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy, focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A key point is that technology diffusion is gradual. Early adoption of policy by developed countries leads to the development of new technologies that make it easier for developing countries to reduce pollution as well. Since clean technologies are first developed in the world's leading economies, international trade and foreign investments provide access to these technologies. Moreover, evidence suggests that some technologies, such as those enhancing energy efficiency, will diffuse to developing countries even without the aid of policy prescriptions, such as the CDM. This is important for assessing the potential emissions reductions of proposed CDM projects.","[Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, Dept Publ Adm, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Popp, D (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, Dept Publ Adm, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",dcpopp@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,56,111,117,2,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

I find that both the surprise component of policy actions and official communication have statistically significant and economically relevant effects on equity indices, with statements having a much greater explanatory power of the reaction of stock prices to monetary policy. For instance, around 90% of the explainable variation in S&P 500 is due to the surprise component of Fed's statements. This paper also shows that equity indices tend to incorporate FOMC monetary surprises within 40 min from the announcement release. Finally, I find that these results are robust along several dimensions. In particular, I consider different estimators, such as the Generalized Empirical Likelihood, and I extend the sample to include the recent period of heightened financial stress. This sensitivity analysis corroborates that central bank communication about its future policy intentions is a key driver of stock returns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is conducted using individual company data, as well as original data on the degree of utilisation of production factors. The sample includes 6,998 observations over the period 1996-2008. This database is, to our knowledge, unique for the empirical analysis of the intensity of capital utilisation on firms' capital retirement behaviour. We adjust for endogeneity biases by means of instrumental variables. The main results obtained from the estimation of capital retirement models may be summarised as follows: i) The retirement rate decreases with the variations in cyclical pressures measured by the changes in output and the workweek of capital; this relation corresponds to a countercyclical decelerator effect on capital retirement; ii) The capital retirement rate increases with the structural intensity of capital utilisation; this effect, which corresponds to a wear and tear one, is nevertheless small compared to the decelerator one; iii) The profit rate does not have a significant impact on the retirement rate. Compared with the existing literature, here mainly Mairesse and Dormont [1985], the contribution of these results is to show, through the use of unique survey data, that the effect of the intensity of capital utilisation on capital retirement is structurally positive, via a wear and tear effect, and cyclically negative, via a decelerator effect which completes that already taken into account via the effect of changes in value added.",,,,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

A sample of 46 North American studies issued from 1971 to 2008 yields 129 distinct estimates that survive outlier diagnostics. The estimation results are highly robust and significant across estimators and specifications. They suggest that all classes of waste sites affect real estate prices, but sites classified as hazardous, especially aquatic hazardous sites, are associated with the greatest discounts. The estimated impacts of nonhazardous waste and nuclear sites are not statistically different from one another. Surprisingly, estimated impacts associated with sites included on the EPA's National Priority List (NPL) are generally smaller (although still statistically significant) than those for non-NPL hazardous waste sites. The estimates for sites in Canada and Mountain, Middle Atlantic, and South Atlantic states exceed those for other regions.

Our findings suggest that academic involvement in patenting results in a citation premium, as academic patents appear to generate more forward citations. We also find that in the European context of changing research objectives and funding sources since the mid-1990s, the importance of academic patents declines over time. We show that academic entrants have patents of lower quality than academic incumbents but they did not cause the decline, since the relative importance of patents involving academics with an existing patenting history declined over time as well. Moreover, a preliminary evaluation of the effects of the abolishment of the professor privilege (the German counterpart of the US Bayh-Dole Act) reveals that this legal disposition led to an acceleration of this apparent decline.","[Czarnitzki, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, Louvain, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk; Hussinger, Katrin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Louvain, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk; Hussinger, Katrin] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Hussinger, Katrin] Univ Maastricht, Dept Org & Strategy, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Schneider, Cedric] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Maastricht University; Copenhagen Business School,"Czarnitzki, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, Louvain, Belgium.",dirk.czarnitzki@econ.kuleuven.be; k.hussinger@maastrichtuniversity.nl; csc.eco@cbs.dk,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021","Schneider, Cedric/0000-0002-4403-104X",,,,,86,58,67,2,72,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We show that investors first invest in domestic securities and only some time later they invest abroad in foreign securities. We also show that investors who trade more often in the domestic market start to invest abroad earlier. Our findings suggest that the experience investors acquire while they trade in the domestic market is a key reason why active investors enter the foreign market earlier. A reason is that highly educated investors as well as investors with more financial knowledge, arguably those for whom learning by trading is the least important, do not need to trade as much in the domestic market before they start investing in foreign securities. Another reason is that investors who start investing in foreign securities are able to improve on their performance afterwards. This improvement in performance constitutes further evidence that the home country bias is costly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However some studies have shown that credit losses are seldom normal and the linear correlation does not give accurate assessment for asymmetric data. Therefore it is possible that many credit models tend to misestimate the probability of joint extreme defaults. This paper employs Copula Theory to model the dependence across default rates in a credit card portfolio of a large UK bank and to estimate the likelihood of joint high default rates. Ten copula families are used as candidates to represent the dependence structure. The empirical analysis shows that, when compared to traditional models. estimations based on asymmetric copulas usually yield results closer to the ratio of simultaneous extreme losses observed in the credit card portfolio. Copulas have been applied to evaluate the dependence among corporate debts but this research is the first paper to give evidence of the outperformance of copula estimations in portfolios of consumer loans. Moreover we test some families of copulas that are not typically considered in credit risk studies and find out that three of them are suitable for representing dependence across credit card defaults.

This literature provides solid support for the Mirrlees Review's dramatic proposals to eliminate any personal taxes on the normal rate of return to savings and to eliminate any net tax on new business investment. There is also solid support for the full taxation of any excess returns on financial investments, including income from capital gains. The commentary does raise questions, though, about the specific methods proposed to achieve these reforms. The proposal advocates adoption of rate-of-return allowances for individual savings under the personal tax and for business investment under the corporate tax. A commonly proposed alternative is to redefine the personal tax base to equal annual consumption and to allow expensing of new investment under the corporate tax. With such reforms to the personal tax, there is no longer even a clear reason to retain a corporate tax. The commentary also emphasises the pressures arising from cross-border investments and cross-border migration of individuals, issues given little attention in the review. These questions regard details of implementation. The overall proposals receive strong support in the academic literature.","Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Gordon, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rogordon@ucsd.edu,,,ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,6,6,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

The analysis covers manufacturing and service firms active in France during the period 1987-1999. We show that the motivation to start producing abroad is an important determinant of its impact at home. Market-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) in manufacturing is associated with significant scale effects, resulting in job creation. By contrast, factor-seeking FDI in manufacturing has no significant effect on employment. However, there is some evidence that this type of FDI is associated with technology effects, in the form of greater capital-intensity and efficiency, as well as larger exports. Finally, FDI in service sectors is associated with significant positive employment effects, presumably reflecting the importance of the market-seeking motive in these sectors.","[Jean, Sebastien] INRA, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Hijzen, Alexander] OECD, Paris, France; Univ Nottingham, GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jean, Sebastien] AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ 210, Grignon, France; [Mayer, Thierry] CEPII, Sci Po, Paris, France; [Mayer, Thierry] CEPR, Paris, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Nottingham; AgroParisTech; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Jean, S (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR Econ Publ 210, 16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",sebastien.jean@grignon.inra.fr,,"Jean, Sebastien/0000-0003-1895-0955",,,,,46,57,59,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Assistance Program (SNAP until recently, the Food Stamp Program) caseload increased by half As the Great Recession unfolded, the SNAP caseload grew even more rapidly. Further, over the past two decades the composition of the caseload has shifted sharply away from families combining food and cash assistance and toward families receiving food assistance in the absence of any other major, means-tested income support. By analyzing components of the caseload separately, we provide new and more insightful estimates of the effects of food and cash assistance policies and the economy on both the change in the composition of the caseload and the large caseload swings over the 1990s and 2000s. We find that the economy can explain a portion of caseload changes, but not compositional shifts. Food and cash assistance policies help to explain both changes. In total, the combination of SNAP and welfare policy changes account for about half of the sharp increase since 1994 in the share of SNAP households receiving food, but not cash, assistance.

I exploit policy-induced variation in tax-based aid eligibility to estimate its causal effect on college enrollment. I find that tax-based aid increases full-time enrollment in the first two years of college for 18 to 19 years old by 7 percent. The price sensitivity of enrollment suggests that college enrollment increases 0.3 percentage points per $100 of tax-based aid.

In these environments, a high-tech foreign investor acquiring the state-owned assets may end up dominating the local market, thereby harming local consumer and producer interests. A foreign investor, however, is likely to be both willing and able to offer a higher bid for the assets than local investors. This paper addresses the trade-off for local governments between privatization revenues and foreign market power. The authors find that there may be an incentive to privatize strategically by selling the state-owned firm to a local (less advanced) investor at a lower price in order to achieve a more competitive post-privatization market structure.","[Bjorvatn, Kjetil] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Eckel, Carsten] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Munich,"Bjorvatn, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",kjetil.bjorvatn@nhh.no; Carsten.eckel@lmu.de,,"Eckel, Carsten/0000-0002-2799-2439",,,,,15,4,5,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We examine a necessary and sufficient condition for determinacy under interest rate policy that responds to a weighted average of an inflation forecast and current inflation. This condition demonstrates that the average-inflation targeting policy ensures determinacy as long as both the response to average inflation and the relative weight of current inflation are large enough. We also find that interest rate policy that responds solely to past inflation guarantees determinacy when its response satisfies the Taylor principle and is not large.

Inspired by Wang (J Environ Econ Manag 32:219-232, 1997) we hypothesize that respondents' stated certainty in choice increases with the utility difference between the alternative chosen and the best alternative to that. We test this hypothesis using data from two independent Choice Experiments both focusing on nature values. In modelling respondents' self-reported certainty in choice, we find evidence that the stated level of certainty increases significantly as utility difference in choice sets increases. In addition, stated certainty increases with income. Furthermore, there is some evidence that male respondents are inherently more certain in their choices than females, and a learning effect may increase stated certainty. We find evidence of this in the first study where the good is described in rather broad and generic terms, but not in the second study where a more specific description of the good is used.","[Olsen, Soren Boye] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Unit Environm & Nat Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Div Econ Policy & Management Planning Forest & La, Fac Life Sci, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Olsen, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Fac Life Sci, Unit Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",sobo@foi.dk,"Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343; Lundhede, Thomas/0000-0003-3226-8338; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228",,,,,49,34,37,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The study was one part of a larger study which explored the factors underlying the high level of road traffic casualties especially among children in the most disadvantaged areas of England and to explore how this impacts on mobility and quality of life. The methods involved a cross sectional survey comprising school based questionnaire surveys with children aged 9-14 and focus groups with parents who had children within this age range. The surveys were conducted in 2007 and the focus groups during 2008. 4286 children completed the survey and eight focus groups were held. Bike ownership (77%) was high, use in previous week moderate (39%) but only 2% cycled to school. Ownership was significantly lower in minority ethnic groups. Despite young children's strong preference to travel by cycle (30%) than walk or go by car, most parents felt it was too hazardous. It is unlikely that these findings would be any different from the rest of England, however the combination of environmental and social factors may elevate the risks for young cyclists in these areas. This paper concludes that a number of barriers exist to increasing levels of cycling among children living in disadvantaged areas particularly amongst ethnic groups. These barriers could be addressed by environmental modifications to reduce speeds and by reducing the levels of antisocial driving and riding in residential areas and around destinations where children travel, by providing cycle training to improve children's skills and parent's confidence, and by providing secure storage facilities for bikes. Until these barriers are addressed it is unlikely that cycling will increase despite the strong preferences children have to travel by bike. Such preferences to cycle provide an opportunity for local authorities to act on. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead of looking at the systemic nature of automobility, the article concentrates on its human component. Access to cars by young people in the greater Reykjavik area, and the shift in modal choice that occurs when they start driving, was investigated with a survey among high school students that yielded 553 answers. The results show that young residents in the capital area are fully aware of the costs of car-based automobility. Their near-universal move to cars when they enter driving age reflects the conditions of this regime. Yet they are also ambivalent about their position within the regime. While most previous studies of novice drivers have centred on road safety issues, this study shows the need to consider the cultural and social aspects of young people driving. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the modal shift that perpetuates car-based automobility, which is an important issue for transport planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is considered as a mode favoured to alleviate road congestion. Alas, promises have not been met and cargo transfers have not reached their objectives yet, despite strong financial will and a programme for modal shift implemented by the European Union (EU). The hypothesis raised by this paper is that Short Sea Shipping has not been well defined in the EU and market potential for modal shift from land to sea has been overestimated. Therefore, this has a great impact for policy-making. Studies have covered many topics such as its implementation using case studies, cost-benefit analysis compared to land-transport modes, general European shipping policy and its environmental contribution. Therefore, little has been written on the role of public institutions in its implementation and no critical assessment of the success of supporting public programme in the EU has been done. This paper explains how the lack of a final definition has led to misadapted public policies favouring modal transfer in the EU and how misknowledge of SSS markets has led to the overestimation of the modal shift potential.

It does so with reference to parents whose children attend a suburban school in Auckland, New Zealand, where walking and driving are the two main travel options. Four focus groups were conducted in order to understand parents' transport decisions. This approach revealed the significance of the following factors: perceived distance and time constraints; concerns about children's health and fitness, as well as their competence; road safety and congestion issues; and social norms. We conclude that the reasons leading parents to drive are manifold, and, as such, a variety of interventions is needed to promote walking. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Both the term structure of interest rates and returns on value and growth stocks convey information about how the representative investor values cash flows of different maturities. We model how the representative investor perceives risks of these cash flows by specifying a parsimonious stochastic discount factor for the economy. Shocks to dividend growth, the real interest rate, and expected inflation are priced, but shocks to the price of risk are not. Given reasonable assumptions for dividends and inflation, we show that the model can simultaneously account for the behavior of aggregate stock returns, an upward-sloping yield curve, the failure of the expectations hypothesis, and the poor performance of the capital asset pricing model.

We find that value-growth characteristics generally provide better explanations for long-term stock returns than past performance. The evidence also shows that winners identified by capital gains dominate past performance winners in predicting reversals in the cross-sectional comparison. However, in the time-series analysis, when returns on capital gain winners are adjusted by the Fama and French (1996) risk factors, the predictive power of capital gain winners disappears. Our results show that capital gain winners are heavily featured as growth stocks. Return reversals in capital gain winners potentially reflect market price corrections for growth stocks. We conclude that investors' incentives to delay paying capital gain taxes cannot fully rationalise long-term reversals in the UK market. Our results also imply that the long-term return pattern potentially reflects a mixture of investor rational and irrational behaviour. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional weighted average aggregates of the price distortions involved, such as producer and consumer support estimates (PSEs and CSEs), can be poor indicators of the trade restrictiveness and economic welfare losses associated with them, especially if a country's support estimates vary a lot across the product range. Certainly estimates of trade and welfare effects of price supports can be obtained from sectoral or economywide models using price elasticity estimates, but the results can be contentious if there is no consensus on what model specification and elasticity parameters to use. This paper shows that, if there is a willingness to accept simple assumptions about elasticities, it is possible to generate indicators of the welfare and trade restrictiveness of agricultural policies using no more than the price and quantity data needed to generate PSEs and CSEs. These new indexes thus provide an attractive supplement to the current policy monitoring regime developed by the OECD Secretariat.","[Anderson, Kym; Croser, Johanna] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au; johanna.croser@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,22,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

It is on the interface between economics and psychology. Economic theory has a well-defined theory of how people should tackle such problems, but experimental evidence suggests that these are not empirically valid, and particularly that people find dynamic decision problems complex and cognitively demanding. Psychologists have long been aware of such issues and have developed a suite of theories to explain behaviour in such contexts, but these have been largely developed in a static context. This paper attempts to build a bridge between the two disciplines by exploring decision processes in a dynamic problem for which economic theory provides clear predictions. To aid us in this quest we use an experimental design which enables us to infer the decision rules that people are using. We identify a number of distinct decision heuristics, which could usefully be embodied into economic models of dynamic decision making. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, for intermediate levels of public information precision, it is optimal for the central bank to actually disclose less than it knows. We show that such crowding out can occur, even in the likely scenario that public information is more precise than private information, under the plausible assumption that traders are nearly risk neutral.

For the most popular descriptive model for decision making under risk and uncertainty today, prospect theory, preference foundations have as yet been provided only for prospects taking finitely many values. In applications, however, prospects often are complex and involve infinitely many values, as in normal and lognormal distributions. This paper provides a preference foundation of prospect theory for such complex prospects. We allow for unbounded utility and only require finite additivity of the underlying probability distributions, leaving the restriction to countably additive distributions optional. As corollaries, we generalize previously obtained preference foundations for special cases of prospect theory (rank-dependent utility and Choquet expected utility) that all required countable additivity. We now obtain genuine generalizations of de Finetti's and Savage's finitely additive setups to unbounded utility.","[Kothiyal, Amit; Spinu, Vitalie; Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wakker, PP (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",wakker@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,43,21,28,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

In this environment, monetary policy plays an important signaling role. This paper highlights this signaling role by showing that conclusions from imperfect information monetary models are sensitive to the number of shocks included. With multiple shocks, contractionary monetary policy can initially increase inflation and delay the eventual disinflation. Moreover, multiple shocks can result in destabilizing price flexibility, while optimal policy's response to one shock will depend on the existence of other shocks, contrary to a typical linear-quadratic framework.

In many developing countries the requirements for public transport and non-motorised transport are not explicitly integrated into the planning process, despite the fact that these form the primary mode of transport for the majority of the population. This affects the mobility opportunities for these sectors of the population and contributes to poor road safety, especially with regards to pedestrians. The research outlined in the paper posits that, in order to assess the usage and needs of the road holistically, other factors related to the adjacent land uses, socio-economic characteristics of the population the road serves, and the environmental context within which the road is located, factors heavily in how the road is used and should, therefore, be considered within the planning process. The paper describes a methodology to include these factors in the planning of roads. The method attempts to prioritise amongst the five primary road based modes (public transport, car, freight, walking and cycling) based upon a combination of traffic and non-traffic factors. The method employed uses a geographic information system (GIS) based spatial multiple criteria evaluation (SMCE) model with inputs from widely available data sources such as census, household travel surveys, land use and environmental data to arrive at solutions for modal priorities. A case study is conducted along an arterial route in Cape Town, South Africa, providing infrastructure planning recommendations and audit possibilities for the future. Since weighting is an important driver in the SMCE process, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of alternative weighting schemes on the outputs from the method.

In the first-stage, basic inputs (e.g., labor and capital) are used to generate service potential (e.g., opening hours, materials), which is then, in the second-stage, transformed into observed outputs (e.g., school outcomes, library circulation, crimes solved). As final outputs are also affected by demand-side factors, conflating both production stages likely leads to biased inferences about public productive (in)efficiency and its determinants. Hence, this paper uses a specially tailored, fully non-parametric efficiency model allowing for both outlying observations and heterogeneity to analyse efficient public good provision in stage one only. We thereby employ a dataset comprising all 290 Flemish public libraries. Our findings suggest that ideological stance of the local government, wealth and density of the local population and source of library funding (i.e., local funding versus intergovernmental transfers) strongly affect library productive efficiency.

The RBA's interventions are detected in the late Sydney onshore period, early European market, and again in the early New York market hours. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the RBA chooses those hours of higher volume, lower volatility and lower bid/ask spreads to conduct its non-intervention transactions.

This paper examines the current funding of state and local pensions using a sample of 126 plans, estimating an aggregate funded ratio in 2009 of 78% using GASB accounting methods. Projections for 2010-2013 suggest that some continued deterioration is likely. Funded status can vary significantly among plans, and so the paper explores the influence of four types of factors: funding discipline, plan governance, plan characteristics, and the fiscal situation of the state. Judging the long-term health of plans requires more than just a snapshot of assets and liabilities, and so the paper examines how well plans are meeting their Annual Required Contributions and what factors influence whether they make them. The paper also addresses the controversy over what discount rate to use for valuing liabilities, concluding that using a riskless rate of return could help improve funding discipline but would need to be implemented in a manageable way. Finally, the paper assesses whether plans face a near-term liquidity crisis and finds that most have assets on hand to cover benefits over the next 15-20 years. The bottom line is that, like private investors, public plans have been hit hard by the financial crisis and their full recovery is dependent on the rebound of the economy and the stock market.","[Munnell, Alicia H.; Aubry, Jean-Pierre; Quinby, Laura] Boston Coll, Ctr Retirement Res, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Munnell, AH (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Ctr Retirement Res, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",laura.quinby@bc.edu,,,,,,,33,20,29,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We confirm a strong positive link between changes in CDS spreads and in option implied volatility and find that adjustments take place simultaneously.

We do so by introducing possible cross-border lobbying and by endogenizing tariff formation in a political economic model for the determination of CETs. The latter allows us to consider asymmetries among the member nations in their susceptibilities to lobbying. We also consider asymmetries in the influence of the member nations in CU-wide decision-making. A central finding of this paper is that, in the absence of economic asymmetry, the CET rises monotonically with the degree of asymmetry in country influences if the two countries are equally susceptible to lobbying. If influences are the same, the CET also rises monotonically with the degree of asymmetry in susceptibilities. These results hold irrespective of whether the lobby groups in the two member countries cooperate or work non-cooperatively.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lahiri, Sajal] So Illinois Univ Carbondale, Carbondale, IL USA; [Roy, Suryadipta] High Point Univ, High Point, NC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",subhayu.bandyopadhyay@stls.frb.org,"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543",,,,,25,1,1,0,9,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN, MA 02148-529 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Cross-site variation in treatment-control differences is used to identify the effects of employment levels and transitions. Under certain assumptions, this method controls for unobserved correlates of job loss and child well-being, as well as measurement error and simultaneity. IV estimates suggest that maternal job loss sharply increases problem behavior but has neutral effects on positive social behavior.

Tax evasion, however, severely limits the capacities of these reformed states, which reduces in a vicious circle the citizens' incentives to pay taxes. The question then arises how this vicious circle may be broken. Several authors suggest that political institutions may do the trick. Based on insights that institutions allowing a direct say on policy issues (especially tax questions) may increase tax morale, we propose to study comparatively how the link between trust and tax morale is affected by these institutions. We find that allowing for referendums strengthens the link between trust and tax morale, but that this effect depends on the nature of the institutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study uses empirical data on slot capacity deployed by container shipping lines for analysing ports (as nodes) and routes and shipping lines (as links) that are embedded within the maritime supply chain. The ports of Singapore and Hong Kong are chosen to illustrate the respective transhipment and gateway perspectives. Findings reveal that geographical location and changes in the constitution of players can have reverberations on the maritime supply chain dynamics that traverse the port. Furthermore, evidence from trade route data also shows that maritime supply chain dynamics associated with transhipment and gateway ports could be governed by different levels of scope economies, demand complementarity and market power. The paper illustrates the abundant potential of slot capacity analysis for academic and industry/market research. Thus, future research can be pursued in various contexts and for different applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Outside analysts have detected few signs of such management. We find that, in the 2 years from mid-2006 to mid-2008, the renminbi strengthened gradually against trading partners' currencies within a narrow band. In mid-2008, the financial crisis interrupted this experiment and the bilateral renminbi/dollar exchange rate stabilised at 6.8.

The direction and magnitude of fund flow, which ultimately determine the local provision of public goods, are influenced by the re-election probability of the parties in power at the federal and provincial levels. The prevailing wisdom is that provincial governments, which are ruled by the same political party as that ruling at the federal level, enjoy a higher level of federal transfers.

The explanation requires two ingredients. First, labor demand expands (e.g., prices are sticky). Second, general nonseparable preferences over consumption and leisure should be such that the two goods are substitutes; that is, Frisch labor supply elasticity is lower than the constant-consumption elasticity; this implies that constant-consumption labor supply shifts left. Existing empirical evidence on the relative magnitudes of the two elasticities supports this hypothesis. The parametric conditions under which the result occurs are consistent with restrictions of concavity and noninferiority of consumption and leisure.","[Bilbiie, Florin O.] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Bilbiie, FO (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",florin.bilbiie@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,42,51,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The generality of this tenet was investigated in the context of a moderating variable, purchase deadline. It was hypothesized that the effect of increased price uncertainty, as reflected by both cross-sectional price variability and longitudinal price variability, was moderated by temporal proximity to a purchase deadline. The hypothesis was tested by analyzing purchase data from a sample of consumers with known purchase deadlines searching for rental trucks. The results indicated that search increased in response to greater price uncertainty for distant deadlines but decreased in response to greater price uncertainty for proximal deadlines.

In the first stage, the portfolio size is determined by genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are stochastic search algorithms, which can find a near optimal solution efficiently for combinatorial problems such as optimal portfolio selection. Proposed genetic algorithm tries to minimize correlations amongst stocks that make up the portfolio while trying to maximize the correlation between stocks and the targeted market index. In the second stage, the optimal weights of stocks in the portfolio obtained in the first stage are calculated with Quadratic Programming by taking into consideration a specific purpose such as maximization of return or minimization of risk. Results of simulation studies have indicated that the proposed genetic algorithm can efficiently search the set of possible solutions to a given problem and find the efficient investment portfolio meeting the desired criteria.","Adnan Menderes Univ, Nazilli Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Sayisal Yontemler Anabilimdali, TR-09860 Nazilli, Aydin, Turkey",Adnan Menderes University,"Özdemir, M (通讯作者)，Adnan Menderes Univ, Nazilli Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Isletme Bolumu, Sayisal Yontemler Anabilimdali, IIBF Isabeyli Yerleskesi, TR-09860 Nazilli, Aydin, Turkey.",mozdemir@adu.edu.tr,"OZDEMIR, MUHSIN/JTD-2581-2023","OZDEMIR, MUHSIN/0000-0001-8088-937X",,,,,26,3,3,3,14,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

In this essay we present and evaluate his work over the last four decades in three of its dimensions: pioneering, provocative and participative. While his research interests and themes range widely, early on he resisted the individualization of entrepreneurship studies and instead emphasized that entrepreneurship is a social practice that must be contextualized, localized and situated. In so doing, he uses such concepts as networks, industrial districts, regions and local communities. Making interpretive studies possible in a European context, his conceptual and methodological approach documents how future studies of entrepreneurship can be enacted as a reflexive, participative practice where methods of research, intervention and debate become blurred.","[Steyaert, Chris] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Landstrom, Hans] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",University of St Gallen; Lund University,"Steyaert, C (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Varnbuelstr 19, St Gallen, Switzerland.",chris.steyaert@unisg.ch; hans.landstrom@fek.lu.se,,,,,,,63,34,37,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The Nigerian GSM market is adopted as the study area because it presents contrasting features than where the model was frequently tested. The research relied on secondary data largely drawn from regulatory/operators' disclosure. The paper compares GSM operators marketing effort vis-a-vis TALCM prescriptions in relation with their market share for early and middle stages. Result indicates perfect correlation between compliance with the models' prescription and operators' market share. In essence, analysis of operators marketing effort and market share suggest the robustness of the model especially in the early stage where operators marketing effort were more divergent.","[Ahmad, Aminu] Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Univ Bauchi, Sch Management Technol, Management & Informat Technol Programme, Bauchi, Nigeria",,"Ahmad, A (通讯作者)，Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Univ Bauchi, Sch Management Technol, Management & Informat Technol Programme, Bauchi, Nigeria.",aminu_aa@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,114,120,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500022,0

Many configurations arise depending on the nature of a system's funding and determination of benefits. Many reforms propose changing the social security systems. The authors focus their analysis of the transition from a pay-as-you-go to a fully funded system. They argue that the key component of any reform is the treatment of the implicit liabilities of a country's social security system. The welfare gains accruing to some cohorts as a result of such reforms usually stem from either a partial or complete default on the implicit debt of the system, and in that sense the gains imply only a redistribution of welfare across agents. In contrast, the elimination of existing distortions in social security financing can generate efficiency gains, allowing for welfare improvements for all agents. This result shifts the focus from the nature of the system itself and centers the debate on the distortions associated with social security.

By considering the desire of the central bank to stabilize different types of the basis risk as a contribution to financial stability, we derive a set of plausible interest-rate rules characterized by either backward or forward interest-rate smoothing. The paper investigates the determinacy conditions of the rational expectations equilibria obtained under such rules. Contrary to what previously found in the literature, we find that the practice of smoothing interest rates backward does not in general alleviate problems of equilibrium indeterminacy. Moreover, basis risk stabilization may lead to policy rules embedding forward interest-rate smoothing, where a new kind of indeterminacy may arise following excessive concern for financial stability.

In this paper, we investigate to extract informative content block from Web documents by removing noise blocks. So, to extract information from these pages, several challenges must be overcome. Another existing informative content extraction system implemented nowadays depends on rule-based systems where Web sites with various templates are not applicable. In our task, a possible application of Neural Networks is presented for three pattern classification combine with DOM structure to extract content information. The type of Neural Network used to implement our system is feed forward which uses the back propagation learning algorithm. The data used in training and testing is collected from several Web sites. The classification result of back propagation neural network is used for eliminating various noise patterns from Web page. In order to evaluate our proposed system, we perform the experiment on several Web pages of different News Web sites and Commercial Web sites as data set. Experiments indicate our method is applicable to extract informative content from Web pages of these Web sites.","[Htwe, Thanda; Kham, Nan Saing Moon] Univ Comp Studies, Yangon, Myanmar",,"Htwe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Comp Studies, Yangon, Myanmar.",tdhtwe80@gmail.com; moonkhamucsy@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9173-2,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,12.0,,,,,,123,128,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392895700022,0

Despite their different origins, banking crises display similar patterns. Their causes lie in unsustainable macroeconomic policies, market failures, regulatory distortions, and government interference in the allocation of capital; they are frequently characterized by boom-bust cycles in credit and asset prices; and they are generally resolved through large-scale government intervention. When not handled effectively and swiftly, banking crises tend to impose enormous costs to society by curtailing the flow of credit to the real economy. The article concludes with a review of proposals to enhance financial stability in an increasingly integrated financial system, which include making banking regulation more macroprudential-focusing on the cycle and systemic risk rather than the risk of individual banks-and improving market discipline by limiting explicit and implicit government insurance of bank liabilities.","[Laeven, Luc] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Laeven, Luc] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 3PZ, England",International Monetary Fund; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Laeven, L (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",llaeven@imf.org,"Pettit, Krista/G-3549-2012",,,,,,147,45,52,1,78,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4803-8,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Gender differences in financial decisions and behaviors have been well-documented in popular media and the managerial press. The academic literature supports the notion of gender differences in investing, pointing out that male investors tend to make the high-consequence financial decisions in households and are the more risk tolerant and self-confident investors. Yet few studies have empirically connected these conditions to differences in the information acquisition behavior of male and female investors. This paper examines whether differences exist in the information sources and the frequency of their use among male and female investors and identifies demographic and attitudinal characteristics that could cause differences in information search strategies.","[Loibl, Caezilia] Ohio State Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Hira, Tahira K.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Iowa State University,"Loibl, C (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, 1787 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",loibl.3@osu.edu,"Loibl, Caezilia/O-8282-2019","Loibl, Caezilia/0000-0002-7586-3295",,,,,73,14,14,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

J,"Pézier, J; Scheller, J",,,,"Pezier, Jacques; Scheller, Johanna",,,Optimal investment strategies and performance sharing rules for pension schemes with minimum guarantee,JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INSURANCE; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN,"There is a potential conflict of interest between a pension fund sponsor and future pensioners when they share unequally in the pension fund performance. Thus, when a scheme offers a yearly guaranteed minimum return to pensioners, as is presently the case with German Pensionskassen, the sponsors cannot afford to invest in risky assets and consequently, pensioners end up with safe but very low expected returns. We examine optimal investment strategies for sponsors under alternative performance sharing rules and seek the rules that are most beneficial to pensioners. We find that the current yearly performance sharing rule imposed on Pensionskassen could be tilted in favor of sponsors without impairing the welfare of pensioners. We also find that the welfare of pensioners would be greatly enhanced if the guaranteed minimum return were applied to the cumulative return since inception of the scheme rather than to yearly returns. The ensuing credit risk taken by pensioners on sponsors could be kept to a minimum by proper regulation; this would induce sponsors to adopt safe constant proportionality portfolio insurance (CPPI) style investment strategies.","[Pezier, Jacques; Scheller, Johanna] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Pézier, J (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",j.pezier@icmacentre.ac.uk; j.scheller@icmacentre.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,4,5,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Because of their important contribution to growth, it is necessary a special focus on the strategies capable to facilitate active SME financing through a mix of classic and innovative mechanisms. The low level of funding capacities is explained by high transaction costs and credit risk, information asymmetry and a shortage of collateral.

Financial black-holes are characterized by the breaking-up of credit market discipline and the large-scale financing of negative net present value projects. In a theoretical model, the paper explains how the interaction of perceived government guarantees and the ability to issue catastrophe-bond-like liabilities generates financial black-holes. The paper then shows that key facts of the recent U.S. crisis can simultaneously be rationalized by the financial black hole equilibrium: Between 2003 and 2006, the origination of catastrophe-loan type mortgages exploded, as well as the issuance of 'Private Label' mortgage-backed securities that helped off-load them into the market. During the same period, there was a massive increase in the origination of mortgages to borrowers with limited repayment ability, absent a continuous increase in home prices. While this situation should have led to an upward repricing of the risk associated with Private Label MBS, the contrary occurred and the spread on these securities actually declined. While each of these facts in isolation can he interpreted differently, the strength of the financial black-hole explanation is its ability to account for the combination of these key facts.

I suggest that the quantitative magnitude of underpricing can be explained with a market structure in which underwriters want to underprice excessively, issuers are focused on services bundled with underwriting rather than on maximizing the offer proceeds, and there is limited competition between underwriters. Since the technology bubble burst in 2000, U.S. IPO volume has been low. Although regulatory burdens undoubtedly account for some of the decline, I suggest that much of the decline may be due to a structural shift that has lessened the profitability of small independent companies relative to their value as part of a larger, more established organization that can realize economies of scope. I also discuss the long-run performance literature. My interpretation of the evidence is that except for the smallest companies going public, IPOs have long-run returns that are similar to those on seasoned stocks with the same characteristics.","Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ritter, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jay.ritter@warrington.ufl.edu,,"Ritter, Jay/0000-0001-6274-0766",,,,,123,90,106,3,61,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4803-8,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The dynamism, flexibility, and the crisis-resistant capacity are specific features of the Small and Medium-Sized Entities, construed as essential for the economic-social cohesion, for, economic growth and for the creation of new jobs. This explains the fact that the concentrating tendency of the economic activity is often reversed in favour of small production facilities, which have a major role in restructuring industries, in the equilibrium of activities on the national territory and the economic bloom. One may notice that this tendency is also manifested (rather shyly for now) at the level of the Romanian economy. At the same time, at the level of these entities, there is a certain settling tendency on scientific bases as far as the managerial/decision-making process is concerned. However, in Romania, nowadays, businessmen would often refuse to acknowledge the importance of strategic planning. They consider it an accessory that is useful to acquire only if time allows it. Sometimes, even if strategic planning studies claim the contrary, they think their business is too small and the procedure too simple to achieve strategic planning. Given this perspective, we believe that the strategic planning issue deserves a special approach, our paper insisting on this particular issue.","[Roman, Costica] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1511,1515,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001037,0

Weather derivative represent an innovative financial risk management tool related to the conduct of the weather. The aim of the paper is to point out some problems of index estimation for the purposes of weather derivative valuation considering the particularities of agriculture. Assessment of the sensitivity of barley to weather over 40 years has been the basis for the design and valuation of weather derivative in the Czech Republic (The South Moravian Region). The analysis is based on linear regression modeling using monthly temperature index (as the most suitable independent weather variable) and barley yield (as dependent variable). The burn analysis based on parametric bootstrap is used as the method for the valuation of weather derivative contract, namely the call option. It can be concluded that the burn analysis is suitable for weather derivative valuation in agriculture, but only if the basis risk has been minimized. With the effective bootstrap tool, the burn analysis may easily be processed and the uncertainty about the pay-off and other statistics can be effectively determined. Nevertheless, the results of the analysis reveal a significant adverse impact of basis risk on the quality of agricultural weather derivative in the Czech growing conditions. The article outlines the scope for use of weather derivative as the reinsurance tool in regions with frequent occurrence of systematic weather risk.","Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0002-9266-9435",,,,,12,0,0,1,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,169,177,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100017,0

Construction projects often suffered from high fragmentation, large waste, poor productivity, cost and time overruns, and conflicts and disputes for a long time. Thus, many new and innovative management and procurement systems in construction are introduced such as partnering, joint venture, alliances, supply chain management, enterprise resource planning (ERP), just in time (JIT), and total quality management (TQM) to meet these challenges. However, these construction management and procurement systems are meaningless without coordination, a vital managerial principle and activity, which provides the best cooperation among team members. Although coordination plays crucial functions throughout the building process especially during the design and construction stages, some failures in construction projects adopted coordination principles are still observed. Hence, a study is carried out to investigate the key barriers of coordination in construction project. Through the literature review, five groups of key barriers are established in this paper, including the nature of construction, traditional contractual arrangement, construction's participant, characteristic of organization and construction management approach. The investigation of these key barriers is expected to assist the construction players in coordinating their projects towards a better implementation of the innovative management and procurement systems.

We apply a comprehensive approach by cross-validating our analysis with both balance sheet and qualitative data on self-declared credit rationing and financing constraints on a sample of mainly small and medium-sized firms. Our qualitative information shows that (self-declared) credit rationing is (weakly) related to both traditional a priori factors-such as firm size, age and location-and lenders' rational decisions taken on the basis of their credit risk models. We use the qualitative information on firms which were denied (additional) credit to provide evidence relevant to the investment-cash flow sensitivity debate. The evidence shows that self-declared credit rationing significantly discriminates between firms which possess or not such sensitivity, while a priori criteria do not. The same result does not apply when we consider the wider group of financially constrained firms (which do not seem to have a higher investment-cash flow sensitivity), supporting the more recent empirical evidence in this direction.","[Becchetti, Leonardo; Castelli, Annalisa; Hasan, Iftekhar] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.",becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it,,"BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,62,29,29,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In addition to stocks and bonds, the households have access to deferred annuities. Deferred payout life annuities are financial contracts providing life-long income to the annuitant after a specified period of time conditional on survival. We find that deferred annuities play an important role in household portfolios and generate significant welfare gains. Households with high benefits from state pensions, moderate risk aversion and moderate labor income risk purchase deferred annuities from age 40 and gradually increase their portfolio share. At retirement, deferred annuities account for 78% of total financial wealth. Households with low state pensions and high labor income risk purchase more annuities and earlier. Uncertainty with respect to future mortality rates has the same effect, i.e. household hedge against longevity risks using deferred annuities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence is assessed on the policy influence of the fertilizer-response research and on the impact of switching to a more inclusive policy that relaxed the government's probation of fertilizer allocation to barley. Interviews with key informants make a persuasive case for attribution; estimates from economic surplus models are consistent with a high rate of return on investment in the policy-oriented research.

Specifically, success only accompanies entry if a participant is one of the better ranked entrants on the skill criterion. We investigate what happens when participants face an additional source of uncertainty that perturbs relative skill rankings. Interestingly, this has asymmetric effects. On average, chances of success are increased for those with low rankings but decreased for those with high rankings. Thus, we predicted that the additional uncertainty would lead to more entry by the former but less by the latter. Our data supported the first prediction but, for those with high skill rankings, the existence of additional uncertainty made little difference. Finally, although we observed excess entry (i.e., too many participants entered markets), this could not be attributed to overconfidence.

We find operational efficiency, access to capital, and tax savings are important determinants for this shift. The incentive to demutualize differs by the type of conversion: full demutualization is chosen for efficiency and access to capital reasons and partial conversion, using a mutual holding company, is chosen for tax savings. Firm operational efficiency improves after conversion.

Pre-existing relationships between firms and the banks that acquire their loans are detrimental to the positive valuation effects of the event. Banks may have an incentive to favor pre-existing relationships to increase the value of previously extended loans. Therefore, loan renewals to firms with prior relationships do not signal borrower quality to the market, which is aware of the banks' conflicts of interest.

In addressing this question, the paper lets an investor in a credit portfolio face non-diversifiable uncertainty about two risk parameters - probability of default and asset-return correlation - and calibrates this uncertainty to a lower bound on estimation noise. In this context, a Bayesian inference procedure is essential for deriving and analyzing the main result, i.e. that parameter uncertainty raises substantially the tail risk perceived by the investor. Since a measure of tail risk that incorporates parameter uncertainty is computationally demanding, the paper also derives a closed-form approximation to such a measure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the gains to two merging firms and to national welfare in a linear Cournot model. With heterogeneous firms and possible synergies, greater foreign entry tends to enhance both private and public incentives for domestic mergers. Thus, policymakers have no cause to doubt the intentions of firms seeking to merge: when it is in the firms' interests then it is also in the public interest. However, at least for certain parameterisations, private gains from mergers become positive at a lower level of foreign entry than do public gains. This suggests that private firms may have an incentive to overstate the degree of foreign competition they anticipate facing-for example, after liberalizing foreign investment rules-to persuade policymakers that a proposed domestic merger is in the national interest.","[Richardson, Martin] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Fang, Ryan] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Richardson, Martin] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",Australian National University; University of Chicago; University of Otago,"Richardson, M (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ryfang@uchicago.edu; martin.richardson@anu.edu.au,,"Fang, Ryan/0000-0002-7094-3392; Richardson, Martin/0000-0002-9825-090X",,,,,11,1,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Results also highlight the possibility that the documented spillover effects from FDI in developing countries may be partly a product of model misspecification.","[Diebel, David S.] ADM Associates Inc, Sacramento, CA 95827 USA; [Wooster, Rossitza B.] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",Portland State University,"Diebel, DS (通讯作者)，ADM Associates Inc, 3239 Ramos Circle, Sacramento, CA 95827 USA.",wooster@pdx.edu; david@admenergy.com,,"Wooster, Rossitza/0000-0002-6676-9213",,,,,44,79,91,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

While the topic is important, the relevant empirical studies in the literature have been limited. This paper attempts to close the gap by investigating the issue with panel data in the period 2001-06. Empirical models for both productivity level and growth are developed, in which two channels are identified through which FDI may affect industrial productivity directly and indirectly. The estimates suggest that FDI has positive direct and spillovers effect on China's industrial productivity level and growth, and the contribution of FDI to productivity is enhanced by its interaction with China's human capital. While labor-intensive industries benefit more from FDI direct effects, capital-intensive industries gain more from FDI spillover effects.","[Zhang, Kevin Honglin] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Zhao, Zhongxiu] UIBE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Illinois State University; University of International Business & Economics,"Zhang, KH (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",zhxzhao@uibe.edu.cn; khzhang@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,30,49,53,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

These new ventures are being subsidized by various governmental programs. Empirical evidence on skill-composition, direct job creation and other key variables is rather scarce, largely because of inadequate data availability. We base our analysis on unique survey data containing a representative sample of over 3,100 start-ups founded by unemployed persons in Germany and subsidized under two different schemes: the bridging allowance (BA) and the start-up-subsidy (SUS). We are able to draw on extensive pre- and post-founding information concerning the characteristics of the business (start-up capital, industry, etc.) and of the business founders (education, motivation, preparation, etc.). Our main results are: (1) The two programs attracted very different business founders (higher skilled for the BA, more female persons for the SUS), and different businesses were created (less capital intensive for the SUS). (2) We find that formerly unemployed founders are motivated by push and pull factors. (3) Survival rates 2.5 years after business founding are quite high (around 70%) and similar for both programs and across gender. (4) However, the newly developed businesses differ significantly in terms of direct employment effects. While around 30% of the founders with the BA already have at least one employee, this is true for roughly 12% of the founders with the SUS.","[Caliendo, Marco] Inst Study Labor IZA, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Kritikos, Alexander S.] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Dept Innovat, Berlin, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Caliendo, M (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",caliendo@iza.org; akritikos@diw.de,,,,,,,46,110,118,2,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

As a result, these countries are increasingly experimenting with alternative approaches aimed at leveraging nonregulatory green pressures applied by local communities, capital markets, and consumers. This article reviews three strands of the empirical literature on this trend. The first examines the direct impact of nonregulatory pressures on the environmental performance of developing-country firms. The second and third strands analyze policy innovations in developing countries reputed to leverage these pressures-public disclosure and voluntary regulation. Overall, these three strands of literature do not provide widespread compelling evidence that alternative pollution control policies spur significant improvements in environmental performance. A handful of reasonably rigorous studies-particularly those concerning public disclosure-present positive results, but are overshadowed by a larger number of studies that present negative, inconclusive, or unconvincing results. Therefore, policy makers would do well to exercise caution in promoting and implementing alternative pollution control tools in developing countries: they are only likely to be effective in certain forms and situations.","[Blackman, Allen] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Blackman, Allen] Ctr Cent Amer, Turriabla, Costa Rica",Resources for the Future,"Blackman, A (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",blackman@rff.org,,,,,,,56,86,95,1,51,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

From a legal perspective, we show that the proposals' 'first and second pillars' would give rise to considerable interpretative and qualification problems, resulting in as much complexity and legal uncertainty as the current regime. Equally, an option to tax could potentially follow significantly different legal designs, which would give rise to discrepancies in the application of the option amongst Member States of the European Union (EU). On the economic side, we show that quite generally, when firms cannot coordinate their behaviour, they have an individual incentive to opt in on business-to-business (B2B) transactions, but not on business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. We also show that opting-in eliminates the cost disadvantage that EU financial services firms face in competing with foreign firms for B2B sales. But these results do not hold if firms can coordinate their behaviour. An estimate of the upper bound on the amount of tax revenue that might be lost from allowing opting-in is provided for a number of EU countries.","[de la Feria, Rita] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Lockwood, Ben] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Oxford; University of Warwick,"de la Feria, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",rita.delaferia@sbs.ox.ac.uk; B.Lockwood@warwick.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,34,13,13,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We use a dynamic panel data model where the bank's shareholder value is a linear function of various bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic variables. We show that shareholder value has a positive relationship with cost efficiency changes, while economic profits are linked to revenue efficiency changes.

Although his legacy was paramount in the work of the Nobel Prize winner Vernon Smith, Siegel endorsed a very different approach to making interdisciplinary research effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In such economies, a curbside garbage tax not only fails to encourage the centralized recycler to internalize the external costs of waste disposal, but introduces inefficiencies to the cost-minimizing mix of household and centralized recycling efforts.

The deep habits mechanism gives rise to countercyclical markup movements even when prices are flexible and interacts with nominal rigidities in interesting ways. Key parameters are estimated using a limited information approach. The deep habits model can account very precisely for the persistent impact of monetary policy shocks on aggregate consumption and for both the price puzzle and inflation persistence. A key insight is that the deep habits mechanism and nominal rigidities are complementary: the deep habits model can account for the dynamic effects of monetary policy shock at low to moderate levels of nominal rigidities. The results are shown to be stable over time and not caused by monetary policy changes. J. Japanese Int. Economies 24 (2) (2010) 236-258.

I develop a general equilibrium production economy where firms use two factors: real estate and other capital. Investment is subject to asymmetric adjustment costs. Because real estate depreciates slowly, firms with high real estate holdings are more vulnerable to bad productivity shocks and hence are riskier and have higher expected returns. This prediction is supported empirically. I find that the returns of firms with a high share of real estate capital exceed that of low real estate firms by 3-6% annually, adjusted for exposures to the market return, size, value, and momentum factors. Moreover, conditional beta estimates reveal that these firms indeed have higher market betas, and the spread between the betas of high and low real estate firms is countercyclical.","[Tuzel, Selale] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Tuzel, S (通讯作者)，USC Marshall Sch Business, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy,Bridge Hall 308, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",tuzel@usc.edu,,,,,,,57,73,89,2,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Many studies have demonstrated this phenomenon for verbal agreements reached via open discussion. In contrast, little evidence exists concerning the effects of agreements reached using formal procedures that do not allow for discussion. This paper begins to fill this gap by investigating the effectiveness of an agreement reached by majority voting. Specifically, I investigate how voting on a sharing norm affects subsequent behavior in a dictator game. The voting procedure takes place behind a 'veil of ignorance', and the result of the vote is referred to as a non-binding agreement. I find that this procedure does not induce higher offers than are observed under a no-vote baseline. In fact, dictators were significantly more likely to offer nothing under the voting treatment. This evidence suggests that formal decision procedures may be less effective than open deliberation in creating effective non-binding agreements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper connects different types of corporate name changes to the reputational concerns that precede them and to the important corporate events and performance changes that follow them. The empirical results suggest that a firm adopts a radically different name to disassociate from a poor reputation, the name of one of its well-recognized brands to associate with a good reputation, or a minor change in its name by adding or deleting a part of its name that identifies it with a particular product to accompany a narrower business focus or a broader business focus. The empirical results also suggest that, except for radical name changes, significant organizational upheaval follows most corporate name changes.

In equilibrium, firms with negative private information have negative leverage, issue equity, and overinvest. Firms signal positive information by substituting debt for equity. Default costs induce such firms to underinvest. Model simulations reveal that repeated signaling can account for countercyclical leverage, leverage persistence, volatile procylical investment, and correlation between size and leverage. The model generates other novel predictions. Investment rates are the key predictor of abnormal announcement returns in simulated data, with leverage only predicting returns unconditionally.

Using a mobility impact index based on commuting data for 1981 and 1991, we quantify the impact of commuting for seven major Italian urban areas, comprising in total 739 municipalities (communes). Our modelling experiment highlights the effect of sprawl at the commune level, while taking into account the variability of communes across geographical location and level of polycentrism. Causal relationships between spatial developments and explanatory factors related to changes in urban density are analysed using multivariate cross-section regression analysis and Causal Path Analysis (CPA). Our empirical results confirm the expectation that sprawl is accompanied by intensive travel movements and associated environmental effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It argues that attitudes toward ambiguity are heterogeneous across the population, just as attitudes toward risk are heterogeneous across the population, but that heterogeneity of attitudes toward ambiguity has different implications than heterogeneity of attitudes toward risk. In particular, when some state probabilities are not known, agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio. This suggests a different cross section of portfolio choices, a wider range of state price/probability ratios, and different rankings of state price/probability ratios than would be predicted if state probabilities were known. Experiments confirm all of these suggestions. Our findings contradict the claim that investors who have cognitive biases do not affect prices because they are inframarginal: ambiguity-averse investors have an indirect effect on prices because they change the per capita amount of risk that is to be shared among the marginal investors. Our experimental data also suggest a positive correlation between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion that might explain the value effect in historical data.

Compared to the substantial growth in self-employment in the 1980s, the 1990s saw overall self-employment rates plateau. Despite this, some minority groups experienced continued growth whilst others, particularly Chinese and Indian males and Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Chinese females, saw their self-employment rates decline. In this paper we use microdata samples from the 1991 and 2001 Censuses to investigate the dynamic and spatial patterns of ethnic entrepreneurship. Using decomposition methods we find that, for males from the Asian groups, changes in observable characteristics associated with an increasing proportion of second-generation individuals explain much of the decline in self-employment. This, which is also true of Chinese females, reflects in part the age structure and educational experiences of the second generation. The dynamics of Black male and Pakistani/Bangladeshi male and female entrepreneurship are less easy to explain. We also find that, while there is no evidence of self-employment being an enclave phenomenon, local economic conditions do affect rates of entrepreneurship for some groups, notably Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.","[Clark, Ken] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Drinkwater, Stephen] Univ Surrey, Dept Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Manchester; University of Surrey,"Clark, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",ken.clark@manchester.ac.uk,"Drinkwater, Stephen/P-5701-2019","Drinkwater, Stephen/0000-0001-9973-8811; Clark, Ken/0000-0001-7658-168X",ESRC [ES/F034180/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F034180/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,38,45,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

First, bonds issued by firms incorporated in takeover-friendly states have significantly higher at-issue yield spreads than bonds issued by firms in states with restrictive antitakeover laws. Second, firms in takeover friendly states have significantly higher leverage than their counterparts in restrictive law states. Third, bond issues are associated with negative average stock price reactions among firms in takeover-friendly states, but positive stock price reactions among firms in restrictive law states. Fourth, existing bond values increase, on average, upon the introduction of Business Combination antitakeover law. These results indicate that state antitakeover laws tend to decrease bond yields and increase bond Values, which is the opposite of their effect on equity values. This, in turn, implies that state laws help mitigate the agency cost of debt by shielding bondholders from expropriation in takeovers. Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that the effect of antitakeover provisions on firm value must take into account the impacts of both bondholders and stockholders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The conjunction rule states that if event A and event B are two independent events, the probability that both events A and B will occur cannot be greater than the probability that A will occur. Hence, the prediction that AC Milan will beat Fiorentina at the same times as Juventus will beat Lecce cannot be more likely than the prediction that AC Milan will beat Fiorentina. In an empirical study, it was shown that people frequently violated the conjunction rule. When a prediction with a low or intermediate likelihood of success (e.g., Stoke City will beat Manchester United) was combined with one or two predictions that had high likelihood of success (e.g., Liverpool FC will beat Wigan), it was perceived to be more likely to happen than when it was presented alone. This was not true when it was combined with a prediction with a low likelihood of success. Thus, the perceived likelihood of a particular prediction is dependent on the context in which it is presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Its innovation is to allow a parallel growth in motorization and public transit. The Singapore experience shows how a range of well-coordinated policies including efforts to control the number of cars in both ownership and usage, and at the same time increase the availability and rider-ship of public transit contribute to a sustainable transport system. The Singapore model provides a valuable reference for not only developing an alternative approach towards sustainable transport in countries where motorization is desired but also for understanding the various parameters important to the formulation of management policies. In particular, the paper contends the Singapore experience provides a model for Asian nations and cities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To improve the accuracy of estimates, we employed spatial autoregression and kriging models, resulting in a higher validity of the spatial models compared to the least squares model. Kriging models were superior to others particularly in terms of prediction accuracy, indicating that these models should be employed if the objective is superior prediction rather than estimation.

Are there lessons to be drawn for future tax reform priorities? This paper reviews the main channels by which tax effects might have been felt and which may require forceful attention. These include in particular the large tax biases favouring debt finance and, in some countries, investment in housing. The complexities of national tax codes, and the international interaction between them, have, moreover, encouraged the use of complicated financial instruments and international tax planning, reducing transparency. Tax distortions did not cause the crisis - in the sense that there are no obvious tax changes likely to have triggered it - but they may well have contributed by leading to higher leverage and more complexity than would otherwise have been the case. Most of these distortions have long been a source of concern, but dealing with them may be more important than previously supposed.","[Keen, Michael; Klemm, Alexander; Perry, Victoria] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Keen, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mkeen@imf.org; aklemm@imf.org; vperry@imf.org,"Klemm, Alexander/AAI-4154-2020","Klemm, Alexander/0000-0002-9892-3182",,,,,69,34,38,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Advances (and expected advances) in a single technology should affect both its adoption rate and the adoption of alternative technologies. This paper combines plant-level data on US coal-fired electric power plants with patent data pertaining to NOX pollution control techniques to study this link. As in other studies of environmental technologies, the effect of other explanatory variables is dominated by the effect of environmental regulations, demonstrating that the mere presence of environmental technologies is not enough to encourage its usage. Nonetheless, I do find that technological advances are important for the adoption of existing combustion modification technologies. However, these advances are less important for the adoption of newer post-combustion control techniques, which are adopted only when needed to comply with the strictest emission limits.","[Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, Dept Publ Adm, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Popp, D (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, Dept Publ Adm, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",dcpopp@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,41,50,60,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In 2003, the largest nongovernmental organization in the country introduced much smaller-scale loans without a collateral requirement. This scheme is commercialized but potentially more suited to the credit demands of the poor. Applying propensity score matching with the difference-in-difference method, this paper examines whether the emerging microcredit scheme has been successful in targeting and improving the welfare of the poor in the one year following loan disbursement. The results show that although collateral ownership is not an important determinant of participation, relatively wealthier families gain access to microcredit. The impact of microcredit on various household outcomes is generally statistically insignificant, except for sales of nonfarm enterprises for the nonpoor and schooling expenditures for the poor. This implies that the microcredit scheme under study might not have an immediate impact on poverty alleviation.","[Takahashi, Kazushi; Higashikata, Takayuki; Tsukada, Kazunari] JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan",,"Takahashi, K (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan.",,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012",,,,,,31,29,32,1,27,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We incorporate an estimate of resilience in IW by taking account of known or suspected thresholds that can lead to irreversible (or practically irreversible) changes in the productivity and value of assets and hence social welfare. These thresholds allow us to identify policies or projects that may be leading to an increased risk of decline in capital stocks (the wealth of the region). Such risks are not reflected through usualmeasures of current system performance, e. g. agricultural production.

These elements will help to have an alternative method in stress-testing scenarios, and better anticipate the capital adequacy process.","[Atomei, Alexandru; Robu, Vasile] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,sanatomei@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,923,932,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100055,0

The phrase 'land policy', used to refer to all policies that have anything to do with land, may be convenient, but it masks the actual complexity of issues. Meanwhile, concern for 'pro-poor' land policy has coincided with the mainstream promotion of efficient administration of land policies, leading to the concept of 'land governance'. Such concepts have enriched discussion on land issues, but they also complicate further an already complex terrain. In response, this paper offers possible analytical signposts, rather than an actual in-depth and elaborated analytical exploration of this terrain. It hopes to be a modest step forward and towards a better understanding of contemporary policy discourses and political contestations around land and land governance.","[Borras, Saturnino M., Jr.] St Marys Univ, Canada Res Chair Int Dev Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Franco, Jennifer C.] Transnatl Inst TNI, NL-1052 AK Amsterdam, Netherlands",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Borras, SM (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Canada Res Chair Int Dev Studies, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",sborras@smu.ca; jfranco@tni.org,,,,,,,120,128,139,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The first field is the social problems, the second one is economic and market problems, and the third group contains environmental problems. In my investigation, within the economic problems I dealt with the unfavourable breed structure, which considerably contributes to the low yields typical to Hungary nowadays. For solving the problem, improving the production and breed structure may be a specific objective. Its expected results are developing breeding programs and growing yields. The effect of crossbreeding, being one of the several possibilities of increasing yields as a separately activity, on the economic result were investigated. A calculation model was constructed, which made the effect of the change of input data calculable for the operation of the modeled farm producing for the market. The modeling reflected the improving effect of the crossbreeding on the results. The effect of crossbreeding was modeled on the basis of input prices of the year 2009 in case of farms of 5, 10, 20 and 30 ESU. When preparing scenarios, the natural input data of the model was changed on the basis of results of previous researches, such as yield, weight gain, feed conversion, milk producing ability of ewes; that is every feature influencing the production which is changed by the effect of crossbreeding. The positive effects of crossbreeding were evaluated. Other factors (other input parameters) were not changed during running the scenarios. Sheep farms of every firm size in Hungary may reach positive results only by profit supplementing subsidies. In this way it was a relevant issue of my calculation that whether only crossbreeding may result in an extra yield, by which the Hungarian sheep production for the market may be viable, even without profit supplementing subsidies.","Univ Debrecen, Ctr Agr & Appl Econ Sci, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Cehla, B (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Ctr Agr & Appl Econ Sci, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",cehlab@agr.unideb.hu,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,21,28,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600003,0

We model the agency theoretic perspective of risk-averse investors and financiers in a general equilibrium setting under the framework of rational expectations (i.e., symmetric information). We focus on real estate, as it constitutes a special case of complete market contracting where adverse selection and moral hazard are easily mitigated. Our results illustrate an increase in pareto-efficiency, as financial architecture advances from: (i) banks to capital markets; and (ii) plain vanilla debt to an innovative one with participation clauses. This is attributed to the reduction in agency costs and cross-sectional risk-sharing, leading to an increase in the value of property. Our results predict that an optimal financial system will orient itself towards efficient financial contracts, irrespective of its source of origination. We also rationalize the co-existence of banks and capital markets, and generalize our results under a set of restrictive conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ebrahim, M.

Sometimes the cultural value of visual works, music scores and texts might be safely ignored by economists were it sufficiently isolated from the value created in currency-using exchanges. But more generally, there is reason to believe that the two varieties of value are interdependent. The economic and artistic histories of three paintings are analyzed that show how the cultural value of certain items determines their economic value. Raffaello Sanzio's Madonna of the Pinks shows how the increase of cultural value creates a corresponding increase in economic value. Rembrandt's Man in a Golden Helmet shows an opposed example. Jackson Pollock's Number 12, 1949 illustrates the progressive formation of both artistic and economic value.

Patenting growth is significantly higher in cities and technologies where breakthrough inventions occur after 1984 relative to peer locations that do not experience breakthrough inventions. This growth differential in turn depends on the mobility of the technology's labor force, which we model through the extent that technologies depend upon immigrant scientists and engineers. Spatial adjustments are faster for technologies that depend heavily on immigrant inventors.

However, their functions' exacerbation by growing the fiscal burden could lead to very negative social and economic consequences, since an old saying predicted that it might kill the goose with the golden eggs. The estimation of the fiscal burden derives from a classic index that expresses the part of GDP that state takes as taxes and that might be relatively bigger in the developed countries than in the developing ones, directly connected with the whole volume of the national revenue. Associated with the fiscal policy, the term of fiscal pressure is widely spread in the literature and indicates the magnitude of the national revenue redistribution through taxes. Generally, it is a specialized word that expresses the average of the fiscal burden's intensity as a tax-payers' obligation to the central and local public authority. The amplitude and dynamics of the fiscal pressure is measured and estimated through the fiscal taxation ratio that is established by law or fiscal regulations. It is a fiscal coefficient expressing the very share of the national revenue taken by the state and is calculated as a percentage ratio for tax payments/revenues to the GDP considering. There are three ratios usually employed (low ratios, high ratios and optimum ratios) according to the average values of the fiscal taxation ratios on relatively long term of a certain country or group of countries, and by reference to the average ratios existing at a given moment in the countries at the top of world economy as well. To a certain extent, the present rise of the Romania's economy and social development reflects the existing global tendencies which are materialized in what the specialists call the transitional path towards the informational society, i.e. the society of knowledge and consciousness. As another challenge for the country, the integrative process requires the substantiation of a strategy that aims at gradually catching up with the countries that have developed within normal parameters along the trajectory of social and economic progress. Both support and motivation, the present Romania's struggle for integration in the European Union is actually an effort towards its social and economic second modernity. Being permanently interdependent with other macro-economic processes and policies, tax planning and tax policy play an important role both in ensuring and improving the financial stability and in sustaining an adequate environment for all economic activities. Although their different approaches and methods, tax planning and tax policy deal with the management of the accumulated public financial resources, i.e., the dynamics of fiscal pressure itself. The present study aims at analyzing the impact of fiscal reforms as reflected in the dynamics of the fiscal pressure from the perspective of various tax ratios and also the way it was felt against the integration in the euro zone background. Considering the context of the global financial turbulences, the paper intend to offer a solution as convenient as possible for the double challenge that Romania has to face in the years to come.","[Susanu, Monica] Univ Galatzi, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finances & Econ Efficiency, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,,susanu_mnc@yahoo.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",2223-5779,,978-960-474-184-7,WOR MULTIC APP ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,20,20,,,,,,1,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300068000007,0

As high international food prices permeated domestic markets, households in all the case study areas resorted to coping strategies common in the annual hunger season. Though acute malnutrition has not risen as consistently as in a seasonal hunger crisis, reduced micronutrient intake threatens to have severe long-term consequences for health and poverty reduction.

We find that the choice of the threshold matters and that a zero threshold (leading to sign predictions) does not lead to the largest probability response to changes in volatility dynamics. Under certain conditions there is a threshold that has maximum responsiveness to changes in volatility dynamics that leads to 'optimal' probabilistic predictions. We connect the evolution of volatility to probabilistic predictions and show that the volatility ratio is the crucial variable in this context.

This study provides evidence of both in documenting a conditional negative (positive) association between financial reporting quality and investment for firms operating in settings more prone to over-investment (under-investment). Firms with higher financial reporting quality also are found to deviate less from predicted investment levels and show less sensitivity to macro-economic conditions. These results suggest that one mechanism linking reporting quality and investment efficiency is a reduction of frictions such as moral hazard and adverse selection that hamper efficient investment.

We do so for post-communist Albania, where the regional and cultural polarization that has existed for centuries has evolved to clientelism in the new democracy. We show how clientelistic parties give rise to very particular voting patterns. These reveal major differences across regions not only in party choice but also in voters' responses to government policies. These responses depend on the party in government and on the region concerned. This is in sharp contrast with results obtained when applying the same model to a large number of more advanced democracies with similar electoral institutions. A proper evaluation of democratization in Albania thus requires looking beyond the formal institutions governing elections and taking clientelism and its effect on voter behavior into account.","[Schram, Arthur] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Res Expt Econ & Polit Decis Making, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gerxhani, Klarita] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Amsterdam Inst Adv Labour Studies, Fac Econ & Econometr, NL-1012 DK Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gerxhani, Klarita] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1012 DK Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Schram, A (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Res Expt Econ & Polit Decis Making, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.gerxhani@uva.nl; Schram@uva.nl,"Schram, Arthur JHC/G-5045-2011; Gërxhani, Klarita/F-2953-2013; Gerxhani, Klarita/K-2446-2018; Gërxhani, Klarita/HKE-2577-2023","Schram, Arthur/0000-0002-1767-4998; Gerxhani, Prof. dr.

We show that access to financial markets makes firms bid more aggressively, possibly even above their valuation for the project. In addition, hedging increases the variance of bids and makes firm values more dispersed. Further, with hedging, the covariance of internal capital changes with the risk factor is negative, and is more negative, the higher the correlation of the hedging instrument with the risk factor.

In addition, I have separately pooled data on Nicaraguans in the destination countries. These two types of data together provide a rich description of the determinants of choice of destination for Nicaraguan emigrants. For emigration to both the United States and Costa Rica, patterns of emigration are consistent with individual wage gains. The main finding, though, is that emigrants to Costa Rica have characteristics similar to non-emigrants and that emigration to Costa Rica is based relatively more on the current economic condition of the sender household. In contrast, emigration to the United States is based on the accumulated pre-emigration labor market success of emigrants' households in Nicaragua.

As an extension of Hoyt's (1991) finding that intensified tax competition is always harmful and aggravates the extent to which public goods are undersupplied in a region, we show that intensified tax competition can be beneficial if political as well as tax competition is considered. In particular, we identify plausible conditions under which (i) there is an optimal intensity of tax competition such that the interaction between interregional tax competition and intraregional political competition will result in the optimal provision of public goods and (ii) intensified tax competition will be beneficial if and only if the degree of tax competition is less than this optimal intensity.

Full coverage from deposit insurance is imposed by many regulators to stabilize the banking system in the current financial crisis, despite of the potential moral hazard problems. We argue that bankruptcy cost is an important factor in pricing deposit insurance, especially when the insured institution is insolvent. Applying the isomorphic relationship between deposit insurance and put option, we first derive a closed-form solution for the pricing model with bankruptcy costs and closure policies. Then, we modify the barrier option approach to price the deposit insurance in which the bankruptcy cost is set as a function of asset return volatility and more realistic closure policies considering possible forbearance can be accounted for. The properties of the models are supported by numerical simulations and are consistent with the risk-based pricing scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two types of market structure are considered: perfect competition and Cournot oligopoly. We find that output, abatement costs and the number of firms are higher under credit trading. Allowing trade between permit-trading and credit-trading sectors may increase welfare. With perfect competition, permit trading always leads to higher welfare than credit trading. With imperfect competition, credit trading may outperform permit trading. Environmental policy can lead to exit, but also to entry of firms. Entry and exit have a profound impact on the performance of the schemes, especially under imperfect competition. We find that it may be impossible to implement certain levels of total industry emissions.

Using two large panel datasets, this paper analyzes the price dynamics in two significantly different types of markets, cyclical (or volatile) and non-cyclical (or tame), by applying an autoregressive mean reversion (ARMR) model. Our results show that cyclical markets have larger AR coefficients than non-cyclical markets. As a result, house prices in cyclical markets tend to have larger price cycles. We also find that the upward periods have larger AR coefficients than the downward periods. This demonstrates that house prices are likely to overshoot the equilibrium in appreciating markets while experiencing downward rigidity during periods of decline. The model developed in this paper can produce a forecast with rich house price dynamics across markets. Our results can also be used to determine how house prices in overvalued markets will ultimately adjust. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose a new methodology to test whether or not two competing linear asset pricing models have the same Hansen-Jagannathan distance. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic depends on whether the competing models are correctly specified or misspecified, and on whether the competing models are nested or non-nested. In addition, given the increasing interest in misspecified models, we propose a simple methodology for computing the standard errors of the estimated stochastic discount factor parameters that are robust to model misspecification. Using monthly data on 25 size and book-to-market ranked portfolios and the one-month T-bill, we show that the commonly used returns and factors are, for the most part, too noisy for us to conclude that one model is superior to the other models in terms of Hansen-Jagannathan distance. Specifically, there is little evidence that conditional and intertemporal capital asset pricing model (CAPM)-type specifications outperform the simple unconditional CAPM, In addition, we show that many of the macroeconomic factors commonly used in the literature are no longer priced once potential model misspecification is taken into account.","[Kan, Raymond] Univ Toronto, Joseph L Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Robotti, Cesare] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",University of Toronto; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Kan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Joseph L Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",kan@chass.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,33,55,61,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Since new information about a firm is revealed at the time of its bond IPO, it follows that banks will be forced to adjust their loan interest rates downwards after firms undertake their bond IPO. We test this hypothesis and find that firms are able to borrow at lower interest rates after their bond IPO. Importantly, firms that get their first credit rating at the time of their bond IPO benefit from larger interest rate savings than those that already had a credit rating. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that banks price their informational monopoly. We also find that it is costly for firms to enter the public bond market.

This paper examines a panel of 128 countries over the period 1976-2005, and finds that the current account balances of common currency participants are more highly correlated with fundamental factors (such as net foreign assets, incomes, growth rates, fiscal policy, demographics, resource endowments) than the current accounts of non-participants. Furthermore, this greater sensitivity to fundamentals leads to larger current account imbalances. Participation in a common currency is typically associated with a 1.6 percent increase in a country's current account imbalance. Larger current account imbalances under common currency arrangements could be a sign of increased financial integration. Alternatively, they could reflect the difficulties of current account adjustment under fixed exchange rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Europe succeeded for a number of reasons: with a Single Market for the economy, the logic of a single market for environment is inexorable; the European Commission-which had failed in its earlier efforts to introduce a carbon energy tax-made the case for trading with great skill and persistence, on the basis of qualified majority voting, which meant no country had a veto; the UK and Denmark initiated their own national schemes, and there was a serious risk of balkanising the market with up to 27 different schemes, with the losses of scale and scope this would entail; meeting the Union's Kyoto commitments required a substantive pan European response, and EU ETS was the most credible and effective way of doing so. The European Parliament and Environmental Non Governmental Organisations played a constructive role, pushing for more auctioning of allowances and less of them, allocated centrally.

Second, policies differed in the 1980s and 1990s: Leftist governments pursued expansionary policies in the 1980s.

Traders provide market liquidity, and their ability to do so depends on their availability of funding. Conversely, traders' funding, i.e., their capital and margin requirements, depends on the assets' market liquidity. We show that, under certain conditions, margins are destabilizing and market liquidity and funding liquidity are mutually reinforcing, leading to liquidity spirals. The model explains the empirically documented features that market liquidity (i) can suddenly dry up, (ii) has commonality across securities, (iii) is related to volatility, (iv) is subject to flight to quality, and (v) co-moves with the market. The model provides new testable predictions, including that speculators' capital is a driver of market liquidity and risk premiums.","[Brunnermeier, Markus K.] Princeton Univ, NBER, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Brunnermeier, Markus K.] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Dept Econ, CEPR, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Pedersen, Lasse Heje] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Princeton University; New York University,"Brunnermeier, MK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, NBER, 26 Prospect Ave, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",markus@princeton.edu,"Brunnermeier, Markus K/C-4473-2012; Pedersen, Lasse Heje/AAE-7552-2019","Pedersen, Lasse Heje/0000-0001-7126-5530",,,,,66,1886,2219,14,369,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The aim of this paper is to consider the potential poverty-trap implications of this use. If the capacity of the resource is low, or if the population in need of insurance is too large, the households are trapped in CPR extraction activity and cannot get more than their subsistence requirement. In this context, cooperation between households and the introduction of a cooperative insurance mechanism may sustain an equilibrium outside the poverty trap and relax pressure on the resource. Moreover, private insurance schemes could also be a potential solution to this poverty trap.","[Delacote, Philippe] INRA, UMR Econ Forestiere 356, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Delacote, Philippe] Agroparistech, Engref, Lab Econ Forestiere, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Delacote, Philippe] Univ Nancy, CNRS, BETA, Fac Droit Econ & Gest, F-54000 Nancy, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine,"Delacote, P (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR Econ Forestiere 356, F-54000 Nancy, France.",philippe.delacote@eui.eu,"delacote, philippe/C-2853-2008; delacote, philippe/J-7929-2013; Delacote, Philippe/HHC-1541-2022","delacote, philippe/0000-0002-9888-7193;",,,,,18,33,34,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The management of operational risk is a key component of financial and risk management discipline that drives net income results, 2capital management and customer satisfaction. The present paper contains a statistical analysis in order to determine the number of operational errors as quality based services determinants, depending on the number of transactions performed at the branch unit level. Regression model applied to a sample of 418 branches of a major Romanian bank is used to guide the decision taken by the bank, consistent with its priorities of minimizing the risk and enlarging the customer base ensuring high quality services. The analyisis reveals that the model can predict the quality of the transactions based on the number of operational errors.

This paper is the first to systematically analyse transparency trends throughout the world and across monetary policy frameworks. It shows that the most notable change in central bank communications has been the greater prevalence of the publication of macroeconomic forecasts and explanations of monetary policy decisions. The rise in transparency has not been confined to inflation targeters but extends to other monetary policy frameworks, although there are significant differences in information disclosure. Nevertheless, in some respects central banks remain quite opaque, in particular about policy deliberations and policy inclinations. This paper also establishes some stylized facts about the macroeconomic environment. In particular, countries with higher inflation and economic development have undergone larger increases in transparency. Moreover, countries with greater transparency have experienced lower subsequent inflation.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge,"Geraats, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",Petra.Geraats@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,39,41,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

In this paper, experience of loan burden over time is contrasted with forecasts and recollections. Furthermore, it is suggested that loan burden relates to the mental association between the loan and the loan-financed goods. A survey of 117 homeowners at different stages of the loan process demonstrated that participants expected lower levels of loan burden in the future and reported higher levels in the past; in their view, loan burden decreases over the loan period. in contrast, participants at all stages reported similar current loan burden, suggesting no systematic change over time. Predictions and recollections were systematically different from experience: predictions were too positive, recollections too negative. Subjective loan burden can, in part, be predicted by home-to-loan associations, i.e. the degree to which thoughts of the home evoke thoughts of the loan. Homeowners seem to hold an intuitive theory about adaptation to the financial situation and this contributes to misforecasts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, it highlights and quantifies the role played by net capital gains on the U.S. external portfolio and 'residual adjustments' in explaining this discrepancy. It discusses whether these 'residual adjustments' are likely to be originating from measurement errors in external assets and liabilities, financial flows, or capital gains, and explores the implications of these conjectures for the U.S. financial account and external position.

However, the reduction in the unemployment rate is by no means warranted: although for pension systems which involve a limited amount of intra-generational redistribution this is likely, for systems displaying a high degree of intra-generational redistribution the unemployment rate may well rise thus preventing the realization of welfare gains.","[Adam, Antonis] Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Moutos, Thomas] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",University of Ioannina; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Adam, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",,"Moutos, Thomas/AAE-2552-2022; Adam, Antonis/AAI-2014-2021","Adam, Antonis/0000-0002-9483-1547",,,,,34,0,0,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

They construct a theoretical framework leading to two-way feedbacks between financial and trade openness and identify these feedbacks empirically. They find that one standard deviation increase in commercial openness is associated with a 9.5% increase in de facto financial openness (% of GDP). Similarly, an increase in de facto financial openness has powerful effects on future trade openness. De jure restrictions on capital mobility have only a weak impact on de facto financial openness, while de jure restrictions on the current account have a large adverse effect on commercial openness. The authors investigate the relative magnitudes of these directions of causality using Geweke's (1982) decomposition methodology. They conclude that in an era of rapidly growing trade integration, countries cannot choose financial openness independently of their degree of openness to trade. Dealing with greater exposure to turbulence by imposing restrictions on financial flows is likely to be ineffectual.","[Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Noy, Ilan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jaizen@ucsc.edu; noy@hawaii.edu,,"Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,37,49,55,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We re-examine this evidence using a broad array of credit spreads constructed directly from the secondary bond prices on outstanding senior unsecured debt issued by a large panel of nonfinancial firms. An advantage of our ground-up approach is that we are able to construct matched portfolios of equity returns, which allows us to examine the information content of bond spreads that is orthogonal to the information contained in stock prices of the same set of firms, as well as in macroeconomic variables measuring economic activity, inflation, interest rates, and other financial indicators. Our portfolio-based bond spreads contain substantial predictive power for economic activity and outperform-especially at longer horizons-standard default-risk indicators. Much of the predictive power of bond spreads for economic activity is embedded in securities issued by intermediate-risk rather than high-risk firms. According to impulse responses from a structural factor-augmented vector autoregression, unexpected increases in bond spreads cause large and persistent contractions in economic activity. Indeed, shocks emanating from the corporate bond market account for more than 30 percent of the forecast error variance in economic activity at the two- to four-year horizon. Overall, our results imply that credit market shocks have contributed significantly to US economic fluctuations during the 1990-2008 period.

Particular attention is paid to research design issues to try to isolate Metrolink's impacts from those of other influences on travel behaviour. In the short term a more marked decline in the frequency of bus use is found in the Metrolink corridor compared with conventional rail and 'no rail' corridors. Changes in the frequency of rail use are more prominent in the Metrolink corridor, both to the highest frequency use but also to lower frequency use. Higher frequency rail use tends to be associated with respondents who have limited or no car availability, who are in employment, who are of non-manual social class and who are aged 18-44 years. Metrolink appears to have attracted at least as many former car users as former bus users, but the former car users tend to use the light rail services less frequently. Census commuting data suggest that, in the medium term, Metrolink has increased rail's share of trips, especially to the city centre. contributed to the declining share of bus trips and may have helped to restrain work trips by car.

Estimates are based on panel data for the period 1980-2001. The large dataset allows us to estimate the effects of limited resale markets, low depreciation rates, high uncertainty, and negative industry-wide shocks on the irreversibility premium.

A Study of Financial Market Regulation,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Asia; China; regulatory decentralization; financial market regulation; IPO firm screening; regional competition,LAW; FORM,"Plagued by a notoriously weak legal system, China has developed an alternative governance system based on de facto regulatory decentralization in its financial market development, in which regional governments are responsible for selecting state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to go public. The effect of this regulatory system has been highly controversial but evidence is very scant in the literature. This paper shows that regional governments tended to choose better-performing SOEs in the pre-listing stage to go public, and thus substantial stock market investment funds were channeled into potentially productive companies. China's experience demonstrates that administrative governance of capital markets may have been instrumental in jump starting capital markets in the absence of adequate market-supporting legal institutions.

This view of corporate tax avoidance implies that shareholders and policymakers should question the rationale for distinct financial reports and that greater book-tax alignment may have mutually beneficial effects for investors and tax authorities.,"[Desai, Mihir A.] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Desai, Mihir A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dharmapala, Dhammika] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Connecticut,"Desai, MA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",,"Dharmapala, Dhammika/GPF-9205-2022","Dharmapala, Dhammika/0000-0001-9858-0565",,,,,42,113,133,7,48,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

J,"Esteves, RB",,,,"Esteves, Rosa Branca",,,CUSTOMER POACHING AND ADVERTISING,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMPETITION; MARKETS; INFORMATION; OLIGOPOLY; INTERNET; SALES,"This paper is a first look at the dynamic effects of customer poaching in homogeneous product markets, where firms need to invest in advertising to generate awareness. When a firm is able to recognize customers with different purchasing histories, it may send them targeted advertisements with different prices. It is shown that only the firm which advertises the highest price in the first period will engage in price discrimination, a practice that clearly benefits the discriminating firm. This poaching gives rise to 'the race for discrimination effect,' through which price discrimination may act actually to soften price competition rather than intensify it. As a result, all firms may become better off, even when only one of them can engage in price discrimination. This paper offers a first attempt to evaluate the effects of price discrimination on the efficiency properties of advertising. In markets with low or no advertising costs, allowing firms to price discriminate leads them to provide too little advertising, which is not good for consumers and overall welfare. Only in markets with high advertising costs, might firms overadvertise. Regarding the welfare effects, price discrimination is generally bad for welfare and consumer surplus, though good for firms.","[Esteves, Rosa Branca] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710 Braga, Portugal; [Esteves, Rosa Branca] Univ Minho, NIPE, P-4710 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Esteves, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710 Braga, Portugal.",rbranca@eeg.uminho.pt,"Esteves, Rosa-Branca/B-5332-2009","Esteves, Rosa-Branca/0000-0001-5063-697X",,,,,25,37,47,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

Relative to the other neighborhoods, house prices in type I neighborhoods decreased in 10 months by about 3%, with a widening gap over time. Our results are robust to several adjustments including using synthetic control groups. Finally, we find evidence that segregation increased.

This paper examines how fiscal centralization influences the likelihood of a successful fiscal adjustment. Using a panel of Swiss cantons from 1981 to 2001, we empirically investigate the determinants of successful long-lasting deficit reductions. Contrary to some results in the literature, we find that fiscal centralization significantly decreases the probability of a successful fiscal consolidation when the contravening effects of competitive and cooperative federalism are disentangled. The results also point to an important role of the economic environment, in particular the size of the primary balance in the years before the consolidation, in determining whether adjustment policy is successful.

We explore a large number of political and macroeconomic variables using a non-parametric technique to predict safety from default. The advantage of this technique is that it is able to identify patterns in the data that are not captured in standard probit analysis. We find that political factors matter, and do so in different ways for democratic and non-democratic regimes, and for domestic and external debt. In democracies, a parliamentary system or sufficient checks and balances almost guarantee the absence of default on external debt when economic fundamentals or liquidity are sufficiently strong. In dictatorships, high stability and tenure play a similar role for default on domestic debt.","[Weder, Beatrice] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Weder, Beatrice] CEPR, Mainz, Germany; [Van Rijckeghem, Caroline] Sabanci Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Sabanci University,"Weder, B (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany.",cvanrijckeghem@superonline.com; Beatrice.Weder@uni-mainz.de,,,,,,,43,38,48,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2009,138.0,3-4,,,,,387,408,,10.1007/s11127-008-9364-0,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,422NZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264436300007,0

Conventional wisdom asserts that being an entrepreneur means making risky decisions; hence more risk-averse individuals are less likely to become entrepreneurs. In contrast to previous research, we are able to examine empirically whether the decision of starting a business is influenced by objectively measurable risk attitudes at the time when this decision is made. Our results show that in general, individuals with lower risk aversion are more likely to become self-employed. Sensitivity analysis reveals, however, that this is true only for people coming out of regular employment, whereas for individuals coming out of unemployment or inactivity, risk attitudes do not seem to play a role in the decision process.","[Caliendo, Marco] IZA, Inst Study Labor, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Fossen, Frank M.] DIW Berlin, D-14191 Berlin, Germany; [Kritikos, Alexander S.] Private Hanseuniv Rostock, D-18119 Rostock, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Rostock,"Caliendo, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Inst Study Labor, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",caliendo@iza.org; ffossen@diw.de; akritikos@hanseuni.de,"Fossen, Frank/S-5861-2019","Fossen, Frank/0000-0002-5908-8049",,,,,31,281,318,0,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

They are often preceded by a credit boom and a rise in real estate and other asset prices, as in the current crisis. They are also often associated with severe disruption in the real economy. This paper surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on crises. The first explanation of banking crises is that they are a panic. The second is that they are part of the business cycle. Modeling crises as a global game allows the two to be unified. With all the liquidity problems in interbank markets that have occurred during the current crisis, there is a growing literature on this topic. Perhaps the most serious market failure associated with crises is contagion, and there are many papers on this important topic. The relationship between asset price bubbles, particularly in real estate, and crises is discussed at length.","[Allen, Franklin] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Babus, Ana] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Financial Anal & Policy, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Carletti, Elena] European Univ Inst, I-50133 Florence, Italy",University of Pennsylvania; University of Cambridge; European University Institute,"Allen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",allenf@wharton.upenn.edu; ab791@cam.ac.uk; elena.carletti@eui.eu,"Babus, Ana/KBC-9742-2024",,,,,,113,94,112,1,131,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1367,,,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

It argues that we should be wary of attempting to reconstruct the settlement landscape from the surviving documents: too often, references to agrarian structures are misconstrued as references to settlements. The shape of the latter is rarely visible in the textual evidence, but can be appreciated far more certainly from archaeological surveys and excavations, which present a picture of the evolution of the human landscape that is far more varied than a simple transition 'from villa to village'. Documentary sources are more helpful in tracing the fate of the Roman taxation system. They point to structural continuities in the way that the peasantry was exploited that did not significantly vary between neighbouring political territories, and that reveal how the powerful continued to affect both the location and the condition of peasant life.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Hist, Liverpool L69 7WZ, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Costambeys, M (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Hist, Liverpool L69 7WZ, Merseyside, England.",costa@liv.ac.uk,,,,,,,77,13,14,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Its size depends on the form of imperfect competition, market scale and technical-economic level of companies. The new phenomenon of a significant size has become the globalization process, which has been expanding the market area and has been leading to changes in market structures. The hypothesis of this paper is a condition that the monopoly reality always signifies higher deadweight loss. It means that the price is higher in monopoly and there also is a greater restriction on the amount of production than in oligopoly. The situation will be the same even if globalization leads to market expansion and oligopoly can operate there. Three forms of imperfect competition are compared: monopoly, cooperative oligopoly (cartel), oligopoly with dominant firm, and their consequences for economy. From the theoretical point of view, globalization influences demonopolization in terms of creating competitive environment by oligopolization which leads to reducing the negative effect of deadweight loss. The condition is to keep domestic competition on the newly globalized market even if the domestic companies were in the competitive environment just a part of the competitive edge. Moreover, there can be identified a new problem in the case of increased market globalization in which exists only one monopoly company as well as in the main market with the same technology. This problem is called social opportunity loss.","[Kraft, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,jiri.kraft@tul.cz,"Kraft, Jiri/P-2722-2017","Kraft, Jiri/0000-0002-4269-0009",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,187,192,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000021,0

No. 406/08/0459 supported by GA CR - Czech Science Foundation. The research is oriented on tacit knowledge transmission and management competence development. This paper presents partial findings acquired through the questionnaires for managers that were focused on management development and experience of Czech managers with training courses. The paper brings the results related to these questions: In which areas of managerial work do Czech managers have problems that can be eliminated by further development (training, education)? What is the experience of Czech managers with training courses organised by training and development organisations? What are the main weaknesses of training courses for managers? Do common training programmes for managers create the conditions where can managerial knowledge be shared and moulded? What is the experience of Czech managers with mentoring? We should mind the answers of managers themselves when trainers prepare training programmes for managers, mould competences of individual managers and share their knowledge with managers. The authoress sees the need to solve this thematic topic in its contribution to the increased improvement of the quality of the professional preparation (i.e. education or formation) of future managers for the execution of their professional duties. If however, we can come up with new observations relating to this field, the results will show themselves in the actual performance of individual managers in their work. This can as a consequence lead to increasing the competitive abilities of individual organisations.

Support for other major secular-nationalist parties fell significantly, as did that for the Islamic parties as a group. Two new parties led by former generals also performed relatively poorly. At the time of writing SBY seemed the likely winner of the forthcoming presidential election, supported by running mate Boediono, the former governor of Bank Indonesia. Indonesia's performance during the global financial crisis has been vastly better than during the Asian financial crisis, and superior to that of most other countries in the region. Output growth remained positive through Q1 2009, although there were signs of heightened caution within the business community. Deft monetary policy saw inflation decline significantly, with little negative impact on output growth or the banking sector. Much of the earlier declines in the financial markets had been reversed by mid-June. Successful management of exchange rate policy in late 2008 and early 2009 raises the question whether Indonesia would fare better with a more genuinely floating exchange rate and a much lower level of international reserves. Economic outcomes during the SBY administration fell well short of the president's 2004 election campaign promises, but were comparable with those under former president Megawati, reflecting the great policy similarities of the two regimes. A key feature of the presidential election campaign has been the use of the term 'neo-liberal' to attack one's opponents. It has been implied that those following 'neo-liberal' policies favour the business sector and foreigners over the people, whereas the real issue is what types of policies are more likely to benefit the Indonesian people as a whole. The debate provides the opportunity potentially to resolve long-standing disagreements as to the relative efficacy of free market- and interventionist-type policies. Public sector accounting reform is an important aspect of efforts to improve governance. Newly introduced accounting standards require a shift to double-entry accounting, and away from the single-entry system inherited long ago from the Dutch. This requires the listing of government entities' assets and liabilities in a balance sheet, and should lead to far greater accuracy in government financial reporting. In turn, this has the potential to be a powerful anti-corruption instrument. But progress is significantly limited by a severe shortage of accountants in the public sector, and by dysfunctional personnel management practices.","[Kuncoro, Mudrajad; Widodo, Tri] Gadjah Mada Univ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [McLeod, Ross H.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Gadjah Mada University; Australian National University,"Kuncoro, M (通讯作者)，Gadjah Mada Univ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,23,16,16,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

This paper looks at the effects of entrepreneurial optimism on financial contracting. When the contract space is restricted to debt, we show the existence of a separating equilibrium in which optimists self-select into short-term debt and realists into long-term debt. Long-term debt is optimal for a realist entrepreneur as it smooths payoffs across states of nature. Short-term debt is optimal for optimists for two reasons: (i) bridging the gap in beliefs by letting the entrepreneur take a bet on his project's success, and (ii) letting the investor impose adaptation decisions in bad states. We test our theory on a large data set of French entrepreneurs. First, in agreement with the psychology literature, we find that biases in beliefs may be (partly) explained by individual characteristics and tend to persist over time. Second, as predicted by our model, we find that short-term debt is robustly correlated with optimistic expectation errors, even controlling for firm risk and other potential determinants of short-term leverage.","[Landier, Augustin] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Landier, A (通讯作者)，Leonard N Stern Sch Business, Tisch Hall,40West 4th St,Room 9-09, New York, NY 10012 USA.",alandier@stern.nyu.edu,"landier, augustin/AAX-1984-2020","landier, augustin/0000-0001-7928-295X; thesmar, david/0000-0001-9265-0526",,,,,29,181,208,1,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

To maintain this balance, market orders must share any benefit obtained by limit order traders from more efficient trading conditions, such as better order queuing policies. Therefore an efficient market places a low price on immediacy, producing small bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, when price-discreteness leads to a mainly constant spread, cutting the price tick raises surplus. This is modeled with a stochastic sequential game, using stationarity considerations to bypass direct analysis of traders' intricate market forecasts.

It outlines unsuccessful attempts to staunch the mud volcano, concerns for human health and plans for long-term management of the mudflow. It considers the impact on transport and logistics networks and the additional costs to the East Java economy. The heaviest economic impact has occurred in the region surrounding the mud volcano in Sidoarjo district, but areas to the east and west are also affected. Individual firms in East Java have found means of accommodating their business operations to the mudflow with some provincial government assistance. PT Lapindo Brantas, the company considered responsible for the drilling that led to the mud volcano, has been slow in compensating victims as required by presidential decrees. Delays in finalising compensation appear to be holding back implementation by the national government of critical infrastructure reconstruction work.","Dept Foreign Affairs & Trade, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"McMichael, H (通讯作者)，Dept Foreign Affairs & Trade, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,22,14,17,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

During the last decades, EU trade went through deep transformation and structural changes. Traditional distributive trade has been replaced by organized and concentrated distribution. Even though, there are many developing trends which unify the EU trade, still there are some differences specific for particular countries. Level of development, structure of trade network, as well as structure of retail forms, differ from one country to another. Developing patterns of retail forms differ from one country to another. For instance, hypermarkets have reached mature stage in France, Germany and Belgium, just have started developing in Italy and are in developing stage in Spain. Hard discount shops are already one mature concept in Germany and Netherlands, while in France, they have just started developing. Regardless of differences between particular national and regional markets within EU, almost all countries participate in increased trend of internationalization, concentration and dislocation of traditional retail towards modern sale forms, which have more subsidiaries. However, degree of concentration in some countries is still quite different. While just a few companies control the markets in Scandinavia, France, Great Britain and Germany; in Italy there is not a company with similar comparable size or market strength. Trend of business globalization have emphasized the area of international retail as an important topic. With process of retail internationalization - retail has turned into a global industry quite fast.","[Mesic, Ishak] Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zenica,,imesic@bih.net.ba,,,,,,,7,1,2,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,25,32,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800002,0

Under the US Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006, funding in defined benefit (DB) plans is likely to improve significantly. Many plans may become overfunded over time, owing to the shortfall amortizations mandated by the PPA, as well as to precautionary contributions by sponsors and to plan investment returns. This analysis shows that a more moderate excise tax rate together with a reasonable funding threshold for asset reversions would not only enable sponsors to spend the excess funds on other corporate needs, thereby lowering the cost of sponsorship of DB plans, but also would open a considerable revenue source for the government, with only a small increase in bankruptcy cost for the PBGC. Plan participants could also gain in an alternative reform, which would require a partial transfer of excess assets to them along with a still-lower reversion tax rate. These findings also hold for plan sponsors with various degrees of risk tolerance or only making the PPA-required minimum contributions.","[Pang, Gaobo; Warshawsky, Mark] Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Arlington, VA 22203 USA",,"Pang, G (通讯作者)，Watson Wyatt Worldwide, 901 N Glebe Roach, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.",Gaobo.Pang@watsonwyatt.com; Mark.Warshawsky@watsonwyatt.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

J,"Resosudarmo, BP; Yusuf, AA",,,,"Resosudarmo, Budy P.; Yusuf, Arief A.",,,SURVEY OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Indonesia has so far suffered a relatively mild impact from the global financial crisis. Its economy grew at 4% in the year to June 2009, displaying a more resilient response than some of its neighbours. Fiscal stimulus measures, deft monetary policy and cash transfers to the poor served to soften the impact of the crisis. Parliamentary elections in April and presidential elections in July provided further economic stimulus. Election-related spending and the stimulus measures helped maintain formal sector employment levels and the proportion of casual employees in the workforce. Like the cash transfers, payments by parliamentary candidates to voters contributed to household incomes, particularly among the poor. This is reflected in widespread declines in poverty observed in 2009. The crisis, the stimulus package, the direct cash transfers and the election campaign spending combined to create a mechanism of income redistribution in favour of the poor. On 20 October Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Boediono were inaugurated as president and vice president for 2009-14. They announced key economic targets for 2014, including 7% economic growth, 5-6% unemployment and an 8-10% poverty level. It is crucial that the two leaders tackle important reforms - even politically sensitive ones - that will remove obstacles to faster and more employment-friendly growth. However, the plan for their first 100 days focuses on a series of small, politically non-sensitive reforms designed to demonstrate their commitment to, and create momentum for, wider reform. This strategy is unlikely to create an impression that the government is serious about more substantial and essential reforms. Nor is it likely to generate the economic impact necessary to bring the economy closer to the government's key economic targets. The slow expansion of infrastructure since the 1997-98 crisis is a major obstacle to future high and sustained economic growth. Despite some signs of improvement in recent years, Indonesia's rate of infrastructure investment remains far below pre-crisis levels. Tackling this problem should be a high priority for the government. While pursuing ways to grow faster, Indonesia - one of the world's largest CO2 emitters-needs to respond more vigorously to climate change. The leaders have pledged to place climate change mitigation high on their policy agenda. Yet little has been said about how, as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Indonesia should support her people's adaptation to its effects. The government needs to give high priority to adaptation and promote it at the international level.","[Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Yusuf, Arief A.] Padjadjaran State Univ, Bandung, Indonesia",Australian National University; Universitas Padjadjaran,"Resosudarmo, BP (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Yusuf, Arief Anshory/AAA-5839-2020; Resosudarmo, Budy/K-1129-2017","Yusuf, Arief Anshory/0000-0002-3126-3853; Resosudarmo, Budy/0000-0003-2273-9765",,,,,27,15,15,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Empirical evidence on the internalization question,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Airport congestion; Internalization; Airline hubbing; Flight delays,AIR-TRAFFIC DELAYS; AIRPORT CONGESTION; TIME; COMPETITION; NETWORK; TRANSPORTATION; ECONOMICS; IMPACT,"Economists have long suggested overhauling the existing U.S. airport landing/departure fees to reflect market valuations of scarce runway capacity. Economists, however, do not agree on the optimal congestion-based pricing scheme. While some researchers advocate for a uniform congestion fee regardless of a carrier's airport market share, others suggest that airport tolls should only reflect the congestion costs imposed on other carriers. This paper uses ten years of ontime performance data to empirically determine if carriers internalize congestion costs. While previous researchers (e.g., [Mayer. Christopher. Sinai, Todd, 2003a. Network effects, congestion externalities, and air traffic delays: Or why all delays are not evil. American Economic Review 93 (4). 1194-1215]) use excess travel time to measure flight delays, the contribution of this paper is the addition of on-time arrival and delay measures based on actual versus scheduled arrival and departure times. We find that estimates based on these new delay measures reverse earlier findings by Mayer and Sinai [2003a. Network effects, congestion externalities, and air traffic delays: Or why all delays are not evil. American Economic Review 93 (4). 1194-1215] and hence imply that carriers are not internalizing flight congestion costs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Deterministic versus probabilistic equivalent versions of the associated externalities are compared within a laboratory setting. Experimental results reveal that the collective action problem associated with counterterror strategies is deepened in uncertain environments, and is indeed a robust regularity that is not easily overcome; as individuals gain more experience, they become even more self-interested.","[Arce, Daniel G.; Bakshi, Sneha; Croson, Rachel T.

We also find that communication is a relatively effective way to implement the 'knowledge pooling' argument in favor of collective decision-making, compared to expanding the size of a committee. Moreover, decision-making with internal communication appears generally more robust in situations when heterogeneity of members is not adequately captured by decision-making rules.

Households' consumption, income and the two measures of real and financial wealth - proxied by house and stock market prices - are found to be difference-stationary and co-integrated; by means of recent econometric techniques for heterogeneous panels, i.e. the pooled mean group estimator, inference is drawn about the long- and short-run relationships between the variables of interest. The main result of the analysis shows that both real and financial wealth positively affect households' consumption in the long-run, with the elasticity of housing wealth being larger than that of stock market wealth. Moreover, there is also a significant short-run adjustment from income, stock prices and house prices on consumption, i.e. consumption adjusts to its long-run relationship with lags. When the model is run for the two groups of countries separately, the long-run impact of an increase (decrease) in house prices is generally higher in Central and Eastern European economies with respect to Asian ones, which make them more vulnerable to further adverse housing market developments.

First, conditional betas are estimated nonparametrically for each asset and period using the time-series of previous data. Then, time-varying MPR are estimated from the cross-section of returns and betas. We prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations for the conditional version of the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993) and show that nonparametrically estimated betas outperform rolling betas under different specifications of beta dynamics. Using return data on the 25 size and book-to-market sorted portfolios, we find that the nonparametric procedure produces a better fit of the three-factor model to the data, less biased estimates of MPR and lower pricing errors than the Fama-MacBeth procedure with betas estimated under several alternative parametric specifications.

I examine the effects of Bayh-Dole on university-industry collaboration and technology transfer in the United States, emphasizing the lengthy history of both activities prior to 1980 and noting the extent to which these activities are rooted in the incentives created by the unusual scale and structure (by comparison with Western Europe or Japan) of the US higher education system.

What makes the Swiss case special is the size of this liquidity provision at times, 80 percent of all short-term CHF liquidity provided by the SNB and the measures adopted to distribute this liquidity. In addition to making CHF available to other central banks via swap facilities, the SNB also allows banks outside Switzerland to directly participate in its repurchase agreement transactions. Although this policy was adopted for reasons predating the 2007-09 financial crisis, it proved tremendously helpful during the crisis by providing the European banking system direct access to the primary funding facility for CHF.

While several studies have identified a positive marginal effect of RCA rules, none have explicitly measured the effectiveness of these institutions to limit local externalities. This study measures this effectiveness by estimating how the direct and spillover price impacts caused by foreclosure differ by RCA status. Using a spatial hedonic model that controls for selection bias using propensity score methods and coarsened exact matching we find that foreclosed RCA properties experience smaller direct foreclosure discounts and produce smaller spillover effects than their non-RCA counterparts.

I find that CEOs are more likely to receive equity during negotiations when they negotiate for the target, particularly when the target has more bargaining power. This suggests that boards use equity to enhance bargaining incentives for CEOs with the most influence over deal price.

We find that, when the informed portfolio manager is relatively risk tolerant (averse), price informativeness increases (decreases) with the amount of noise trading. When noise trading is endogenized, the linear equilibrium in the traditional literature breaks down under a wide range of parameter values. In contrast, a linear equilibrium always exists in our model. In a conventional portfolio delegation model under a competitive partial equilibrium, the manager's effort of acquiring information is independent of a linear incentive contract. In our strategic trading model, however, a higher-powered linear contract induces the manager to exert more effort for information acquisition.","[Hui Ou-Yang] Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Beijing 100738, Peoples R China; [Kyle, Albert S.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Hui, OY (通讯作者)，Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Beijing 100738, Peoples R China.",houyang@ckgsb.edu.cn; bin.wei@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,,60,15,17,5,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We utilize that data to provide a brief overview of important trends in foreign aid. Contributors to this special issue draw on AidData as well as other sources to analyze aid transparency, new donors (not previously described or analyzed), aid allocation, and aid effectiveness. Our recurring theme in this introductory essay is that AidData and these initial academic projects refine rather than revolutionize our understanding of aid. The database has added significant numbers of new projects, dollar amounts, donors, and details about those projects, though there is much more yet to add. We worry that aid debates have been driven by too little information, and that many claims are based on limited or very poor evidence. Rectifying these problems will not be instantaneous: refining knowledge takes a lot of time and hard work. The common feature of the papers in this special issue is their careful attention to nuance and detail. In spite of what some recent authors have claimed, aid is neither a simple solution nor a sufficient cause of most problems in developing countries; its motivations, distribution, and effects are complex, and shifting. Capturing this complexity requires detailed data, careful thought, and sophisticated methods that allow scholars to make conditional causal and descriptive inferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Thoughts in favor of the smaller, sooner amount are more prominent in delay scenarios than acceleration scenarios, and this increases discounting for gains and decreases discounting for losses.

In contrast to previous research, our evidence suggests full convergence in the long run and, hence, capital market integration. For the same sample period, global convergence is rejected for RIRs measured in conventional terms. From these results, we conclude that previous tests of the long-run real interest rate parity might have suffered from weak measurement of real capital market interest rates.","[Herwartz, Helmut; Roestel, Jan] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometrie, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Herwartz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometrie, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",h.herwartz@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de; jr@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,49,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

An experimental investigation,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Perceived inflation; Price increase; Purchase frequency; Availability; Bias,JUDGMENT,"The effect of frequency of subjective experience of price increases on perceived inflation, i.e. the subjective experience of general price development, is investigated. The paper presents a two-phased psychological model of perceived inflation: first, information about product price increases is gathered in daily purchase. Second, these are integrated into one perceived inflation judgment. In the integration phase, the complexity of the task should trigger heuristic processing: higher frequency of price increases should enhance their availability and thus perceived inflation. Participants simulated purchases in two scenarios. Frequency of products with increased prices was varied while overall expenditure increases as well as relative price increase of individual products were balanced. Experiment 1 presented a high frequency condition with a majority of increased prices relative to previously learned reference prices and a low frequency condition with a majority of stable prices. Experiment 2 balanced cognitive effort for product price change estimation over conditions by replacing absolutely stable prices with slightly increased prices. As predicted, perceived inflation was higher with high frequencies of increased prices, while price increases of individual products were judged correctly. Experiment 3 ruled out the alternative hypothesis that presentation duration, which in the previous experiments correlated with presentation frequency, might have been the determining factor.

It is found that, on average, there are significant positive risk premiums in short-term electricity futures prices. The significance and size of the premiums, however, varies seasonally over the year; whereas it is greatest during winter, it is zero in summer. It is also found that time-varying risk premiums are significantly related to unexpectedly low reservoir levels. Furthermore, before the unprecedented supply-shock that hit the market around the end of year 2002, the risk premiums were related to the variance and the skewness of future spot prices.

The agricultural and management costs are often directly measurable. But the costs to protect threatened native plants and animals are harder to assess. The Rural Lands Protection Boards were the government agency in New South Wales that managed invasive animals. An analysis of their decisions provided the opportunity to estimate the costs of protecting native species. The number of native plants and animals threatened by invasive pests was modelled against the expenditure, area, pest abundance, climate and location of 38 Board districts. There was a strong negative relationship between the number of threatened native species and Board expenditure. This relationship was interpreted to estimate the marginal cost of protecting a threatened native species, the downward shift in the supply curve necessary to protect all threatened native species, and the gains from the shift in the form of cost savings in the continued protection of non-threatened native species. These results value some of the costs that invasive animal pests impose on the environment.","[Sinden, Jack] Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Gong, Wendy] Univ New S Wales, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jones, Randall] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",University of New England; University of New South Wales Sydney; Asian Development Bank,"Sinden, J (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia.",jsinden@une.edu.au; W.Gong@unsw.edu.au; rjones@adb.org,,,,,,,48,4,5,2,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Based on new trade theory, increasing returns to scale-both internal and external scale economies-are considered an important source of comparative and competitive advantage. The empirical analysis of (small) innovating firms in The Netherlands leads to two main findings. First, firms that are located in technical Marshallian clusters seem less inclined to become exporters. Availability of technical knowledge alone does not help to reduce entry costs that come with the decision to export and/or marketing and sales costs in order to achieve a higher export performance. Second, firms that experience difficulties in appropriating innovation rents due to labour poaching also seem to be less inclined to become exporters. The explanation for this second finding is the importance of outgoing knowledge spillovers, which is particularly relevant for small, product innovating firms. This reduces their probability to export. However, if firms export, the knowledge leaking argument is not valid for the export performance of the firm.","[van Beers, Cees; van der Panne, Gerben] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"van Beers, C (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands.",c.p.vanbeers@tudelft.nl,,"van Beers, Cees/0000-0001-6377-4845",,,,,51,17,17,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Moreover, subdebt regulation and bank capital requirements can be complements for alleviating the banks' moral hazard problems. To make subdebt regulation effective, regulators may need impose ceilings on the interest rates of subdebt, prohibit collusion between banks and subdebt investors, and require subdebt to convert into the issuing bank's equity when the government provides assistance to the bank.","[Chen, Yehning] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hasan, Iftekhar] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Lally Sch Management & Technol, Troy, NY 12181 USA",National Taiwan University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Chen, YN (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",ynchen@ntu.edu.tw; hasan@rpi.edu,"Hasan, Iftekhar/IUM-3182-2023","Hasan, Iftekhar/0000-0003-2469-0539; Chen, Yehning/0000-0002-7013-9222",,,,,60,25,28,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

However, pineapple exporters in Ghana produce both for their own account and purchase from smallholders. We hypothesize that vertical integration is only partial because exporters face large market risks that smallholders, surprisingly, are better able to absorb.

Making a ferry is conceptualized as a form of gathering, and as a phase of the wider performance of travel by ferry boat. Gathering for a ferry sailing before its scheduled departure data show-is a complex taskscape. Passengers keen on making a ferry employ reflexive, adaptive, orientation skills, weaving artful journeys to the ferry terminal in order to make a specific sailing.

Among our results, we observe that innovative activity, measured in terms of R&D expenditure or patents, has a strong positive association with market value at the upper quantiles (corresponding to the leader firms), whereas the innovative efforts of laggard firms are valued significantly less. Laggard firms, we suggest, should instead achieve productivity growth through efficient exploitation of existing technologies and imitation of industry leaders.

This literature is based on the notion that there are externalities associated with financial crises because individual market participants do not internalize their contribution to aggregate financial instability. We describe financial crises as situations in which an emerging economy loses access to international financial markets and experiences a feedback loop in which declining aggregate demand, falling exchange rates and asset prices, and deteriorating balance sheets mutually reinforce each other-a common phenomenon in recent emerging market crises. Individual market participants take aggregate prices and financial conditions as given and do not internalize their contribution to financial instability when they choose their actions. As a result they impose externalities in the form of greater financial instability on each other, and the private financing decisions of individuals are distorted toward excessive risk-taking. Prudential capital controls can induce private agents to internalize their externalities and thereby increase macroeconomic stability and enhance welfare.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Korinek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,76,106,131,1,19,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The main characteristics of this consensus are formed by the synthesis of the New Classical, Real Business Cycle and New Keynesian approaches. Although The New Keynesian Macroeconomic Model is based on a general equilibrium model, it can typically be reduced to a three-equation system, consisting of an aggregate supply equation (Phillips curve), an aggregate demand equation (IS equation) and a monetary policy rule. The basic model assumes a closed economy However for a small open economy, such as Turkey, whose growth is largely affected by international capital flows, the ability of the standard New Neo-Classical Synthesis model to fully take into account economic dynamics is limited. In this paper we attempt to extend the New Neo-Classical Synthesis model to a small open economy case by adding equations that would capture the exchange rate movements and the current account dynamics. Results indicate that the open economy New Neo-Classical Synthesis model for Turkey can provide a framework to capture the dynamics of the Turkish economy for the post financial liberalization era and explain the behavior of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey.","[Yildirim, Erhan; Cakmakli, Selim] Cukurova Univ, Dept Econ, Adana, Turkey; [Lopcu, Kenan] Cukurova Univ, Dept Econometr, Adana, Turkey",Cukurova University; Cukurova University,"Yildirim, E (通讯作者)，Cukurova Univ, Dept Econ, Adana, Turkey.",erhanyil@cu.edu.tr; klopcu@cu.edu.tr; selimc@cu.edu.tr,"LOPCU, Kenan/H-5220-2018","LOPCU, Kenan/0000-0003-1526-5581",,,,,28,0,0,0,19,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We explain such stress by modeling leveraged banks' precautionary demand for liquidity. Asset shocks impair a bank's ability to roll over debt because of agency problems associated with high leverage. In turn, banks hoard liquidity and decrease term lending as their rollover risk increases over the term of the loan. High levels of short-term leverage and illiquidity of assets lead to low volumes and high rates for term borrowing. In extremis, inter-bank markets can completely freeze.

The capital crunch theory predicts that lending is particularly sensitive to regulatory capital constraints during recessions, when regulatory capital declines and external-financing frictions increase. Regulators and policy makers argue that the current loan loss provisioning rules magnify this pro-cyclicality. Exploiting variation in the delay in expected loss recognition under the current incurred loss model, we find that reductions in lending during recessionary relative to expansionary periods are lower for banks that delay less. We also find that smaller delays reduce the recessionary capital crunch effect. These results hold across management quality partitions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The article has two main findings. First, it shows that, in general, there was an upward trend in average energy prices before the Industrial Revolution and a decline afterward, which was associated with the shift from traditional energy sources to fossil fuels. In the second half of the twentieth century, however, average energy prices did rise, reflecting not so much rising resource scarcity as greater value to consumers, as consumers shifted to energy sources that provided the desired services more efficiently. Second, the article highlights the dangers of focusing on the price of energy rather than the price of energy services when considering the long run. The price of energy ignores major technological improvements and their benefits to the consumer. This failure to focus on energy services is likely to lead to incorrect estimates of consumer responsiveness to changes in price and income. The article suggests that the inclusion of service prices and consumption variables would lead to more reliable models of long-run energy demand and forecasts of carbon dioxide emissions.","[Fouquet, Roger] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao 48008, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Fouquet, R (通讯作者)，Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Alameda Urquijo 4-4, Bilbao 48008, Spain.",roger.fouquet@bc3research.org,"Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013","Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Fouquet, Roger/0000-0003-4732-0821",,,,,66,43,44,0,31,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We draw three main findings from our analysis. First, SNA data has been substantially revised in and after the second comprehensive revisions, as well as at the earlier stage of revisions. We find that the past absolute revisions to the annual growth rate of labor productivity often went beyond 1% point. Second, the annual growth rate of labor productivity has been revised upward by 0.4% points on average. We show that part of its upward revisions reflects an underestimation of employment through an increase in 'non-response people,' people who do not respond in the Population Census. Third, revisions to source data such as the Population Census and the Employment Status Survey are helpful to predict revisions to labor productivity growth. Our regression results suggest that labor productivity is likely to be revised upward during expansions or with low real-time estimates of value added. We conclude that the three findings indicate that labor productivity during the 2000s will experience substantial revisions in the future. This conclusion takes into account the fact that the SNA after 2000 has experienced at most one comprehensive revision. The upcoming revisions to labor productivity can be positive rather than negative. J.Japanese Int. Economies xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx. Bank of Japan, 2-1-1.

This paper examines the importance of tax rules in determining the size of the government spending multiplier by estimating and simulating a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the Japanese economy. This paper shows that the debt-stabilizing tax policies employed in Japan during the 1980s and 1990s played a role in making the short-run multipliers large. Provided that monetary policy is accommodative, fiscal stimulus becomes more effective if it is initially financed by debt and if that debt is repaid largely through a gradual increase in capital taxation. Capital taxation has the smallest dampening effect on labour input, whereas an increase in labour input is the key factor contributing to the effectiveness of stimulus. Because the prospect of future taxation considerably affects the size of the multiplier, fiscal stimulus plans should be announced alongside financing schemes.","Govt Japan, Cabinet Off, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008970, Japan",,"Iwata, Y (通讯作者)，Govt Japan, Cabinet Off, Chiyoda Ku, 3-1-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008970, Japan.",yasuharu.iwata@cao.go.jp,,"Iwata, Yasuharu/0000-0002-9048-7056",,,,,63,9,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

It is well known that cost-efficiency may be achieved if allowances are auctioned or distributed in a lump sum manner, e.g., based on emissions levels before the start of the system ('grandfathering'). Bohringer and Lange (Eur Econ Rev 49:2041-2055, 2005) show that a cost-effective outcome can also be achieved if the base year for allocation is continually updated ('updating'), given that banking and borrowing are prohibited. In this paper we examine whether updating alters the entry and exit conditions for firms compared to grandfathering, and how it affects profits for new and existing firms. We find that the two schemes function surprisingly similar: First, the incentives to entry and exit are identical. Second, the total value of free quotas to existing firms, based on emissions before the system starts, is also identical without any auctioning. With updating initial claims for free allowances have a shorter lifetime compared to grandfathering, but quota prices are higher as firms anticipate the effect of current emissions on future claims to free allowances. The two effects exactly cancel each other out. If there is some combination of auction and free allocation, the total value of free quotas will always be highest under grandfathering if the auction rate is the same. Entry and exit incentives are still equal.","[Rosendahl, Knut Einar; Storrosten, Halvor Briseid] Stat Norway, Res Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Storrosten, HB (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",halvor.storrosten@ssb.no,,"Rosendahl, Knut Einar/0000-0002-8066-6261",,,,,28,14,14,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our results document that consultants neither agree on the methods with which to identify best practices nor on the possibilities to transfer them between organizations within one or between different industries.

The performance of this portfolio is evaluated against several conventional factors, using both cross-sectional and time-series regression approaches, as well as the Hansen and Jagannathan (1997) distance measure.

Based on the availability of information on actual bilateral exposures for all Italian banks, the results obtained by assuming the maximum entropy are compared with those reflecting the observed structure of interbank claims. The comparison indicates that, under certain circumstances, depending on the structure of the interbank linkages, the recovery rates of interbank exposures and banks' capitalisation, the maximum entropy approach overrates the scope for contagion.

In addition to common road accidents, users of these roads face risks from natural hazards such as avalanches and rockfalls. Moreover, the individual risk of road users varies with the frequency of their exposure. Drawing on choice experimental data of frequently exposed respondents from a mountainous region and less frequently exposed respondents from a city in Switzerland, we are able to estimate the value of statistical life (VSL). Furthermore, we explore how respondents differ in their individual willingness-to-pay depending on exposure and other individual characteristics. Our estimates of the VSL in the context of fatal accidents on Alpine roads are in the range of CHF 6.0-7.8 million (a,not sign3.9-5.1 million). We find the VSL to be dependent on socio-economic and perceptional factors but to be not significantly altered by the type of hazard. These findings imply that the VSL might be adjusted to account for heterogonous risk preferences of different societal groups, but there is no evidence of a 'dread' premium for natural hazards.","[Rheinberger, Christoph M.] Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Rheinberger, Christoph M.] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland","Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Rheinberger, CM (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",crheinbe@univ-tlse1.fr,,,,,,,37,18,21,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The survival processes associated with exit were similar. There were similar differences in productivity between entrants and the exits that they drove out. While the potential for turnover was the same, its realization was not. Retail entrants bought a different option when they experimented with entry that suggests different entry costs.

While it commonly leads to an increase in the fraction of green units in the market, the introduction of an eco-label can either increase or decrease welfare.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu,"Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173",,,,,38,39,43,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The empirical regularities we uncover show that that entrepreneurial firms substitute venture capital for multiple banking relationships. This substitution effect is primarily driven by expertise substitution, and there is also some suggestive, yet inconclusive, indication in the data that SMEs turn to providers of venture capital to avoid rent-extracting behavior by the firm's main bank. Our results do not support the view that firms obtain venture capital in instances when bank financing is difficult to obtain. Instead, venture capital funds are used if bank funding is deemed not appropriate, and firms do seem to be aware of which type of financing is more appropriate for them.","[Berger, Allen N.] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Schaeck, Klaus] Univ Wales, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Bangor University,"Berger, AN (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",aberger@moore.sc.edu; klaus.schaeck@bangor.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,34,39,2,51,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Inspired by the recent Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, the leaders of the G8+5 nations commissioned a similar assessment of the economics of losing biodiversity, under the Potsdam Initiative on Biodiversity. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for such a global assessment which emphasizes several critical insights from the environmental economics and valuation literature: contrasting counterfactual scenarios which differ solely in whether they include specific conservation policies; identifying non-overlapping benefits; modeling the production, flow, use and value of benefits in a spatially-explicit way; and incorporating the likely costs as well as possible benefits of policy interventions. Tackling these challenges, we argue, will significantly enhance our ability to quantify how the loss of benefits derived from ecosystems and biodiversity compares with the costs incurred in retaining them. We also summarise a review of the current state of knowledge, in order to assess how quickly this framework could be operationalized for some key ecosystem services.","[Fisher, Brendan] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Green, Rhys E.] Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy G19 2DL, Beds, England; [Naidoo, Robin] World Wildlife Fund, Conservat Sci Program, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Rodrigues, Ana S.

This balance hinges on the degree of asset dependence. In light of theoretical research linking diversification and dependence, we examine international diversification using two measures of dependence: correlations and copulas. We document several findings. First, dependence has increased over time. Second, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence or downside risk in Latin America, but less in the G5. The results indicate very little downside risk in East Asia. Third, East Asian and Latin American returns exhibit some correlation complexity. Interestingly, the regions with maximal dependence or worst diversification do not command large returns. Our results suggest international limits to diversification.

We characterize currencies with relatively large investment flows as investment intensive and conjecture that the more investment intensive a currency is, the closer its exchange rate adheres to random walk. Using 29 floating bilateral USD exchange rates, we find that the higher the investment intensity, the less likely it is to reject random walk and the smaller the deviation from random walk is. However, the effect of investment intensity is non-monotonic. Application of threshold models shows that after investment intensity reaches the estimated thresholds, the level of investment intensity has no further effect on the deviation from random walk. These findings help reconcile the previous conflicting results on the random walk in exchange rates by focusing on the effect of cross-currency and temporal variations in investment intensity.

More specifically, exploiting a very rich data set on university graduates and the higher education institutions they attended, we empirically study whether graduates from universities and programs that display better academic research records are more likely to be enrolled in PhDs or employed as researchers 3 years after graduation. Controlling for a number of individual and university covariates and using different proxies for research performance, we find that the likelihood of entering a research-oriented career increases with the quality of academic research. Notably, the inclusion of university-fixed effects shows that this result does not stem from unobserved university heterogeneity. Our finding is stronger for graduates in hard sciences, medicine, and engineering.","[Labini, Mauro Sylos] Univ Pisa, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Zinovyeva, Natalia] FEDEA, Madrid 28001, Spain; [Zinovyeva, Natalia] CSIC, IPP, Madrid 28037, Spain",University of Pisa; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP),"Labini, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",syloslabini@gmail.com; nzinovyeva@fedea.es,,"SYLOS LABINI, MAURO/0000-0001-9362-1313; Zinovyeva, Natalia/0009-0002-8449-6519",,,,,17,7,7,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The results of nonparametric plots and copula model estimates of these dependence structures provide evidence of weak dependence in these markets before the introduction of the open policy, except for the US and Japan, and the tail dependence is found to be insignificant for all country pairs. These dependence structures are adequately captured by Clayton and normal copula models. On the other hand, in the period 2002-2009, there is significant dependence in all but the Korean market, as indicated by Symmetric Joe-Clayton, Clayton and rotated Gumbel copula models. Further, the significant lower tail dependence of the 'A' shares with other markets was found, except for the US, Japan and Korea, which indicates that the financial sectors returns in these five pair markets move downwards together.

To account for these variations we consider the social norm to work and national systems of unemployment benefits. Following the social psychological approach to social norms (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990) we differentiate between descriptive, societal injunctive and personal injunctive norms. We use the national unemployment rates as a proxy of the descriptive norm to work. The societal injunctive norm and the personal injunctive norm to work are conceptualized as society's vs. personal attitudes towards working for a living versus living off public funds, respectively. The results of the multilevel regression analysis of the data from 28 OECD countries (European and World Values Survey, 1999-2009) suggest that the single country characteristic that could explain contextual variations in the unemployment effect is the societal injunctive norm to work: unemployment hurts less in societies with more tolerant attitudes towards being out of work. This effect holds even after controlling for the national level of unemployment benefits and the personal injunctive norm to work. We conclude that the negative effect of personal unemployment in societies with a strong societal injunctive norm to work is so much higher due to social pressure and disapproval and not to the perception that one does not live up to their own standards.

In two experiments participants endowed with a lottery ticket were offered to exchange their ticket for another ticket from the same lottery. Even though they could receive a bonus for exchanging, many participants chose not to do so. Experiment 1 finds that a manipulation that prevented the anticipation of regret by offering the ticket in a sealed envelope made more participants exchange their ticket. Experiment 2 finds that an increased potential of regret over not-exchanging made more participants exchange as well. In both experiments the effect of the manipulation on choices is mediated by anticipated regret. The experiments show that people are willing to forego a material gain to prevent future regrets and that the reluctance to exchange lottery tickets is (partly) caused by regret aversion.

Specifically, the paper argues that, in the context of Malaysia, ethical and socially responsible commercial practices are seen critical in order to build a strong ground for harmonious business dealings among the multiracial community. This is because, different ethnic groups might embrace different personal cultural values that affect the way they perceive good business practices. The varying commercial interests, distinct cultural perspectives, and historically distinct skill and trades could provide a rich perceptual framework for understanding the ethical and socially responsible practices in commercial settings. Even though it has been reported that there is minimal cultural distance between Malays, Chinese and Indians, it is likely that the various challenges faced in the commercial settings have some bearings on their perception of ethics and social responsibility. It is envisaged that this research will provide a better insight into the intercultural variation in regards to values, ethical and socially responsible practices among entrepreneurs in Malaysia and promote a better understanding of the linkage of personal values held by three racial groups in Malaysia and their business practices.","[Ahmad, Noor Hazlina; Halim, Hasliza Abdul] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Amran, Azlan] Univ Sains Malaysia, Grad Sch Business, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Ahmad, NH (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",hazlina@usm.my; azlan_amran@usm.my; haslizahalim@usm.my,"Halim, Hasliza Abdul/E-3592-2012; Ahmad, Noor Hazlina/E-3589-2012; Azlan, Amran/F-2503-2012","Azlan, Amran/0000-0002-9747-547X; Abdul-Halim, Hasliza/0000-0003-3708-7114",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,709,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000065,0

They expect to reduce production and inventory costs, speed product development, expand markets or secure technology, while enjoying congenial business relations with partners. They may not reap advantages attributed to cooperative arrangements, however, if dissension arises concerning the means of competition or desired ends. Strategic management researchers associate competitive advantage in part with consensus on the means of competition, whereas other researchers' entrepreneurship or negotiation, accentuate the importance of common ends (e.g., goals and values) in cooperative arrangements. Competitive advantage refers to the superior capabilities of the firm over rivals and means of competition involve resource allocations. Desired ends include business goals, as well as standards of fairness and trustworthiness. Strategy researchers report that consensus among managers on methods of competing relates to higher firm performance.","[Bobot, Lionel] Negocia Business Sch, F-75838 Paris 17, France; [Bobot, Lionel] INRA French Natl Inst Agr Res, F-75838 Paris 17, France",INRAE,"Bobot, L (通讯作者)，Negocia Business Sch, 8 Ave Porte Champerret, F-75838 Paris 17, France.",lbobot@advancia-negocia.fr,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,17,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Or, more precisely, do the subjective appreciation of these dimensions by individuals exhibit different patterns? Our empirical results first reveal a very significant correlation between happiness and life satisfaction. Second, someone with high standard hedonic well-being (happiness or life satisfaction) is likely to have high eudaimonic well-being as well (flourishing, vitality, resilience and functioning). In addition, the factors that are correlated with the different measures of well-being seem to be very similar at the individual level. For example, marriage, higher income and greater education are associated with greater satisfaction, but also with higher levels of flourishing, vitality, resilience and functioning. This fit is not perfect, however, and men notably report lower levels of standard well-being measures, but higher eudaimonic well-being.","[Clark, Andrew E.; Senik, Claudia] Univ Paris 04, PSE, F-75014 Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Clark, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 04, PSE, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",Andrew.Clark@ens.fr,"Clark, Andrew/A-2388-2012","Clark, Andrew/0000-0001-7004-7654",,,,,22,36,43,0,26,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The research furthers the theoretical perspective by introducing an instrument based on the 42 adjectives of Aaker's (1997) scale. Based on the affective and cognitive theories to explain endorsement efficiency, the congruence between the mean values of the brand being endorsed (Omega watch) and that of the targeted celebrity against the mean value of the endorser was being tested. The results proved that successful brand promotion needs congruency between the brand's and the endorser's personality, though it may be moderate.","[Farhat, Reshma; Khan, Bilal Mustafa] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Fac Management Studies & Res, Dept Business Adm, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India",Aligarh Muslim University,,reshma.farhat2010@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,20,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,473,476,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400094,0

The most fair settlement amount result can only be achieved based on the accuracy of a whole series of forecasts. And in order to calculate the settlement amount, various factors should be taken into consideration. Currently in Malaysia, courts use the traditional multiplicand-multiplier approach when assessing the economic losses and damages as specified by the Malaysian Civil Law Act 1956. In the United Kingdom, judges use a series of actuarial tables known as the Ogden Table that would help courts assess the size of awards to be made to personal injury and fatal accident cases. While in the United States, the human life value method is often used in court cases attempts to measure the compensatory economic damages. Therefore, this paper will discuss the factors in the Ogden Tables and human life value concept that can be used by Malaysian courts in order to develop a standard benchmark in calculating compensation for personal injury and wrongful death.","[Hashim, Haslifah; Mohamad, Massita] Univ Teknol MARA, Ctr Actuarial Studies, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Hashim, H (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Ctr Actuarial Studies, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",,,,,,,,4,1,2,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,334,337,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500064,0

The Bank's monetary policy objective is to ensure price stability, means-low inflation and to support the Government's economic objectives including those for growth and employment. Therefore this paper provides a critical analysis of inflation expectations, price stability and inflation targeting. Inflation's effects on an economy are various and can be simultaneously positive and negative. When we first think of inflation we assume that it will affect all people equally. The fact of course is that everyone isn't affected equally, so we provide a classification of the losers and winners of inflation, and discuss them. This analysis will acknowledge the fact that price stability would encourage greater institutionalization of savings, because interest rates, paid by financial institutions to their depositors, would effectively compete with the returns that savers can get on the unorganized market of borrowings. We will also point out that increase of institutionalization of savings would provide more room for a much better distribution of funds. By using transparent inflation targeting as a preventive measure, enhancement of transparency and reduction of price variability are given, and in an economy where prices are relatively stable, money retains its value and this helps to create an environment where economic growth may occur more easily.","[Kadusic, Esad] JSC Sarajevo, Dept Planning & Dev Serv Networks & Applicat BH T, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Bojovic, Petar] Union Univ, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Kadusic, E (通讯作者)，JSC Sarajevo, Dept Planning & Dev Serv Networks & Applicat BH T, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",esad.kadusic@gmail.com; psbojovic@sbb.rs; amelazgalj@gmail.com,"KADUSIC, Esad/GLS-0392-2022",,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,284,290,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500055,0

Considering the interests of ageing Polish society and institutions offering a mortgage pension based on a life-long structure as defined by the Civil Code, adequate regulations of this Product in the Polish legal system become an urgent necessity.","[Kuchciak, Iwa] Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Kuchciak, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",iwa.kuchciak@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,4,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9084-1,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,11.0,,,,,,329,333,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392766500063,0

Given that the recent wave of Latin American immigration in the 1980s and 1990s coincided with the fall in earnings and employment of the less skilled, it is not surprising that, like previous immigration waves, recent Latin American immigration is sometimes blamed for the misfortunes of less skilled Americans. There is, however, little evidence showing that immigration reduces native employment and earnings. Some believe that this is because immigrants are employed in jobs that natives are not willing to do in any case. In this chapter, we examine whether recent Latino immigrants are hurting the chances of earlier Latino immigrants and native Hispanics who are more likely to do the same jobs as recent Latin American migrants. We find little evidence showing that the recent influx of Latin Americans hurts Latinos and Hispanics. If anything, once we control for ongoing trends in regions receiving immigrants, we find that the recent Latin American immigration helped native Hispanics but had no effect on previous Latin American immigrants. The earnings of native Hispanics increased with the most recent wave of Latin American immigration, probably because immigrants help the productivity of native Hispanics by providing cheap services and doing jobs that free up the time of natives for more specialized tasks.","[Kugler, Adriana] Georgetown Univ, NBER, CEPR & IZA, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Yuksel, Mutlu] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kugler, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, NBER, CEPR & IZA, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",ak659@georgetown.edu; yuksel@iza.org,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4419-6681-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,213,+,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6682-7_11,0.0,,,3,Economics; Ethnic Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Ethnic Studies,BTU03,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288059300011,0

Despite uncertainty in Europe and slower than expected recovery in the US, Indonesia is well placed for moderately high growth in the medium term, and economic stability in the shorter term. At the end of June 2011, foreign reserves were at a record high, inflation was down, annual growth was steady at 6.5%, and investment especially foreign direct investment (FDI) - was up significantly. Consumer price inflation had fallen to just below 5% by August, from double-digit levels earlier in the year. This was due partly to low food prices and success in sterilising the effects of capital inflows. However, turmoil in international markets led to a sharp fall in the Indonesia stock exchange index and a mild currency depreciation in August-September, prompting central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market. Fiscal policy has remained conservative, aiming for a balanced budget by 2014. However, the government has still not moved to reduce growing fuel and energy subsidies. While the service sectors have continued to record high rates of growth, there has been a revival of manufacturing in 2011. This is partly underpinned by strong inflows of FDI, and is especially evident in the labour-intensive textiles, clothing and footwear industries after a decade of stagnation. Multinationals have announced plans to expand operations in Indonesia in the past six months to take advantage of new tax incentives. Overseas investors have also been attracted by Indonesia's growing middle class - a result partly of higher rural incomes driven by the commodity boom outside Java. Some recent ministerial announcements about initiatives to promote domestic industry have a protectionist flavour. A cabinet reshuffle in October may signal a more dirigiste approach to industrial policy - especially the shifting of internationally respected economist Mari Pangestu from the trade portfolio to that of tourism and creative economy. One important outcome of recent growth has been falling unemployment rates. However, youth unemployment remains a major problem, and efforts to overcome it have been fragmentary. A recent ban on overseas migration of domestic helpers (maids) seems certain to add to labour supply pressures among young people. The government is now considering how to mobilise its large population base, abundant natural resources and strategic location to play a greater role in the world economy. These assets are central to the ambitious 'Master Plan' for longer-term development (2011-25), announced in May. It focuses on developing the resource-rich Outer Island regions, with massive investments in energy and 'connectivity' to link the major centres and islands with each other, and centres with their hinterlands. Funding (to come mainly from the private sector), implementation and coordination are all major challenges.","[Manning, Chris] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Purnagunawan, Raden M.] Padjadjaran State Univ, Bandung, Indonesia",Australian National University; Universitas Padjadjaran,"Manning, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,33,17,17,1,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

One of the objectives of the research is to know if movies as cultural products have certain role in, and power over, the nation culture building. Those involved in the movie-making: producers, directors, actors and actresses, and the necessary technology, are chosen as subjects of this research, beside some supporting actors/players such as government agency (censorship institution), cinema owner, and movie-critics. The methodology used as the analysis instrument is discourse analysis, which is a qualitative analysis. The research method consist of background literature, movie-related document research, and interviews. From total 737 movies over period 20 years, these quantitative data are processed and classified into 2 categories. The primary data gathered interviews with 13 informants, namely movie makers, actors, and government agencies. Bourdieu's theory of habitus and capital, are used in this analysis. The research result shows that the dynamic of Indonesian movies after the Reformation Era is colored with theme varieties, innovation, and the reduction of government involvement. Dominations and power now are at the hands of producers who have higher or stronger cultural capital. Rooms for free expressions after the Reformation Era have been pioneered by the independent communities with their indie movies. Hence, a good culture strategy can actually make possible the building of the desired national culture through movies.","[Manurung, Elvy Maria] Parahyangan Catholic Univ, Bandung, Indonesia",Universitas Katolik Parahyangan,"Manurung, EM (通讯作者)，Parahyangan Catholic Univ, Bandung, Indonesia.",elvymaria@unpar.ac.id,"Manurung, Elvy Maria/AFQ-1704-2022; Manurung, Elvy Maria/AAU-3093-2021","Manurung, Elvy Maria/0000-0001-5047-0973",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9175-6,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,14.0,,,,,,102,106,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392896300019,0

This paper uses unique district level data on landmine contamination intensity in Cambodia combined with survey data on individuals to evaluate the long-run impact of Cambodia's 30 years of war (1970-1998) on education levels and earnings. These effects are identified using difference-in-differences (DD) and instrumental variables (IV) estimators. In the DD framework I exploit two sources of variation in an individual's exposure to the conflict: age in 1970 and landmine contamination intensity in the district of residence. The IV specification uses the distance to the Thai border as an exogenous source of variation in landmine contamination intensity. The most conservative result indicates that individuals who were too young to have attended school before the start of the war received on average 0.5 less years of education. And, immediately after the war there was no visible effect on earnings. The effects are therefore overall weak. I argue that the destruction of physical capital may be what contributes to drive down the returns to education in Cambodia post-war.

The model has been presented during a case study analysis.","[Motadel, Mohammadreza; Afshar-Kazemi, Mohammadali] Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Ind Management Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Toloie-Eshlaghy, Abbas] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Ind Management Dept, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Motadel, M (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Ind Management Dept, Tehran, Iran.",Dr.Motadel@yahoo.com; afshinafshar44@gmail.com; toloie@gmail.com,"Motadel, Mohammadreza/AAW-7996-2021; Toloie Eshlaghy, Abbas Toloie/AAW-9665-2021","Toloie Eshlaghy, Abbas Toloie/0000-0001-6050-1016",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9175-6,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,14.0,,,,,,202,208,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8ZN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392896300036,0

The most prevalent of these anomalies appear to be weekend effect, where stocks exhibit significantly lower returns over the period between Friday's close and Monday's close (French 1980, Lakonishok and Levi 1982, keim and Stambaugh 1984); a January effect, where returns are unusually high during the month of January as compared to any other month (Rozeff and Kinney 1976, Reinganum 1983); and a Holiday effect, where returns are much higher on trading days immediately prior to holidays (Ariel 1990, Kim and Park 1994). The other irregularities include monthly effect (Ariel 1987), turn-of-the month effect (Lakonishok and Smidt 1988) and relatively less documented Friday-the-thirteenth effect (Kolb and Rodriguez 1987). The anomalies mentioned above have originally been documented for the US market and its empirical confirmation and extension has now taken place to other capital markets mostly in developed world. In spite of these phenomena appearing in different markets around the world, there still remain people who believe that some of the irregularities are artifacts caused by institutional factors such as ex-dividend, tax and liquidity effects (Bowers and Dimson 1988). Hence, one's belief regarding the true market anomalies would be strengthened if it is known to occur also in other capital markets of developing economies which are characterized by separate cultures and institutional arrangements. Thus, it is of interest to search whether such anomalies exist for a developing market such as one in India. In fact very little empirical research on calendar anomalies has been undertaken on security market using Indian data. Chaudhury (1991) studied BSE Sensei between June 1988 and January 1990 and found that average return on Monday is negative and highest returns are on Friday. Poshakwale (1996) studied BSE National Index and found that mean return except for Monday and Wednesday are positive. Arumugam (1998) investigated the day-of-the week effect on stock return for a longer time series (April 1979 to March 1997) and used the dummy variable regression model used in international studies. He divided the data set for different sub-periods and also for bull and bear phases of the market. Friday returns are found to be significantly positive in all periods except the sub-periods 1979-85. bull and bear phases. While Monday returns are significantly negative in the bear phase, they are significantly positive in the bull phase, and become insignificant in other periods. Though the results are the first comprehensive analysis of the 'day-of-the week' effect in Indian markets, the study deals with only one aspect of market anomalies. The present study, which deals with different aspects of market anomalies using BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty market returns.","[Selvakumar, D.

It departs from the previous empirical literature on aid and resource mobilisation by abandoning the pervasive, but untenable, assumption that aid either displaces domestic saving (increases consumption) or increases investment. Some aid is, in fact, used to finance reverse flows (debt servicing, capital flight, and reserve accumulation). The evidence suggests that, for the period covering 1980 to 2006, nearly 50 per cent of aid to Sub-Saharan African countries was used to finance reverse flows.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Serieux, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, 501 Fletcher Argue Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada.",serieux@cc.umanitoba.ca,"Serieux, John/AAF-8966-2021","Serieux, John/0000-0002-1606-6042",,,,,27,7,8,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

In order to implement MS adoption successfully, it is important to consider the quality of information used throughout the adoption process, which seriously impacts the effectiveness of MS adoption practice and the optimization of AIS adoption decisions. There is a growing need for research to provide insights into issues and solutions related to Information Quality (IQ) in MS adoption. The need for an integrated approach to improve IQ dimensions in AIS adoption, as well as the unique characteristics of accounting data, demands an AIS adoption specific IQ framework. Thus, this study aims to investigate the IQ dimensions revealed in the implementation of AIS to enhance firm performance. This research was conducted with 32 respondents at six organisations within manufacturing firms in Thailand. The findings of the research's empirical evidence suggest that organisations should understand appropriate IQ dimensions for MS adoption and provide assistance in all processes of decision making.","[Wongsim, Manirath; Gao, Jing] Univ S Australia, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia",University of South Australia,,Manirath.Wongsim@postgrads.unisa.edu.au; Jing.Gao@unisa.edu.au,"Gao, Jing/AAQ-1859-2021","wongsim, manirath/0000-0003-1380-5636",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,432,442,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000040,0

The authors applied the traditional (Engle-Granger) and the standardised (Enders & Siklos) Dickey-Fuller procedures to test for cointegration and asymmetry in price transmission. Four competing models, namely the Engle-Granger (EG), Threshold Autoregressive (TAR), Momentum Threshold Autoregressive (M-TAR), and Momentum Consistent Threshold Autoregressive (MC-TAR) models, were fitted. Following the application of a standard model selection criterion, the MC-TAR was chosen as the best. The following results were obtained: price transmission between producer and retail prices is asymmetric; the direction of causation runs from producer to retail prices; retailers correct about 2 per cent of the negative and 4 per cent of positive disequilibria every month; and it takes fewer months for negative shocks than positive shocks to be eliminated. In general, the results suggest that retailers respond more quickly to shocks that stretch their market margin than to those that squeeze it. This is typical of positive asymmetric price transmission. We attribute this to the anticompetitive behaviour that characterises the food market chain.","[Alemu, Z.

Does the empirical evidence bear out such predictions? This article explores the dynamics of selection and reallocation through an investigation of the relations linking productivity, profitability and growth at the firm level. Exploiting large panels of Italian and French industrial firms, we find that heterogeneity in efficiencies primarily yields persistent profitability differentials, whereas the relationships of corporate growth with either productivity or profitability appear much weaker, if at all existent. This suggests that selection forces are much less strong than usually assumed. The results robustly apply across different industrial sectors and across the two countries.","[Bottazzi, Giulio; Dosi, Giovanni; Tamagni, Federico] LEM Scuola Super St Anna, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Jacoby, Nadia] Univ Paris 01, CES Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Secchi, Angelo] Univ Pisa, Dipartmento Sci Econ, Fac Sci Polit, I-56125 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; University of Pisa,"Bottazzi, G (通讯作者)，LEM Scuola Super St Anna, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",bottazzi@sssup.it; gdosi@sssup.it; Nadia.Jacoby@univ-paris1.fr; angelo.secchi@sp.unipi.it; f.tamagni@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020; DOSI, GIOVANNI/B-9587-2014","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388; Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732; DOSI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-0126-9349",,,,,45,71,79,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Using the Nelson-Siegel model of the yield curve as inspiration, we estimate an extremely parsimonious state-space model of interest rates across time and maturity. The time-series process suggests a specific functional form for the yield curve. We use the Kalman filter to estimate the time-series process jointly with observed yield curves, greatly improving empirical identification. Our stochastic process generates a three-factor model for the term structure. At the estimated parameters, trend and slope factors matter while the third factor is empirically unimportant. Our baseline model fits the yield curve well. Model generated estimates of uncertainty are positively correlated with estimated term premia. An extension of the model with regime switching identifies a high-variance regime and a low-variance regime, where the high-variance regime occurs rarely after the mid-1980s. The term premium is higher, and more so for yields of short maturities, in the high-variance regime than in the low-variance regime. The estimation results support our model as a simple and yet reliable framework for modeling the term structure.","[Startz, Richard; Tsang, Kwok Ping] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Startz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",startz@u.washington.edu; byront@vt.edu,,"Tsang, Kwok Ping/0000-0002-0045-6185",,,,,13,4,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This paper presents findings from an empirical study of trip distances travelled for three purposes (work, maintenance, leisure). The study was conducted in the region of Cologne, and the analysis is based on structural equation modelling. The results indicate that, in general, neither lifestyles nor location preferences have a strong impact on trip distances, except for leisure activities: here lifestyle has the strongest impact of all variables studied. Maintenance trip distances are significantly affected by the spatial setting in which people live, indicating the relevance of the built environment for this travel segment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It achieves this by employing panel data for 80 countries that cover 1976-2007. International capital inflow is broken down into foreign direct investments (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments (FPI). We find interesting evidence that only FDI has a positive effect on growth and that FPI has an unfavorable, if not negative, effect on growth. The conditional variables of banking liberalization, high-income level, twin crises, lower corruption, and human capital mitigate the positive impacts of FDI on growth. In contrast, the middle-income level and good shareholder protection have a positive effect. As concerns FPI, the level of financial liberalization, being in a Latin American region, the wealth of countries, and market governance all influence the way that FPI affects growth, whereas the conditional variables of twin crises and human capital do not influence the effect of FPI on economic growth.","[Shen, Chung-Hua] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lee, Chi-Chuan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Sun Yat Sen University; National Chengchi University,"Shen, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020; Lee, Chi-Chuan/AAD-2211-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347; Lee, Chi-Chuan/0000-0003-0644-1168",,,,,72,33,38,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Grounded in agency theory, we argue that multiple directorships affect the quality of managerial oversight and thus influence agency conflicts in acquisition decisions. We show that acquiring firms where directors hold more outside board seats experience more negative abnormal returns. This adverse effect, nonetheless, does not extend across the entire range of multiple directorships. Rather, the detrimental impact is significant only when the number of outside board seats surpasses a certain threshold. We interpret this result as suggesting that directors serving on multiple boards allow value-destroying acquisitions when they become too busy beyond a certain point, and the effect of directors' busyness on acquisition performance appears to be nonlinear. We employ several alternative definitions of directors' busyness and obtain consistent results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the high concentration of Greek equity portfolios imposes a substantial return and utility loss which is further increased when the lack of international diversification is taken into account. Restricting the weight of equities to 23% of the total portfolio, leads to sub-optimal asset allocation that costs as much as 2% (3%) per annum compared to a balanced domestic (global) benchmark.

Efficiency is defined in terms of the excess profits associated with different trading strategies, where excess is defined relative to a dynamic buy and hold benchmark in order to make a clean separation between trading gains and market gains. We define an Inefficiency matrix that takes into account the difference in excess profits of one trading strategy versus another (signal) relative to the standard error of those profits (noise) and use this statistical measure to gauge the degree of market efficiency. A one-parameter family of trading strategies is considered, the value of the parameter measuring the relative informational advantage of one strategy versus another. Efficiency is then investigated in terms of the composition of the market defined in terms of the relative proportions of traders using a particular strategy and the parameter values associated with the strategies. We show that markets are more efficient when informational advantages are small (small signal) and when there are many coexisting signals. Learning is introduced by considering copycat traders that learn the relative values of the different strategies in the market and copy the most successful one. We show how such learning leads to a more informationally efficient market but can also lead to a less efficient market as measured in terms of excess profits. It is also shown how the presence of exogeneous information shocks that change trader expectations increases efficiency and complicates the inference problem of copycats. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When taking the shares of respondents who took both the environmental and the cost attributes (52-69% of the respondents) into account, then the WTP for each attribute changes if the respondents who ignored the attributes have a zero WTP. At the same time, we find evidence that not all respondents who claimed to have ignored an attribute really did. However, the most commonly ignored non-monetary attributes always have the lowest rankings in terms of WTP across all three environmental objectives. Thus, our results show that instead of ignoring attributes completely, respondents seem to put less weight on the attributes they claimed to have ignored.","[Carlsson, Fredrik; Lampi, Elina] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kataria, Mitesh] Max Planck Inst Econ, D-7745 Jena, Germany",University of Gothenburg; Max Planck Society,"Carlsson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.carlsson@economics.gu.se; kataria@econ.mpg.de; elina.lampi@economics.gu.se,"Carlsson, Fredrik/E-3734-2010","Carlsson, Fredrik/0000-0003-4789-8009",,,,,36,105,112,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The measurement of the unobservable volatility risk premium rests on a simple garch model, which generates the parameters of the volatility process under the physical measure and produces paths of future volatilities. whose averages represent the realized volatility forecasts. Results show that interest rate volatility has embodied a large - negative - compensation for volatility risk, in line with other studies focusing on different asset classes. We also document that the volatility risk premium has exhibited a term structure across the analyzed maturity spectrum and that it has changed through time, but much less than risk neutral volatilities. Compensation for volatility risk is positively related to risk neutral volatility, although the relation is not completely linear, and it is influenced, as expected, by the level of the short term rate and its realized volatility. Also a small but robust number of macroeconomic surprises affect compensation for volatility risk, with macroeconomic uncertainty in one country spilling over to other currencies.

The results show that state-dependent pricing is clearly present in a low-inflation environment and that variables measuring the current situation of the firm, especially costs for intermediate products, are important determinants of price adjustments. Compared to purely time-dependent features, the state-dependent variables significantly add to the explanatory power of a price adjustment probability model. Macroeconomic factors are significant but contribute little in terms of the goodness of fit. Furthermore, when taking into account sticky plan models by excluding possibly predetermined price changes, the importance of state-dependent factors becomes even greater. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that credit ratings are lower and yield spreads higher for firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power. To further investigate why bondholders are concerned about CEO power, we show that powerful CEOs tend to maintain an opaque information environment. Bondholders demand higher yields because it is difficult for them to monitor managers in firms with powerful CEOs.

The allocation adds up to the total capital of the firm (a result echoing findings in the congestion pricing literature-where optimal tolls exactly cover the rental cost of the highway). The allocation follows each consumer's share of recoveries in states of insurer default, weighted by the severity of the default in terms of welfare impact.

Frontier efficiency analysis is used to devise an alternative indicator of competition and rank European countries by their dispersion from a competition frontier.

The article operates with four forms of work organization (discretionary learning, lean production, Taylorism, and simple or traditional). Through a factor analysis three dimensions of national labor market systems (flexible security, passive security, and job support) are defined. Using a multi-level logistic regression model that takes into account both characteristics of individuals and of national labor market systems it is shown that there is a significant positive correlation between flexible security and the prevalence of discretionary learning. On this basis we point to an extension of flexible security in Europe's labor markets as an adequate response to the current crisis.","[Holm, Jacob R.; Lundvall, Bengt-Ake] Univ Aalborg, Dept Business Studies, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Lorenz, Edward] Univ Nice, CNRS, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Valeyre, Antoine] Ctr Maurice Halbwachs, CNRS, F-75014 Paris, France",Aalborg University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Holm, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Aalborg, Dept Business Studies, Fibigerstr 4, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",jrh@business.aau.dk; edward.lorenz@gredeg.cnrs.fr; bal@business.aau.dk; antoine.valeyre@ens.fr,"Holm, Jacob Rubæk/H-9402-2017","Holm, Jacob Rubæk/0000-0003-1110-1918; Lundvall, Bengt-Ake/0000-0001-7465-4881",,,,,31,37,39,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In this paper, we consider this decision-making process in the context of a model in which inflation forecast targeting is used, but there is heterogeneity among the members of the committee. We find that rational partisan theory can explain spatial voting behavior under forecast uncertainty about the output gap. Internally generated forecasts of output and market-generated expectations of medium-term inflation provide the best description of discrete changes in interest rates, in combination with uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. There is also a role for developments in asset, housing and labor markets. Further, spatial voting patterns clearly differentiate between internally and externally apzpointed members of the MPC.

A broad efficiency comparison of 6462 insurers from 36 countries is conducted. Different methodologies, countries, organizational forms, and company sizes are compared, considering life and non-life insurers. We find a steady technical and cost efficiency growth in international insurance markets from 2002 to 2006, with large differences across countries. Denmark and Japan have the highest average efficiency, whereas the Philippines is the least efficient. Regarding organizational form, the results are not consistent with the expense preference hypothesis, which claims that mutuals should be less efficient than stocks due to higher agency costs. Only minor variations are found when comparing different frontier efficiency methodologies (data envelopment analysis, stochastic frontier analysis). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, the R&D stock has a significant positive impact on labor productivity; this general result is largely consistent with previous literature in terms of the sign, the significance, and the magnitude of the estimated coefficients. More interestingly, both at sectoral and firm levels the R&D coefficient increases monotonically (both in significance and magnitude) when we move from the low-tech to the medium- and high-tech sectors. This outcome means that corporate R&D investment is more effective in the high-tech sectors and this may need to be taken into account when designing policy instruments (subsidies, fiscal incentives, etc.) in support of private R&D. However, R&D investment is not the sole source of productivity gains; technological change embodied in gross investment is of comparable importance on aggregate and is the main determinant of productivity increase in the low-tech sectors. Hence, an economic policy aiming to increase productivity in the low-tech sectors should support overall capital formation.","[Ortega-Argiles, Raquel; Potters, Lesley; Vivarelli, Marco] European Commiss, JRC, IPTS, Seville, Spain; [Piva, Mariacristina; Vivarelli, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy; [Potters, Lesley] Utrecht Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vivarelli, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Vivarelli, Marco] Inst Study Labour IZA, Bonn, Germany",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Utrecht University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Ortega-Argilés, R (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, IPTS, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville, Spain.",Ortega-Argiles.RAQUEL@ec.europa.eu; mariacristina.piva@unicatt.it; Lesley.POTTERS@ec.europa.eu; marco.vivarelli@unicatt.it,"Vivarelli, Marco/AFM-1199-2022; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023","Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0001-8982-2163; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0002-8746-9324; PIVA, Mariacristina/0000-0002-3347-8946; VIVARELLI, MARCO/0000-0003-0500-9461",,,,,49,53,55,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

We find that the poor's nutrient intake responds asymmetrically to declines and increases in cereal prices, and that the asymmetric response of their fat intake may be due to habit formation. Our results also imply that introducing cereal price subsidies can increase their total energy intake by increasing their calorie intake from fat and protein, while ending such subsidies would insignificantly affect their total energy intake, but further increase their calorie intake from fat and protein.

We find that linear trends are present in 17 of the 30 industry volatilities. Granger-causality tests reveal that the industry of business supplies and the industry of finance are the most important lead indicators of industry volatilities. To uncover contemporaneous causal relationships in the market, we implement an emerging data-driven method of directed acyclic graphs. The results suggest that volatility shocks originating from business supplies, machinery, and consumer goods industries are sources of risks that affect most other industries. By contrast, volatilities in the two traditionally important industries, oil and autos, do not appear to have a substantial influence on other large industries in the contemporaneous time. Finally, business equipment and services, both containing information technology components, are the most important driving forces of the industry volatility surge in the late 1990s.

Optimal debt levels consistent with those observed in practice emerge without relying on frictions such as moral hazard or asymmetric information.

The results indicate that vegetarian diet has a central role within the wider concern for healthy food, endorsing arguments to support the assertion. Hence, propensities in the consumer concerns to turn to healthier diets were identified, based on a system that diminishes or eliminates meat based diets.

Proponents of this practice argue that it is essential to hire and retain star performers. Detractors argue that the temptation for abuse is high, and the practice should be banned. Our analysis based on various performance metrics shows that side-by-side mutual fund managers significantly outperform peer funds, consistent with this privilege being granted primarily to star performers. Interestingly, side-by-side hedge fund managers are at best on par with their style category peers, casting further doubt on the idea that conflicts of interest undermine mutual fund investors.

Our study is a secondary analysis of the data provided by the special EB 69.1 Eurobarometer on the topic of, Consumer Protection on the Domestic Market (Euopean Commission, 2008). We focused on aspects connected to the Romanian consumer: the ascribed factors which influence the purchasing decision related to gender, age, level of education, residence, the level of protection felt by the consumer, ways of consumers' protection as they are seen by the consumers themselves, the mechanism of safety product assessment done by the consumers. From the data analysis in the present study we concluded that numerous Romanian consumers do not know the laws and the institutions entitled to protect their rights, but are discontent regarding the manner their rights are observed; they have as a main purchasing criterion the price; the producers take advantage of the lack of information and attitude of the consumers regarding their rights; and the consumers, lacking a suitable education, remain only at the level of discontent, of not trusting the possibility of their rights being respected, which in its turn causes a low level of self-protection. In these conditions we consider necessary the systematic education of the consumers as well as producers regarding the quality, the safety of the marketed products, of the attitude regarding the disobedience of the producers/suppliers for the regulations in this area, doubled by an increased interest from the authorities for consumer protection and a manifestation of individual or associative civic sense.","[Stefanescu, Florica; Baltatescu, Sergiu] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Stefanescu, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania.",florica.stefanescu@gmail.com,"Stefanescu, Florica/AEQ-0669-2022; Bălțătescu, Sergiu/A-3535-2009","Bălțătescu, Sergiu/0000-0003-3610-3004",,,,,23,3,3,0,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,297,313,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000003,0

The demand for excess reserves is determined by precautionary factors and the opportunity cost of holding cash. It is argued that excess liquidity may impart greater stickiness to the deposit rate in response to a monetary contraction and induce an easing of collateral requirements on borrowers - which in turn may translate into a lower risk premium and lower lending rates. As a result, asymmetric bank pricing behavior under excess liquidity may hamper the ability of a contractionary monetary policy to lower inflation.

We find that the likelihood of multiple banking is the highest for SMEs in French-civil-law countries, next highest for German-civil-law countries, and the lowest in Scandinavian-civil-law and English-common-law countries. We also find that SMEs in countries with low legal efficiency are more likely to establish multiple bank relationships. These results seems to confirm the underlying idea in the law and finance literature that relevant loan risk for banks also arises from low quality of laws and institutions and not just from firm-specific characteristics. Banks in countries where protection of creditor rights is poor may resort to multiple banking to share this additional risk. Policy makers can use our findings to justify the necessity of improving their institutions by reducing legal formalisms and thereby, lowering the enforcement costs in the courts. This would lead to better loan contracting and enhance the flow of debt capital, which is required for a healthy and dynamic economy.","[Koeter-Kant, Johanna] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hernandez-Canovas, Gines] Tech Univ Cartagena, Murcia, Spain",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Koëter-Kant, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jkoeter@feweb.vu.nl,"Hernandez-Canovas, Gines/H-4829-2015","Hernandez-Canovas, Gines/0000-0001-7654-0714",,,,,31,9,11,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using the framework of an infinitely repeated game with discounting, we show that interlinked contracts can help the dominant parties to collude, in cases where collusion is not possible with noninterlinked contracts. This occurs because either interlinkage pools incentive constraints across markets, or it affects the incentives of agents to accept deviating contracts. We illustrate these mechanisms by considering the case of interlinkage between markets for credit and share tenancy. The model that is used to formalize the second mechanism is characterized by frictions in the tenancy market, which we model using the standard framework of search and matching.","[Motiram, Sripad] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Motiram, S (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen AK Vaidya Marg,Goregaon E, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",sripad@igidr.ac.in; jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We analyze unbalanced panel data from 139,922 firms belonging to the Spanish manufacturing and service industries between 1994 and 2002. The results show that small firms grow faster than large firms. The evidence supports the proposition that market structure affects the capacity of firms to grow. In particular, small firms in service industries do not grow as quickly as small firms in manufacturing industries. This is mainly due to the lower medium efficient size (MES) in the service industries diminishing the incentives to grow and the positive effect of MES on the speed of convergence.","Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Teruel-Carrizosa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain.",mercedes.teruel@urv.cat,"Teruel, Mercedes/K-1355-2017","Teruel, Mercedes/0000-0002-4104-7679",,,,,54,46,50,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We provide a framework in which agents, in an asset pricing model, underparameterize their forecasting model in a spirit similar to Hong, Stein, and Yu (2007) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), except that the parameters of the forecasting model and the choice of predictor are determined jointly in equilibrium. We show that multiple equilibria can exist even if agents choose only models that maximize (risk-adjusted) expected profits. A real-time learning formulation yields endogenous switching between equilibria. We demonstrate that a real-time learning version of the model, calibrated to U.S. stock data, is capable of reproducing regime-switching returns and volatilities, as recently identified by Guidolin and Timmermann (2007).

To this end, we develop a simple model of moral hazard that takes the soft budget constraint into account. Within this moral hazard environment, we show that investment is positively related to the amount of internal funds. We further show that the presence of the soft budget constraint deteriorates the moral hazard problem, thereby making the investment level less sensitive to the amount of internal funds. This is the case irrespective of whether the soft budget constraint renders the firm more or less liquidity constrained. To test the model's empirical implications, we employ data of China's listed companies for the period from 1997 to 2003. We use the share of state ownership as a proxy for the severity of the soft budget constraint. We find strong evidence that firms with larger shares of state ownership exhibit lower investment-cash flow sensitivities than firms with smaller shares of state ownership. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This important question cannot be adequately answered if framing effects, nonlinear probability weighting, and heterogeneity of preference types are neglected. We show that the observed increase in relative risk aversion over gains cannot be captured by the curvature of the value function. Rather, it is predominantly driven by a change in probability weighting of a majority group of individuals who weight probabilities of high gains more conservatively. Contrary to gains, no coherent change in relative risk aversion is observed for losses. These results not only challenge expected utility theory, but also prospect theory.","[Fehr-Duda, Helga; Bruhin, Adrian; Epper, Thomas; Schubert, Renate] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Econ, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Fehr-Duda, H (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Econ, Weinbergstr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",fehr@econ.gess.ethz.ch,,,,,,,69,69,76,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

With logarithmic utility functions, this separation holds for any heterogeneity in discount factors, while the generalization to constant relative risk aversion holds only for homogeneous discount factors but allows for any heterogeneity in endowments. The logarithmic case provides a general equilibrium foundation for the growth-optimal portfolio literature. Both cases yield equilibrium asset pricing formulas that allow for investor heterogeneity, in which the return process is endogenous and asset prices are determined by expected discounted relative dividends. Our results have simple asset pricing implications for the time series as well as the cross section of relative asset prices. It is found that on data from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a risk aversion smaller than in the logarithmic case fits best.","[Gerber, Anke] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Hens, Thorsten] Swiss Finance Inst, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hens, Thorsten] Swiss Banking Inst, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hens, Thorsten] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5042 Bergen, Norway; [Woehrmann, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Hamburg; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Gerber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",anke.gerber@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; thens@isb.uzh.ch; pwoehrmann@ethz.ch,,"Hens, Thorsten/0000-0002-0266-1561",,,,,57,0,0,0,14,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The analysis is based on the integration of two government databases and a matched-pair framework for comparing casualty rates under different weather conditions for 10 Canadian cities. The most notable result is a downward trend in relative risk during rainfall from 1984 to 2002 - both overall and when further disaggregated by injury severity combined with precipitation amount, city group, and time of day. By contrast, the overall relative risk of casualty during snowfall shows no significant change over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This result suggests that problems associated with having numerous banks in distress simultaneously during the Depression may have exacerbated the number of banks closed and the economic downturn.","Fed Reserve, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Carlson, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve, Board Governors, 20th & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Mark.A.Carlson@frb.gov,,"Carlson, Mark/0000-0002-9261-9702",,,,,34,5,5,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We first present a simple theoretical model based on lacoviello (2004) and Luengo-Prado (2006), explicitly considering the dual role of housing and linking credit constraints to the behavior of consumption in a pair of aggregate Euler equations. We then estimate a threshold regression model and find that LC-PIH holds only under the unconstrained regime. More importantly, durable consumption exhibit a very strong asymmetric effect in response to changes in house prices, while other categories of consumption do not exhibit this asymmetry.
