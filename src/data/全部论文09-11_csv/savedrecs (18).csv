The results for the large economy resemble those of the original Poole scenario and also extend to the welfare measure. In particular, an interest rate rule is preferable to a money supply rule when liquidity shocks dominate, whereas a money supply rule fares better with real shocks. For the small open economy, the stabilization properties of the large-economy case continue to hold for domestic shocks, but a money supply rule performs better than an interest rate rule using the welfare measure. If shocks originate in the foreign economy, a money supply rule turns out to be superior both in terms of its stabilization properties as well as in terms of welfare.","[Hoffmann, Mathias] Deutsch Bundesbank Cent Off, Dept Econ, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hoffmann, Mathias] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Kempa, Bernd] Univ Munster, Dept Econ, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Munster,"Hoffmann, M (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank Cent Off, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",mathias.hoffmann@bundesbank.de; bernd.kempa@uni-muenster.de,"Kempa, Bernd/ABG-7880-2020",,,,,,25,2,2,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

J,"Leith, C; Wren-Lewis, S",,,,"Leith, Campbell; Wren-Lewis, Simon",,,Taylor rules in the open economy,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Taylor rules; Inflation targeting; Interest rate rules,OPTIMAL MONETARY-POLICY; EXCHANGE-RATE; FISCAL-POLICY; INFLATION; DYNAMICS; EMU,"Taylor rules, which link short-term interest rates to fluctuations in inflation and Output, have been shown to be a good guide (both positively and normatively) to the conduct of monetary policy. As a result they have been used extensively to model policy in the context of both closed and open economy models. Their determinacy properties have also been analysed in the context of closed and, to a more limited degree, in small open economy models. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the determinacy properties of Taylor rules to the case of a benchmark two-country model. When the rules are specified in terms of output-price inflation we confirm and extend the conventional results from the closed economy literature-satisfying the Taylor principle is the key to ensuring determinacy, although the presence of backward-looking price-setting can affect the determinacy properties of the two-country model. However, the conventional results do not hold when we replace output-price inflation with consumer price inflation in the specification of the rule, In this case, Taylor rules which satisfy the Taylor principle will be indeterminate, unless there is an unusually large home bias ill consumption. Similar indeterminacy problems arise when one Country targets CPI inflation and the other output-price inflation. In this case we show that, even if determinacy is achieved, large spillovers may occur between countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, prices reveal different information depending on whether trades are direct or though vehicle currencies. Second, missing markets arise due to insufficiently symmetric information, rather than insufficient transactions scale. Third, the indeterminacy of equilibrium that arises in traditional models is resolved: currency trade patterns no longer concentrate arbitrarily on market size. Empirically, we provide a first analysis of transactions across a full market triangle: the euro, yen and US dollar. The estimated transaction effects on prices support the information approach.

In the absence of regulation we identify the market conditions under which a monopolist decides to invest early as well as the overall welfare generated by this decision. In a regulated environment, we consider a vertically integrated network provider that is required to provide access to downstream competitors and compare two distinct access pricing methodologies: the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (ECPR) and the Option to Delay Pricing Rule (ODPR). We identify the welfare-maximizing access prices using the unregulated market output as a benchmark and show that optimal access regulation depends on market conditions (that is, the nature of demand) with two possible outcomes: (i) access prices that provide a positive payoff to the incumbent, that is, provide a positive compensation to account for the option to delay; and (ii) access prices that yield a zero payoff to the incumbent. Moreover, unlike the earlier literature that argues in favor of an ECPR-type methodology to account for the interaction between irreversibility and demand uncertainty, we find that, except under very specific conditions, an access price that accounts for the option to delay value is welfare-superior to the ECPR.","[Camacho, Fernando T.; Menezes, Flavio M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Menezes, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",f.menezes@uq.edu.au,"Menezes, Flavio/L-4434-2019","Menezes, Flavio/0000-0003-0889-9551",,,,,10,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In a 'strong no-power' design persistently competitive outcomes are observed in markets with three or four sellers. Even duopolies are frequently competitive in this design. Unilateral market power raises prices, as predicted. However, static Nash predictions fail to organize outcomes across power treatments, because tacit collusion moves inversely with concentration.

Health is produced with inputs of market goods and services and the own time of the consumer. Health is demanded not only because it is an argument in the utility function but also because it determines the amount of time available for market and nonmarket production. The latter motive points to health capital as one component of the stock of human capital. The economics of the household has much to say about the determinants of investment in this type of capital. The five health economics papers in this issue of Review of Economics of the Household are connected by an emphasis on the role of time in the production of two aspects of health: obesity and the general health of elderly persons.,"[Grossman, Michael] CUNY, Ph Program Econ, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Anderson, Richard] New Jersey City Univ, Dept Econ, Jersey City, NJ 07305 USA; [Anderson, Richard] Stevens Inst Technol, Howe Sch Technol Management, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Grossman, Michael] Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Stevens Institute of Technology; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Grossman, M (通讯作者)，CUNY, Ph Program Econ, Grad Ctr, 365 Fifth Ave,5th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA.",randerson@njcu.edu; mgrossman@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,20,11,11,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We show that, in contrast to the common notion (e.g. [Bovenberg, A.L., Smulders, S., 1996. Transitional impacts of environmental policy in an endogenous growth model. International Economic Review 37, 861-893] and [Bovenberg, A.L., de Mooij, R.A., 1997. Environmental tax reform and endogenous growth. journal of Public Economics 63, 207-237]), the existence of an environmental production externality is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for environmental policies to stimulate economic growth if the labor-leisure choice is endogenously determined. In particular, since there are complementarities between public abatement and private abatement, the public abatement expenditure will have a more powerful enhancing effect on economic growth when it is accompanied by more efficient private abatement. This result also leads to a corollary to the effect that it is easier to achieve double dividends in terms of enhancing both growth and welfare if the endogenous labor-leisure choice is taken into account. In our dynamic analysis, we show that if public abatement is substantially large, dynamic indeterminacy may occur despite the absence of a positive labor externality and interestingly, this is more likely to be the case when abatement labor plays a more significant role. Besides, the transitional effects of an increase in public abatement are also investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A cross-country panel data analysis China's economy grew at an average annual rate of 9% over the last three decades. Despite the vast empirical literature on testing the neoclassical model of economic growth using data on various groups of countries, very few cross-country regressions include China and none of them particularly focuses on the explanation of China's remarkable economic growth. We attempt to fill this gap by utilising panel data on 146 countries over the period 1980-2004 to examine the extent to which the rapid growth of China and the huge gap in the growth rate between China and other countries can be explained by the augmented Solow model. Using system GMM estimation techniques, we find that, in spite of the restrictive assumptions involved, the Solow model augmented by both human capital and structural change provides a fairly good account of international variation in economic growth. In particular, China's relative success in economic growth is due to high physical capital investment, conditional convergence gain, dramatic changes in the structure of employment and output, and low population growth.

In particular, we are interested in the existence of mechanisms with zero probability of war. Here, we focus on situations where the countries' payoffs to war are interdependent or correlated and where efficient settlements are not required but subsidies are unavailable. Most importantly, countries can choose to go to war at any time and can use information learned from the negotiation process in making this choice. We characterize the conditions under which no peaceful mechanisms exist and discuss how weakening our war consistency condition can change this result.","[Fey, Mark] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Ramsay, Kristopher W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Rochester; Princeton University,"Fey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",mark.fey@rochester.edu; kramsay@princeton.edu,,"Fey, Mark/0000-0002-6773-6579",,,,,47,8,12,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

The problem differs from the conventionally assumed growth setups because one considers that expectations concerning the next period value of the control variable (consumption) are formed through adaptive learning. In such scenario, the found stability conditions reveal that convergence to the unique steady state point is feasible if a minimum requirement regarding the quality of learning in the long run equilibrium is fulfilled.

The modeling of conjectures captures the role played by beliefs in a micro-founded model. So, the economy may have three kinds of symmetric general equilibria. Furthermore, these equilibria can be Pareto-ranked by the conjectural variation parameter. Finally, we consider the implementation of a tax on the strategic behaviors in case of balanced-budget rule. The comparative statics illustrates the idea according to which the effectiveness of the multiplier mechanism to mitigate the market distortions depends on the symmetric equilibrium considered. Therefore, the effect of the tax on the prices and economic activity depends on the degree of market power which is conjectured by the agents. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Partial factor productivity demonstrates that 3 of the 4 Brazilian mobile operators, Vivo, TIM and Oi, have remarkable productivity ratios, and that the state-owned operator, China Unicom, has the highest revenue per capital expenditure among BRIC operators.

I use a sample of municipalities from the Spanish region of Catalonia during the six terms of office taken place during the 1980-2002 time range. I hypothesize a dynamic neighboring effect, which is not rejected by the data: in a first phase (early eighties), water privatization is more likely in regions where there is no previous privatization; in a second phase (nineties), the opposite happens. The way other factors influence the privatization decision also evolve during the two decades under study, from a priority to fix old infrastructures to a concern about service efficiency. Budgetary shortfalls seem to encourage privatization only in times of huge economic struggle. The political sign of the government may influence the mode-of-production decision if there is no consensus about the most efficient one.","[Miralles Asensio, Antonio] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Miralles Asensio, Antonio] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",Boston University; University of Barcelona,"Asensio, AM (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,,,,,,35,22,22,0,11,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

The Optimal Choice of Monetary Policy Instruments in a Simple Macro Model. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84,192-216.], studies how differently monetary and fiscal shocks influence the appropriate choice of the monetary policy regime. Velocity shocks are introduced by embedding a stochastic cash-in-advance constraint within the New Keynesian framework. In addition to optimal policy under discretion, three classic rules, interest rate targeting, monetary targeting, and the Taylor rule are ranked under both fiscal and velocity shocks. The non-stationarity of prices under the Taylor rule makes it inferior to the other rules under which prices are stationary. Monetary targeting, by stabilizing aggregate demand under fiscal shocks, outperforms interest rate targeting, while the latter provides a better insulation against velocity shocks. Monetary targeting (under fiscal shocks) and interest rate targeting (under velocity shocks) even outperform the optimal policy under discretion for sufficiently high intertemporal elasticities of consumption substitution.

If movements in permanent employment changes are important, then recessions are times when the destruction of job-specific capital picks up and/or investment in new job capital slows. If movements in temporary employment changes are important, then employment fluctuations are related to the temporary movement of workers across activities (e.g. from work to home production or search and back again) as the relative costs/benefits of these activities change. I estimate that in the manufacturing sector temporary employment changes account for nearly 60% of the change in employment growth over the cycle. However, if permanent employment changes create and destroy more capital than temporary employment changes, then their economic consequences would be relatively greater. The correlation between gross permanent employment changes and capital intensity across industries supports the hypothesis that permanent employment changes do create and destroy more capital than temporary employment changes.

We propose a new efficiency concept, D-efficiency, that considers an implicit constraint in the act of giving: Donors cannot bequeath to donees more than their existing resources. Considering this constraint, we show that the market equilibrium is not socially efficient. The efficient level of bequest transfers can be implemented by the market with estate and labor-income subsidies and a capital-income tax. In the absence of lump-sum taxation, the government faces a trade-off between minimizing distortions and eliminating external effects. The implied tax policy differs from Pigovian taxation since the government's ability to correct the external effects is limited. Finally, we show that the efficiency-equity trade-off does not affect the qualitative features of the optimal distortionary fiscal policy.","[Sanchez-Losada, Fernando] Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Garriga, Carlos] Fed Reserve Bank, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA",University of Barcelona; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Sánchez-Losada, F (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",fernando.sanchezlosada@ub.edu,"Garriga, Carlos/I-5744-2016","Garriga, Carlos/0000-0003-0961-1986",,,,,19,1,1,1,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

We show that equilibrium outcomes when the followers perfectly observe the leaders' actions cannot be approximated by mixed equilibrium outcomes of the game where followers imperfectly observe the leaders' actions, i.e. they are not accessible. Accessibility fails since in a pure strategy equilibrium, a supplier makes positive profits; however in an equilibrium where a leader randomizes, supplier profits must be zero. Our result follows from a generalized indifference principle that mixed strategies must satisfy in economic environments. While supplier profits cannot be approximated, player action profiles are accessible. Our results also apply to games with costly observation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We must consider that prevalence rates of chronic diseases declined during the twentieth century and that this rate of decline has accelerated. However, health care costs may continue to increase even as the age of onset of chronic diseases is delayed, because the proportion of a cohort living to late ages will increase. The accelerating decline in the prevalence of chronic diseases during the course of the twentieth century supports the proposition that increases in life expectancy during the twenty-first century will be fairly large, but the effect on health care in the U. S. will be modest. The income elasticity for health services is calculated at 1.6, meaning that income expenditures on health care in the U.S. are likely to rise from a current level of about 15 percent to about 29 percent of GDP in 2040.

The empirical results from a random effect regression model indicate that mean per capita income in rural villages follows an inverted U-shaped path as financial intermediation develops. However, using a pooled quantile regression approach, we find that median per capita income in rural villages follows a positive linear path, rather than an inverted U-shaped path, as financial intermediation develops. The positive linear effect of financial intermediary development is observed at the lower and higher ends of the conditional per capita income distribution. This suggests that development of financial intermediation in China might not have statistically significant differential effects in low-income or high-income rural villages.","[Pan, Suwen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Rejesus, Roderick M.] NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC USA; [He, Xiurong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; North Carolina State University; China Agricultural University,"Pan, SW (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",s.pan@ttu.edu; rmrejesu@unity.ncsu.edu; hexr@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2009,17.0,4,,,,,72,87,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01159.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,472XY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268167800005,0

Although G.D.H. Coles reputation as a labour historian endures, his popular writings on economics are no longer influential. Among these works, a 1932 volume combined Coles historical perspective on the sources of the Depression with an attempt to present, for the general reader, a consensus account of the economic mechanisms involved.

This paper investigates whether the introduction of a cost channel of monetary transmission, whose presence is empirically supported, changes the impact of model uncertainty on interest rate setting. The model is simple enough to facilitate an analytical solution. I find that the presence of the cost channel dampens the effect of model uncertainty on interest rate setting and can offset the activist policy stance.

In other words, firms in an oligopoly market may engage in an R&D war and spend excessively on R&D when product market competition is intense. We also show, among other results, that when product market competition is intense, a monopoly may exhibit higher expected welfare and, sometimes, a higher expected consumer surplus than a duopoly.

In the mid-1990s, Cornell University's Faculty Senate had a number of discussions about grade inflation and what might be done about it. In April 1996, the Faculty Senate voted to adopt a new grade reporting policy which had two parts: 1) the publication of course median grades on the Internet; and 2) the reporting of course median grades in students' transcripts. The policy change followed the determination of a university committee that it is desirable for Cornell University to provide more information to the reader of a transcript and produce more meaningful letter grades. It was hoped that More accurate recognition of performance may encourage students to take courses in which the median grade is relatively low. The median grade policy has remained to date only partially implemented: median grades have been reported online since 1998 but do not yet appear in transcripts. We evaluate the effect of the implemented policy on patterns of course choice and grade inflation. Specifically, we test two related hypotheses: First, all else being equal, the availability of online grade information will lead to increased enrollment into leniently graded courses. Second, high-ability students will be less attracted to the leniently graded courses than their peers. Building on these results we perform an exercise that identifies the extent to which the change in student behavior resulted in an increase in the university-wide mean grade.","[Bar, Talia; Kadiyali, Vrinda] Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zussman, Asaf] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel",Cornell University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Bar, T (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tb97@cornell.edu; kadiyali@cornell.edu; azussman@mscc.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,7,54,72,0,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Tolerant people have diversified values and respect social alterity.

Meetings are depicted by an urn-ball process where firms rank their applicants and pick the best one. We show that a general rise in unemployment induces an increase in the employment shares of high-skilled workers which, in turn, makes firms choose more complex jobs, leading then to a decrease in the output of low-skilled workers. The technical skill bias is therefore related to the usual explanations of unemployment. Next, we state that a decentralized equilibrium is efficient in terms of job complexity but inefficient in terms of job creation when firms internalize the usual congestion effect. We then extend the analysis to a dynamic model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the first game, the sender can choose to ten the truth, to lie, or to remain silent. The latter strategy is costly. In the second game, the receiver must decide additionally whether or not to costly punish the sender after having observed the history of the game. We investigate the existence of two kinds of social preferences: lying aversion and preference for truth-telling. In the first game, senders tell the truth more often than predicted by the sequential equilibrium analysis, they remain silent frequently, and there exists a positive correlation between the probability of being truthful and the probability of remaining silent. Our main experimental result for the extended game shows that those subjects who punish the sender with a high probability after being deceived are precisely those who send fewer but more truthful messages. Finally, we solve for the Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibria of a reduced form of the baseline game with two types of senders. The equilibrium predictions obtained suggest that the observed excessive truth-telling in the baseline game can be explained by lying aversion but not by a preference for truth-telling.","[Vorsatz, Marc] FEDEA, Madrid 28001, Spain; [Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Vorsatz, M (通讯作者)，FEDEA, Calle Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain.",ssanchez@staffmail.ed.ac.uk; mvorsatz@fedea.es,"Vorsatz, Marc/H-1489-2015","Vorsatz, Marc/0000-0001-6244-3606",,,,,24,58,63,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Each firm's marginal cost of production is its own private information, thereby facing ex ante uncertainty about its cost position. The (inelastic) market demand can accommodate only a fraction of firms to operate, and thus only firms with relatively lower costs are viable in the long run. Some firms in the market will exit if excessive entry (or overshooting) occurs. We derive the unique symmetric sequential equilibrium. The equilibrium properties are consistent with empirical observations: (i) entry occurs gradually over time with lower cost firms entering earlier than higher cost firms, (ii) exiting firms are among the ones that entered later (indeed in the last period). Moreover, equilibrium overshooting probability is shown to always be positive and decreasing over time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Not only are firms that directly infringe liable, but those that indirectly contribute are also liable. We investigate how this rule affects the creation of a network of members (e.g., an e-commerce network). We find that the enforcement of indirect liability does not induce more trials in equilibrium. Firms settle out-of-court, but because of the threat of trial, the network size decreases and the social welfare is reduced. Surprisingly, we find that if the compensation paid by the indirect infringers is high, the rule does not benefit the patent holder and may not even give enough R&D incentives ex ante.

We consider a standard General Equilibrium model with large but finite horizon and complete markets. We show that, for almost every such economy, if conditional beliefs eventually become correct along a path of events then equilibrium prices of assets traded along this path converge to rational expectations equilibria in the sup-norm. Moreover, we establish that, generically, there exist along any such path local diffeomorphisms between individual beliefs and equilibrium prices.","Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"Leoni, PL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",patrick.leoni@nuim.ie,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It is determined that the RMB has been under great appreciation pressure over the past decade. However, the pressure has been weakening since 2005. The two approaches provide significantly different results in terms of the estimated RMB EMP indices and the estimated central bank's interventions. The differences may lead to different predictions of potential currency crises. According to the estimation of the RMB EMP, and based on the model-independent approach, the paper shows that China has been under threat of an appreciation currency crisis since 2008.

We therefore conclude that selection into establishments is an important explanatory factor for the family pay gap.","[Beblo, Miriam] Berlin Sch Econ, D-10825 Berlin, Germany; [Bender, Stefan] Inst Employment Res, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Wolf, Elke] Univ Appl Sci Munich, D-80335 Munich, Germany",,"Beblo, M (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ, Badensche Str 50-51, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",beblo@fhw-berlin.de; stefan.bender@iab.de; elke.wolf@hm.edu,,"Wolf, Elke/0000-0003-4255-2260",,,,,32,34,37,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It has been suggested that this happens either because these countries have a relatively lower TFP in industries producing capital goods or because they are subject to greater investment distortions. This paper provides a micro-foundation for the cross-country dispersion in investment distortions. We first document that firms producing capital goods face a higher level of idiosyncratic risk than their counterparts producing consumption goods. In a model of capital accumulation where the protection of investors' rights is incomplete, this difference in risk induces a wedge between the returns on investment in the two sectors. The wedge is bigger, the poorer the investor protection. In turn, this implies that countries endowed with weaker institutions face higher relative prices of investment goods, invest a lower fraction of their income, and end up being poorer. We find that our mechanism may be quantitatively important.","[Castro, Rui] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Clementi, Gian Luca] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [MacDonald, Glenn] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA",Universite de Montreal; New York University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Castro, R (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",,"Castro, Rui L/C-1011-2009",,,,,,44,41,51,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We find that these improvements are attenuated in Indian cities where employment experienced larger reductions in tariff protection. Girls are particularly affected.

The results suggest that the dynamics out of low pay differ by gender and that these differences change after 1999. These differences are driven by the differing impact of a number of covariates such as age and education on the baseline hazards. Overall, the effect of many covariates on expected duration is often less in absolute terms for women than men, although such differences frequently decline after 1999. At mean values, gender differences in expected duration of low pay effectively disappear and gender differences in the exit probability to high pay decline after 1999. However, for individuals with characteristics most associated with long periods of low pay, the high pay exit probability is substantially lower after 1999 for women than for men.","[Phimister, Euan; Theodossiou, Ioannis] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Phimister, E (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Ctr European Labour Market Res, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",e.phimister@abdn.ac.uk; theod@abdn.ac.uk,,"Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113",,,,,44,4,4,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We do so in a setting that takes three key features of elections into account, namely, strategic voting, endogenous candidacy and policy motivation on the part of the candidates. We consider two classes of voting rules. One class consists of the voting rules where each voter casts several equally-weighed votes for the different candidates. The other class consists of the voting rules where each voter rank-orders the candidates. We identify conditions under which these voting rules yield policy moderation. We also show that these voting rules may yield policy extremism instead of policy moderation if one (or several) of the conditions is not satisfied! Finally, we find that amongst these voting rules the extent of policy moderation is maximal under the Borda Count if we consider only equilibria where all candidates are serious contenders. However, this result does not carry over to spoiler equilibria, where Approval Voting can yield more moderate policy outcomes than the Borda Count. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Market players and researchers have tried to find a proxy for it, notably by means of spreads in high yielding markets like credit or emerging markets. However, these measures might be biased because they hinge on series of prices that include market movements due to the re-pricing of both systemic and specific risks. Being macro factors that affect all the assets in the universe, risk appetite and risk aversion can only produce systemic risk re-pricing. We apply a methodology to correct this bias. We analysed emerging market debt capital markets and compute a systemic risk only indicator that enables one to ascertain more precisely periods in which risk appetite might have driven market returns. We find that from the end of 1997 to 2004 only about 30 per cent of the return of the EMBI+ might have been due to changes in risk appetite.","Halbis Capital Management, F-75419 Paris, France",,"Dupuy, P (通讯作者)，Halbis Capital Management, 4 Pl Pyramide,Def 9, F-75419 Paris, France.",philippe.dupuy@cegetel.net,,,,,,,11,7,8,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Author applies the classical models of oligopoly to subsidy competition, endogenousing investment incentives, but leaving tax rates exogenous. According to the conventional wisdom, subsidy competition leads to overprovision of incentives. This paper suggests that, in the oligopolistic framework, supranational coordination can either decrease or increase the supply of subsidies. Further, in the setting of subsidy regulation, the host country's corporate income tax rate has an ambiguous effect on the provision of incentives.","Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Havránek, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",tomas.havranek@ies-prague.org,"Havranek, Tomas/M-8888-2015","Havranek, Tomas/0000-0002-3158-2539",,,,,27,2,2,1,4,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In the early 1990s, however, the unemployment rate increased sharply and hit double-digit levels. The paper argues that the steep rise in unemployment was mainly the result of a series of adverse macroeconomic shocks, partly self-inflicted by bad policies, and partly caused by unfavourable international developments. The extremely contractionary monetary policy in 1992 appears to have had strong and long-lasting effects on unemployment. Institutional factors do not appear as convincing explanations of the steep rise in unemployment in the early 1990s.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Holmlund, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",bertil.holmlund@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,24,7,7,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Predictably, investment in old capital takes place if the elasticity of substitution between old and new capital is low, and when the depreciation of capital is high.

The dynamic panel data analysis results demonstrate that real income per capita and institutional quality are statistically significant determinants of banking sector development and capital market development. The trade openness, however, is more prominent in promoting capital market development. In terms of financial liberalisation, the empirical results suggest that domestic financial sector reforms tend to promote banking sector development, whereas stock market liberalisation is potent in delivering stock market development. Nevertheless, the financial liberalisation programmes are more responsive in developed economies.","[Law, Siong Hook; Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Law, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",lawsh@econ.upm.edu.my,"Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883; Habibullah, Muzafar Shah/0000-0002-2853-8019",,,,,36,80,88,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Yet, existing theories of industry dynamics focus exclusively on new entrants and assume that firm exit is synonymous with failure. This paper proposes a model that incorporates entry and exit by both new and existing firms into a standard framework of industry dynamics. There are two forms of exit: a firm may shut down by selling its assets to earn their salvage value, or reallocate its assets at a cost to enter another industry or product line. In equilibrium, a low-skill firm shuts down from and a high-skill firm transfers out of an industry with a low state of demand. We show the model is consistent with a series of stylized facts pertaining to the entry and exit patterns of new versus existing firms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These restrictions hold in both prototype Real Business Cycle (RBC) and New Keynesian models. Shocks to government consumption and investment increase real wages and employment contemporaneously, both at state level and in the aggregate. The dynamics in response to employment shocks are mixed: Increases in government employment raise the real wage and total employment in the aggregate. However, in one third of the states they reduce total employment.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Pappa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Edifici B Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",evi.pappa@uab.es,"Pappa, Evi/Y-6442-2018","Pappa, Evi/0000-0002-2393-0142",,,,,38,107,121,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0020-6598,,,INT ECON REV,Int.

On the one hand, it shows that structural changes in financial markets and in the hedge funds industry make the light-touch arguments for regulating hedge funds no longer relevant. On the other hand, pleas for stronger regulation of hedge funds are getting more attention. In the first part of the paper the huge expansion of the industry is outlined and the state of current regulation is highlighted. In the second part an in-depth analysis of risks associated with hedge funds is carried out. It is shown that systemic risk can arise from leverage and from concentration of exposures amongst hedge funds. The part played by hedge funds in the spread of the crisis of structured credit is portrayed. In the third section, the recommendations of professional organisations, regulatory authorities and international institutions are surmised tip within the framework of risk mapping. This oversight shows the ways to reform: the need for direct regulation, the enhancement of indirect regulation and the overhaul of securitization. The prospective pattern of regulation encompasses macro- and micro-issues, and impinges upon factors of demand and supply. It emphasizes the enhanced role of public regulators and displays the conditions for an effective market discipline performed by long run institutional investors.","[Aglietta, Michel; Rigot, Sandra] Paris X EconomiX, Paris, France",,"Aglietta, M (通讯作者)，Paris X EconomiX, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,8,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Optimal policy generates long-run cycles in both sovereign debt and foreign direct investment in an environment in which the first best capital stock is a constant. The expected tax on capital endogenously varies with the state of the economy, and investment is distorted by more in recessions than in booms, amplifying the effect of shocks. The government's lack of commitment induces a negative correlation between investment and the stock of government debt, a debt overhang effect. Debt relief is never Pareto improving and cannot affect the long-run level of investment. Furthermore, restricting the government to a balanced budget can eliminate the cyclical distortion of investment.","[Aguiar, Mark] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Aguiar, Mark; Amador, Manuel; Gopinath, Gita] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Amador, Manuel] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gopinath, Gita] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Rochester; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; Harvard University,"Aguiar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",,,,,,,,33,65,82,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A devaluation in 1998 in Brasil, its main partner, damaged the Argentinian competitiveness and resulted in a fall in export demand. There was a need for a real adjustment but removing the peg would have implied large balance sheet effects and raised serious financial issues. This article endeavours to learn a lesson about the aftermath of hard peg regime from the Argentinian experience. It is based on a dynamic macroeconomic model to assess the impact of three scenarios, already suggested in the literature. Two hypothetical, a floating regime and dollarization and one which was actually implemented in 2002, the pesification of the whole economy. The simulations suggest that pesification was the only scenario with unambiguous expansionary effects.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Social Sci Div, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Baldi-Delatte, AL (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Social Sci Div, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",delatte@ust.hk,,,,,,,18,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using data from three panel waves of the Border Epidemiologic Study on Aging, collected between 1995 and 2003, estimation results from a set of logit regression models reveal that obese individuals, who lose weight over an eight-year period, are less likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than those who remain obese in waves two and three. Moreover, employment, an important covariate in all three waves, is associated with the lower likelihood of being diagnosed with diabetes. In all, results confirm findings from cross-sectional data that point to overweight and obesity as important predictors of diabetes and further support public policy efforts that aim at controlling the rising incidence of diabetes through tailored interventions.","[Soydemir, Goekce A.] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Bastida, Elena] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Sociol, Edinburg, TX USA; [Bastida, Elena] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Ctr Aging & Hlth, Edinburg, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Soydemir, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",soydemir@panam.edu,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, their toolbox - psychological game theory - incorporates several restrictions that rule out plausible forms of belief-dependent motivation. Building on recent work on dynamic interactive epistemology, we propose a more general framework. Updated higher-order beliefs, beliefs of others, and plans of action may influence motivation, and we can capture dynamic psychological effects (such as sequential reciprocity, psychological forward induction, and regret) that were previously ruled out.

However, while some literature is available on technology management, little information is available on social capital. Similarly, the study on social capital has been mounting steadily, but little work is available on national innovation system. Thus, this work used the reports of World Bank and World Value Survey, applying the linear structural relation model to consider this relationship between the social capital and national innovation system. Overall, the results found that the innovation seem a collective achievement embedded with other social activities, and that the social capital like a catalyzer helps the collective innovation and economic productivity. Thus, this work suggests that every country should recognize that economy was closely embedded with social structure, and that should enrich the social capital to improve the performance of national innovation system and economic productivity.","Natl Taiwan Univ Educ, Dept Culture Ind, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, CK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Educ, Dept Culture Ind, Ho Ping E Rd 134, Taipei, Taiwan.",chihkai@tea.ntue.edu.tw,"Chen, Chih-Kai/JMP-6977-2023; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Chen, Chih-Kai/0000-0003-4725-6735;",,,,,49,1,1,1,17,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The key finding is that the form and extent of independent worker activism, and the response of the state to such activism, are a much more significant determinant of trade union development than is the legal and institutional framework of industrial relations, while the main barriers to trade union reform are the inertia of the trade union apparatus and the dependence of primary union organisations on management.","[Clarke, Simon; Pringle, Tim] Univ Warwick, Dept Sociol, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Clarke, Simon; Pringle, Tim] Univ Warwick, Dept Sociol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Clarke, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Sociol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Simon.Clarke@Warwick.ac.uk,,"Pringle, Tim/0000-0002-9185-7346",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-155-25-0071] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,59,62,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,1,,,,,85,101,PII 909478866,10.1080/14631370802663679,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,418HE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264138500006,0

However, the trade pattern in manufactures should be differentiated according to Russia's main trading partners: the European Union (EU), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and China. On the basis of trade indicator analysis (revealed comparative advantages and Grubel-Lloyd index of intra-industry trade), we show that Russia is globally disadvantaged in manufactures trade vis-a-vis the EU and China, and advantaged in trade within the CIS. Russia is managing to expand its manufactured exports to other CIS countries.

The topic is explored using a dataset that matches race and income information from HMDA data with property-level transaction data from Massachusetts Registry of Deeds offices. With this data, we show that much of the subprime lending in the state was concentrated in urban neighborhoods, and that minority homeownerships created with subprime mortgages have proven exceptionally unstable in the face of rapid price declines. The evidence, in Massachusetts, suggests that subprime lending did not, as is commonly believed, lead to a substantial increase in homeownership by minorities, but instead generated turnover in properties owned by minority residents. Furthermore, we argue that the particularly dire foreclosure situation in urban neighborhoods actually makes it somewhat easier for policymakers to provide remedies.","[Gerardi, Kristopher] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Willen, Paul] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Gerardi, K (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA.",Kristopher.Gerardi@atl.frb.org; paul.willen@bos.frb.org,,,,,,,46,25,34,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Expansion, in various forms, of E-commerce will contribute to globalizing the economy, and will facilitate a universal and coherent way of operating in the electronic environment eventually, covering a wide range of aspects in the society economic, financial, social, legal, safeguard of property.","[Grigorescu, Adriana] Natl Sch Polit Studies & Publ Adm Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",,,adrianag@snspa.ro; dangr31@hotmail.com,"Grigorescu, Adriana/ISU-9191-2023; Grigorescu, Adriana/S-2020-2016; Grigorescu, Adriana/AAF-4557-2022","Grigorescu, Adriana/0000-0003-4212-6974;",,,,,11,0,0,0,8,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,48,57,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984500008,0

This paper addresses the question of the role of monetary uncertainty from both a theoretical and empirical point of view. Our analysis is based on a simple model that derives the influence of monetary uncertainty on unionized wage setting. We construct an indicator of monetary policy uncertainty and test our model with data for the G5 countries. The central finding is that monetary policy uncertainty has a negative impact on nominal wage growth in countries where wage setting is relatively centralized.,"[Gruener, Hans Peter] Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany; [Hayo, Bernd] Univ Marburg, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Hefeker, Carsten] Univ Siegen, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",University of Mannheim; Philipps University Marburg; Universitat Siegen,"Gruener, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany.",hgruener@staffmail.uni-mannheim.de; hayo@wiwi.uni-marburg.de; carsten.hefeker@uni-siegen.de,,,,,,,55,3,3,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In the paper we propose and discuss accessibility and other indicators-based urban transport system analysis and GIS (geographic information systems) calculation method for indicating problematic transportation zones in Vilnius city. The main parameter is time-based accessibility from/to the central part of Vilnius and other transport zones in the city. Created GIS application computes the ranks for transport zones of Vilnius city according to accessibility and Vilnius statistics in these zones (street network density in city zones, number of working places, number of equipped parking places, number of attractive objects in transportation zones). The GIS decision support system is based on 2 calculation methods TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and SAW (Simple Additive Weighting). Application of transportation zones analysis improves the quality of basic environment statistics and fills many data gaps related to urban statistics, providing information to decision-makers and the general public concerning key factors determining the state of urban transportation environment. This paper outlines criteria and models used in Vilnius to develop urban transportation indicators and the reasons why the selected indicators represent the first important step to achieve a comprehensive system of indicators of urban transportation sustainability in Vilnius city.

When the taste for discrimination is small or competition is weak, the policy removes job segregation and the wage gap completely. However, with a bigger taste for discrimination or stronger competition, equal pay legislation leads to more job segregation, and sometimes minority workers end up earning less than before. Profits of discriminating firms might increase, and discrimination can persist in the long run, although it would have disappeared without the policy.","Univ Konstanz, DE-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Kaas, L (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, DE-78457 Constance, Germany.",leo.kaas@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,24,6,8,2,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

This paper develops a model of growth and schooling consistent with these decompositions but with less unexplained growth. The theory distinguishes between three different sources of education gains: (1) supply shifts. (2) skill-biased technical change increasing demand within industries/occupations, and (3) skill-biased technical change caused by the introduction of new skill-intensive industries/occupations. The third source leads to the large sectoral shifts and the largest growth effects. Quantitatively, schooling contributions account for 24 percent of wage growth, with both the direct (i.e., supply driven) causal contribution of schooling and the indirect causal (i.e.. technology induced) contribution playing substantial roles.

Our discussion focuses on three distinct periods of field experimentation that have influenced the economics literature. The first might well be thought of as the dawn of field experimentation: the work of Neyman and Fisher, who laid the experimental foundation in the 1920s and 1930s by conceptualizing randomization as an instrument to achieve identification via experimentation with agricultural plots. The second, the large-scale social experiments conducted by government agencies in the mid-twentieth century, moved the exploration from plots of land to groups of individuals. More recently, the nature and range of field experiments has expanded, with a diverse set of controlled experiments being completed outside of the typical laboratory environment. With this growth, the number and types of questions that can be explored using field experiments has grown tremendously. After discussing these three distinct phases, we speculate on the future of field experimental methods, a future that we envision including a strong collaborative effort with outside parties, most importantly private entities.

Data from the Greek and the UK Labour Force Surveys are used in order to assess how personal attributes of an individual have an impact on the incidence of SE. It is found that common patterns exist between these two countries. In particular, it is found that for both countries, males have greater odds of being self-employed than females, older people have greater odds than younger, individuals employed in the primary and tertiary sectors have greater odds than the ones employed in the secondary, and that individuals with primary or secondary education have greater odds of being self-employed than individuals holding higher degrees. The incidence of SE is also found to differ according to the occupation of the individual. On the other hand, the findings indicate that individuals, residing in London, have greater odds of being self-employed than individuals working outside UK's capital, whereas in Greece the pattern is reversed.","Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Livanos, I (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",I.Livanos@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,11,17,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The empirical work to explain the interest rate setting is made by means of several approaches: calibrated, intra-temporary and inter-temporary regarding the generalized method of moments. The conclusions are clear: the implicit inflation target is located at around 1.9%, very close to 2%, as was stated by the ECB in the evaluation of its monetary policy strategy in 2003. We contend that the approach of this institution is forward-looking on underlying inflation, and is backward-looking with regard to the business cycle, showing a certain tendency towards extending the temporary horizon in both cases. The inflation aversion coefficient value follows the Taylor principle, and, finally, the attached weight by the ECB to the economic growth on setting the interest rates is small.","[Manuel Garcia-Iglesias, Jesus] Univ Extremadura, Fac Empresariales & Turismo, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Pateiro Rodriguez, Carlos] Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Universidade da Coruna,"Garcia-Iglesias, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Empresariales & Turismo, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",jmgarcia@unex.es; cpateiro@udc.es,"Garcia-Iglesias, Jesus M./F-1709-2016","Garcia-Iglesias, Jesus M./0000-0002-8811-9385; Pateiro-Rodriguez, Carlos/0000-0001-6530-9605",,,,,66,8,9,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Under the latter we prove that the regression tests of Uncovered Interest Parity and the rational expectations version of the term structure display a downward bias.

In a simple model of vertically (willingness to pay) ordered households we posit that the relative importance of the income elasticity of demand (vs. the family size elasticity) depends positively on the price faced by households. Thus, very low prices tend to depress the across households income elasticity of demand relative to the characteristic-elasticity and the opposite holds for under high prices. We test this hypothesis using, for the first time in Argentina, data from the household expenditure survey on Natural gas and LPG and compare the cross-consumption equations for both fuels, which have quite different price regimes. Finally, we explore welfare implications for low-user tariff scheme reforms in natural gas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The legal framework determines the scheme of intergovernmental finance based on well specified cooperation programs for the provision of basic infrastructure that result in different stocks of local infrastructures. We estimate translog cost functions to quantify economies of scale, density and scope in the provision of infrastructure dealing with water supply, sewerage and cleansing of residual waters, paving and lighting. We find that these economies are present to a large degree due to the existing rural structure, characterized by a suboptimal municipal size. This carries an excess cost in the provision of infrastructure in terms of the existing infrastructure stock and the amount of intergovernmental finance. Taking Castilla y Leon as the geographical reference, we estimate infrastructure stocks relying on the Local Infrastructure and Equipment Survey while developing a new price database based on best practice engineering approaches.","[Prieto, Angel M.] IRNASA CSIC, Madrid, Spain; [Zofio, Jose L.; Alvarez, Inmaculada] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Salamanca (IRNASA); Autonomous University of Madrid,"Prieto, AM (通讯作者)，IRNASA CSIC, Madrid, Spain.",,"Zofío, José L./HTQ-2877-2023; Zofío, José Luis/K-5178-2014; Prieto, Angel M./K-5780-2014","Zofío, José Luis/0000-0003-1170-9501; Prieto, Angel M./0000-0002-5219-0665",,,,,78,6,7,0,10,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2009,,190,,,,,59,93,,,,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V17YN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000207972600003,0

Changes in aggregate productivity are decomposed into elements corresponding to productivity growth among survivors, market share growth by survivors and the contributions of entering and exiting firms. The traditional entry and exit effects begin to work as transition to a market economy progresses. However, initial productivity improvements are due to changes in market shares of the existing firms following the break-up of large enterprises. Regression analysis shows that changes in the firm-level productivity are affected by restructuring and a more competitive economic environment.","[Roberts, Barbara M.] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Thompson, Steve] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of Leicester; University of Nottingham,"Roberts, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",bbr@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,5,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper argues that as capital flight is a drain on financial resources for development, it is more appropriate to measure it against the size of the financial market, which can be proxied by money aggregate, in contrast to the common practice of measuring it as a percentage of gross domestic product. Using this more appropriate new measure, we find that capital flight is more severe in some financially underdeveloped countries than has been suggested previously. It is also found that while capital flight could be a dormant sideshow in a benign economic environment, it could have considerable impact on the availability of financial resources when activated.","[Tang, Kam Ki] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Zheng, Yingmei] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of Queensland; Shandong University,"Tang, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",kk.tang@uq.edu.au,,"Tang, Kam/0000-0001-7282-8112",,,,,42,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Recently, cognitive aspects of institutional economics have been highlighted. The proposal of this paper is to offer other psychological insights related to institutional economics, which are complementary to a cognitive approach. The goal is to emphasize elements of Psychological Social Learning Theory as a possible foundation of Institutional Economics. This paper argues that people vicariously learn by the observation and interpretation of exemplary behaviors. Vicarious learning relies on the comprehension of people about who/what models are. Vicariously, people are motivated to behave as a model; when they succeed, models are reinforced. As something socially and cumulatively acceptable and/or desirable, exemplary behaviors can take place repetitively and become a habit. Institutions arise as outgrowths of those habits. In this logic, a working definition of institution is a cognitive inertia about the typifications of foreseeable regularities in behaviors of people in a society.","Fed Univ Pampa, Bage, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Pampa,"Almeida, F (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Pampa, Bage, RS, Brazil.",,"Almeida, Felipe/H-6457-2016",,,,,,51,6,7,0,12,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

When the economy trades with the rest of the world the government chooses a new education policy that maximizes welfare under trade. Is it ever optimal for the government to choose its new policy so that it reverses the economy's comparative advantage? We find that if the budget stays fixed when it is optimal to move up the skills chain it is not feasible. In such a case, a foreign loan is welfare improving.

The analysis of why and under which conditions countries (or policy makers) may be inclined toward ratifying such agreements or not has been the focus of a body of theoretical work at the interface of environmental economics and the economics of coalition games. Traditional theoretical work predicted that environmental agreements are hard to sustain due to the lacking enforceability of associated contracts and the incentive to free-ride. This hypothesis is at odds with the enormous surge of such agreements in reality over the last few decades. Recent work by Rose and Spiegel (J. Money, Credit Bank. 41: 337-363, 2009) suggests that environmental agreements will be signed and are stable, because they work as a signal and help economies to get access to export (and possibly other) credits. Hence, the reason for a ratification of such agreements is their interdependence with other policies, especially ones that are related to international business. This paper sheds light on the determinants of multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) participation. In particular, we pay attention to the role of a country's international openness by means of chosen trade and investment policies for such participation.

In general, the forecasts are found: (i) to have a positive average bias, (ii) to be more biased in booms, and (iii) to be even more biased at the 3-year horizon than at shorter horizons. This over-optimism in official forecasts can help explain excessive budget deficits, especially the failure to run surpluses during periods of high output: if a boom is forecasted to last indefinitely, retrenchment is treated as unnecessary. Many believe that better fiscal policy can be obtained by means of rules such as ceilings for the deficit or, better yet, the structural deficit. But we also find: (iv) countries subject to a budget rule, in the form of euroland's Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), make official forecasts of growth and budget deficits that are even more biased and more correlated with booms than do other countries. This effect may help explain frequent violations of the SGP. The question becomes how to overcome governments' tendency to satisfy fiscal targets by wishful thinking rather than by action. Chile in 2000 created structural budget institutions that may have solved the problem. Independent expert panels, insulated from political pressures, are responsible for estimating the long-run trends that determine whether a given deficit is deemed structural or cyclical. The result is that Chile's official forecasts of growth and the budget have not been overly optimistic, even in booms. Unlike many countries in the North, Chile took advantage of the 2002-7 expansion to run budget surpluses, and so was able to ease in the 2008-9 recession.","Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Frankel, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jeffrey_frankel@harvard.edu,,,,,,,62,69,71,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Here, we deviate from this tradition and look instead at the structure of output embodied in the network connecting countries to the products that they export. We characterize this network using four structural features: the negative relationship between the diversification of a country and the average ubiquity of its exports, and the non-normal distributions for product ubiquity, country diversification and product co-export. We model the structure of the network by assuming that products require a large number of non-tradable inputs, or capabilities, and that countries differ in the completeness of the set of capabilities they have. We solve the model assuming that the probability that a country has a capability and that a product requires a capability are constant and calibrate it to the data to find that it accounts well for all of the network features except for the heterogeneity in the distribution of country diversification. In the light of the model, this is evidence of a large heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities across countries. Finally, we show that the model implies that the increase in diversification that is expected from the accumulation of a small number of capabilities is small for countries that have a few of them and large for those with many. This implies that the forces that help drive divergence in product diversity increase with the complexity of the global economy when capabilities travel poorly.","[Hidalgo, Cesar A.] MIT, MITMedia Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hausmann, Ricardo] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hausmann, Ricardo; Hidalgo, Cesar A.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Int Dev, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; Harvard University,"Hidalgo, CA (通讯作者)，MIT, MITMedia Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Hidalgo, Cesar A./B-5155-2009","Hidalgo, Cesar A./0000-0002-6977-9492; /0000-0002-6031-5982",,,,,35,325,363,2,141,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The paper decomposes this total value into two components: redistributive value, which is due to predictable changes in income (and family circumstances), and insurance value, which occurs when taxes and transfers compensate for unexpected income shocks. Our approach is a forward-looking one, where we examine income and transfers net of taxes over a 10-year period. We model state taxes (personal income taxes, the EITC, and sales taxes) and state means-tested transfers (AFDC/TANF and Medicaid/SCHIP). The calculations are made using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and allow for analysis of the role of changes in tax-and-transfer programs, demographics, and income in the value of state net benefits over a period of more than 30 years. We find that the redistributive value of state tax-and-transfer programs sharply declines with income, but that the insurance value is increasing in income. The resulting total value still declines with income, but not nearly as sharply as the redistributive value. Hence, the insurance value mitigates the incentives for mobility that would undo state redistributive spending. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Regional provision is inefficient because governments compete for scarce capital by lowering their capital taxes and public good levels to inefficiently low levels. On the other hand, central provision is inefficient because it is determined by the minimum winning coalition within a legislature. The optimal degree to which public good provision should be decentralized depends on a tradeoff between these inefficiencies. In our main model, complete centralization is never optimal: regional governments should supply some public goods.

Internet related variables and location factors. Since online shopping is only observed for Internet users, we use the Heckman's two-step model to correct sample selection. We argue that one of the relevant variables to explain online shopping, the existence of a home Internet connection, can be endogenous. To account for this potential endogeneity, we jointly estimate the probability of online shopping and the probability of having Internet at home. The dataset used in this paper comes from the Household Survey of ICT Equipment and Usage, conducted by the Spanish Statistical Office on an annual basis. Our analysis covers the period 2004-2009. Our results show that not accounting for the endogeneity of having Internet at home, leads to an overestimate of that variable's effect on the probability of buying online. We also show that, compared to other variables that are also relevant for online shopping, the effect of Internet at home is quite small. This finding can be important in the design of public policies aimed at enhancing e-commerce through providing households with Internet connection at home. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Subjective satisfaction ('happiness') measures have become increasingly popular, as they seem to avoid paternalism while at the same time not being dependent on observed choice behaviour. We argue that there is a clash between using subjective satisfaction and respecting preferences, because the former also depends on aspirations. We propose the equivalent income indicator as an alternative cardinalization of the utility function. It does respect preferences but does not depend on aspirations. We apply our general ideas to one specific policy domain: monitoring job quality as individual well-being on the job. Our empirical results about the quality of jobs for school-leavers in Flanders show that the choice of a specific indicator of well-being is highly relevant from a policy point of view. The most popular measures that are in use now (the paternalist equal weights-indicator and subjective job satisfaction) may be misleading if they are not complemented by information about the other indicators.

The results are twofold. First, regardless of the government's preference for tax revenues and the number of private firms, the government and the public firm do not always have an incentive to privatize the public firm even if the government places lesser emphasis on the tax revenues than on social welfare. Second, social welfare increases with an increased number of private firms regardless of the government's preference for tax revenues and decreases with the government's preference for tax revenues regardless of the number of private firms. Hence, the government can use tax more efficiently as a commitment device to control the union's wage demand so as to maintain lower wage level under unionized mixed oligopoly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that if private agents use information extracted from money and financial markets to form inflation expectations and if interest rate pass-through is incomplete, the central bank can use a narrow monetary aggregate and the discount interest rate as independent and complementary policy instruments to reinforce the credibility of its announcements and the role of inflation target as a nominal anchor for inflation expectations.

Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper outlines a model to optimally monitor self-employed entrepreneurs when, in addition to reported profits, the tax collection agency also observes the number of workers employed (or any other input variable) at each firm. We show that, by conditioning the monitoring strategy only on labor input, it is optimal for the IRS to audit firms in a way that generates some empirical regularities, like the missing middle. We also show that the optimal direct mechanism can be implemented by an indirect monitoring strategy that is consistent with actual IRS practices. In particular, the IRS calculates inputted income as function of labor. Whenever an entrepreneur reports profits that are lower than inputted income, she is randomly monitored.

Surprisingly, information sometimes raises the average equity premium, no matter what the preferences of the representative agent. Information purely about the volatility either of consumption or the marginal utility of consumption raises the equity premium for a wide class of preferences. Moreover, information can raise the average equity premium by an arbitrarily large percentage (while still matching important magnitudes, such as average growth and the risk-free rate). We consider two different economies: a two-period economy with arbitrary preferences for the representative agent; and an infinite horizon economy, in which we restrict both preferences and the endowment distribution.

When consumers can reject this hypothesis, some become angry, which is costly to the firm. The desire to appear benevolent can lead firms to adopt third-degree price discrimination based on the income of different consumer classes while foreswearing third-degree price discrimination based on differences in the elasticity of demand. It can also explain why prices seem to be more responsive to changes in factor costs than to changes in demand that have the same effect on marginal cost. Lastly, if consumers experience regret or disappointment when faced by increased prices, the model can explain why prices can be more rigid in response to disasters that increase demand dramatically than they are when there is a less substantial increase in demand.

The classical solution to many of these models is to apply a mechanism called Top Trading Cycles, attributed to David Gale, which satisfies good properties for the case of strict preferences. In this paper, we propose a family of mechanisms, called Top Trading Absorbing Sets mechanisms, which generalize the Top Trading Cycles to the general case in which individuals are allowed to report indifferences, while preserving a maximal possible set of its desirable properties.

We focus on the case of India, a country that underwent a major exogenous tariff reform program in the early 1990s and subsequently initiated substantial use of safeguard and antidumping import restrictions. We first estimate structural determinants of India's import protection using the Grossman and Helpman (1994) model and provide evidence from its pre-reform tariff data of 1990 that is consistent with the theory. We then re-estimate the model on the Indian tariff data after the trade liberalization is complete and find that the model no longer fits, a result consistent with theory and evidence provided in other settings that India's 1991-1992 IMF arrangement can be interpreted as resulting in an exogenous shock to India's tariff policy. However, when we re-estimate the model on data from 2000-2002 that more completely reflects India's cross-product variation in import protection by including both its post-reform tariffs and its additional non-tariff barriers of antidumping and safeguard import protection, the significance of the Grossman and Helpman model determinant estimates is restored. We interpret these combined results as evidence that India unwound its commitment to reduce tariffs through use of antidumping and safeguard protection in the face of political-economic pressure.The estimates are also economically important and provide one explanation for separate results in the literature that the magnitude of import reduction associated with India's use of antidumping is similar to the initial import expansion associated with its tariff reform. Finally, we interpret the implications of our results for the burgeoning research literature examining the effects of liberalization on India's micro-level development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical results show that the optimal portfolio weights of all multivariate volatility models for Brent suggest holding futures in larger proportions than spot. For WTI, however, DCC, BM and diagonal BEKK suggest holding crude oil futures to spot, but CCC and VARMA-GARCH suggest holding crude oil spot to futures. In addition, the calculated optimal hedge ratios (OHRs) from each multivariate conditional volatility model give the time-varying hedge ratios, and recommend to short in crude oil futures with a high proportion of one dollar long in crude oil spot.

We derive a sufficient condition that ensures the existence of an efficient dissolution mechanism that satisfies Bayesian incentive compatibility, ex post budget balancedness, and ex post individual rationality. For equal-share partnerships, we show that our sufficient condition is satisfied for any symmetric type distribution whenever the interdependence in valuations is non-positive. This result improves former existence results, demonstrating that the stronger requirement of ex post individual rationality does not always rule out efficiency. We also show that if we allow for two-stage revelation mechanisms, in which agents report their realized payoffs from the allocation, as well as imposing penalties off the equilibrium path, efficient dissolution is always possible even when the interdependence is positive. We further discuss the possibility of efficient dissolution with ex post quitting rights.","[Muto, Nozomu; Oyama, Daisuke] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Galavotti, Stefano] Univ Florence, Dept Decis Math, I-50134 Florence, Italy",Hitotsubashi University; University of Florence,"Oyama, D (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Naka 2-1, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",stefano.galavotti@unifi.it; nozomu.muto@gmail.com; oyama@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,"Oyama, Daisuke/G-5746-2011; Galavotti, Stefano/AAI-4503-2021","Muto, Nozomu/0000-0001-6882-6296",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23530211] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,35,10,11,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This is one of the aspects which determines the complexity of social systems and make them behave as a whole. Systems characterized by such a trade-off between individual choices and collective behavior are ubiquitous and have been studied extensively in different fields. Schelling, in his seminal papers (1973, 1978), provided an interesting analysis of binary choice games with externalities. In this work we analyze some aspects of actor decisions. Specifically we shall see what are the consequences of assuming that switching decisions may also depend on how close to each other the payoffs are. By making explicit some of these aspects we are able to analyze the dynamics of the population where the actor decision process is made more explicit and also to characterize several interesting mathematical aspects which contribute to the complexity of the resulting dynamics. As we shall see, several kinds of dynamic behaviors may occur, characterized by cyclic behaviors (attracting cycles of any period may occur), also associated with new kinds of bifurcations, called big-bang bifurcation points, leading to the so-called period increment bifurcation structure or to the period adding bifurcation structure.

The studies on emerging European markets covered in our survey report direct and indirect FDI effects weakening over time, similarly as in other FDI destination countries. This is imputable to a publication bias that is detected and to the fact that more sophisticated methods and more controls can be used once a sufficient time span is available. Panel studies are likely to find relatively lower spillover effects. The choice of the research design (definition of firm performance and foreign firm presence) matters.

We develop a dynamic political-economy model to explain this phenomenon. In the model, public expenditures provide insurance to uninsured households, and optimal fiscal policy is countercyclical. The introduction of a political friction, in which successive governments disagree on the desired distribution of public spending, can lead to procyclical fiscal policies. Numerical simulations of the model allow us to compare quantitatively the relative role of common explanations for fiscal procyclicality. We conclude that political distortions in the fiscal process can explain fiscal procyclicality better than other common explanations, such as borrowing constraints and macroeconomic volatility.

These extract the information in these predictors into factors reflecting different blocks of variables (e.g. a price block, a housing block, a financial block, etc.). However, a forecasting model which simply includes all blocks as predictors risks being over-parameterized. Thus, it is desirable to use a methodology which allows for different parsimonious forecasting models to hold at different points in time. In this paper, we use dynamic model averaging and dynamic model selection to achieve this goal. These methods automatically alter the weights attached to different forecasting models as evidence comes in about which has forecast well in the recent past. In an empirical study involving forecasting output growth and inflation using 139 UK monthly time series variables, we find that the set of predictors changes substantially over time. Furthermore, our results show that dynamic model averaging and model selection can greatly improve forecast performance relative to traditional forecasting methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article seeks to construct an explanation of the experience, which centers on the notion of an evolving development path that embodies an uneasy mix of the attributes of allocative and productive efficiency. In this light, the analytical findings of the article give rise to two main propositions. First, in contrast to the general direction of market reform in the institutional dimension, China's actual path of industrialization and economic growth has rather tended to contradict the principle of (endowment-determined) comparative advantage. It has been in the direction of capital deepening, especially since the early 1990s. Second, China's reformed economic institutions have encompassed both market-supplanting and market-conforming elements. These are represented by state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises, respectively, with the former accounting for the improvement in productive efficiency and the latter accounting for the improvement in allocative efficiency.

One candidate explanation is supply-side effects driven by dramatic expansions of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit durations, to as long as 99 weeks. This paper investigates the effect of these extensions on job search and reemployment. I use the longitudinal structure of the Current Population Survey to construct unemployment exit hazards that vary across states, over time, and between individuals with differing unemployment durations. I then use these hazards to explore a variety of comparisons intended to distinguish the effects of UI extensions from other determinants of employment outcomes. The various specifications yield quite similar results. UI extensions had significant but small negative effects on the probability that the eligible unemployed would exit unemployment. These effects are concentrated among the long-term unemployed.

Leaders of groups in the opposition (what was called the informal and then the democratic movement) rushed into the two major pathways for reorienting careers as legislators or journalists. Most of them had been on the fringes of the Soviet system, and were mainly equipped with resources drawn from their activism. They were appointed to offices beyond what they could have hoped for. Although their career trajectories veered before 1991, this year marked a turning point as these persons accumulated new institutional capital. They assumed roles that were not yet fully codified and that they helped redefine, since the new institutions with which they were affiliated were in the throes of change. This creative redefinition led them to hold often divergent positions in their new professions, a probable factor underlying their movement's dispersal. The study of these career trajectories lets us glimpse the conditions enabling them to remain in the sphere of power beyond 1991, thus revealing how little institutions could lastingly incorporate players who were not conformist.","CNRS, Inst Sci Sociales Polit, F-75700 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Sigman, C (通讯作者)，CNRS, Inst Sci Sociales Polit, F-75700 Paris, France.",carole.sigman@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Using a methodology that borrows from DiNardo et al.

The main factor which accounts for the increase in the relative female earnings share is the rising female labour force participation across the whole distribution of the female breadwinner index. Changes in assortative mating have a modest positive impact on the index at the mean, 25th and 75th percentiles of the distribution. This is explained by increasing positive assortative mating between 1994 and 2004.","Open Univ, Dept Econ, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Open University - UK,"Soobedar, Z (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Dept Econ, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",z.soobedar@open.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The present paper works to fill that gap and find three main results. First, when there exist positive externalities in the accumulation of human capital, it is optimal to subsidize education and to tax births. Second, when the Social Welfare Function does not consist of the average utility, the social returns on educational investments can be weaker than the private returns when the optimal population growth rate is negative. In this case, the optimal economic policy consists in subsidizing births and taxing education. Finally, when the health expenditure is introduced as another source of positive externalities, it can be optimal to tax the parental health expenditure to decentralize the first-best path even if this expenditure is always too low at the laissez-faire equilibrium.","[Baudin, Thomas] CORE, Bur B 117, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Baudin, Thomas] IRES, Loveland, CO USA",,"Baudin, T (通讯作者)，CORE, Bur B 117, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",thomas.baudin@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,40,10,10,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Once we introduce the appropriate controls, CU trade effects are shown to range around 50%. We also highlight that the practice of reporting average CU effects generates misleading results.

The model provides estimates of the structural preferences of women that can be used to study the effect of various policy reforms.

Additionally, the process of retail market integration has followed a U-shaped trajectory with many domestic markets being better integrated - as measured by the average dispersion of retail prices - at mid-century than in the 1990s.

Assumptions about the level of consumers' financial literacy frequently influence the formulation of regulatory policy, whether tacitly or explicitly and many national governments are actively engaged in financial education programs of various sorts. Indeed since at least 2003 the OECD has actively developed and encouraged such efforts. An underlying supposition of these initiatives is that more financial literacy is socially preferable to less. We examine that supposition in a formal analytic framework and demonstrate plausible conditions under which it is not true. We discuss implications of this for policy-makers and regulators alike.","[Williams, Oliver J.] Scalpel Res Ltd, London W1K 5EH, England; [Satchell, Stephen E.] Univ Cambridge, Trinity Coll, Cambridge CB2 1TQ, England; [Satchell, Stephen E.] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of Sydney,"Williams, OJ (通讯作者)，Scalpel Res Ltd, 84 Brook St, London W1K 5EH, England.",oliver.williams@scalpelresearch.com,,,,,,,62,11,14,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In particular, in Mexico, the movements in productivity in the data are associated with changes in institutions, so that we can explain productivity shocks to a large extent as shocks to the quality of institutions. We find that the model with shocks to the degree of protection of property rights can match the second moments in the data for Mexico very well. Moreover, the fit is better than that of the standard neoclassical model with full protection of property rights regarding the auto-correlations and cross-correlations in the data. Viewing productivity shocks as shocks to institutions is also consistent with the stylized fact of falling productivity and non-decreasing labor hours in Mexico over 1980-1994, which is a feature that the neoclassical model cannot Match.

When agents are risk-averse they need to make forecasts of the conditional variance of a stock's return. Recursive updating of both the conditional variance and the expected return implies several mechanisms through which learning impacts stock prices. Extended periods of excess volatility, bubbles, and crashes arise with a frequency that depends on the extent to which past data is discounted. A central role is played by changes over time in agents' estimates of risk.

We show that this approach is at odds with some of the empirical regularities across and within political systems. We then propose a legislative bargaining model to elucidate this puzzle. In the model, the policies of a confidence-dependent parliamentary government enjoy more predictable support from governing coalition members because their short-term policy goals are less important than the government's survival. Coalition support is stronger when the government has more agenda power and is weaker with a larger ruling coalition. We explore the empirical implications of these findings and their consequences for the comparative study of legislative institutions.","[Diermeier, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Vlaicu, Razvan] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Northwestern University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Diermeier, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,35,18,23,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using recently collected longitudinal data we find that grade advancement is strongly associated with scores on a baseline literacy and numeracy test. In grades 8-11 the effect of these scores on grade progression is much stronger for white and coloured students than for African students, while there is no racial difference in the impact of the scores on passing the nationally standardized grade 12 matriculation exam. We develop a stochastic model of grade repetition that generates predictions consistent with these results. The model predicts that a larger stochastic component in the link between learning and measured performance will generate higher enrollment, higher failure rates, and a weaker link between ability and grade progression. The results suggest that grade progression in African schools is poorly linked to actual ability and learning. The results point to the importance of considering the stochastic component of grade repetition in analyzing school systems with high failure rates. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that an increase in the leverage ratio causes the stock price to rise in the current period through a leverage effect, and will result in more borrowing and more stock purchase that pumps the stock price higher in the subsequent period, known as the pyramiding effect. There can also be a depyramiding effect when the price falls because lenders issue margin calls and force stock sales, contributing to further stock price plummeting. Price changes from depyramiding effect, however, may not take effect when margin calls are not triggered. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, decreasing leverage ratios leads to lower stock price volatility, measured by the variation of prices caused by an exogenous shock, when the shock is unanticipated. The influences of dispersion of beliefs and available investment funds on the relation between financial leverage and market volatility are also examined. When the shock is anticipated, we demonstrate that reducing leverage ratios may not lower stock price volatility, which poses an important challenge to future studies on this issue.","[Wu, Ho-Mou] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Guo, Wen-Chung] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Frank Yong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; National Taipei University; University of International Business & Economics,"Wu, HM (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hmwu@ccer.edu.cn,"Wu, Homou/HJH-9499-2023",,,,,,37,11,11,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We then aggregate the 14 regions to 5 regions, and estimate a similar common cycle. At this level of aggregation, we can assess the statistical significance and relative strengths of influence on the common cycle of monetary and fiscal policy variables and several external shock variables. Our results show that structural breaks associated with New Zealand's major economic policy reforms of the mid-1980s through to the early 1990s play an important role, and that New Zealand's region-specific growth cycles have exhibited considerable diversity. The variance contributions of region-specific cycles dominate common-cycle contributions, a result consistent with multivariate findings for Australasia, but contrary to evidence for the US and for Australian states. We also establish that during key periods, terms of trade and net immigration variables have had distinctive procyclical influences on the common cycle, that real government expenditure has had a modest crowding-out role, and that monetary policy has had no additional significant influence.","[Hall, Viv.

When the equilibrium involves the public firm acting as a leader, social welfare increases compared with the level in the absolute-profit-maximization case.

By most measures, internal migration in the United States is at a 30-year low. The widespread decline in migration rates across a large number of subpopulations suggests that broad-based economic forces are likely responsible for the decrease. An obvious question is the extent to which the recent housing market contraction and the recession may have caused this downward trend in migration: after all, relocation activity often involves both housing market activity and changes in employment. However, we find relatively small roles for both of these cyclical factors. While we will suggest a few other possible explanations for the recent decrease in migration, the puzzle remains. Finally, we compare US migration to other developed countries.

The pressure on savings spills over to other households. Both cross-regional and household-level evidence supports this hypothesis. This factor can potentially account for about half the actual increase in the household savings rate during 1990-2007.","[Wei, Shang-Jin] Columbia Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wei, Shang-Jin] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Zhang, Xiaobo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wei, SJ (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023","zhang, xiaobo/0000-0002-4981-9565",,,,,42,412,489,33,303,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Starting from strong evidence against a simple linear Taylor rule, we model nonlinearities using logistic smooth transition regression (LSTR) models. The LSTR models with time-varying parameters consistently track actual interest rate movements better than a linear model with constant parameters. Our preferred LSTR model uses lagged interest rates as a transition variable and suggests that in times of recessions the Bank of England puts more weight on the output gap and less so on inflation. A reverse pattern is observed in non-recession periods. Parameters of the model change less frequently after 1992, when an inflation target range was announced. We conclude that for the analysis of historical monetary policy, the LSTR approach is a viable alternative to linear reaction functions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical results find the nonlinear response of REIT returns to expected and unexpected components of monetary policy. The unexpected component of monetary policy plays a more prominent role in influencing REIT returns than does the expected component of monetary policy. Specifically, unexpected contractionary monetary policy has a significantly adverse impact on REIT returns, and the adverse effect in a bust market is stronger than in a boom market. In addition, the unexpected monetary policy will also affect the boom-bust dynamics of REIT returns through its effect on the time-varying transition probability matrix. The tightening of the expected and unexpected components of monetary policy will enhance the probability that the REIT market will stay in the bust regime. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In our experiment, people play a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a partisan audience watching the choice. Two groups participated in each session; these groups could be both all-male, both all-female, or one all-male and one all-female. Groups were separated into two rooms. Each person in the group played the game once with an audience of the same group and once with audience of the other group. Behavior is significantly affected by the interaction of gender and place: males cooperate substantially less often when observed by their peer group, while females cooperate substantially more often.

In the third quarter of 2009, the unemployment rate stood at 17.9%, the second-highest rate in the 27-nation EU and the highest rate in the euro area (EA-16). The exponential growth of the Spanish unemployment rate is the by-product of falling employment rates. However, there is a second explanation which is often overlooked by unemployment forecasters: changes in labour force participation rates. On the one hand, in times of recession participation rates tend to increase in order to safeguard sustainable household incomes. This phenomenon is known as the 'added-worker' effect. On the other hand, there is also an opposite effect in that individuals leave the labour force in recessions because chances to find employment are low. This is the 'discouraged-worker' effect. Applying a threshold cointegration model to Spanish quarterly data over the period 1976-2008, we find that the added-worker effect dominates the discouraged-worker effect, but only when unemployment is below 11.7%. Above this threshold, the two effects cancel each other out so that the participation rate is not influenced by further deteriorations of economic conditions. Since Spain recently passed the 11.7% unemployment threshold, our model predicts that there will be no further increases in the participation rate in the near future. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The support for a stochastic volatility model including jumps in both prices and volatility is strong and the model clearly outperforms the others in terms of a superior fit to data. Our estimation method allows us to obtain a detailed study of oil prices during two periods of extreme market stress included in our sample; the Gulf war and the recent financial crisis. We also address the economic significance of model choice in two option pricing applications. The implied volatilities generated by the different estimated models are compared and we price a real option to develop an oil field.

In a closed economy, we show that high-productivity firms are more likely to agglomerate because they benefit more from agglomeration than their low-productivity counterparts. However, trade liberalization, especially with a high-productivity partner, favours partial agglomeration; that is, low-productivity firms relocate away from the region where high-productivity firms agglomerate. Consequently, the welfare gap between the domestic regions of an economy narrows following trade liberalization. The latter result suggests that trade liberalization promotes regional economic development.On developpe un modele economique pour examiner l'agglomeration de firmes heterogenes a la suite de la liberalisation du commerce. Dans une economie fermee, on montre que les firmes a haute productivite sont davantage susceptibles de s'agglomerer parce qu'elles tirent plus d'avantages de l'agglomeration que les firmes a basse productivite. Cependant, la liberalisation du commerce, en particulier avec un partenaire a haute productivite, favorise l'agglomeration partielle, i.e., que les firmes a basse productivite se relocalise hors de la region ou les firmes a haute productivite s'agglomerent. En consequence, l'ecart de bien-etre entre les regions domestiques d'une economie s'amenuise a la suite de la liberalisation du commerce.

A (single-valued) solution for TU-games assigns a payoff distribution to every TU-game. A well-known solution is the Shapley value. In the literature various models of games with restricted cooperation can be found. So, instead of allowing all subsets of the player set N to form, it is assumed that the set of feasible coalitions is a subset of the power set of N. In this paper, we consider such sets of feasible coalitions that are closed under union, i.e. for any two feasible coalitions also their union is feasible. We consider and axiomatize two solutions or rules for these games that generalize the Shapley value: one is obtained as the conjunctive permission value using a corresponding superior graph, the other is defined as the Shapley value of a modified game similar as the Myerson value for games with limited communication.","[van den Brink, Rene; van der Laan, Gerard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Katsev, Ilya] Russian Acad Sci, St Petersburg Inst Econ & Math, St Petersburg 191187, Russia",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Economics & Mathematics Institute RAS; Institute for Regional Economic Studies Russian Academy of Sciences,"van den Brink, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Tinbergen Inst, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jrbrink@feweb.vu.nl; katsev@yandex.ru; glaan@feweb.vu.nl,,"Katsev, Ilya/0000-0001-9279-0086; van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706",,,,,19,14,14,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Our econometric analysis shows that the magnitude of the retrenchment in capital flows across countries is linked to the extent of international financial integration, its specific nature - with countries relying on bank flows being the hardest hit - as well as domestic macroeconomic conditions and their connection to world trade flows. - Gian-Maria Milesi-Ferretti and Cedric Tille.","[Milesi-Ferretti, Gian-Maria] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",International Monetary Fund,"Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,39,259,295,4,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The model is computed with an optimized Taylor-style interest rate rule that includes real exchange targeting, thus arguing in favour of an international dimension of monetary policy.","Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Sousa, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",tsousa@fe.unl.pt,"Sousa, Teresa/IAM-4541-2023; Sousa, Teresa/E-2546-2016","Sousa, Teresa/0000-0002-6183-512X",,,,,14,2,2,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,,,PORT ECON J,Port.

The correlation between consumers' valuation of high quality in each dimension is a key determinant of the feasibility of such signaling. A firm may use price alone as a signal, or price and quality together. Both signals tend to be used when the market is very uninformed, whereas price signaling alone tends to be used when the market is moderately informed. If high observable quality is inexpensive to provide, then it cannot signal high unobservable quality, and low observable quality is always an indication that unobservable quality is high.","St Edwards Univ, Austin, TX 78704 USA",,"Clements, MT (通讯作者)，St Edwards Univ, Austin, TX 78704 USA.",mattcl@stedwards.edu,,,,,,,13,3,4,1,10,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 7,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,20115,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-5,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865BN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298285800001,0

Estimation of a simultaneous equation switching regression model allows us to examine which market structure better characterizes the world oil market during the 1974-2004 period and to test whether switches between collusive and non-cooperative behaviour occurred. The null hypothesis that no switch occurred is rejected in favour of the alternative that both cooperative and non-cooperative behaviour was observed. We find that, although there were periods in which oil prices were measurably higher owing to collusion among OPEC members, overall OPEC has not been effective in systematically raising prices above Cournot competition levels. Our results suggest that, on average over the period of study, OPEC's behaviour is best described as Cournot competition in the face of a competitive fringe constituted by non-OPEC producers.","[Herrera, Ana Maria] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Douglas, Christopher C.] Univ Michigan Flint, Flint, MI USA; [Almoguera, Pedro A.] US Govt Accountabil Off, Washington, DC USA",Wayne State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan Flint,"Herrera, AM (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",AlmogueraP@gao.gov; ccdougla@umflint.edu; amherrera@wayne.edu,,"Herrera, Ana Maria/0000-0003-3583-2555",,,,,40,41,48,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Based on data from 1970 to 2006 and forecasting horizons of up to 12 quarters, there is surprisingly strong evidence that including money improves forecasting accuracy. The results are very robust with regard to alternative treatments of priors and sample periods. That said, there is also reason not to overemphasise the role of money. The predictive power of money growth for inflation is substantially lower in more recent sample periods compared with the 1970s and 1980s. This cautions against using money-based inflation models anchored in very long samples for policy advice.","[Berger, Helge] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Berger, Helge] Free Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany; [Osterholm, Par] Natl Inst Econ Res, Stockholm, Sweden",International Monetary Fund; Free University of Berlin,"Berger, H (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St,NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",hberger@imf.org,"Österholm, Pär/ABD-8486-2020","Österholm, Pär/0000-0002-4840-7649",,,,,63,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

It asks what are the elements in the mainstream paradigm that caused many economists to misjudge the state of the economy so dramatically in the years leading up to the 2007 credit crisis and the 2008-2009 recession. It scrutinizes the work of twelve economists who warned of the crisis and identifies, as the common elements in their thinking, financial assets, debt, the flow of funds and behavioral assumptions on uncertainty, bounded rationality and non-optimizing behavior. These are then contrasted to mainstream thinking. The conclusion is that economics, if it is to be relevant to reality, should stop neglecting money, wealth and debt, and turn away from an individualistic view and toward a systemic view of the economy.","Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Bezemer, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",d.j.bezemer@rug.nl,,,,,,,52,30,32,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We extend the investment game with one Sender and one Receiver to networked versions - one characterized by one Sender and two Receivers ([1S-2R]) and one characterized by two Senders and one Receiver ([2S-1R]) - under two information conditions, full and partial. We develop a comparative model of trust for the networked exchange environments and generate two hypotheses: (1) what counts as a signal of trust depends on investment behavior along the other link in the network and (2) this type of trust can be leveraged under full information, increasing the rate of cooperation on the side of the exchange with multiple traders. The results generally support our hypotheses: trust is comparative and under full information, the [1S-2R] network shows higher trustworthiness and the [2S-1R] network displays higher trust.

Specifically, the discussion focuses on the recent developments of RMB trading in the global foreign exchange market, cross-border trade settlement in RMB, the Hong Kong offshore market and China's policies relating to the RMB. The evidence suggests that the use of the RMB overseas, especially in trade financing and in the off-shore market, has increased rapidly in recent years. However, compared with the size of the Chinese economy, the current scale of the use of the RMB is quite small. Although the RMB has great potential to become an international currency, its acceptance in the global economy is affected by both economic and political factors.

The case of China is useful for understanding this problem because there is substantial time series and cross sectional variation in the ratio of utilized to contracted FDI (UC ratio), which is less than one in most province year observations. Provinces may believe that they are rewarded for reporting higher levels of contracted FIR which would lead to lower UC ratios and higher policy incentives in subsequent years. Alternatively, provinces may be rewarded for reporting data more accurately, which would lead to higher UC ratios and policy incentives in subsequent years. Empirical analysis supports the second, institutional theory and suggests that provinces may increase their rate of utilizing pledged FDI by strengthening their legal systems and reducing government bureaucracy. journal of Comparative Economics 39 (1) (2011) 92-107.

First, vertical mergers can be jointly unprofitable. Second, the buyer's preferred merger partner is almost always the seller with lower expected costs, and is typically the larger seller. Third, vertical mergers always reduce the unintegrated seller's profits, sometimes dramatically. Finally, vertical mergers can increase total welfare. Some of the results contrast qualitatively with unambiguous findings from models with symmetric sellers, which suggests that caution should be used in drawing general inferences from those models.

It concludes that fundamentals continue to anchor the market, but that speculative investment flows may bring about temporary departures from equilibrium. It is proposed that the type of volatility that matters most macroeconomically is medium-term price trends. The paper then discusses possible policy actions that could prevent or mitigate such trends, concluding that proposals solely related to the operation of the financial markets will not address the fundamental drivers of instability.

While we find that the performance elasticity of explicit CEO pay slightly increases subsequent to the IT law adoption for non-financial firms indicating an incentive-substitution effect, the overall change in levels seems modest. We explore the hypothesis that compensation for forgone IT profits in general is small because typically, firms lack at least one of the two necessary conditions for profitable IT: the existence of a liquid stock market imposing low costs of transactions and the presence of a small number of co-insiders, preventing the information rent to be competed away. Based on a difference-in-difference estimation, we indeed find that explicit pay increases more strongly for intensely traded firms and decreases for non-financial firms and insurance companies with a higher number of co-insiders. The combined effect is relatively small except for firms with the most liquid shares. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The first one is an information technology without agency costs (IT(P)), whereas the second one is the expertise of an agent subject to moral hazard, adverse selection and limited liability (IT(A)). First, we show that the principal does not necessarily benefit from access to additional information and thereby may prefer to ignore it. Second, we discuss different timings of information release, i.e., a disclosure contract offered to the agent after the principal announced the result of IT(P) , and a concealment contract where the agent exerts effort before IT(P) is checked. We find that concealment is superior whenever the quality of IT(P) is sufficiently low. Then, IT(P) is almost worthless under a disclosure contract, while it can still be exploited to reduce the agent's information rent under concealment. If the quality of IT(P) improves, disclosure can be superior as it allows to adjust the agent's effort to the updated expected quality of the project. However, even for a highly informative IT(P) , concealment can be superior as it mitigates the adverse selection problem.","[Feess, Eberhard] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Walzl, Markus] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany; [Walzl, Markus] Maastricht Univ, METEOR, Maastricht, Netherlands",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Maastricht University,"Feess, E (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",e.feess@frankfurt-school.de,,"Walzl, Markus/0000-0003-3732-7755",,,,,15,1,1,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

J,"Frot, E; Santiso, J",,,,"Frot, Emmanuel; Santiso, Javier",,,Herding in Aid Allocation,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN-AID; STOCK-PRICES; BEHAVIOR; RECIPIENTS; IMPACT,"P>This paper investigates a claim repeatedly made, but never tested, that aid donors herd. To do so it originally uses methodologies developed in finance to measure herding on financial markets, and adapts them to aid allocation. The motivation for studying herding is to improve our understanding of aid allocation beyond observable determinants. If herding is indeed present, then it is likely to shape aid patterns in a significant way by creating aid darlings, orphans, but also by exacerbating aid volatility. Our approach starts by carefully defining aid to avoid including herding-prone aid, such as humanitarian aid and debt relief, and the sets of donors and recipients. Once this is done, herding is measured by directly applying the indexes used in finance to yearly aid data. Results show herding is indeed present, but that it is small. A second step is to introduce modifications to better match the characteristics of aid allocation. The most important in the paper is to change the time horizon. Unlike traders, aid donors commit to an aid partnership over several years, and yearly variations may contain a large part of randomness. Instead of year-to-year changes, we instead use 3 and 5-year allocations to measure herding. With this modification herding is still found to be present, but also of a larger size. It is now similar to what is traditionally found on financial markets. The next, important step is to acknowledge that aid donors' allocation decisions almost surely follow similar determinants and changes in these determinants generate a lot of co-movements. Herding measures by definition interpret these simultaneous decisions as herding, when they merely reflect common views among donors (think about a natural disaster occurring in a country that dramatically increase aid needs). Herding determinants are carefully estimated and their contributions to herding measures are then removed to obtain an estimate free of the effects of observable variables that affect aid allocation. This procedure shows that, even after taking observable factors into account, herding is still present. It suggests other considerations drive herding behavior.","[Frot, Emmanuel] SITE, Stockholm Sch Econ, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Frot, Emmanuel] Microeconomix, F-75002 Paris, France; [Santiso, Javier] ESADE, Madrid 28036, Spain",Stockholm School of Economics; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Frot, E (通讯作者)，SITE, Stockholm Sch Econ, Sveavagen 65,POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",emmanuel.frot@hhs.se; javier.santiso@esade.edu,"Condal, Jaume/F-3631-2011",,,,,,38,36,42,0,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2011,64.0,1,,,,,54,74,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00494.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,705ES,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286112300003,0

VAR estimates clearly identify quite different policy responses during the two regimes.

J,"Ackello-Ogutu, C",,,,"Ackello-Ogutu, Chris",,,Managing Food Security Implications of Food Price Shocks in Africa,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Until the food price alarm went off, discussions on how to reduce hunger and malnutrition in Africa took place in an environment of declining food prices with estimates indicating that real food prices declined by about 75% between 1974 and 2005. However, since 2006, real food prices have been on the rise and although prices started to decline after mid-2008, they largely remained above their long-term trends. This paper provides a contextual overview of how African countries responded to the economic and welfare impacts of the food price crisis of 2006-08. The responses to the food crisis have been as varied as the African economies are diverse. In the short and medium terms, the policy options preferred by both governments and their development partners focused predominantly on social safety nets aimed at cushioning vulnerable communities and urban consumers from food inflation. The paper provides a critique of these responses and lays out broad outlines for what must be done in order for African agricultural sectors to be provided with the right investments and incentives to produce sufficient food and lay the basis for broad-based and sustainable economic growth.","[Ackello-Ogutu, Chris] Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ackello-Ogutu, Chris] Resource Management & Policy Anal Inst REMPAI, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Ackello-Ogutu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, Nairobi, Kenya.",ackello@accesskenya.co.ke,,,,,,,24,7,9,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

The main goal of this article is to verify whether the extent of the gender pay gap varies between highly- and low-educated workers, and whether or not the role played by gender differences in characteristics and in market rewards is similar in the two groups. We apply quantile regression analysis and an adaptation of the procedure suggested by Machado and Mata (2005) to evaluate the predicted wage gap at different points of the female wage distribution scale. The analysis is carried out on the Italian sample of the last available year of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). We show that the extent and the trend of the gap predicted across the female distribution is sharply different between groups with diverse educational levels. In the case of low-educated workers, although the predicted gap is largely explained by differences in rewards, lower levels of education or experience are responsible for the gap, especially on the right-hand side of the distribution. On the contrary, highly-educated females have better characteristics than highly-educated men that partially compensate the rather high difference in returns, in particular at the extremes of the distribution.","[Addabbo, Tindara; Favaro, Donata] Ctr Household Income Labour & Demog Econ CHILD, I-41100 Turin, Italy; [Addabbo, Tindara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, RECent, CAPP, Modena, Italy; [Favaro, Donata] Univ Padua, Dept Econ M Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Padua,"Favaro, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Household Income Labour & Demog Econ CHILD, I-41100 Turin, Italy.",donata.favaro@unipd.it,"; Addabbo, Tindara/C-5557-2016","FAVARO, DONATA/0000-0003-1174-5027; Addabbo, Tindara/0000-0002-1861-4065",,,,,24,32,33,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One of those requisites is social life. If we believe that social life is an innate trait of all human beings, then we should accept that human beings sometimes have to live with others who are different from them in their ideas, attitudes, beliefs and theoretical and religious principles. Differences in creation of human beings and the fact that God has stipulated that He created all people alike(1) shows that differences in ideas, beliefs and religious principles are acquired, relative, and variable. The most important reason for this is that human beings can easily change attitudes, religion, or their place. If such differences were part of human nature, it would have been impossible to change them. The main question of this article is what methods, principles and strategies have been offered by Islam to its followers to enable them live with other human beings, who do not share their thoughts and ideology, in peace. The article has taken a modem approach to this issue so as to be useful to Muslims' interactions with other people. The word Islam in this article is taken to mean 3 collection of Quran, Sunna of Prophet Mohammad (S) and conduct of Imam Ali (AS) which will be taken as the basis for discussion. Some of the most important strategies which Islam has offered for peaceful coexistence have been specified in Quran and Surma and others need more search. discussion and comments and should be delineated through scientific endeavor.","[Alikhani, Ali Akbar] Univ Tehran, Iranian Inst Social & Cultural Studies, Tehran 14174, Iran",University of Tehran,,AliakbarAlikhani@gmail.com,"Alikhani, Ali Akbar/HGC-7736-2022",,,,,,26,1,1,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,461,468,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800087,0

One crucial contribution of this article is the analysis of the interdependence across Product Market Regulation (PMR) and labour markets regulation (Employment Protection Legislation (EPL)). With the help of a dynamic fixed effect model with an interaction term, we estimate the marginal impact of EPL and PMR at different levels of the other interacted variable. To cope with problems related to the inclusion of time-invariant institutional variables in fixed effect models, we present results of regressions based on a new procedure, specifically designed to treat slowly changing variables. We build time-series data to account for the annual evolution of EPL, and use new data for unemployment insurance net replacement rates. Among other results, we find evidence of a positive (negative) effect of EPL (PMR) on employment performance as well as of substitution, rather than complementarity, between the two forms of regulation.","[Amable, Bruno] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Gatti, Donatella] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, PSE, CEPREMAP,IZA, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite Paris 13,"Amable, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",bruno.amable@ens.fr,"Gatti, Donatella/GRO-6034-2022","Gatti, Donatella/0000-0003-2836-4335; Demmou, Lilas/0000-0003-1256-704X",,,,,54,30,30,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J., Ottaviano, G. I. P., 2008. Market size, trade, and productivity. Review of Economic Studies 75 (1), 295-316). It then analyses how the two bargaining regimes change aggregate industry productivity and firm performance relative to a competitive labour market. While sector-level bargaining forces the least productive firms to exit and thus increases average productivity relative to the competitive benchmark, firm-level bargaining allows less productive firms to stay in the market and thus reduces average productivity. Sector-level bargaining also results in higher average output and profit levels than either firm-level bargaining or a competitive labour market The paper also shows that the choice between sector- and firm-level bargaining can involve a trade-off between product variety and product prices: Not only the average price level but also product variety tends to be lower under sector-level bargaining than under firm-level bargaining.

However, there is some evidence that humans are not the only animal species to possess these characteristics. Work from behavioral biology and neuroscience has indicated that some of these traits are present in other species, including other primates. Studying these behaviors in other species can inform us about the evolutionary trajectory of morality, helping us to understand how the behaviors evolved and which environmental characteristics were critical for their emergence. A brief historical look indicates that, while this evolutionary approach to human behavior is not always well received, this line of inquiry is not new. For instance Adam Smith, better known for his economics than his natural history, was clearly sympathetic with the view that moral behaviors are present in species other than humans. This paper focuses on how individuals respond to inequity, which is related to moral behavior. Recent evidence shows that non-human primates distinguish between inequitable and equitable outcomes. However, this is primarily in situations in which inequity hurts the self (e.g. disadvantageous inequity) rather than another (e.g. advantageous inequity). Studying such responses can help us understand the evolutionary basis of moral behavior, which increases our understanding of how our own morality emerged. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our main objective is to determine whether successes of past adopters have the tendency to speed up Twitter adoption, where past success is defined as the average followers per Tweet - a common measure of Twitter success - among all prior adopters. The data suggests that accelerated adoption can be associated with favorable past outcomes: increasing the average number of followers per Tweet among past adopters by a standard deviation ( of eight followers per Tweet) accelerates the adoption time by about 112 days. This acceleration effect is weaker for those who already have adopted Facebook and those who have access to information about a large number of past adopters. We later find a positive relationship between an adopter's own success and the success of adopters preceding him/her. Thus, there may exist benefits associated with adopting Twitter based on past successes of others.

To simplify the analysis, we focus on the effects of immigration flows on input prices. We find that immigration quotas almost always generate the highest capital-labor ratio (and thus the highest wage rate). We also provide an example in which immigration permits generate the lowest value of the capital-labor ratio when permits sales are wasted. Under this last assumption, we show that if the wealth of the median voter is low enough, immigration quotas will be chosen over immigration permits. If the median voter's wealth is high, then the issue of majority voting will be the system which delivers the lowest capital-labor ratio.","Univ Paris 02, Lab Econ Droit, CNRS, ERMES,EAC 4441, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Crettez, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, Lab Econ Droit, CNRS, ERMES,EAC 4441, 26 Rue Fosses St Jacques, F-75005 Paris, France.",bertrand.crettez@me.com,,"Crettez, Bertrand/0000-0001-5521-7926",,,,,28,2,2,0,5,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Analyses are based on efficiency calculations with 2001-02 FADN data for fieldcrop farms, and on the same sample's farmers' intentions to remain in the sector and to expand their area after EU accession under two scenarios: a hypothetical scenario of continuing pre-accession national policies, and a realistic scenario of fully decoupled SAP introduction with coupled national top-ups. Our results suggest that, before accession to the EU, the smallest inefficient farms remained in the sector thanks to policy support.

Since then, the single parameter form that has been used to estimate the starting price effect has been adapted to distinguish among strategically induced, Bayesian or yea-saying responses (Whitehead, 2002). Recent works, however, show that these diagnostics can be inaccurate if heterogeneity exists in the value of the updating parameter. This work allows a more flexible functional form, beyond the single updating parameter, to capture a potentially richer set of starting price effects that may operate in a single dataset. First we employ a finite mixture model to sort respondents into latent classes. The finite mixture model locates three distinct types (latent classes) of respondents, and each exhibits a discretely different starting price-affected behaviour in a subsequent regression. Heterogeneity does not follow a continuous distribution across one starting price effect, such as a Bayesian updating parameter, that might be captured by a random parameter estimator. Rather effects fall into discrete classes. Researchers will need to better match theory to the diverse array of starting price effects detected.","[Farmer, Michael C.; Belasco, Eric] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Belasco, Eric] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Farmer, MC (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Agr Sci Bldg,POB 42132, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",michael.farmer@ttu.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Economists use either unit values (ratios of household expenditure to quantity purchased) or community prices (enumerated from vendors in local markets) as proxies for market prices when estimating price elasticities with household survey data. Biases are believed to result from using unit values, due to measurement error and quality effects, but evidence on this issue is lacking and even less is known about community prices. This article provides an empirical evidence from Vietnam, which suggests that economists should exercise caution when estimating price elasticities from household surveys. A 14-food demand system is estimated alternatively with unit values or community prices, and the elasticity of calories with respect to rice prices is calculated. This elasticity is more than twice as large (-0.54 versus -0.22) when community prices are used rather than unit values. Hence, conclusions about the nutritional effects of rice price increases appear sensitive to data choices made by economists. More generally, this discrepancy suggests that the household survey databases commonly used by economists may not provide reliable estimates.","[Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Waikato; Stanford University,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873",,,,,15,9,10,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using panel data for 128 countries from 1970 to 2000, we analyze the behavior of main financial aggregates and of interest rates around 125 episodes of exchange rate stabilization and show that spreads between domestic and foreign interest rates as well as the real effective exchange rate are affected by the policy switch.

However, most of its salient characteristics are almost similar to the conventional property loans whereby most of the significant terms are just changed to Islamic based terms and aqad or contract is executed in order to make a property financing become Islamic. Truly, the issues that must be taken into account not only aqad and terms but they are much more than that. These irregularities exist owing to mismatch of knowledge and experience between the management of Islamic financiers and the Islamic scholars who sit on the Syariah Advisory Board of the Islamic financiers. There have been abundant negative comments by Islamic jurists and industry observers on Islamic Property Financing in Malaysia but there are hardly any recommendations to improve the same in term of compliance to Syariah regulations. In this article, critical appraisals and analysis is executed on the salient features of an Islamic Property Financing namely Syariah Perspectives, Ownership Transfer and Legal Documents, Profit Charged and Installment and lastly Redemption and Early Settlement. Subsequently, practical recommendations to improve the Islamic Property Financing in Malaysia are suggested so as to endeavor for a more comprehensive Islamic Property Financing that is in line with Islamic Syariah regulations which could assist customers to purchase properties yet could still contribute profits to the Islamic financiers/banks. Hopefully, more Islamic Property Financing products that are entirely in line with Syariah regulations could be offered to the public especially Muslims since a number of them still not fully confident in the adherence of the existing products to Islamic Syariah that are currently available in the market.","[Hassan, Hasroleffendy] Univ Teknol MARA, Dept Bank Management, Fac Business Management, Kedah Branch, Merbok 08400, Kedah, Malaysia",,,hasroleffendy@kedah.uitm.edu.my,"Hassan, Hasroleffendy/Y-6912-2019; Hassan, Hasroleffendy/P-6375-2018","Hassan, Hasroleffendy/0000-0001-5495-2830;",,,,,2,0,0,0,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,367,374,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800069,0

An advertising campaign precedes the firm's sales when the marginal product of advertisement is sufficiently large (e. g., Amazon Kindle and Apple Macintosh), whereas sales of a new brand of a familiar product may start without advertising (e. g. Crocs shoes). When the firm chooses both advertising and sales policies, the optimal solutions can be divided into two groups typified by low and high demand elasticities. When demand elasticity is low, a massive increase in the quantity sold causes a considerable drop in the product's price. Therefore, the firm prefers to use advertising, rather than excess sales. With high demand elasticity, a massive increase in the quantity sold reduces the price only marginally, thus sales becomes a relatively cheap way to build up the stock of goodwill, compared with advertising.","[Hochman, Gal] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hochman, Oded] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Hochman, Eithan; Heiman, Amir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Leung, PingSun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Ben Gurion University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Hochman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",galh@berkeley.edu; oded@bgu.ac.il; hochman@agri.huji.ac.il; heiman@agri.huji.ac.il; psleung@hawaii.edu,"Heiman, Amir/S-1377-2016",,,,,,26,0,0,0,15,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The instrumental variable results are robust to weak instruments.

However, lending decisions of the SOCBs were still determined by state directives instead of profitability consideration. This paper argues that although the post-WTO banking reforms have accomplished staggering results, China's SOCBs need an overhaul of ownership structure if China aims to develop a full-fledged market-based banking system. It also argues that the current banking reforms are not comprehensive enough to sustain China's long-term economic development because there still remain noticeable capital constraints facing small- and medium-sized private enterprises, particularly those in rural areas.","Open Univ Hong Kong, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Metropolitan University,"Kwong, CCL (通讯作者)，Open Univ Hong Kong, Sch Arts & Social Sci, 30 Good Shepherd St, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",clkwong@ouhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,43,13,14,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The four attributes of economic growth are input growth, adjusted scale effect, technical progress, and efficiency growth. A stochastic frontier model with a translog production and incorporated with human capital is used to estimate the growth attributes in China. The empirical results show that input growth is the major contributor to economic growth and human capital is inadequate even though it has a positive and significant effect on growth. Technical progress is the main contributor to productivity growth and the scale effect has become important in recent years. The impact of technical inefficiency is statistical insignificant in the sample period. The relevant policy implication for a sustainable post-reform China economy is the need to promote human capital accumulation and improvement in technical efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One can conclude that financial institutions can further enhance efficiency by adopting Self-Service Technologies (SSTs) such as telephone and Internet banking, which can substantially reduce their service delivery costs.","[Moffat, Boitumelo Dudu; Valadkhani, Abbas] Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Valadkhani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Econ, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",abbas@uow.edu.au,"Valadkhani, Abbas/I-6960-2019","Valadkhani, Abbas/0000-0003-2538-1949",,,,,14,10,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Specialization allows countries to devote their scarce resources to the production of the particular goods and services for which that country has a comparative advantage. It is so reached of economies of scale and increases itself the global production possibility frontier. Protectionism imagines by contrast free trade restraining trade between states through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas and variety of other government regulations designed to discourage imports and prevent from abroad.

First, the contribution of world comovements to domestic output growth has decreased over the post-WWII period. The contribution of regional comovements, however, has increased significantly. Second, the share of inflation variation due to a global factor has become larger since 1985. Third, over most of the post-WWII period, international comovements within regions have accounted for the bulk of fluctuations in business cycle and inflation. Fourth, prices have become significantly less countercyclical during the post-1984 sample, with the largest contribution due to external developments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Representing both tolerance and diversity, we test an index of community-level ethnic diversity against the location decisions of workers in the culture occupations, a key component of the creative class, in the recently defined Canadian Framework for Cultural Statistics. Supporting past studies, we find that greater ethnic diversity is consistent with a higher cultural occupations share in urban communities (though not rural). However, even for urban areas, growth in cultural occupation workers over the past 15 years is not affected by prior ethnic diversity. The culture workers' share in an urban community, once established, appears highly persistent, suggesting that policy aimed at enhancing the livability of a community through increasing its cultural footprint appears to be misguided.

En representant tant la tolerance que la diversite, nous testons un index de diversite ethnique a l'echelon communautaire en fonction des decisions de localisation des travailleurs dans les activites culturelles, element cle de la classe creative, dans le Cadre des Statistiques culturelles au Canada, defini recemment. A l'appui d'etudes precedentes, il nous semble qu'une diversite technique majeure va de pair avec un role superieur des activites culturelles dans les communautes urbaines (et non rurales). Toutefois, meme dans les zones urbaines, l'expansion des travailleurs dans le secteur des activites culturelles au cours des 15 dernieres annees n'est pas affectee par une diversite ethnique precedente. Une fois qu'elle a ete etablie, la part des travailleurs du secteur culturel dans la communaute urbaine semble extremement persistante, en indiquant ainsi qu'une politique visant a renforcer la qualite de vie d'une communaute par le biais de l'augmentation de sa presence culturelle serait erronee. Creacion de la comunidad cultural: diversidad etnica frente a aglomeracion Extracto Siguiendo el trabajo de Richard Florida y Jane Jacobs, la tolerancia junto con el talento y la tecnologia se dan a entender para atraer a la 'clase creativa', percibida como clave para estimular el dinamismo economico en la economia del conocimiento. Representando tanto a la tolerancia como a la diversidad, ensayamos un indice de diversidad etnica a nivel de comunidad frente a las decisiones de emplazamiento de trabajadores en las Ocupaciones de Cultura, un componente clave de la clase creativa, en el recientemente definido Marco Canadiense de Estadisticas Culturales. Apoyando estudios pasados, descubrimos que una mayor diversidad etnica es consistente con un reparto mas alto de ocupaciones culturales en comunidades urbanas (aunque no rurales). No obstante, incluso en las areas urbanas, el crecimiento de los trabajadores de ocupacion cultural durante los ultimos 15 anos no se ha visto afectado por diversidad etnica previa. Una vez establecido, el reparto de trabajadores de cultura en una comunidad parece ser muy persistente, lo que sugiere que las politicas dirigidas a mejorar los medios de vida de una omunidad a traves de aumentar su huella cultural parecen ser erroneas.

Daily data is used to assess pairwise relationships between individual EMU nations and 'lead' nation Germany, to assess the hypothesis that Germany was the dominant European nation prior to EMU. By and large our econometric investigations support this hypothesis, and lead us to conclude that the only European nation to lose monetary policy independence in the light of monetary union was Germany. Our results have important policy implications. Given that the loss of monetary policy independence is generally viewed as the main cost of monetary unification, our findings suggest a reconsideration of the costs and benefits of monetary integration. A country can only lose what it has, and in Europe the countries that joined EMU - spare Germany - apparently did not have much to lose, at least not in terms of monetary independence. Instead, they actually gained monetary policy influence by getting a seat in the ECB's governing council which is responsible for setting interest policy in the euro area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the shift in monetary policy regime to inflation targeting has reduced the volatility of the real interest rate and increased the persistence of real interest rate deviations from the mean.

We consider several explanations. First, we find that the incidence of financial crises is related to the dampening of the effect of financial deepening on growth. Excessive financial deepening or too rapid a growth of credit may have led to both inflation and weakened banking systems which in turn gave rise to growth-inhibiting financial crises. Excessive financial deepening may also be a result of widespread financial liberalizations in the late 1980s and early 1990s in countries that lacked the legal or regulatory infrastructure to exploit financial development successfully. However, we find little indication that liberalizations played an important direct role in reducing the effect of finance. Similarly, there is little evidence that the growth of equity markets in recent years has substituted for debt financing and led to a reduced role of financial deepening on growth.

We expect an endogenous relationship between quality of life and population growth, and we question whether the usual assumption that quality of life decreases with population growth holds. To answer this question we propose a simultaneous equation model, which is estimated assuming the spatial dimension of the data. We perform our exercise in a dynamic local framework, the metropolitan area of the city of Barcelona (Spain), in the period 1991-2004. Our results confirm the importance of quality of life in population growth, plus, if any, a positive impact of population growth on quality of life growth. Interestingly we find that spatial lags of the variables are particularly important, as services are not homogeneously provided in the territory.

Le cas de la zone metropolitaine de Barcelone Resume La presente communication s'efforce d'identifier le role de la qualite de la vie dans la determination des tendances actuelles de localisation de la population au sein d'une zone metropolitaine. Nous prevoyons un rapport endogene entre la qualite de la vie et l'accroissement demographique, et nous tentons d'etablir si l'hypothese usuelle, d'apres laquelle la qualite de vie diminue au fur et a mesure de l'augmentation de la population, est toujours valable. Pour repondre a cette question, nous proposons un modele a equation, que l'on estime sur la base des dimensions spatiales des donnees. Nous realisons cet exercice dans un cadre local dynamique, a savoir la zone metropolitaine de la ville de Barcelone (en Espagne) au cours de la periode 1991-2004. Nos resultats confirment l'importance de la qualite de vie dans l'accroissement demographique, plus, le cas echeant, un impact positif de l'accroissement demographique sur l'amelioration de la qualite de vie. Il est interessant de noter que les retards spatiaux des variables sont particulierement importants, car les services ne sont pas assures de facon homogene dans le territoire.

We focus on two previously neglected dimensions of the cross effects. First, we examine whether a halo effect (i.e. promotion for one US commodity positively effects demand for another US commodity) for US commodities exists. Second, we look at whether US grain export promotion has public goods characteristics, that is does US grain promotion have a halo effect on grain demand for other countries? We use a Linear Approximation of an Almost Ideal Demand System (LA/AIDS) model for US and non-US rice, wheat and sorghum that include US export promotion as one of the explanatory variables. Our goal is to provide further empirical evidence for the halo effect issue by using US grains as a case study since this sector has not been previously explored. In addition to estimating own and cross export promotion elasticities, the magnitude of cross effects on US market share for grain commodities are simulated for several policy scenarios involving alternative export promotion levels.","[Rusmevichientong, Pimbucha; Kaiser, Harry M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Kaiser, HM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, 349 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hmk2@cornell.edu,"Rusmevichientong, Pimbucha/AAK-6410-2020",,,,,,24,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By examining different dimensions of economic freedom, we find that not all are equally regressive on bank efficiency. We find that the impact of business freedom to be positive, implying that higher (lower) freedom for entrepreneurs to start businesses increases (reduces) bank efficiency. Similarly, monetary freedom is positively related to bank efficiency levels, indicating the importance of a stable and reliable monetary policy to business environment.

I use annual state level panel data for the period 1983 to 2000 to estimate static and dynamic health production function models. I find no compelling evidence that greater aggregate utilization of medical care from application of existing technology improves population health by lowering mortality in the short run or long run. My results suggest that development of new medical technologies that diffuse rapidly throughout the nation and at different rates across states may well explain much of the decline in the age-adjusted death rate over the past several decades, as well as persistent differences in mortality across geographic regions.

This paper is an attempt to describe the US subprime mortgage crisis in the framework of 'balance sheet economics', which was originally proposed by Stone (1966) and Klein (1977; 1983). Since it is almost impossible to collect all the balance sheets of economic entities, we use flow-of-funds accounts instead to simulate the negative consequences resulting from home mortgage delinquencies. We show that the pass-through sequence converges when the original delinquency is made up by loss of net worth in any of the economic entities. Most of the eventual loss is incurred by 'Households and Nonprofit Organizations' and 'Rest of the World'. A portion of pass-through loss is eventually incurred by foreign countries with excess external assets, such as Japan, Ireland, etc.","Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tsujimura, Masako] Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tsujimura, Kazusuke] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University; Keio University; Keio University,"Tsujimura, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Tokyo, Japan.",mizosita@sanken.keio.ac.jp,,,,,,,36,11,11,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Two proxies of demand structure, the Balassa index and the absolute value of the difference in per capita Gross Domestic Products (GDPs) of trading partners, are used to capture the Linder effect. In addition, two measures of bilateral trade, the Grubel and Lloyd (GL) index, and the value of bilateral trade are used as the dependent variable. This study investigates the role of the Linder effect in explaining the trade of 37 differentiated agri-food and beverage products categorized into eight product groups: cereals, fresh fish, frozen fish, vegetables, fresh fruit, processed fruit, tea and coffee and alcoholic beverages. The data covers trade across 52 developed and developing countries from 1990 to 2000. The type of proxy used for the Linder effect and the way in which bilateral trade is measured influence the outcome of the statistical tests for the Linder effect. The Linder effect for cereals, frozen fish, vegetables, processed fruits and tea and coffee, using the value of trade as the dependent variable, is often accepted, but it is generally rejected when the GL index is used as the measure of trade intensity. In brief, the results do not provide strong support for the Linder effect in the trade of differentiated agri-food products.","[Ul Haq, Zahoor; Meilke, Karl D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Ul Haq, Zahoor] NW Frontier Prov Agr Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan",University of Guelph; Agricultural University Peshawar,"Ul Haq, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",zahoor.haq1@gmail.com,,"Haq, Zahoor/0000-0001-6813-6746",,,,,27,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is therefore a country for which achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be a high priority. While exact data are difficult to obtain, Myanmar is performing poorly across most of the MDG targets. This is partly an unintended but direct consequence of the international sanctions and concomitant reduced aid flows into Myanmar. Myanmar receives the lowest level of aid per person of any of the 50 Least Developed Countries, raising the very direct question of whether the MDGs are relevant or achievable in Myanmar. Failure to achieve the MDGs could have serious implications in 2015 on future international funding and on reform programmes in the country. This paper considers how the political goals of the international community negatively impact upon the ability to achieve the MDGs and proposes a way forward by increasing aid and by tailoring the MDGs to the Myanmar context, as several regional neighbours have done.","Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, Sch Int & Polit Studies, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Ware, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, Sch Int & Polit Studies, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia.",anthony.ware@deakin.edu.au,"Ware, Anthony/AHE-0616-2022","Ware, Anthony/0000-0002-3203-5908",,,,,61,6,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Sticky prices or wages allow for larger multipliers than in a neoclassical model, though the size of the multiplier depends crucially on the monetary policy response. A multiplier well in excess of one is possible when monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound, and in this case welfare increases if government purchases expand to partially fill the output gap that arises from the inability to lower interest rates.

This paper introduces an approach that can measure fishermen's responsiveness to stock changes more accurately. In order to deal with the challenge of the latent fish stock, I adopt the method proposed by Zhang and Smith (2011) that derives a stock index from a heterogeneous production function. I use the imputed stock proxy in a count data model that describes fishing trip frequency. By these two steps, I can estimate the stock elasticity of fishing mortality. In the empirical study of the reef-fish fishery in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, I find that the popular method that uses catch rate as a stock proxy significantly underestimates fishermen's responses to stock changes. This result suggests that policy predictions based on the traditional method are overly optimistic.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Zhang, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",junjiezhang@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,32,5,6,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

EU countries are divided into two groups according to their current situation with respect to the adoption of the euro. Financial integration before the adoption of the euro is analyzed for the countries that adopted the euro in 1999. Similarly, current financial integration is evaluated for non-euro EU countries. Besides the importance of comparing the situation of the non-euro EU countries with the situation of the euro EU countries previous to the euro adoption, which may be useful to evaluate an eventual decision of the non-euro members to adopt the euro, it is interesting to analyze the performance of Generalized Maximum Entropy. Generalized Maximum Entropy has the ability to estimate the parameters of a regression model without imposing any constrains on the probability distribution of errors and it is robust even when we have ill-posed problems. Overall our results suggest that the degree of financial integration on non-euro countries is lower than the degree of financial integration that existed among euro adopting countries before the adoption of the euro.","[Ferreira, Paulo; Dionisio, Andreia; Pires, Cesaltina] Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, P-7000 Evora, Portugal",University of Evora,"Ferreira, P (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000 Evora, Portugal.",pjsf@uevora.pt; andreia@uevora.pt; cpires@uevora.pt,"Pires, Cesaltina/A-3871-2010; Dionisio, Andreia/C-7299-2009; Ferreira, Paulo/P-9622-2016","Pires, Cesaltina/0000-0001-8024-8935; Dionisio, Andreia/0000-0002-4289-9312; Ferreira, Paulo/0000-0003-1951-889X",,,,,36,9,11,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Factors driving overvaluation are housing demand shocks before 2006 and post-2006 macroeconomic shocks. Wealth effects from equity markets are also important.

Empirical evidence shows that countries endowed with better institutions present higher TFP growth rates and faster rates of technology adoption and, as a result, are the ones that are more rapidly closing the gap with the frontier. Conversely, countries lacking a minimum institutional level diverge in the long-run and do not to catch up. Some institutions, however, play an ambiguous role in the creation and adoption of technology. We find that the tightening of Property Rights reduces the ability of followers to freely imitate technology thus slowing down their catch-up rate. This negative effect is stronger the farther away the countries are from the frontier. Other institutional categories such as openness to trade, instead, benefit both leaders and followers.

In this paper we exploit a detailed NAMEA-based dataset to explore the evidence regarding the dynamic trade-off or joint dynamics, between economic and environmental productivities in the Italian economy. The quite long period of observations (1993-2006) allows a robust ex post dynamic assessment. Sectoral heterogeneity and variance in emission-economic productivity relationships is fully captured; the panel is well balanced. We do not observe joint economic-environmental productivities in the case of CO, emissions per unit of labour and relative delinking performance seem to worsen since the late 90's, as shown by elasticities and some structural breaks. This evidence gives food for thought, since the stagnation period experienced by Italy seems to have affected its environmental efficiency performances. CO, per unit of value added instead correlates with labour productivity showing a joint dynamic efficiency improvement. SOx analyses again show the presence of relevant structural breaks that fully explain the reduction of SOx per unit of labour or technical efficiency. A joint productivity dynamic relationship is observed for SOx on both value added and labour, with slightly larger elasticities. The analyzed period was characterized by a sharp increase of globalization trends. The economic globalization we consider through trade openness indicators interestingly appears to be a driver of emission efficiency with different effects for CO, and SOx. Nevertheless, the trade-environment relationships at sector level need further examinations by means of decomposition and input-output frameworks that could fruitfully complement NAMEA-based analyses.","[Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Univ Ferrara, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ Ist Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Zoboli, Roberto] Univ Cattolica Milano, I-20123 Milan, Italy",University of Ferrara; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ Ist Terr, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",massimiliano.mazzanti@unife.it; roberto.zoboli@unicatt.it,"Zoboli, Roberto/F-5974-2015","Zoboli, Roberto/0000-0003-4662-5949; mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942",,,,,61,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

However, an important institution has been neglected so far: independent auditing institutions with an extended mandate to audit the budget draft and individual policy proposals. We argue that such auditors improve transparency and provide essential information on the impact of policy proposals on common pool resources, which leads to less wasteful spending. We empirically analyze the impact of such auditors on fiscal policy at the Swiss local level. Auditors who can evaluate and criticize policy proposals ex ante to policy decisions, significantly reduce the general tax burden and public expenditures. The results are similar for different datasets and robust to various changes in the econometric specification. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (4) (2010) 357-380.

It is shown that when an insurance agreement suffers from enforcement problems, constraints on individual savings behaviour can enable the group to sustain greater cooperation. This result provides a motivation for a variety of social norms observed in traditional societies which discourage 'excessive' accumulation of wealth by individuals. The paper also shows that social norms that discourage savings are more likely to benefit poorer communities and thus, paradoxically, cause them to fall further behind even as it serves a useful purpose.

We use the Quadratic Assignment Procedure, a non-parametric permutation test, to adjust for the particular error structure of network data. We find that respondents strongly coordinate their choice of mobile phone providers, but only if their provider induces network effects.

We use a new international panel dataset on production and trade compiled by the World Bank. As an intermediate step we calculate Hicks-neutral productivity indices that vary across industries, time, and countries. We find that own-TFP is robustly associated with industry shares across time and countries and that, after correcting for these productivity differences, output shares are related to factor endowments (Rybczynski effects) in a plausible way. Once Rybczynski effects are controlled for, we find little evidence of demand-side policies (import tariffs) affecting the allocation of resources; we find, however, more role for supply-side policies as the relative size of capital-intensive industries is positively associated with infrastructure-capital endowments.","[Cadot, Olivier] Univ Lausanne, World Bank, Fac Business, CERDI,CEPR, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cadot, Olivier] CEPREMAP, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; The World Bank,"Cadot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, World Bank, Fac Business, CERDI,CEPR, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",ocadot@worldbank.org; juliya.shakurova@unil.ch,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We employ the event study methodology to examine the abnormal returns in crude oil spot and futures markets around OPEC conference and SPR announcement dates between 1983 and 2008. Our findings regarding OPEC announcements indicate an asymmetry in that only OPEC production cut announcements yield a statistically significant impact with the impact diminishing for longer maturities. We also find that the persistence of returns following OPEC production cut announcements creates substantial excess returns to investors who take long positions on the day following the end of OPEC conferences. In the case of SPR announcements, we find that the government's use of this program initiates a short-run market reaction following the announcement date. Furthermore, our tests of cumulative abnormal returns suggest that the market reacts efficiently to SPR announcements providing support for the use of the strategic reserves as a tool to stabilize the oil market. Our findings have significant policy implications for investors and are useful in designing effective energy policy strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

S. postwar period economic downturns, employment recovers to its prerecession level within months of the output trough. However, during the past two recoveries, employment has taken up to three years to achieve its prerecession benchmark. We propose a formal empirical model of business cycles with recovery periods to demonstrate that the past two recoveries have been statistically different from previous experiences. We find that this difference can be attributed to a shift in the speed of transition between business cycle regimes. Moreover, we find this shift results from both durable and nondurable manufacturing sectors losing their cyclical characteristics. We argue that this finding of acyclicality in post-1980 manufacturing sectors is consistent with previous hypotheses (e.g., improved inventory management) regarding the reduction in macroeconomic volatility over the same period.

These parameters identify treatment effects on the set of compliers under the monotonicity assumption. The distributions of covariates, the treatment dummy, and the binary instrument are not specified in a parametric form, making the model semiparametric. We derive the semiparametric efficiency bounds for both conditional models and unconditional models.

The illiquidity of this market results from a transitory price impact that is captured by the transaction costs that are convex in the number of shares traded by an investor. The linear component in these costs defines a no-trading zone, while the nonlinear component does not allow trading the stock at an arbitrary rate. The portfolio choice problem is solved when the stock path is continuous and when the stock may crash. We find that an economy could be in states where the conditional liquidity premium is of the same order of magnitude as the historical risk premium of the stock market. If the illiquid stock undergoes crashes, then in many states, an investor demands a premium for crashes that is much higher than that in the liquid market. Finally, we study the shape of the no-trading zone when the nonlinearity in the transitory price impact is strong or moderate. We find that this shape is significantly different from that when the transitory price impact is linear. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

But erratic US monetary and financial policies have upset the American and world economies so as to make foreigners unhappy. A weak and falling dollar led to the great price inflations of the 1970s and to disastrous asset bubbles in the noughties. It aggravated the post-War World's three great oil shocks. The asymmetrical nature of the dollar standard also makes many Americans unhappy because they cannot control their own exchange rate. Although nobody loves the dollar standard, it is a remarkably robust institution that is too valuable to lose and too difficult to replace.

We find a paradoxical effect of state-owned banks on regional development: their credits contribute significantly to the growth of more developed provinces, whereas they fail to encourage the well-being of less developed provinces. On the other hand, credits provided by private banks, in general, positively impact the per capita real gross domestic product (GDP) in both developed and less developed provinces. Contrary to their purpose of existence, our results suggest that state-owned banks did not reduce economic disparity among Turkish provinces. In the trade-off between growth and income disparity, our results suggest that state-owned banks should improve their lending behaviour, especially in the less-developed regions, in order to broaden their development role to the whole economy.","[Onder, Zeynep; Ozyildirim, Suheyla] Fac Business Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",,"Önder, Z (通讯作者)，Fac Business Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",zonder@bilkent.edu.tr; suheyla@bilkent.edu.tr,,,,,,,36,14,14,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We devise an econometric procedure to identify shape factors, propose a dynamic model for the yield curve, develop a corresponding arbitrage pricing theory, derive interest rate pricing formulae, and study the analytical properties exhibited by a finite factor restriction of rate dynamics that is cross-sectionally consistent with a family of exponentially weighed polynomials. We also conduct an empirical analysis of cross-sectional risk affecting US swap, Euro bond, and oil markets. Results support the conclusion whereby shape factors outperform the classical yield (resp., price) factors (i.e., level, slope, and convexity) in explaining the underlying fixed income (resp., commodity) market risk.

I simulate the model without and with borrowing constraints on investment, under monetary policy and technology shocks. I find that the stabilization properties of floating exchange rate regimes in face of foreign shocks are enhanced relative to fixed exchange rate in presence of credit frictions. In presence of symmetric and correlated shock, fixed exchange rates regimes can perform better than floating. This analysis can have important policy implications for accession countries joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II system and with high degrees of credit frictions.

A taxonomy classifying papers according to the estimation method used (system of equations versus reduced-form), type of data (cross-sectional versus longitudinal), and type of policy variable (binary versus continuous) is provided. Through a historical reconstruction of the literature, the review starts by exploring the main features of early structural models and their recent refinements, by paying special attention to the issue of subsidy endogeneity. Subsequently, it discusses the second generation of the structural approach, the Selection-models, pointing out their ability in properly describing the two-player form of an R&D incentive scheme. It then goes on by treating and discussing more data-driven approaches, such as those based on Control-function and, more specifically, Matching. Finally, we address evaluation methods rooted in dynamic models of imperfect competition, considered as a novel promising stream of research within the last generation of 'harder' structural approaches. A discussion of features, advantages and drawbacks of each approach in a comparative perspective is offered to the reader, as well as suggestions for future improvements in this field of economic research.","Ceris CNR, Inst Econ Res Firms & Growth, Natl Res Council, Unit Rome, Rome, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Cerulli, G (通讯作者)，Ceris CNR, Inst Econ Res Firms & Growth, Natl Res Council, Unit Rome, Rome, Italy.",g.cerulli@ceris.cnr.it,,"CERULLI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-5892-3372",,,,,77,94,103,0,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Based on the quantile indicators, the average remaining firm lifespan in the specified period of time and the average survival time during a specific period of time, we conducted a comparative study using enterprises associated with different cities, industries, capital sizes, types of ownership and periods of establishment. The results show that there are great differences in firm survival that correlate with differences in city affiliation, industry, capital size, ownership type and period of establishment. Survival of Chinese enterprises is affected not only by the location of the business, the industry and the capital scale, which are usual players in the classical theory of industrial organization, but also by the nature of ownership and the time of establishment, which are determined by China's national context.

Our sufficient conditions require that each player choose freely and unilaterally those clubs he joins and also his activities within those clubs (subject to feasibility constraints). We refer to our conditions on rules as noncooperative free mobility. We also require that players' payoffs be additively separable in player-specific payoffs and externalities and that payoff externalities - a function of club membership, club activities, and crowding be identical across players (externality homogeneity).

Using the agent-based approach, this study investigates the learning speed of traders and their strategic collaboration in a dynamic market change of electricity. An example of such a market change can be found in the California electricity crisis (2000-2001). This study incorporates the concept of partial reinforcement learning into trading agents and finds that they have two learning components: learning from a dynamic market change and learning from collaboration with other traders. The learning speed of traders becomes slow when a large fluctuation occurs in the power exchange market. The learning speed depends upon the type of traders, their learning capabilities and the fluctuation of market fundamentals. The degree of collaboration among traders gradually reduces during the electricity crisis. The strategic collaboration among traders is examined by a large simulator equipped with multiple learning capabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional neo-classical view of the firm holds that the relative price of different financing only affects the way in which firms finance their activities However, the paper argues that the behaviour of different firms is affected by the composition of their financial liabilities. The elimination of limited liability for equity will tend to shift the structure of corporate liabilities towards debt instruments, which do have limited liability, or towards regular insurance premiums that would reallocate that liability among firms or shareholders The paper concludes that this shift in liabilities may stabilise financial markets, and this may eliminate some of the increasing concentration on speculation that is a feature of financial market capitalism.","[Toporowski, Jan] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Toporowski, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Res Ctr Hist & Methodol Econ, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Amsterdam,"Toporowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,,,,,,13,5,5,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using data for 1999-2006, we found that the industry has suffered from very low profit margins and returns on capital. Because input prices have been increasing, particularly since 2001, generating profits has become more difficult for the industry. Nevertheless, the industry achieved substantial productivity growth over the period examined. Although at an inadequate level, the profitability of the industry did show some signs of improvement. As long as this trend continues, the industry could obtain a decent level of profitability. Since 2005, however, the industry has faced a new challenge: the appreciation of the RMB. Based on 2006 data, we estimated the maximum rate of RMB appreciation that the industry would be able to sustain to be approximately 5 percent a year.","[Zhang, Yimin; Wang, Tianmu] China Europe Int Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",China Europe International Business School,"Zhang, YM (通讯作者)，China Europe Int Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zyimin@ceibs.edu; wtianmu@ceibs.edu,,,,,,,27,8,8,3,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2010,18.0,5,,,,,1,21,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01209.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,649UG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281798800001,0

The former method is found to be more accurate than the latter method. The paper also includes a detailed discussion of the valuation methodology. The results show that China's NFA are much lower than the cumulative current account surplus or the cumulative foreign exchange reserves. This leads to an underestimation of growth in foreign direct investment and an overestimation of the capacity of foreign exchange reserves to cope with possible withdrawals. Therefore, the Chinese Government should pay more attention to valuation issues to obtain more accurate measurement of NF A. Meanwhile, the Chinese monetary authority should relax its control on the foreign exchange settlement system, allow the private sector to hold a certain amount of foreign exchange, and encourage foreign assets to be denominated in RMB to solve structural problems, including entity and currency mismatch.","[Zhu, Chao] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,"Zhu, CO (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhuchaohezhuchao@126.com,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2010,18.0,5,,,,,90,104,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01214.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,649UG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281798800006,0

The emphasis on creative industries as a source of economic growth has highlighted the role of creativity and of copyright as an incentive for it. Little is known, however, about the economics of creativity or what economic incentives it responds to and this is a gap in our understanding of cultural supply that requires detailed research. The application of 'crowding' theory to the motivation for creativity forms a basis for that research, as does work in cultural economics on artists' labour markets. Likewise, economists have almost no empirical evidence about copyright as an incentive to creativity generated by individual creators. Research is, however, held back by data problems concerning the measurement of creative industry output and employment and especially of the supply of core creative content, making claims of the impact of copyright difficult to assess. The impetus for the article is to express these concerns and to emphasis the need for empirical research in this area.","[Towse, Ruth] Bournemouth Univ, CIPPM, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Towse, Ruth] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Bournemouth University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Towse, R (通讯作者)，Langsford Barn, Peter Tavy PL19 9LY, Tavistock, England.",Ruth.towse@gmail.com,,"Towse, Ruth/0000-0002-8020-7583",,,,,45,29,33,3,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2010,63.0,3,,,,,461,478,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00483.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,626AV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279939000008,0

Since then, Chile has had a relatively unregulated, competitive market in primary and secondary education. It therefore provides a unique setting in which to study how these reforms affected school attainment and labor market outcomes. This paper develops and estimates a dynamic model of school attendance and work decisions using panel data from the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Encuesta de Proteccion Social survey. Some individuals in the sample completed their schooling before the voucher reforms were introduced, while others had the option of using the vouchers over part or all of their schooling careers. The impacts of the voucher reform are identified from differences in the schooling and work choices made and earnings returns received by similar aged individuals who were differentially exposed to the voucher system. Simulations based on the estimated model show that the voucher reform significantly increased the demand for private subsidized schools and decreased the demand for both public and nonsubsidized private schools. It increased high school (grades 9-12) graduation rates by 3.6 percentage points and the percentage completing at least two years of college by 2.6 percentage points. Individuals from poor and non-poor backgrounds on average experienced similar schooling attainment gains. The reform also increased lifetime utility and modestly reduced earnings inequality.","[Bravo, David] Univ Chile, Microdata Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Mukhopadhyay, Sankar] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Todd, Petra E.] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Universidad de Chile; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; University of Pennsylvania,"Bravo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Microdata Ctr, Santiago, Chile.",dbravo@econ.uchile.cl; sankarm@unr.edu; ptodd@ssc.upenn.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P30 AG012836-16, P30 AG012836] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD044964, P2C HD044964, R24 HD044964-07] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,65,29,42,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

However, this was explained by Keynes in 1937 by recourse to a form of precautionary demand for money. In The GT, Keynes had actually merged the precautionary demand into the transactions demand for money, making it very difficult for any reader, friendly or unfriendly, to actually see what he meant in 1937. As a result, Keynes liquidity preference theory of the interest rate in the GT exhibited some important shortcomings that were the subject of many reexaminations, including one by Richard Kahn and another by James Tobin. The paper evaluates Keynes's views, Kahn's and Tobin's solutions to Keynes's dilemmas. At its conclusion it is shown why these themes remain relevant today, particularly when financial systems are in turmoil.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-22290080 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"de Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rua Pasteur 250, BR-22290080 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",fjccarvalho@uol.com.br,,,,,,,15,15,17,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

An empirical analysis,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Trade policy; Extensive margin; Trade growth; Fragmentation; Heterogeneity,GROWTH,With disaggregate tariff data we study the impact of changing tariffs on the range of goods countries export to the United States. Our probits with country and good effects show tariffs tend to have a statistically significant but small impact: at best 5% of the increasing extensive margin for 1989-1999 and 12% for 1996-2006 is explained by tariff reductions. This suggests the extensive margin has not amplified the impact of tariffs on trade flows to such an extent that the relatively moderate tariff reductions since WW II can explain the strong growth of world trade.

We assume that traders wish to maximize the expected final payoff of the hedging portfolio and the claims, and we avoid the use of utility functions. Instead, we model how traders are punished when taking excessive risks in practice. To do so, we introduce an extra reserve bank account, which earns a smaller rate of return than a standard deposit bank account. The reserve account should always contain a minimal amount of money, which depends on the risk that the trader's portfolio is exposed to. We focus on a specific example which uses option price sensitivities (the 'Greeks') to specify the risk. The resulting optimization problem can then be solved in a rather explicit form, and we show how the solution naturally leads to bid-ask spreads, prices which depend on the trader's current position and implied volatility smiles.

This paper investigates China's business fluctuations using quarterly real GDP data for the period 1978-2009. Our results show some evidence supporting Friedman's plucking model. We find that a ceiling effect of real output exists, and that negative asymmetric shocks significantly affect the transitory component, which captures the plucking downward behavior during the recession. The results also suggest that the basic asymmetric unobserved component model is not appropriate for directly modeling China's real output because the business cycle is inaccurately measured, but it works quite well when considering a structural break in the second quarter of 1992. The results reveal that although China's economy strengthened in the second quarter of 2009, it is essential for China's government to take further positive and effective measures to maintain sustainable development of the economy.","[Zheng, Tingguo] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Teng, Yujuan] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Song, Tao] Xiamen Univ, Inst Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Zheng, TG (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.",zhengtg@gmail.com; tengjuan3@gmail.com; songtao@xmu.edu.cn,"Zheng, TL/G-3974-2010",,,,,,30,3,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2010,18.0,4,,,SI,,103,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01207.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,625MQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279899800007,0

They have been the subject of considerable concern to policy-makers at the highest level for decades, yet little is known about the effectiveness of various alternative policies which may be used to combat them. In this paper we address this issue by analysing the effectiveness of a range of policies by both regional and central governments. We use a small model with various features of the Chinese economy: two regions (the interior and the coast), two industries (agriculture and manufacturing), inter-regional capital mobility, internal migration subject to the hukou system of household registration and some features of the Chinese tax and expenditure system. The model is calibrated to Chinese data and simulated to analyse the effects of a number of policies on a range of variables but focussing on per capita output disparities and welfare. We find that a policy reducing internal migration costs is effective in reducing the per capita output gap but does so at a substantial cost to the coast. Policies which improve agricultural productivity in the interior region are most likely to both reduce the gap and make both regions better-off. Changes in government consumption expenditure, central government fiscal redistributions and tax cuts, on the other hand, are less effective and have their long-run effectiveness reduced by migration.

To get around this problem and pave the way for a substantive budget reform, we propose to decouple distributional negotiations from the rest of the budget process by linking member state net balances in a rigid manner to relative prosperity. This would be achieved through the introduction of a system of compensating horizontal transfers that would take to its logical conclusion the Commission's proposal for a generalized compensation mechanism.

The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential (power law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. We use the LPPL model in one of its incarnations to analyze two bubbles and subsequent market crashes in two important indexes in the Chinese stock markets between May 2005 and July 2009. Both the Shanghai stock exchange composite index (US ticker symbol SSEC) and Shenzhen stock exchange component index (SZSC) exhibited such behavior in two distinct time periods: (1) from mid-2005, bursting in October 2007 and (2) from November 2008, bursting in the beginning of August 2009. We successfully predicted time windows for both crashes in advance (Sornette, 2007; Bastiaensen et al., 2009) with the same methods used to successfully predict the peak in mid-2006 of the US housing bubble (Zhou and Sornette, 2006b) and the peak in July 2008 of the global oil bubble (Sornette et al., 2009). The more recent bubble in the Chinese indexes was detected and its end or change of regime was predicted independently by two groups with similar results, showing that the model has been well-documented and can be replicated by industrial practitioners. Here we present a more detailed analysis of the individual Chinese index predictions and of the methods used to make and test them. We complement the detection of log-periodic behavior with Lomb spectral analysis of detrended residuals and (H. q)-derivative of logarithmic indexes for both bubbles. We perform unit-root tests on the residuals from the log-periodic power law model to confirm the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck property of bounded residuals, in agreement with the consistent model of 'explosive' financial bubbles (Lin et al., 2009).

In such a model, both the terms of trade and international relocation of firms offer the key to understanding the impacts of one country's profit tax policy. In particular, we note that the relocation of firms from the other two countries is positively related to the wage incomes of the third country through a shift in labour demand, and the terms-of-trade improvement is not only positively related to the wage incomes, but also negatively related to profit incomes through a shift in world consumption demand. We show that (i) in a three-country world economy, regardless of the reduction's source, the profit tax reduction of each country leads to relocation of firms away from foreign countries toward its own economy and deteriorates the terms of trade of its economy and (ii) this becomes a 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policy in the sense that it lowers the welfare of the other foreign countries.","Tezukayama Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Nara 6318501, Japan",,"Johdo, W (通讯作者)，Tezukayama Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, 7-1-1 Tezukayama, Nara 6318501, Japan.",johdo@tezukayama-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Proficiency rates are not useful metrics of school performance because universal proficiency is not a socially efficient goal for principals and teachers. Further, the variation in proficiency rates among schools reflects, in large part, interschool differences in student background characteristics. The designers of accountability systems must move away from systems designed around a one-size-fits-all standard and begin designing systems that organize and promote competition among schools. Well-organized competition among schools is the best vehicle for making sure that schools use public funds efficiently. If education officials pursue this paradigm, they must develop relative performance measures that assess the outcomes of these contests while making reasonable allowance for differences in student populations served by public schools. I will discuss a method for deriving context-specific measures of school performance. A percentile performance index tells public officials how often the students in a particular school or classroom perform better than students in other schools who began the year in similar circumstances with respect to their prior achievements, the compositions of their classmates, and their family backgrounds. This index of relative performance provides the information policymakers need to make preliminary judgments concerning when to reorganize a given school and give a new staff the opportunity to prove they can do better.","[Neal, Derek] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Neal, Derek] Univ Chicago, Comm Educ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Neal, Derek] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Neal, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",d-neal@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,16,9,15,0,7,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Trading money to another agent for a good, rather than trading good for good through the centralized intermediary, allows the money holder to obtain the good while avoiding the fee the centralized intermediary must charge to cover its costs. The model provides a set of pure strategy monetary equilibria where the quantity of privately issued money is a monotonically increasing function of the confidence agents have in money. The model indicates that the circulation of fiat money is explained by the role it can play in reducing transaction costs more so than the role it can play as a medium of exchange in resolving the double coincidence of wants problem.

In this paper, we ask what the existing evidence implies for how school leaders might recruit, evaluate, and retain teachers. We begin by summarizing the evidence on five key points, referring to existing work and to evidence we have accumulated from our research with the nation's two largest school districts: Los Angeles and New York City. First, teachers display considerable heterogeneity in their effects on student achievement gains. Second, estimates of teacher effectiveness based on student achievement data are noisy measures. Third, teachers' effectiveness rises rapidly in the first year or two of their teaching careers but then quickly levels out. Fourth, the primary cost of teacher turnover is not the direct cost of hiring and firing, but rather is the loss to students who will be taught by a novice teacher rather than one with several years of experience. Fifth, it is difficult to identify at the time of hire those teachers who will prove more effective. As a result, better teachers can only be identified after some evidence on their actual job performance has accumulated. We then explore what these facts imply for how principals and school districts should act, using a simple model in which schools must search for teachers using noisy signals of teacher effectiveness. The implications of our analysis are strikingly different from current practice. Rather than screening at the time of hire, the evidence on heterogeneity of teacher performance suggests a better strategy would be identifying large differences between teachers by observing the first few years of teaching performance and retaining only the highest-performing teachers.","[Staiger, Douglas O.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Rockoff, Jonah E.] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",Dartmouth College; Columbia University,"Staiger, DO (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Douglas.O.Staiger@dartmouth.edu; jonah.rockoff@columbia.edu,,,,,,,47,139,254,0,44,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Telser argued that banks were able to significantly increase lending prior to the recession by using asset substitution namely, switching from government securities to loans. This analysis reinforces Telser's position by comparing the behavior of member banks, which were subject to reserve requirement increases, to the behavior of nonmember banks, which were not constrained by such increases.","Roanoke Coll, Salem, VA 24153 USA",,"Stauffer, RF (通讯作者)，Roanoke Coll, Salem, VA 24153 USA.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,5,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Kehoe and Midrigan (2007) recently showed that, under a standard assumption on nominal price stickiness, empirical frequencies of micro price adjustment cannot replicate the time series properties of the Law of One Price (LOP) deviations. We extend their sticky price model by combining good-specific price adjustment with information stickiness in the sense of Mankiw and Reis (2002). Our framework allows for multiple cities within a country. Using a panel of U.S.-Canadian city pairs, we estimate a dynamic price adjustment process for 165 individual goods. Under a reasonable assumption on the money growth process, we show that the model matches the persistence of the LOP deviation for the median good and accounts for the majority of its volatility when information updates occur every 12 months.

The rational prediction in both cases is passing until close to the end. Empirically, however, only the bonus option is used by the subjects. The results indicate that subjects readily understand the strategic effect of the bonus, which, once offered, renders passing until close to the end the strictly dominant strategy for both players. Yet, they fail to realise the slightly more involved strategic signal entailed in the insurance, namely that passing until close to the end is a strictly dominant strategy for an insured player.

This study finds the evidence of a common stochastic trend between population and per capita income which is indicative of long-run relationship between these two variables. Empirical results also indicate that a negative long-run causal relationship is flowing from per capita income to population. The short-run relationship between population growth and per capita income growth is at variance across model specifications. The neoclassical growth model reveals that population growth positively contributes to per capita income growth while the modified endogenous growth model shows a negative relationship between these two variables. Moreover, both neoclassical and endogenous growth models indicate that per capita income growth tends to lower the population growth. The long-run relationship is consistent with Becker's view that as income grows, families tend to prefer quality rather than quantity of children. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling.

The positive productivity effects of FDI are more pronounced for plants that buy more intermediates and who purchase science-based intermediate inputs (i.e., electronics, machinery and equipment, and chemicals).

The weaker the linkages that a peripheral product shares with the core (as measured by the extent of joint sales, joint procurement, joint production, and joint sectorship), the more likely the peripheral product is to be divested in response to import competition.","Univ Alberta, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Alberta,"Liu, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada.",runjuan.liu@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,40,26,29,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

By using data on sixteen German states from 1970 to 2005, we estimate the impact of internationalization, measured by trade volumes and stocks of foreign direct investment, on business tax revenues. We control for the impact of internationalization on business profits. Surprisingly, we find strong and robust evidence for a positive impact of internationalization on tax revenue. An increase in the internationalization indicator of ten percent increases tax revenue by over three percent. This counterintuitive result may be explained by higher tax avoidance activity of purely national firms or by legal provisions in the tax law which can be used as tax loopholes in the case of domestic transactions as opposed to cross-border transactions.","[Becker, Johannes; Fuest, Clemens] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University of Oxford,"Becker, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",johannes.becker2@sbs.ox.ac.uk; clemens.fuest@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,18,7,8,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Using two- and three-game soccer final-score betting in the sports lottery market in Korea, which features matches in the English Premier League, we compare winning payoffs in this parimutuel-type sports lottery against corresponding payoffs from an established bookmaker market in the United Kingdom. We find that for outcomes with relatively high payouts (that is, lower-probability events), winning bets placed in the sports lottery market have greater payoffs than corresponding bets placed in the bookmaker-based market. However, the opposite is true for outcomes with relatively low payouts (that is, higher-probability events). Results suggest that participants in the sports lottery market tend to bet more toward high-probability events than the amount implied by the bookmaker's odds. Results also suggest that the favorite-longshot bias is still present in the bookmaker market, even when there is less threat of privately informed bettors than in horse racing.","[Chung, Jaiho; Hwang, Joon Ho] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Hwang, JH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",jhochung@korea.ac.kr; joonhwang@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,42,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

However, recent contributions have shown that the effects on home economies are rarely negative. Our paper contributes to this literature by examining how outward investments to developing and less developed countries (LDCs) affect home activities of French and Italian firms that turn multinational in the period analysed. The effects of these investments are also compared to the effects of investments to developed economies (DCs). The analysis is carried out by using propensity score matching. We find no evidence of a negative effect of outward investments to LDCs. In Italy they have a positive long term effect on value added and employment. For France we find a positive effect on the size of domestic output and employment.","[Navaretti, Giorgio Barba] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Navaretti, Giorgio Barba; Castellani, Davide] Ctr Luca Agliano, Milan, Italy; [Castellani, Davide] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy; [Disdier, Anne-Celia] INRA AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",University of Milan; University of Perugia; AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay,"Navaretti, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",Anne-Celia.Disdier@agroparistech.fr,"Castellani, Davide/AAN-9912-2020; Castellani, Davide/A-9065-2010","Castellani, Davide/0000-0002-1823-242X; Castellani, Davide/0000-0002-1823-242X",,,,,55,70,72,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Higher quality infrastructures increase the profitability of capital investment by foreign entrepreneurs. The ruler wishes to maximize the amount of capital investment that flows into the country. Before selecting their investment, entrepreneurs receive a signal on the quality of infrastructures. We consider two cases. First, all entrepreneurs observe the same signal (centralized information). Second, each entrepreneur receives an independently drawn signal (decentralized information). We compare the effectiveness of these two scenarios for incentivizing the ruler. We find remarkably clear-cut results. When the entrepreneurs' investments are strategic complements, centralized information does a better job in incentivizing the ruler. The opposite holds when investments are strategic substitutes. This may help understand the role of media, rating agencies, public announcements, and ambiguity.

THE ROLE OF RISK AVERSION IN MARRIAGE,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,JOB SEARCH; ATTITUDES,"Because of the uncertainty inherent in searching for a spouse and the uncertainty of the future quality and state of the marriage itself, risk attitudes likely directly impact the timing of marriage. The effect of an individual's risk aversion, measured via a series of hypothetical gambles over income on time to marriage, is examined using survival analysis. I find risk aversion significantly affects time to marriage, with more risk averse respondents marrying sooner than their more risk-loving counterparts. Within-family analyses using sibling data reveal a similar pattern. In addition, the effect of risk aversion on time to marriage is larger in magnitude and more statistically significant for men. One possible explanation for the different results between the sexes is that women value risk aversion as a desirable trait in potential mates.

Since the United States is the destination country of the vast majority of migrants from Mexico, as well as from other Latin American countries, U.S. immigration policy can have a significant impact on the volume of remittances to the Latin American region. This paper studies how a generalized amnesty - a provision in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) - affected immigrants' remitting patterns. In models that control for immigrants' length of residence in the United States and for economic conditions in both the U.S. state of residence and the country of origin, we estimate substantial post-legalization drops in remittances sent home by Mexican-born migrants who legalized through IRCA. Given the potential positive impact of remittances on investment levels, entrepreneurship rates and the development of the financial sector, this finding underscores the importance of gaining a better understanding of the impact that immigration policies in immigrant-receiving countries may have on the stream of remittance flows to immigrant-sending communities in developing regions.

We consider a dynamic framework where developing an alternative infrastructure requires both time and a captive customer base. We show that a multi-period schedule where regulated access charges rise over time is critical to foster efficient infrastructure investment. Nonetheless, a sunset clause on regulation dilutes investment incentives. We also show that, in the absence of regulatory commitment, the time-dependent schedule may not be robust to sequential entry. Hence, to preserve investment by early entrants, access charges should depend both on time and the entry period, in such a way that each entrant is provided with the same dynamic access conditions. The relevance of these issues carries over to the prospective deployment of new access infrastructures, the so-called Next Generation Access networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We begin by simulating a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with two types of financial frictions-costly contract enforcement and anti-creditor bias in the judicial system. Our model builds on the standard financial accelerator framework of Bernanke et al. (1999). to which we add imperfect judicial enforcement in the line of Krasa and Villamil (2000). According to our simulations, the power of the financial accelerator may either increase or decrease with financial frictions, depending on the source and initial level of such frictions. We then turn to the empirical investigation, based on panel data for 62 countries over 1981-1999. We rely on Djankov et al. (2005) and the World Bank's Doing Business Database for proxies of credit market imperfections. According to our results, which are consistent with the theoretical model's main predictions, macroeconomic volatility and the power of the financial accelerator seem to increase with contract enforcement costs, but vary non-monotonically with the degree of anti-creditor bias in the judicial and legal system.

Samuelson (Econometrica 28:368-379, 1960) showed that this Principle applied to a stable multimarket equilibrium for the case that all commodities are gross substitutes. We note that the Principle also applies to the stable equilibria of markets for which commodities can also be gross complements as formulated by Morishima (Osaka Econ Pap 1:101-113, 1952). Further, the Morishima and gross substitute cases are the only cases to which the Principle can apply, based only upon the stability hypothesis and a specification of the gross substitute/complement relations among commodities. We show that the Milgrom and Shannon (Econometrica 62: 157-180, 1994) single crossing conditions specified for monotone comparative statics can be configured appropriate to the Morishima case to give global conditions for the LeChatelier Principle to apply to a multimarket equilibrium.","[Lady, George M.] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Lady, GM (通讯作者)，123 Stonehaven Lane, Hainesport, NJ 08036 USA.",gmlady@ix.netcom.com,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

With monetary expansion, average propensity to consume increases more rapidly in a single denomination than in multiple denominations due to the distortionary effect, and the welfare gap between them is augmented due to both distortionary and adverse distributional effects. The implication of these effects for modern economies is that a binary-decimal Structure adopted by the EU and the US is superior to a decimal-pair structure adopted by Japan and South Korea.

His result is difficult to generalize to an arbitrary number of bidders, since the entry-decision stage of the game is characterized by strategic substitutes. This paper analyzes more-than-two-bidder, symmetric-prior cases. Two results are proved: (1) as the number of objects grows large, a full comparative cheap talk equilibrium exists and it yields asymptotically fully efficient collusion; and (2) there is always a partial comparative cheap talk equilibrium. All these results are supported by intuitive equilibria at the entry-decision stage (J Econ Theory 130:205-219, 2006; Math Soc Sci 2008, forthcoming). Numerical examples suggest that full comparative cheap talk equilibria are not uncommon even with few objects.","Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Miralles, A (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd,Room 543, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",miralles@bu.edu,"Miralles, Antonio/K-8962-2017","Miralles, Antonio/0000-0001-8146-2140",,,,,20,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Organization economics seeks to understand and improve the ways in which organizations overcome agency costs, information costs, and other obstacles to efficiency. The private organization discussed in the paper is the modern publicly held (that is, dispersed ownership) business corporation, and the particular problem on which I focus is excessive executive compensation as a symptom of weaknesses in corporate governance. I then discuss two public organizations involved in national security - the US intelligence 'community' (a kind of mega-organization) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its role as the nation's principal domestic intelligence service. Both exhibit significant dysfunction that organization economics can help us to understand and overcome. I then discuss two types of public organization that have been more successful in overcoming obstacles to organizational efficiency: the judiciary of common law nations, such as the United States, and the very differently structured judiciary of civil law nations, such as France, Germany, and Japan.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Posner, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bishoplc@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,125,38,39,1,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

However, recent empirical studies showed that this fit improves if the Fisher equation is treated as a non-linear equation. Using U.

We use time-varying coefficient (TVC) estimation, a procedure that allows us to directly confront the unknown functional form problem, specification errors, and spurious relationships.

The leading method for assessing teacher quality is value added modeling (VAM), which decomposes students' test scores into components attributed to student heterogeneity and to teacher quality. Implicit in the VAM approach are strong assumptions about the nature of the educational production function and the assignment of students to classrooms. In this paper, I develop falsification tests for three widely used VAM specifications, based on the idea that future teachers cannot influence students' past achievement. In data from North Carolina, each of the VAMs' exclusion restrictions is dramatically violated. In particular, these models indicate large effects of fifth grade teachers on fourth grade test score gains. I also find that conventional measures of individual teachers' value added fade out very quickly and are at best weakly related to long-run effects. I discuss implications for the use of VAMs as personnel tools.","[Rothstein, Jesse] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Rothstein, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rothstein@berkeley.edu,,"Rothstein, Jesse/0000-0001-6140-0858",,,,,56,387,615,4,109,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

This paper applies a model of single agent learning to address this question. Our results show that learning collective preferences in this setting is possible but hard, giving explicit bounds on the amount of information required.

As the reform took place very recently, we estimate the labour supply effect by using data drawn from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) on the intention of women to return to the labour market.

We use a large representative sample of Swedish men to examine both intergenerational and sibling correlations in IQ. Since siblings share both parental factors and neighbourhood influences, the sibling correlation is a broader measure of the importance of family background than the intergenerational correlation. We use IQ data from the Swedish military enlistment tests. The correlation in IQ between fathers (born 1951-1956) and sons (born 1966-1980) is estimated to 0.347. The corresponding estimate for brothers (born 1951-1968) is 0.473, suggesting that family background explains approximately 50% of a person's IQ. Estimating sibling correlations in IQ, we thus find that family background has a substantially larger impact on IQ than has been indicated by previous studies examining only intergenerational correlations in IQ.","[Bjorklund, Anders; Jantti, Markus] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Eriksson, Karin Hederos] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Björklund, A (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.bjorklund@sofi.su.se; karin.hederoseriksson@hhs.se; markus.jantti@sofi.su.se,"Björklund, Anders/ABA-1326-2020",,,,,,20,11,11,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We test this 'communist legacy' hypothesis by examining the impact of acculturation in a communist regime on social network participation and, as a consequence, on preferences for spatial mobility. We focus on the paradigmatic case of Eastern Germany, where mobility intentions seem to be substantially weaker than in the Western part. Applying an IV ordered probit approach we first find that Eastern people acculturated in a communist system are more invested in locally bounded informal social capital than Western people. Second, we confirm that membership in such locally bounded social networks reduces the intention to move away. Third, after controlling for the social network effect the mobility gap between East and West is substantially reduced. Low spatial mobility of the Eastern population, we conclude, is to an important extent attributable to a social capital endowment characteristic of post-communist economies.","[Schneider, Lutz] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Boenisch, Peter] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Schneider, L (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany.",Lutz.Schneider@iwh-halle.de,"Schneider, Lutz/ADQ-1801-2022","Schneider, Lutz/0000-0002-3686-0753",,,,,40,8,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,4,,,,,483,497,PII 929159865,10.1080/14631377.2010.518470,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,676AU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283883300004,0

Instead of linear regression-based models, we consider the possibility that the true data generating process may come from two different distributions, and we employ the Markov Switching approach to analyse this. From the results of the two-state Markov Switching model, we define State 1 as the efficient state and State 2 as the inefficient one. Only the 30-day forward rate is able to differentiate between the two states. Based on the unconditional probabilities from the Markov switching model, we also find that the 30-day forward rate has a 70% probability in the efficient state, which indicates that 70% of all speculators fully extract information when predicting future spot rates, while 30% of all investors do not.","Dayeh Univ, Dept Finance, Changhua 51591, Taiwan",Da Yeh University,"Chen, SW (通讯作者)，Dayeh Univ, Dept Finance, Changhua 51591, Taiwan.",shyhwei.chen@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,4,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We obtain non-parametric identification under weaker conditions. In particular, we obtain non-parametric identification through discrete variation under a non-periodicity condition on the hazard function of the error distribution. Furthermore, we show that the presence of continuous regressors may lead to stronger identification results. Our non-parametric estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and outperforms that of Lewbel and Linton (2002) in a simulation study. For the panel data setting, we provide the first systematic treatment of non-parametric identification and estimation of the truncated panel data model with fixed effects by extending our treatment of the cross-sectional case.

Furthermore, we find that the short-run effect of financial development on economic growth is unstable despite the positive long-term effect.","[Zhu, Zhen] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Edmond, OK 73034 USA; [Chiou-Wei, Song Zan; Wu, Wun-Cheng] Nan Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan",University of Central Oklahoma; Nanhua University,"Zhu, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Oklahoma, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.",zzhu@ucok.edu,"Zhu, Zhen/AAD-6897-2019",,,,,,49,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The key point of departure from traditional models of social interactions is that actions are interrelated and sequential. We establish existence and uniqueness results akin to those in traditional models. In contrast to these models, however, we show that the presence of strategic complementarities is no longer sufficient to generate a social multiplier that exceeds one in this environment. Self-fulfilling conformity, whereby a greater desire to conform at the individual level leads to greater homogeneity of choices in the aggregate, is not retained either.

Instead, we propose the division of non-OECD countries into two groups: the first one consisting of non-OECD countries fulfilling membership criteria and the second one, not fulfilling these criteria. In our setting, the less developed countries are collected only in the last group, whereas OECD and non-OECD countries fulfilling membership criteria arc the developed ones. We analyze trade between pairs of countries and aggregate the results to illustrate trade between the three above mentioned groups of countries in the period of 28 years (1977-2005).

Since this turns these firms into endogenous monopsonists, the minimum-wage rate has the perverse effect of reducing employment in small firms as well as what these firms offer their workers. Thus, if there are only small firms, the minimum-wage rate makes all workers that would be employed in the absence of a minimum-wage rate worse off. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Large common shocks may have sizeable and persistent effects on the intra-union terms of trade, whereby the region characterized by downward real wage rigidity adjusts with a persistent loss of competitiveness.

The statistical distribution of simulation inputs was based on a theoretical curve fitting the sample data. Distribution parameters for sample data were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Method. The simulation was performed in the @RISK program. It was considered that the installation of the cheapest critical components brings the highest costs necessary for computer warranty service due to shorter failure-free runs.

In contrast, this review, sketches three approaches to the economic theory of internal organization-one substantially developed, another rapidly emerging, and a third on the horizon. The first approach (pricing) applies Pigou's prescription: If markets get prices wrong, then the economist's job is to fix the prices. The second approach (politics) considers environments where important actions inside organizations simply cannot be priced, so power and control become central. Finally, the third approach (path dependence) complements the first two by shifting attention from the between variance. to the within. That is, rather than asking how organizations confronting different circumstances. should choose different structures and processes, the focus here is on how path dependence can cause persistent performance differences among seemingly similar enterprises.","[Gibbons, Robert] MIT, Sloan Sch, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Gibbons, Robert] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Gibbons, Robert] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gibbons, R (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",rgibbons@mit.edu,,,,,,,126,32,35,1,32,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4602-7,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In order to understand how different dimensions of inequality are related via choices, markets, and institutions, we follow the mapping suggested by the household budget constraint from individual wages to individual earnings, to household earnings, to disposable income, and, ultimately, to consumption and wealth. We document a continuous and sizable increase in wage inequality over the sample period. Changes in the distribution of hours worked sharpen the rise in earnings inequality before 1982, but mitigate its increase thereafter. Taxes and transfers compress the level of income inequality, especially at the bottom of the distribution, but have little effect on the overall trend.

The subsidy causes a shift in the composition of production towards the cleaner energy, but it also causes an offsetting consumption effect: energy consumption rises because the subsidy causes the equilibrium price of energy to fall. The net effect on emissions can be positive if the low-carbon energy is not significantly cleaner than the high-carbon energy it displaces. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for this perverse effect in the context of a competitive energy market. We calibrate an example for an ethanol subsidy in the U.S. and find that this policy is likely to cause an increase in carbon emissions for most plausible parameter values.","[Hutchinson, Emma; Kennedy, Peter W.; Martinez, Cristina] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Hutchinson, E (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",ehutchin@uvic.ca; pkennedy@uvic.ca; martinez@uvic.ca,,,,,,,22,11,13,2,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The Baltic States Market turnover has increased from 721 MEUR in 2000 to 978 MEUR in 2008 (with peak 2603 MEUR in 2005). When difficult period appeared in global markets, a lot of attention was dedicated towards the managing of investments. Investment management firms in Lithuania gain significance in personal as well as in business section increasingly; even though these firms are considerably young (the first one in Lithuania was established in year 2000). Successful investment begins with the financial analysis of stock, asset or index, which you are going to invest. Professionals can be divided into two groups as far as this point is concerned: supporters of fundamental analysis and the supporters of technical analysis. Fundamental analysts try to determine a company's value by looking at the balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement. Technicians, on the other hand, assume that all these fundamentals are accounted for in the stock's price and analyses charts of price movements and various indicators derived from the price and volume. Technical analysis suffered major criticism when Fama (1965) presented his efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), which states that past prices cannot be used to profitably predict future prices. However, many researches showed that EMH is not adequate in many aspects. With this background the Quantitative Behavioral Finance theory was introduced (see recent works of Gunduz Caginalp, Vernon Smith, David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran, and Ray Sturm). This theory includes some topics of classical theories, but mainly it is based on behavioral analysis of market agents and helps to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. This means that there is no reason to criticize the technical analysis, but in difficult cases (e. g. crises) it should be supplemented by behavioral analysis of agents. In this paper some methods of technical analysis are used to create an investment strategy trading in Baltic States stock market. The main objectives of this research are: adapt Bollinger Bands to the Baltic market, determine which investment period with - long term or short term - Bollinger Bands is more efficient, research the efficiency of Bollinger Bands depending on the parameters. In this paper the optimal parameters are calibrated and the expected profit is estimated without the information about the transaction costs. Bollinger plotter was developed using the most popular mathematical toolbox MatLab in order to solve stated problems. Application is capable of charting Bollinger Bands and 6 other technical indicators with desired period of time. This software is not a fully automated decision making system, as decisions are usually made based on value judgment. Since the stock returns usually have distributions with fat tails, then less than 95% of data fit in the Bollinger trading channels. However the Bollinger bands trading signals were supported by additional indicators (e.g. %b), so the loss of data is not significant. Our calibration results show that short term investor should apply 10 days moving average and use a trading channel with the width of 1.8 standard deviations, for the Bollinger bands.","[Kabasinskas, Audrius; Macys, Ugnius] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kabasinskas, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",audrius.kabasinskas@ktu.lt; ugnius.macys@gmail.com,"Kabašinskas, Audrius/I-1028-2018",,,,,,26,3,5,0,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Based on these results, the arc elasticity of demand for physician services is -0.055. When we exclude the transitory period using the three-year data, the effects of the reform on the frequency of physician visits turn to be positive. It seems that the patients marginally curtailed the number of physician visits immediately after the reform: however, this effect was not sustained in the six months after the reform. We conclude that Japanese patients are not very price sensitive within the 10-20 percent range of coinsurance rate. Another important finding in our study is that the decrease in expenditure per visit retained even after the transitory period. This result suggests that the existence of a possible moral hazard in the treatment intensity although the decision-making process on the treatment intensity needs to be examined more carefully.

Fiscal policy discipline under the monetary union may require a member country to adopt a policy that is sub-optimal from its own viewpoint. It is very demanding to meet increased fiscal policy coordination and implement it in practise; however, it is inevitable to search for other possible alternatives that would preserve governments' decision independence in their own fiscal policies.","[Kubesova, Barbara] VSMVV Praha Ops, Katedra Evropske Integrace, U Santosky 15, Prague 15000 5, Czech Republic",,"Kubesová, B (通讯作者)，VSMVV Praha Ops, Katedra Evropske Integrace, U Santosky 15, Prague 15000 5, Czech Republic.",kubesova@vip-vs.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-601-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,199,207,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9EP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000393151400025,0

Using a reform which extended parental leave benefits from 12 to 15 months for Swedish children born after August 1988 we evaluate the effects of prolonged parental leave on children's test scores and grades at age 16. We show that, on average, the reform had no effect on children's scholastic performance. However, we do find positive effects for children of well-educated mothers, a result that is robust to a number of different specifications. We find no corresponding heterogeneity relative to parental earnings or fathers' education, or relative to other predictors of child performance. We find no effects on intermediate outcomes such as mothers' subsequent earnings, child health, parental fertility, divorce rates, or the mothers' mental health. Overall the results suggest positive causal interaction effects between mothers' education and the amount of time mothers spend with their children. Since the institutional context is one in which the alternative is subsidized day care, the results imply that subsidizing longer parental leave spells rather than day care reinforce the relationship between maternal education and school outcomes.","[Liu, Qian; Skans, Oskar Nordstrom] Uppsala Univ, Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden.",qian.liu@nek.uu.se; os-kar.nordstrom_skans@ifau.uu.se,,,,,,,37,70,86,3,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This paper addresses the causality of this observed link. We have a unique data set for Norwegians born in the period 1967-1969, with a measure of permanent family income in the children's adolescence. This enables us to examine the long-term effect of family income on children's educational attainment. The Norwegian oil shock in the 1970s is used as an instrument, because this - in some regions but not in others - implied a general increase in income unrelated to parents' abilities. This variation in income is used to estimate the causal effect of family income on children's educational attainment. We find no such causal relationship.

In 2004 and 2007, 10 former socialist eastern European countries joined the EU. Although the EU integration is associated with increasingly favourable investment conditions, accession countries also pursue active strategies to attract foreign firms. In particular, taxes on corporate income have been significantly reduced during the last decade. We analyse whether corporate tax policies of eastern European countries affect three aspects of multinational activity: the location decision, the investment decision and the capital structure choice. The results suggest that local taxes are negatively related to both location and investment decisions. The analysis of the capital structure confirms that higher local taxes imply higher debt-to-capital ratios.","[Overesch, Michael] Univ Mannheim, Sch Business, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Wamser, Georg] Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany",University of Mannheim; Ifo Institut,"Overesch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Sch Business, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",overesch@uni-mannheim.de; wamser@ifo.de,"Overesch, Michael/AAZ-6573-2021","Overesch, Michael/0000-0002-1531-0357",,,,,39,17,20,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

To examine these linkages, we use the two-step procedure from the Engle and Granger model: In the first step, we define the order of integration in series and explore the long run relationships among the variables by using four unit root tests and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach of cointegration test, respectively. In the second step, we test causal relationships by using the error-correction based causality models. The ARDL bounds test reveals that there is an evidence of a long-run relationship between the FDI, import (IM) and real gross domestic product (GDP), but no evidence of a long-run relationship between the FDI, export (EX) and GDP in Turkey. According to the causality test results for GDP-IM-FDI equation, there is evidence of two-way (bidirectional) causality between GDP and IM, evidence of one-way (unidirectional) causality from FDI to GDP and evidence of one-way Granger causality from FDI to IM. The existence of unidirectional causal links suggests that FDI strategies should be designed to promote economic growth.","[Ozturk, Ilhan] Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Mersin, Turkey; [Acaravci, Ali] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Antakya, Turkey",Cag University - Turkey; Mustafa Kemal University,"Ozturk, I (通讯作者)，Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Mersin, Turkey.",,"ACARAVCI, Ali/Q-5833-2019; Acaravci, Ali/G-2206-2016; Ozturk, Ilhan/B-9431-2009","Ozturk, Ilhan/0000-0002-6521-0901",,,,,42,7,7,0,13,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

To account for nonstationarity and to avoid spurious regression problems, the panel unit-roots tests as suggested by Im et al.

The generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimation methodology as suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond (2000), were used to deal with the simultaneity bias introduced by measurement errors. Based on the panel cointegration test, we found evidence of long-run production relationship for all the selected industries. We also observe increasing returns to scale in 3 out of 13 industries under study. However, comparing the pre- and post-liberalization periods, there are improvements in total factor productivity (TFP) in 9 out of 13 industries in the post-liberalization period of 1991 to 1998.

This regret is greater when prices change by more, and this can explain why the actual size of price increases for firms with rigid prices is less sensitive to inflation than in models with fixed costs of changing prices. Regret costs of this form also lead to more variable price changes than fixed costs do. Last, the practice of announcing price increases in advance is easier to rationalize with regret concerns by consumers than with more standard approaches to price rigidity.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Rotemberg, JJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",jrotemberg@hbs.edu,,,,,,,23,12,13,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0347-0520,,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

They are one of the important factors which reduce the market value of a firm. The paper is devoted to agency problems related to the conflict between stockholder-manager and the bondholder-creditor. As the agency costs are extremely difficult to be measured directly, a mathematical model of a firm and contingent claims analysis are used. Both the possibility of making decisions on investment and on abandonment of activity are assigned the form of real options. This approach enables to calculate the agency costs of debt and indicate factors determining their level. Debt financing in a firm leads to overinvesting and risk-shifting two important signs of agency conflict of debt. For the base-case parameters the agency costs are small, ranging from 0,6% to 1,16% of firm value, but when the level of debt increases they rise quickly. Moreover, the more effective are the investment projects made by the firm and the higher its tax payments, the higher are the agency costs of overinvestment. An interesting effect results from changing such parameters as risk of price volatility and the convenience yield. The analysis shows that both high-growth firms and low- growth mature ones are more resistant to agency costs related to overinvestment, though the source of this resistance is different.","Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Matemat Stosowanej, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Rychlowska-Musial, E (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Matemat Stosowanej, Poznan, Poland.",elzbieta.musial@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,1,,,,,35,58,,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,580UN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276476100002,0

We ask if the intrinsic motivation from social norm alone can motivate firms to participate in adoption. The multiple equilibria in the adoption game indicates two possibilities: this intrinsic motivation may or may not enhance adoption. The existing literature on equilibrium selection further suggests that the most likely outcome is that it cannot enhance adoption. Next, by keeping the assumption of symmetry, we show that if cooperation is an option for firms, then the presence of two coordination effects (social norm on adoption and cooperation benefits on output) will result in the existence of asymmetric adoptions.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Shirley, HJ (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, 64,Sec 2,Zhihran Rd Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",hojs@nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The model is estimated using the optimal single-equation and the maximum-likelihood system estimators. All the estimators consistently suggest the cointegrating relationship between services sector and GDP as well as between services and nonservices sectors. The estimates of long-run elasticity parameters are statistically significant and dimensionally consistent across the estimators. The conventional Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and the new CUSUM and Moving Sum (MOSUM) tests suggest the stability of the equilibrium residuals and reinforce the cointegrating relationship between the model series. The error correction model provides some support for unidirectional Granger-causality from services sector to GDP. The impulse response and variance decomposition analyses instead suggest the bidirectional causality between services sector and GDP and between services and nonservices sectors.

We employ the standard reduced-form modelling approach to control for country-specific unobserved heterogeneity and GMM estimation to control for endogeneity. Our study considers 24 transition economies and panel data for 1993-2004. Our results support the EKC hypothesis while confirming the importance of both institutional quality and financial development for environmental performance.

The export intensity of firms and industries proved to have a significant impact on the estimated industry effect, making the industry-related variance statistically not different from zero. However, the industry's influence did not totally disappear, because the effect of export intensity on firms' profitability depends on the industry to which the firm belongs. Moreover, firm size turns out to be significant and positively associated with firm's return, which can be evidence of economies of scale or more efficient processes as a company grows in size.","[Tarzijan, J.; Ramirez, C.] Univ Catolica, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Tarziján, J (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica, Escuela Adm, Vicuna Mackena 4860, Santiago, Chile.",jtarzija@uc.cl,"Ramírez, Cristian/AAR-7167-2021","Ramírez, Cristian/0000-0002-6558-7960",,,,,20,6,7,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It now becomes again a subject of debate in both developed and developing countries. The reasons for the resurgence of interest in the issue, however, are different in both these cases. In the first case, it follows from the fact that the industrial approach to agriculture resulted in degradation of the environment and deprivation of farmers and rural communities, as well as undermined confidence in the quality of food. In the second case, related to nearly 2.5 billion people dependent on agriculture, the reason is in the direct necessity of finding the solution to the problem of food supply in modernization of agriculture, while avoiding the questionable industrial approach. What follows is the necessity to integrate into the economic calculus such externalities as the environmental barrier and the effects of globalization. The economic theory in this case agricultural economics fails to deal with these issues. Thus a new theoretical construction is needed, mainly alluding to ecological economics, but also to acceptable solutions within the area of cooperation between the market and the state.

Surveying definitions of economics from contemporary principles of economics textbooks, we find that economics is the study of the economy, the study of the coordination process, the study of the effects of scarcity, the science of choice, and the study of human behavior. At a time when economists are tackling subjects as diverse as growth, auctions, crime, and religion with a methodological toolkit that includes real analysis, econometrics, laboratory experiments, and historical case studies, and when they are debating the explanatory roles of rationality and behavioral norms, any concise definition of economics is likely to be inadequate. This lack of agreement on a definition does not necessarily pose a problem for the subject. Economists are generally guided by pragmatic considerations of what works or by methodological views emanating from various sources, not by formal definitions: to repeat the comment attributed to Jacob Viner, economics is what economists do. However, the way the definition of economics has evolved is more than a historical curiosity. At times, definitions are used to justify what economists are doing. Definitions can also reflect the direction in which their authors want to see the subject move and can even influence practice.","[Backhouse, Roger E.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Medema, Steven G.] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Birmingham; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Backhouse, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",r.e.backhouse@bham.ac.uk; steven.medema@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,62,101,113,6,33,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Theoretically, it was supposed to be the start of a regional integration initiative that could eventually evolve into a Union, following the example of the European Union. Economic motivation, however, was not the mainspring of Mercosul. The initiative was devised to approximate the two main economies of the region-Argentina and Brazil-both just emerging from long-lasting military regimes, to provide mutual insurance against new military coups. In fact, the economies of Brazil and Argentina are very similar in structure, which created important obstacles to the development of regional division of labor. The removal of barriers to trade between the two economies has been permanently stalled by the difficulty to allocate activities between them. On the other hand, the smaller members of the initiative-Paraguay and Uruguay-have not found in Mercosul the support for development that they expected. Thus, Mercosul still survives, more than 20 years later, mostly because of its political virtues than because of its economic potentialities. Recent attempts at enlarging Mercosul may create new tensions and eventually threaten its survival.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"de Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,,7,1,3,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Implementing the gMMPI, this paper reviews the inequality of the coastal and non-coastal provinces, as well as the latent impact of scale efficiency change (SEC) for China. Using provincial data for the years 1996-2004, the empirical results are as follows. Oil average, China demonstrates ail annual 3.191% productivity change, which is lower than 4.729% for the conventional MPI and accounts for about 26.508% of output growth over the period 1996-2004. Most of this change is propelled by technical progress, while a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale. and the efficiency change has an adverse effect. Furthermore, regional inequality is also found in this empirical work, and the productivity change of the coastal region is actually stronger than that of the non-coastal region. This paper also casts Some focus Oil the China Western Development policy. Indeed, we do not find any Outstanding achievement from the policy in the sample period, except that the west region Sustained its rate of productivity change after 2000. Moreover, the SEC is found to be trivial in the advanced coastal region, but plays all important role in the relatively laggard non-coastal region. The implication of the positive SEC in the non-coastal region means that China's Western Development policy will improve the scale efficiency and the TFP growth of the west region.

It shows that the tertiarization trend is evident for the overall economy and most regions in terms of the service nominal value-added ratio and service employment and consumption. However, the tertiarization trend is not significant in terms of the service real value-added ratio, and there is even some concurrent detertiarization because of the decreasing proportion of services in imports and exports. Indeed, China's tertiarization trend is far behind its industrialization trend. The rise in the relative prices of services explains the rising proportion of household service consumption expenditure and further illuminates why the service real value-added ratio has not grown. The main cause for the growing percentage of service employment is the lag in service labor productivity growth in interaction with the price inelasticity of service demand. Cost disease has appeared in service consumption.","[Cheng, Dazhong] Fudan Univ, Dept Int Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Blanchard, Jean-Marc] San Francisco State Univ, Ctr US China Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",Fudan University; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Cheng, DZ (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Dept Int Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",chengdz@fudan.edu.cn; jmfblanc@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,11,7,7,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,DEC,2009,17.0,6,,,,,88,105,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2009.01175.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,519PC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271778100005,0

This condition implies that research on cities is different from research on countries, and that work oil, places within countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously. Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence of agglomeration, economies, which exist when productivity rises with density, but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent on the role that density can play in speeding the flow of ideas. Finally, urban economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national income accounts, public economics, and housing prices.

The model has six sectors of production and trade in 15 major economies and regions. The paper shows that a 'switching' of expectations about risk premia shocks in financial markets can easily generate the severe economic contraction in global trade and production currently being experienced in 2009 and subsequent events. The results show that the future of the global economy depends critically on whether the shocks to risk are expected to be permanent or temporary. The best representation of the crisis may be one where initial long-lasting pessimism about risk is unexpectedly revised to a more moderate scenario. This suggests a rapid recovery in countries not experiencing a balance sheet adjustment problem.","[McKibbin, Warwick J.] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Australian National University; Brookings Institution,"McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au; abstoeckel@gmail.com,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021",,,,,14,16,19,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

As multinational banks sought to fortify their capital base in the wake of the unfolding crisis, Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and the banks' home governments have become mutual stakeholders in some of the largest financial intermediaries with global reach. From the multitude of individual transactions has emerged a network of equity ties that spans the globe. These ties bridge institutional practices and governance regimes that previously operated largely independently of each other. They have the potential of fostering the emergence of a new governance regime for the global financial market place that deviates from earlier prognoses that globalization entails convergence on a single governance model. Instead, the newly created ties that jointly add up to a global financial network enable institutionally and organizationally diverse players to contribute their own perspectives as joint stakeholders in selected financial intermediaries, and indirectly, in the global financial system. This is likely to have important implications for the behavior of these actors in the future and the emergence of new governance solutions for the global market place. The paper discusses two recent cases of collaborative re-capitalization events to illustrate how this regime is evolving in practice. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (4) (2009) 552-567.

However, the Obstfeld-Rogoff model works exclusively via demand-side channels and abstracts from possible supply-side changes. We extend the framework to allow for endogenous supply-side changes and show that this fundamentally alters the mechanism of the adjustment process. Allowing for such an extension attenuates quite significantly the implied exchange rate adjustment. The paper also provides some empirical evidence of variations in the supply-side structure and correlations with the exchange rate and the current account. The policy implications are that measures to foster a supply-side reaction would facilitate the external adjustment by alleviating an exclusive reliance on demand and exchange rate changes, with the latter being potentially destabilizing for the global financial system.","[Engler, Philipp] Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Fidora, Michael; Thimann, Christian] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",Free University of Berlin; European Central Bank,"Engler, P (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",philipp.engler@fu-berlin.de; michael.fidora@ecb.int; christian.thimann@ecb.int,,,,,,,28,7,7,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Instead, there is evidence in both economics and psychology that people's life satisfaction depends on how experienced utility compares with expectations of life satisfaction or decision utility. In this paper I suggest that expanding work and consumption opportunities is a good thing for decision utility but may not be so for experienced utility. On this premise, I argue that people may overrate their socioeconomic prospects relative to real life chances and I discuss how systematic frustration over unfulfilled expectations can be connected to people's educational achievement. I test the model's predictions on Italian data and find preliminary support for the idea that education and access to stimulating environments may have a perverse impact on life satisfaction. I also find evidence that the latter effect is mediated by factors such as gender and age. Indeed, the model seeks to go beyond the Italian case and provide more general insights into how age/life satisfaction relationships can be modelled and explained.","[Ferrante, Francesco] Univ Cassino, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-03043 Cassino, Italy; [Ferrante, Francesco] Univ Cassino, CREAM, I-03043 Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino; University of Cassino,"Ferrante, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via S Angelo, I-03043 Cassino, Italy.",f.ferrante@caspur.it,"Ferrante, Francesco/AAK-4270-2021","Ferrante, Francesco/0000-0002-4154-6451",,,,,43,44,47,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2009,62.0,4,,,,,542,562,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00450.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,509QK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271033000007,0

We find that changes in the migration probability or the extent of migration costs will lead to a trade-off between the quality and the quantity of children. When a host country cannot differentiate between the abilities of migrants, an increase in migration probability will raise a source country's economic growth. When low- and high-skilled workers are faced with different migration probabilities, allowing more low-skilled workers to emigrate will cause a brain gain in both the short run and the long run.

For that purpose, we specify a structural search model with fixed and variable costs of search in which unemployed workers select their optimal search intensity given the exogenous arrival rate of job contacts coming from the public employment agency. Because the theoretical effect of an increase in this exogenous job contact arrival rate on the structural exit rate from unemployment is ambiguous, we estimate this model using individual unemployment duration data. Our results show that the exit rate from unemployment increases with the arrival rate of job contacts obtained by the public employment service, especially for low-educated and low-skilled workers. They also show that the search effort is more costly for low-educated women and low-skilled adult unemployed workers.

Firms can finance projects either via debt or via equity. Because of asymmetric information about firms' growth opportunities, equity financing involves a dilution cost. Nevertheless, equity emerges in equilibrium whenever financial intermediaries have sufficient market power. In the latter case, best firms issue debt while the less profitable firms are equity-financed. We also show that strategic interaction between oligopolistic intermediaries results in multiple equilibria. If one intermediary chooses to buy more debt, the price of debt decreases, so the best equity-issuing firms switch from equity to debt financing. This in turn decreases average quality of equity-financed pool, so other intermediaries also shift towards more debt. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the cases when the government can and cannot commit to its second-period tax policy. In both cases, the canonical Mirrlees/Stiglitz results regarding optimal marginal tax rates generally no longer apply. In particular, if the government cannot commit and each consumer's skill-type is revealed, it is optimal to distort the high-skill type's labour supply downwards through a positive marginal tax rate to relax an incentive-compatibility constraint.

Using a Cobb-Douglas production technology allows us to characterize important properties of the Laffer curve in terms of the wage share for a competitive labor market, the monopoly union model, the right-to-manage approach, the insider-dominated union, and efficient Nash bargains simultaneously. In this way, we are able to highlight the menu of factor tax systems, and thus of potential tax reforms available to a government, without perfect knowledge of the mechanism of the labor market. In particular, we show that the employment-maximizing tax system features a constant energy tax, while the energy mini-/maximizing tax system features a constant labor tax. We also illuminate to what extent these results must be modified if we either employ a CES production function, or if we allow for an endogenous reservation wage.","Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Upmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Inst Math Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",tupmann@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,"Upmann, Thorsten/AAA-9925-2019","Upmann, Thorsten/0000-0001-7804-7982",,,,,12,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We show that, in equilibrium, wages increase with distance to jobs and commuting costs because firms need to compensate the transportation cost difference between the employed and unemployed workers at each location in the city. We also show that the equilibrium land rent is negatively affected by the unemployment benefit because an increase in the latter induce firms to create less jobs, which, in turn, reduces the competition in the land market. We then use this model to provide a mechanism for the observed spatial mismatch between where black workers live and where jobs are. We finally show that a transportation policy consisting in subsidizing the commuting costs of black workers can increase job creation and reduce unemployment if the level of the subsidy is set at a sufficiently high level.

The marginal return to valence depends on platform polarization-the closer platforms are, the more valence affects the election Outcome. Consequently, candidates without policy preferences choose divergent platforms to soften valence competition. Moreover, exogenous increases in incentives for valence accumulation lead to both increased valence and increased polarization-the latter because candidates seek to avoid the costs of extra valence. As a result, the increase in valence is smaller than it Would have been with exogenous platforms. Finally, the model highlights the overlooked substantive importance of common modeling assumptions. Changing the Source Of uncertainty in our model from noise around the median voter's ideal point to a shock to one candidate's valence (as is common in the literature) leads to complete platform convergence for all parameter values.

While the opinions on the most likely evolution of these imbalances and on their sustainability do differ across observers, ranging from catastrophic to rather optimistic views, almost all agree that some adjustment will have to take place in the near future, and that this adjustment will involve, among other things, a rebalancing of saving and demand across the globe. As an outcome of this process. China shall increasingly supplement the US in the role of engine of global economic growth. Using a global macroeconometric model, we examine the impact on this adjustment process of a number of shocks originating in the Chinese economy, including an expansionary fiscal shock, a revaluation of the renmimbi, and an expansion of internal demand following an acceleration in the process of rural-urban migration. The analysis focuses on two related points: how will these shocks affect the medium-run evolution of transpacific imbalances, and what will their impact be on global economic growth. The simulations allow us to track the impact of these shocks on the different poles of the world economy, and to assess their relative contribution to the task of reducing global imbalances without interrupting global economic growth.

Besides the usual migration determinants such as unemployment and wage differences, housing sector characteristics are also included in the empirical analysis. The results show that internal migration flows are quite responsive to variations in housing market characteristics, especially to the supply of new dwellings, indicating that housing shortage is the key factor hampering interregional migration.","Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Bloze, G (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",gbl@sam.sdu.dk,,,,,,,28,10,10,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Individuals are assumed to have Cobb-Douglas preferences and the wage rate distribution is lognormal. First, the optimal tax rate is shown, for a general form of social welfare function, to be the smallest root of a quadratic equation involving a welfare-weighted average wage rate. Second, an approximation to this average is derived for an isoelastic social welfare function. This average depends on the degree of inequality aversion of the welfare function and the coefficient on consumption in individuals' utility functions. Calculations show that the method performs well in comparison with standard simulation methods of computing the optimal tax rate.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",jcreedy@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,4,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,ADELAIDE,"UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, ADELAIDE, SA 5001, AUSTRALIA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

In this context, this paper presents a theoretical model and empirical evidence to explain the observation that a country in which the level of technology approaches the technology frontier tends to rely more on technology creation than adoption, and invest more in basic research than in development. The model shows that technology creation involves both basic and development research processes, whereas technology adoption uses only the latter process. Therefore, R&D investment in our model involves three different processes: basic research in technology creation, development in technology creation, and development in technology adoption. The results suggest first that the rate of growth is positively correlated with the level of basic research activities in the technology creation sector, if a country's technology gap with the technology frontier is small enough. Second, an increase in the efficiency of the education system for highly skilled workers raises the level of basic research and the rate of growth. Third, verifying these theoretical results, empirical analyses using panel data from Korea, Japan and Taipei, China show that the narrower the distance to the technological frontier, the higher the growth effect of basic R&D, which indicates that the share of basic R&D matters for economic growth. Finally, the results also show that the quality of tertiary education has a significantly positive effect on the productivity of R&D.","[Kim, Yong Jin] Ajou Univ, Div Econ, Suwon 442749, South Korea; [Ha, Joonkyung] Hanyang Univ, Div Econ, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Jong-Wha] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",Ajou University; Hanyang University; Asian Development Bank,"Kim, YJ (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Div Econ, San5 Wonchun Dong, Suwon 442749, South Korea.",jha@hanyang.ac.kr; yongkim@ajou.ac.kr; jwlee@adb.org,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016; Ha, Joonkyung/Q-9057-2019","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961;",,,,,13,2,3,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Using cross-national panel data for 1981-2000 we find that the evidence is only weakly consistent with this conjecture at best; and that the technology-have-nots more likely provided weaker protection due to paucity of financial resources and human capital, and their inward-looking trade-orientation.

In contrast to the literature on multilateral bargaining, the set of agreements can form a (nonpartitional) network, while in contrast to the network literature, players can reach multilateral agreements. Patient enough countries only reach bilateral agreements if insiders gain more than outsiders, which allows them to manipulate the status quo in subsequent negotiations. However, a hub and spoke pattern may then emerge, and insiders then dissipate the advantages of strategic positioning. We also use variants on the model to explain why a US commitment not to bargain bilaterally sustained progress at GATT negotiations, and the rarity of open access preferential trading arrangements.

Concerns about proper targeting have centred on excluding people who do not meet eligibility requirements. Less attention has been paid to the failure of programmes to reach the whole of their target population, partly because there are people who do not even apply. The present article analyses the determinants of non-take-up of social benefits. The case studied is the National Social Emergency Plan, an income transfer programme implemented in Uruguay between 2005 and 2007. It is calculated that over a fifth of eligible households have never enrolled in the programme. A probit model is used to estimate the determinants of the decision to apply.

With an expanded and improved data set, I find that both home and regional biases are much stronger for affiliates' imports than for their exports. At the country-specific level, I find evidence to support the hypothesis that Japanese affiliates have particularly strong network effects, but these effects are limited to a home bias effect alone. Although Japanese affiliates show signs of a regional, or Asian, network effect in their import pattern, the strength of this effect is the weakest among all of the countries tested. Only two countries' affiliates show signs of regional bias in their export behavior, Australia and the Netherlands. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the sample selection bias and the gravity model specification issues in the literature. First, the GATT/WTO not only makes existing trading partners trade more at the intensive margin, but also creates new trading relationships at the extensive margin. Most existing papers exclude zero trade observations and hence ignore the extensive margin. Secondly, due to the violation of some maintained assumptions, the traditional log-linear gravity regressions fail to uncover the role of the GATT/WTO even at the intensive margin. Using a large bilateral panel dataset including zero trade flows and a more appropriate econometric method, this paper finds that the GATT/WTO has been very effective in promoting world trade at both the intensive and extensive margins.","Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Liu, XP (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",xliu6@kennesaw.edu,,,,,,,22,86,103,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This insight explains why during the fourteenth century, when plagues decimated populations and the church promoted the doctrine of purgatory, guilds that bundled together religious and occupational activities dominated manufacturing and commerce. During the sixteenth century, the disease environment eased, and the Reformation dispelled the doctrine of purgatory, necessitating the development of new methods of organizing industry.

We find that for high-seniority male workers, mortality rates in the year after displacement are 50%-100% higher than would otherwise have been expected. The effect on mortality hazards declines sharply over time, but even twenty years after displacement, we estimate a 10%-15% increase in annual death hazards. If such increases were sustained indefinitely, they would imply a loss in life expectancy of 1.0-1.5 years for a worker displaced at age forty. We show that these results are not due to selective displacement of less healthy workers or to unstable industries or firms offering less healthy work environments. We also show that workers with larger losses in earnings tend to suffer greater increases in mortality. This correlation remains when we examine predicted earnings declines based on losses in industry, firm, or firm-size wage premiums.","[Sullivan, Daniel] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Res Dept, Chicago, IL USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Sullivan, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Res Dept, Chicago, IL USA.",,,,,,,,47,454,538,1,49,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

The incumbent may act as a predator, that is, it may price below its marginal costs on a subset of consumers to induce the rival's exit. We show that the entrant may adopt an aggressive attitude to make predation unprofitable for the incumbent. In this case predation does not occur and the equilibrium prices are lower than the equilibrium prices which would emerge in a contest of explicitly forbidden predation. Moreover, we show that when the incumbent may choose whether to price discriminate or not before the game starts, if the quality cost function is sufficiently convex, there always exists a parameter space on which the incumbent prefers to commit not to price discriminate.","Catholic Univ Milan, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Colombo, S (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Milan, Largo A Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",stefano.colombo@unicatt.it,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 16,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200933,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208144200002,0

A single good is traded in a set of independent markets, where shipment between markets is possible but costly. The problem has previously been studied in the non-strategic case, in which it can be analyzed and solved as a min-cost-flow problem. We consider the case where buyers and sellers are strategic. Our first result gives a double characterization of the VCG prices, first as distances in a certain residue graph and second as the minimal (for buyers) and maximal (for sellers) equilibrium prices. This provides a computationally efficient, individually rational and incentive compatible welfare maximizing mechanism.

Men tend to be underemployed while women are evenly split between over- and underemployment. Losses in surplus are generally small, but 10% of underemployed men and women experience losses of more than 34% or 50% of surplus, respectively. The loss measure is also an important determinant in predicting labor market transitions, meaning increases in surplus losses generate a higher probability of changing from workers' present jobs or changing the number of hours.

Since, under these assumptions, the usual firm objective is no longer well defined, several non-standard objectives are incorporated into the model. These include variants of market value maximization and a utility function for the firm. We find that the presence of market incompleteness alters little the behavior of asset returns. On the other hand, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates is quite sensitive to the firm objective, which affects the capital accumulation path. In contrast to conventional findings, capital is not necessarily higher when markets are incomplete. In addition, the different capital accumulation effects imply that shareholders with different asset wealth might prefer different firm objectives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Findings show that at the aggregate level, ALP growth was generally faster than that of ALC and hence resulted in a significant decline in ULC for all regions in China. Furthermore, less developed regions exhibited stronger productivity growth relative to labor cost increase than more developed regions, thus leading to a convergence in ULC levels across provinces and regions over this period. Comparing individual industries, we observe a substantial variation in growth rates and convergence trends across regions. Logit regression analysis confirms that labor-intensive industries are more likely to converge in ALP, ALC and ULC, whereas capital/skill-intensive industries tended to diverge. This finding is further confirmed by estimating a convergence regression, which suggests that misallocation of resources due to market imperfections or institutional barriers is likely to be the main factor behind the divergence of ULC.","[Chen, Vivian W.; van Ark, Bart] Conf Board, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Wu, Harry X.] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Wu, Harry X.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [van Ark, Bart] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",Hitotsubashi University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Groningen,"Chen, VW (通讯作者)，Conf Board, 845 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10022 USA.",vivian.chen@conference-board.org,,,,,,,26,9,9,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This crisis is the latest phase of the evolution of financial markets under the radical financial deregulation process that began in the late 1970s. This evolution has taken the form of cycles in which deregulation accompanied by rapid financial innovation stimulates powerful financial booms that end in crises. Governments respond to crises with bailouts that allow new expansions to begin. As a result, financial markets have become ever larger and financial crises have become more threatening to society, which forces governments to enact ever larger bailouts. This process culminated in the current global financial crisis, which is so deeply rooted that even unprecedented interventions by affected governments have, thus far, failed to contain it. In this paper we analyse the structural flaws in the financial system that helped bring on the current crisis and discuss prospects for financial reform.","[Crotty, James] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Crotty, James] Univ Massachusetts, PERI, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Crotty, J (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jrcrotty@comcast.net,,,,,,,61,423,501,11,139,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Two methods of resolving this indeterminacy are then explored: money illusion and a Taylor rule for monetary policy, a key feature of new consensus models.

While Spain's deviation from the European Union's intermediate emission goals is more serious than most other member countries' unemployment in Spain is also well above average for the European Union. We use a computable general equilibrium model that includes unemployment in the markets for unskilled and skilled labour. We find that introducing carbon permits does not aggravate Spanish unemployment. In fact, if supplied with revenue recycling schemes, unemployment rates may actually fall. Contrary to other European studies, we find that the best option is to reduce payroll taxes on relatively skilled types of labour. This reform is successful in both increasing labour demand and dampening the supply response to rising wages. However, while all of the recycling schemes generate dividends in terms of aggregate welfare, none entirely offsets the abatement costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A North-South model of international trade is introduced in which the number of countries in each region can be varied. As the number of countries in one region is increased, each government there competes more aggressively with the others in its region, by lowering its tariff, to attract imports from the other region. In doing so, all countries in a region exert a negative terms-of-trade externality on each other, collectively undermining their own terms of trade and welfare. This externality can increase efficiency if the numbers of countries in both regions are increased simultaneously. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Monetary policy involves the manipulation of the central bank interest rate, with the specific objective of achieving the main goal of monetary policy, which is, in most cases, the inflation rate. Fiscal policy should not be used as an instrument of stabilization policy. This raises two issues. The first is the theoretical underpinnings of this mode of economic policy. The second is the extent the quantitative impact of monetary and fiscal policy in the real world adhere to the principles set out by theory. Both aspects are investigated in this paper. We summarize results drawn from the euro area, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Two important conclusions emerge: the empirical results point to a relatively weak effect of interest rate changes on inflation. Also, monetary policy can have long-run effects on real magnitudes.

We claim that the marketing costs that emerge when the commercialization of export crops requires intermediaries can lead to lower participation into export cropping and, thus, to higher poverty. We test the model using data from the Uganda National Household Survey. We show that: i) farmers living in villages with fewer outlets for sales of agricultural exports are likely to be poorer than farmers residing in market-endowed villages; ii) market availability leads to increased household participation in export cropping (coffee, tea, cotton, fruits); iii) households engaged in export cropping are less likely to be poor than subsistence-based households. We conclude that the availability of markets for agricultural export crops help realize the gains from trade. This result uncovers the role of complementary factors that provide market access and reduce marketing costs as key building blocks in the link between the gains from export opportunities and the poor.

More specifically, I develop a simple model of oligopolistic competition to compare two main liability doctrines that have been used in the U.S. to assess infringement damages - the unjust enrichment rule and the lost profit rule. I show that the lost profit rule provides more protection to the patent holder than the unjust enrichment rule if the patent holder and infringer are equally efficient. When the lost profits from the infringement cannot be proved, the court accepts a reasonable royalty rate that would have been negotiated in a hypothetical bargaining situation as an alternative measure of damage.

Specifically, we consider a search model where workers can apply to high and or low productivity firms. Firms that compete for the same candidate can increase their wage offers as often as they like. We show that if workers apply to two jobs, there is a unique symmetric equilibrium where workers mix between sending both applications to the high and sending both to the low productivity sector. But, efficiency requires that they apply to both sectors because a higher matching rate in the high-productivity sector can then be realized with fewer applications (and consequently fewer coordination frictions) if workers always accept the offer of the most productive firm. However, in the market the worker's payoff is determined by how much the firm with the second highest productivity is willing to bid. This is what prevents them from applying to both sectors. For many configurations, the equilibrium outcomes are the same under directed and random search so our results are not driven by random search. We discuss the effects of increasing the number of applications and show that our results can easily be generalized to N-firms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, when we separate luck (unemployment in other states) from competence (unemployment in that state relative to the rest of Australia), we find that both luck and competence are equally important. This is consistent with a psychological theory of the 'fundamental attribution error', in which observers consistently underestimate the importance of situational constraints. We also find evidence that unemployment driven by a clearly exogenous source - the US economy - has a non-trivial impact on the re-election probability of Australian state governments.

The Arab world is defined by language rather than ethnicity. The League of Arab States, formed in 1945, consists of all countries in which (a dialect of) Arabic is the spoken language of the majority. It is useful to compare the human development diversity of the Arab world to that of Latin America, another vast geographic area defined by language and culture. Our strategy in this article is therefore to disaggregate the Arab world into Arab sub-Saharan Africa, Arab fuel-endowed economies, and a remainder we call the Arab Mediterranean, and to compare these three Arab worlds to non-Arab sub-Saharan Africa, non-Arab fuel endowed economies, and the rest of the non-Arab world. We will evaluate Arab socioeconomic progress from 1970 to as close to the present as the data allow.","[Rauch, James E.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kostyshak, Scott] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rauch, James E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Rauch, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jrauch@weber.ucsd.edu,,,,,,,19,21,30,0,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

After describing the transformation which has taken place with regard to the availability of data on income inequality, it discusses how the comparability of these estimates is brought into question by differences in methodology that cannot be eliminated by simple adjustments. Recent analyses of the relationships between income inequality and growth or globalisation are shown to be based on time series plagued by discontinuities which can seriously affect regression results. The paper concludes by calling for greater attention to data quality in applied economics.","[Atkinson, A.

If trade must balance in each period, we show that there will be a unique autarkic steady-state equilibrium and that the principle of comparative advantage will hold if the nondurable good is not inferior. A necessary condition for the existence of multiple steady-state equilibria with free trade is that the marginal propensity to consume a good be higher in the exporting country. We provide an example with three steady states where the extreme steady states are saddle points and the middle steady state will be either a source or a sink, depending on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. If there is international lending, this example has the property that there is a range of initial endowments for which there are three distinct and Pareto-optimal (saddle) paths that can be equilibria. We also show that there must be a unique saddle path from any endowment point with international capital markets when preferences are identical, homothetic, and have constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution.","[Bond, Eric W.; Driskill, Robert A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, VU Stn B 351819, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Bond, EW (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, VU Stn B 351819, 2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",eric.bond@vanderbilt.edu; robert.a.driskill@vanderbilt.edu,,"Bond, Eric/0000-0001-7028-1125",,,,,6,1,1,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We investigate two behavioural mechanisms that may be shaping bids in repeated auctions: A tendency to adjust bids towards previously observed market prices, and a tendency to reduce bids following bad market outcomes. We find little support for the former but strong support for the latter. Also, whilst 'just enough' market exposure eliminates the typical preference reversal phenomenon, continued exposure fosters the mirror image anomaly. Therefore, although market experience shapes behaviour, in our experiments, it does not generally promote consistency with standard preference theory. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A key feature of the model is that it achieves a separation between ambiguity, identified as a characteristic of the decision maker's subjective beliefs, and ambiguity attitude, a characteristic of the decision maker's tastes. In applications one may thus specify/vary these two characteristics independent of each other, thereby facilitating richer comparative statics and modeling flexibility than possible under other models which accommodate ambiguity sensitive preferences. Another key feature is that the preferences are dynamically consistent and have a recursive representation. Therefore techniques of dynamic programming can be applied when using this model.

From a Kaldorian perspective deindustrialisation could have negative implications for long-run growth, given the special growth-pulling properties of manufacturing. However, defining deindustrialisation purely in terms of employment share is conceptually limiting given that some of the Kaldorian processes operate primarily through output rather than employment, as well as blunting empirical analysis by not focussing enough on changes in manufacturing share of gross domestic product (GDP). This study develops a new method using decomposition techniques to analyse changes in manufacturing employment levels and shares in 48 countries over periods of 'deindustrialisation'. The analysis separates out changes in the levels and shares of employment manufacturing into components associated with changes in the share of manufacturing in GDP, the growth of manufacturing value-added, the labour intensity of manufacturing production and economic growth. The results indicate that in most cases the decline in manufacturing employment is associated primarily with falling labour intensity of manufacturing rather than an overall decline in the size or share of the manufacturing sector. We suggest that deindustrialisation should appropriately be defined in terms of a sustained decline in both the share of manufacturing in total employment and the share of manufacturing in GDP.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge,"Tregenna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",fmt21@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,114,130,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This article analyzes whether and how U.S. information goods exports are sensitive to national differences in IPR protection and the degree of threat-of-imitation from the dynamic perspective. Employing the technique of instrumental variables for a dynamic panel model to consider the hysteretic effect and controlling the endogeneity problem, the empirical results show that the strength of the importing country's IPR protection overall exhibits a trade-enhancing effect, supporting the standpoint that stronger IPR protection will induce more trade. Moreover, we adopt the piracy rate as a proxy for threat-of-imitation to examine its role on the information goods trade-IPR nexus. Empirical findings validate the prevalence of the market expansion effect wherever the degree of imitation threat of importing countries is high or low, because the technology level and production cost of reproduction are very low. It implies that the existing theory on threat-of-imitation may not apply to the information goods trade.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Weng, Yungho] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Weng, Yungho] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan; [Huang, Yi-Ju] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Central University; Tamkang University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",yweng@nccu.edu.tw; chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw; d11385@tier.org.tw,,"WENG, YUNGHO/0000-0003-1303-1589",,,,,29,12,13,2,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In Malaysia, there are 6 marine parks to-date. The establishment of marine parks also attracts more tourists to the areas. For example, the number of visitors to Payar Marine Park increased tremendously from 3,668 visitors in 1990 to 133,775 visitors in 2002. However, too many tourists are thought by scientists to have damaged the coral reefs.

Transportation productivity varies enormously by traffic type, for example, with long-haul versus short-haul traffic. Measurements of changes in physical productivity can easily be biased by modest changes in the traffic mix. We control for endogenous changes in the composition of truck traffic and Find that trucking has in fact lagged the U.S. economy as a whole in productivity growth over the period of our data, 1982-1997. Loosening of weight, length, and speed limits is the likely explanation for the growth we do observe. Improvements in information technology have brought real improvements in the quality of trucking services (in reliability, predictability, speed, order tracking, etc.), but as in other service industries, true physical productivity improvements in trucking are limited.","[Burks, Stephen V.] Univ Minnesota, Div Social Sci, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Boyer, Kenneth D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; Michigan State University,"Burks, SV (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Div Social Sci, 600 E 4th St, Morris, MN 56267 USA.",boyerkd@msu.edu; svburks@morris.umn.edu,"Burks, Stephen/IRZ-4493-2023","Burks, Stephen/0000-0003-4524-2954",,,,,23,5,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The program emphasized community participation in multi-sectoral interventions (including farming, animal husbandry, infrastructure and social services). Data were collected on 2000 households in project and non-project areas, spanning 10 years. A double-difference estimator of the program's impact (on top of pre-existing governmental programs) reveals sizeable short-term income gains that were mostly saved. Only small and statistically insignificant gains to mean consumption emerged in the longer-term - though in rough accord with the average gain to permanent income. The Use of community-based beneficiary selection greatly reduced the overall impact, given that the educated poor were Under-covered. The main results are robust to corrections for various sources of selection bias, including village targeting and interference due to spillover effects generated by the response of local governments to the external aid.

When firms conduct bi-sourcing in the global economy consisting of the high-waged North and low-waged South, they need to make the location choice for both insourcing and outsourcing. We find that the low wage in the South can encourage investment by component suppliers (the cost effect). However, firms may achieve a better cross-threat effect by relocating overly strong component supplier from the cost.-advantageous South to the cost-disadvantageous North (the balancing effect).

The paper concludes with the analysis of the international agreements on policies toward compatibility and evaluates the existing provisions in the WTO legal system aimed at minimizing the trade-inhibiting impact of standards and regulations in the area of technical compatibility.

The case of Peru,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,,INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES,"Peru has experienced during the last decades a significant increase in its educational coverage at all levels, including higher education. However, currently high unemployment and underemployment rates cast doubt about the profitability of the investments in education undertaken. This paper estimates the evolution of the returns to education in the last two decades in Peru, and finds mixed evidence on the profitability of higher education in the Peruvian labor market. Due to the con-vexification of returns, university education shows average private and social rates of return estimated between 12 to 15%. On the contrary, non university higher education shows on average rather low private and social rates of return, even close to zero. Therefore, a deep evaluation on the effectiveness and relevance of that education level seems warranted.","Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru",Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Yamada, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru.",,,"Yamada Fukusaki, Gustavo/0000-0002-9810-7767",,,,,30,0,2,0,12,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Productive efficiency convergence occurs during 1986-90, 1996-2000, and 2000-4.

In the 20th century, in contrast with the nineteenth, a much smaller fraction of real output growth could be swept back to the growth of inputs conventionally measured. The rise of the residual, they suggested, was an important distinguishing feature of 20th century growth. This paper identifies two difficulties with this claim. First, TFP growth virtually disappeared in the US between 1973 and 1995. Second, TFP growth was in fact quite robust between the end of the Civil War and 1906, as was in fact acknowledged by Abramovitz in his 1993 Economic History Association Presidential address. Developing a revised macroeconomic narrative is essential in reconciling our interpretation of these numbers with what we know about scientific, technological, and organizational change during the gilded age.

However, existing studies typically use a narrow population consisting of college students. To test the robustness of these findings, we report on an experiment using 18-84-year old participants recruited from an online panel. While trusting gender differences are robust across age, with women less trusting than men, reciprocating behavior is not robust across age; gender differences in reciprocating behavior depend on age and amounts received in a complex manner. Regarding trusting behavior, we also find that men and women of all ages trust women and older people more than men and younger people. To understand trust better, we collected socio-economic and demographic information and experimentally measured how much subjects expected different partner types would return. While socio-economic and demographic information explain little of the trusting and reciprocating behavior, expectations explain nearly 50 percent of the reason women trust less than men and why more is sent to women and older people. However, even after controlling for expectations, gender and age differences remain significant in explaining trusting behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Johnson, WR; Turner, S",,,,"Johnson, William R.; Turner, Sarah",,,Faculty without Students: Resource Allocation in Higher Education,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Colleges and universities display substantial differences in the ratio of students to faculty across fields or disciplines. At Harvard University, for example, economics has about 16 students majoring in the subject per full-time-teaching equivalent, while in other departments such as astronomy, Slavic, German, and Celtic, the number of teaching faculty exceeds the number of student majors. We begin by presenting some evidence on the extent of the variation in faculty resource allocation by field and the broad changes over the last several decades. We then consider potential economic explanations for these striking patterns. For example, a basic education production function, which seeks to maximize aggregate student learning subject to a faculty salary budget constraint, will require that faculty be allocated across fields so that relative marginal gains in student learning equal relative faculty salaries. Differences across fields in student-faculty ratios could then arise either from differences in the pedagogical technology across fields or variation in relative faculty salaries. Additional university goals, such as research and graduate program productivity, or adjustment costs, as imposed by the tenure system, could also generate variation across fields in student-faculty ratios. However, we have only limited evidence that these arguments can explain the ongoing disparities in student-faculty ratios across fields and disciplines, which suggests that a substantial part of the explanation may reside in the politics rather than the economics of decision making in institutions of higher education.","[Johnson, William R.; Turner, Sarah] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Turner, Sarah] Natl Bur Econ Res, Fac Res Associate, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Johnson, WR (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",wjohnson@virginia.edu; sturner@virginia.edu,,,,,,,33,10,16,0,13,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Both internal and external impact of the voting rules are examined. Internal impact affects the distribution of power among the Member States, and external impact affects power relations between the main decision-making bodies in the EU. One of the main lessons of the analysis is that voting rules matter. This clearly explains why the design of Council voting rules has required so much bargaining and cumbersome marathon negotiations. The internal decision-making rules in the Council have substantial impact on both the national distribution of power in the Council and inter-institutional power between the EU's decision-making bodies.

Unlike under risk-neutrality, the wedge between the marginal rate of transformation and a low-productivity agent's marginal rate or substitution between consumption and leisure will not vanish permanently at her first high-productivity report; also, the wedge increases with the duration of a low-productivity report.

Several authors have suggested SVARs fail partly because they are finite-order approximations to infinite-order processes. We estimate vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) and state space models, which are not misspecified, using simulated data and compare true with estimated impulse responses of hours worked to a technology shock. We find few gains from using VARMA models. However, state space algorithms can outperform SVARs. In particular, the CCA subspace method consistently yields lower mean squared errors, although even these estimates remain too imprecise for reliable inference. The qualitative differences for algorithms based on different representations are small. The comparison with estimation methods without specification error suggests that the main problem is not one of working with a VAR approximation. The properties of the processes used in the literature make identification via long-run restrictions difficult for any method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore we can measure traders' behavior in both bullish and bearish markets. We observe underreaction of price changes to changes in fundamental value which induces overvaluation in bearish and undervaluation in bullish markets. We also find an asymmetry between markets with bullish fundamental values and those with bearish ones as the former markets show a higher degree of informational efficiency. The reason for the observed underreaction lies in the relatively large volatility of the underlying fundamental value process. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Initially, connection, routing and content were three separate parts of high-speed Internet service. Cable companies initially teamed with affiliated third-party providers to create their high-speed access combination of connection and routing whereas telephone companies resisted working with third-party providers for their high-speed access product. In the end, both cable and telephone providers moved toward a more integrated approach to the provision of high-speed access. However, content has remained, for the most part, separate from connection and routing. This paper finds that changes in the cost of caching, bandwidth and more standardized technical knowledge led cable companies toward the integrated approach favored by telephone companies, and changes in regulation facilitated integrated provision by telephone companies. At the same time, integration of access with content did not provide similar efficiencies and, for the most part, content remains provided for by independent companies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It uses a monopolistically competitive political economy model in which the government determines external tariffs endogenously. The effect of foreign lobbying under the FTA is examined empirically using Canadian industry-level trade data that allow differentiating of lobby groups by the country of origin. The analysis suggests that the presence of foreign lobbying has a significant effect on the domestic trade policy. The heterogeneity of foreign lobbies is also important: the presence of an organized lobbying group in an FTA partner country tends to raise trade barriers while an organized lobbying group of exporters from outside of the FTA is associated with less protection.

Biotechnology offers significant economic benefits, particularly in exports and job creation, as well as important health, safety and environmental benefits. Although it has the potential to be an important engine of economic development in the twenty-first century, its research-intensity and the associated long lead times have intensified the equity gap faced by all rapidly growing firms. As a result, there are concerns about start-up financing on growth and performance. Our results show that angel, venture and conventional capital have contributed significantly to RD capital formation and sales growth. Conversely, the contribution of funding from government, IPO and alliance capital sources are unimportant for our sample of biotechnology firms. These are counter intuitive results for conventional capital's importance for firm growth rates. It was expected that venture capital would be most important; however, it may be that older firms with more mature products or products ready for market are chosen as bank customers. In that case, perhaps it makes sense that bank capital is correlated with higher growth rates.","[Cozzarin, Brian P.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Management Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Ahmed, Shamim] Head Off Motijheel, Bangladesh Bank, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Waterloo,"Cozzarin, BP (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Management Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",bpcozzar@uwaterloo.ca,"Cozzarin, Brian Paul/AAY-9110-2021; Cozzarin, Brian/AAY-9114-2021","Cozzarin, Brian Paul/0000-0002-4280-7633; AHMED, SHAMIM/0000-0003-3712-5213",,,,,7,11,12,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Employing a nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, the study estimates the efficiency for a cross section of the UAE banks in 2004. The results indicate that the dominant source of inefficiency in the UAE banking is stemming from allocative inefficiency rather than technical inefficiency. Furthermore, the main source of the relatively small size, technical inefficiency in the UAE banking industry is not the scale inefficiency but rather pure technical inefficiency. The results further indicate that the UAE banks are able to use their input resources more efficiently when they have more branches, and that newer banks are performing better than older banks on average. Moreover, the results also show that short experiences of employees affect efficiencies negatively and government ownership tends to reduce efficiency (as the government shares increase in the bank, the efficiency scores get lower). Finally, the most interesting results have to do with finding higher average efficiencies in banks that employ more women, more managers and less national citizens of the UAE.","[Al Shamsi, Fatima S.] UAE Univ, Dept Econ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Aly, Hassan Y.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [El-Bassiouni, Mohamed Y.] UAE Univ, Dept Stat, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Aly, Hassan Y.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Al Shamsi, Fatima S.] UAE Univ, Dept Econ, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [El-Bassiouni, Mohamed Y.] UAE Univ, Dept Stat, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; United Arab Emirates University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University,"Aly, HY (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 410 Arps Hall,1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",aly.1@osu.edu,,"Aly, Hassan/0000-0001-8757-0361",,,,,46,5,6,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

At the same time the number of currency exchange transactions also increases. Every year the amount of exchange operations grows together with the profits of market participants. The majority of these market participants faces currency exchange rate fluctuations, because there is a lack of currency rate forecasting model helping to operate on the market profitably for a longer period. This influences the need for various currency rate risk management models development. Investing in international currency market, it is very important to know what types of risk can be met and what level of risk is related with one or another currency position opening. That is why for selection of investment decisions it is very important to estimate and manage risk. For risk valuation different mathematical statistical methods are used, however, most of them estimate risk separated from the trade model and with known trade results. It is not an occasion that models become more popular. This allows to valuate risk in advance, moderate it and calculate possible foreign currency positions. Paper analyzes possibilities of risk management using value at risk (VaR) methods, theoretical presumptions of VaR method applications are also discussed. The authors of this paper present complex variance - covariance VaR model, which allows to moderate rate risk of a given currency. Proposed model is tested using regressive testing with real currency market data, aiming to estimate the reliability level of the proposed model.

Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we examine the effect of parental benefits on participation rates of children in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Our findings indicate a significant difference in take-up rates for children in states offering parental coverage compared to neighbouring states that did not in the period surrounding the introduction of the SCHIP program (1997-2002). Specifically, states offering parental coverage have greater program participation (on the order of 10% points) among children even after controlling for observable demographic characteristics and the household's position in the income distribution. Thus, extending coverage to the parents of SCHIP-eligible children appears to be an effective strategy to reduce uninsurance rates among children.","[Bansak, Cynthia] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [McLaren, Christopher] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",Saint Lawrence University; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Bansak, C (通讯作者)，St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, Canton, NY 13617 USA.",cbansak@stlawu.edu,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Some authors have presented evidence to suggest that this is the outcome of a one-off structural break from a high to low volatility state whilst others have estimated regime switching models that indicate low volatility regime states have dominated in recent years. This article provides further evidence on the general properties of output volatility for Australia, including evidence of a significant moderation in output volatility for the country that occurred in the early 1980s. Estimates of various GARCH models of real GDP growth are also provided to further examine shorter term volatility features of the Australian economy that are associated with its business-cycle. A regime shift dummy is maintained in all models of the conditional variance in order to account for the regime shift in volatility and evidence is found of significant business-cycle effects, including leverage effects and asymmetries that suggest recessions are times of higher output volatility than economic expansions. Overall, it is concluded that the so-called 'Great Moderation' in macroeconomic instability, as documented here for Australia, is a result of a myriad of economic, institutional and policymaking changes.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Bodman, P (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.bodman@economics.uq.edu.au,,,,,,,34,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Though the literature comes up with some means to calibrate the estimated preferences ex-post, this is far from being unproblematic and uncontroversial. In this paper we test whether a short ex-ante entreaty, presented to respondents in a health economic stated preference survey, can effectively reduce the number of protest zero bids. We first of all find that the protest reduction entreaty significantly reduces the number of protest zero bids in the survey. Furthermore, the results indicate that marginal demand for the individual attributes as well as general preferences do not seem to be influenced by the protest reduction entreaty. Compared to the traditional ex-post calibration of protest zero bids in stated preference surveys, these results suggest that an ex-ante reduction in protest zero bids by using a simple and short entreaty is possible without introducing other types of biases in the survey.","[Bonnichsen, Ole] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Life Sci, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Environm Econ & Rural Dev Div, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ladenburg, Jacob] Danish Inst Govt Res, DK-1602 Copenhagen V, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Bonnichsen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Life Sci, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Environm Econ & Rural Dev Div, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",ole@foi.dk; jal@akf.dk,"Bonnichsen, Ole/D-9893-2015; Ladenburg, Jacob/GPP-5997-2022","Ladenburg, Jacob/0000-0002-1095-1534",Coloplast A/S,Coloplast A/S,We gratefully acknowledge the helpful and valuable comments of Soren Boye Olsen and Sinne Smed at the University of Copenhagen and two anonymous reviewers.

Results from the widely used structural analysis model indicate that the four banking sectors have become moderately concentrated, resulting in a narrower reach of banking services to customers. Because of governments' re-privatization of banks and the relaxation for foreign bank entry, foreign ownership has increased. Our financial analysis shows significant improvements in financial intermediation, efficiency and soundness. More special efforts, however, need to be made to regain performance levels in credit provision to the private sector, and increase depositor confidence, operating efficiency, and profitability. Our results suggest that it is imperative for policy-makers to realize and balance the trade-off between achieving financial soundness and providing private credit access. In addition, although new policy (deposit insurance) has been adopted to assure depositors of their investments, long-term measures such as better risk management practices should be in place to ensure safety and the soundness of banks, and thus the confidence of the depositors.","[Can, Luc] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ariff, Mohamed] Bond Univ, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia",Harvard University; Bond University,"Can, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Vanlucan@yahoo.com,"Ariff, Mohamed/U-6072-2019",,,,,,71,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This research explores the possibility of two stages credit evaluation in lending process. When the evaluation cost drops below the trigger cost, it pays to conduct the second-stage loan appraisal. We derive two trigger cost thresholds for borrowers who are rated as credible and default in the first stage, respectively. Contingent on the share of good borrowers relative to the bad ones, the optimal strategy of the bank can be differentiated to implement second-stage evaluation on either (I) both types, or (2) only one type, or (3) neither type of the borrowers. We find that during severe economic contractions or in geographic areas/industries Which are in deep troubles, whilst the borrowers who repay the loan are out-numbered by the borrowers who fail to pay, the trigger cost for good borrower is higher than that of default borrower. in this scenario, the banks are more inclined to undertake the second-stage credit evaluation on good borrowers. On the other hand, if the percentage of credible borrowers is higher than that of default borrowers, the trigger cost for good borrower lies below the trigger cost of default borrower. As a result, the banks are less inclined to undertake the second-stage evaluation on good borrowers. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

One major point seems to be that the negative elasticity for within-state price is similar in magnitude to the positive elasticity for the (lowest) price in bordering states. Several additional points also seem noteworthy. First, having a border with Mexico lowers sales in the state sizably. Second, the share of Hispanic/Latino population in the state also lowers sales significantly. Third, contiguity with Canada appears to have no significant effect. Fourth, partial impact of the state being a major tobacco producer appears minor even though consumption in these states is considerably higher. Fifth, education shows the expected negative association with cigarette consumption, but its statistical significance is low. Last, income carries a weak negative parameter, perhaps reflecting the lower prevalence of smoking in higher-income households.","[Connelly, Richard T.; Goel, Rajeev K.; Ram, Rati] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA",Illinois State University,"Ram, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",rram@ilstu.edu,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",,,,,25,12,13,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We also review evidence from laboratory and field experiments examining the role of wages and fairness on effort, derive predictions from our approach for entry-level wages and incumbent workers' wages, confront these predictions with the evidence, and show that reference-dependent fairness concerns may have important consequences for the effects of economic policies such as minimum wage laws.","[Fehr, Ernst] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Goette, Lorenz] Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Zehnder, Christian] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Geneva; University of Lausanne,"Fehr, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",efehr@iew.uzh.ch; Lorenz.goette@unige.ch; christian.zehnder@unil.ch,"Vyacheslav, Gromyko/I-5054-2012","Zehnder, Christian/0000-0001-6199-4975",,,,,153,140,159,2,63,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1383,,,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

It is performed by managing project technical documentation and digital data, which involves the complete life cycle of design documentation and design-related data inside CAD applications. Life cycle of design documentation and design-related data is achieved through the engineering document management system (EDM). EDM system founded on electronic archive system, which stores and distributes all technical information. The electronic archive is based on reference model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). As OAIS is a universal and uniform system, a technological development is required for customizing it to a specific industry (such as, building design and construction industry). Such development is presented in this work with an emphasis on management of projects document properties and their inheritance. The document properties play an important role in an archive, as they represent an instrument for performing any manipulations with a document (such as submission, distribution, search, modification and so on). Thus, any document placed in an archive has to be accompanied by document properties. This issue is addressed because the straightforward attachment of properties directly to a document introduces a lot of mistakes. This may lead to misplacement of document in archive system. Instead of this, in a proposed approach the properties were attached to the project structure (also called hierarchal tree). The previous developments in management Of electronic archive were focused on the automatization of data gathering, processing and submitting. It allows storing the technical documentation according to the rules, which were based on the flow of documentation in a building design company. It was insured by additional models enclosed into the system - now called the, 'monolithic archive. However, the growing requirements of engineers, and internal collaboration required across engineering departments, lead to the constant modification of monolithic archive and the basis of OAIS model. This introduces delays in engineering product design processes and requires an implementation of trainings and instructions. Therefore, the monolithic archive was fundamentally restructured rejecting all intermediate OAIS models. It was named as a virtual archive, since it operates from a virtual vault rather than a centralized vault. The objective of this work is to propose and implement a new development of an electronic archive system (named virtual archive) that offers a management of project document properties and inheritance in a structural way. A virtual archive was built for storing files that do not lock engineering documents into proprietary data vault. This open architecture prepares engineering to merge into a corporate environment without changing usually work routines. The document management and search in a distributed network can be performed by using Window File explore, Word, Excel, or CAD applications, thus avoiding any intermediate links. It provides all essential document management capabilities, property management, version control, advanced searching, user and work group management. A virtual archive maintains project properties, metadata and related files so that it enables properties inheritance and management of document properties. Property inheritance is established according to the project structure and components. It takes a form of hierarchical tree, which reflects the main phases of the construction process.","[Gabrielaitis, Linas; Bausys, Romualdas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Gabrielaitis, L (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",linas.gabrielaitis@fm.vgtu.lt; romas@fm.vgtu.lt,"Bausys, Romualdas/AAT-6277-2021","Bausys, Romualdas/0000-0002-6284-0406",,,,,22,1,1,2,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Five primary contributions of this work are: First, it provides evidence on the cross-relation between cigarettes and marijuana and illicit drugs. Second, besides the 'standard' control variables used in demand studies (namely, price, education and income), we also control for the influence of employment status and health insurance coverage. Third, this research provides new evidence on the price elasticity of cigarette demand for a recent time period. Fourth, the data used in this study are the latest available. Five, based on our results, implications for drug use policy are provided. Several key points may be noted from our results: (i) Cigarette demand seems to have become elastic in recent years. This is in contrast to findings in earlier years; (ii) Consumers seem to view cigarettes and marijuana as substitutes and cigarettes and illicit drugs as substitutes. (iii) Greater consumer income increases illegal drug use, but does not seem to have a significant impact on smoking and marijuana use; (iv) The unemployment rate and health insurance converge do not seem to significantly affect smoking or drug use; and (v) Policymakers should pay attention to the cross effects among drugs in framing drug use policies.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Goel, RK (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rkgoel@ilstu.edu,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",,,,,14,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

DEA models are non-parametric techniques for evaluation of efficiency and performance of the set of homogenous units based on solving of linear programming problems. The basic idea of DEA models consists in estimation of an efficient frontier that defines production possibility set of the problem. The efficient frontier is estimated from the data set that contains the most important characteristics influencing the efficiency of the units. The units lying on the frontier are considered as efficient and the remaining ones as inefficient. Their efficiency score is measured as a distance from the efficient frontier. The following characteristics are taking into account in our analysis: premium income, other income, insurance claims, operating expenses.","[Grmanova, Eva] Trencianska Univ Alexandra Dubceka Trencine, Fak Socialnoekon Vztahov, Katedra Mikro Makroekon, Trencin 91150, Slovakia; [Jablonsky, Josef] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Informat Stat, Katedra Ekonometrie, CR-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Grmanová, E (通讯作者)，Trencianska Univ Alexandra Dubceka Trencine, Fak Socialnoekon Vztahov, Katedra Mikro Makroekon, Studentska 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",grmanova@tnuni.sk; jablon@vse.cz,"Jablonsky, Josef/U-2395-2018; Grmanová, Eva/HKE-0610-2023; Jablonsky, Josef/N-8711-2019","Grmanová, Eva/0000-0003-2269-1677; Jablonsky, Josef/0000-0003-0606-354X",,,,,10,17,17,1,9,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.
