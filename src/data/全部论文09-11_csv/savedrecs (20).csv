This paper presents new estimates of the wage intertemporal substitution elasticity (ISE) for the intensive margin of female labor supply. It likewise explores this margin's sensitivity to changes in the price of recreation and home consumption goods. Our estimated wage ISE (0.9) implies that, at average time allocation values, female labor force participants will increase their annual labor supply by around 14 hours when offered a 1% increase, in the wage rate. Approximately 7 hours of this increase will be from less time spent on leisure and the other 7 from less time spent on home production. Annual labor supply is reduced by around 7 hours when the price of home consumption goods rises by 1%, this extra time being almost entirely devoted to home production. An elasticity of substitution between time and goods in home production of approximately 2 is also estimated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The policy implication is that value judgements about intergenerational welfare, reflected in stpr, have implications for policies aimed at achieving a target carbon price.

It compares actual primary expenditure trends with those that would have prevailed if countries had followed neutral policies based on expenditure rules since the start of EMU. Moreover, the implications for debt trends are calculated. Results show that all sample countries except Germany applied expansionary expenditure policies already before the crisis. Consequently, expenditure and debt paths were much higher compared to a counterfactual neutral expenditure stance. Rule-based expenditure policies could have led to much safer fiscal positions much more in line with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact.

Differences in managing the exchange rate fluctuations are identified according to the extent of managing as hard (dirty) versus soft managed floating, on the one hand, and according to direct managing via foreign exchange interventions and indirect managing via interest rate policy, on the other hand. Hard versus soft managed floating (sub) regimes are related to inflation-targeting (sub) regimes: hard managed floating with light inflation targeting and soft managed floating with strict or full-fledged inflation targeting. Two main motives for managing exchange rate fluctuations are emphasized in the paper: exchange rate pass-through and financial euroization. The direct and indirect managing of exchange rate fluctuations, exchange rate pass-through, and financial euroization, are investigated with vector auto regression (VAR)/vector error correction (VEC) models in the case of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Serbia, in the period of combining flexible exchange rate regimes and an inflation-targeting monetary regime. The comparison of investigated indicators provides conclusions and lessons for the Serbian monetary authorities in the sense of conducting the current combination of managed exchange rate floating and an inflation-targeting regime.","[Josifidis, Kosta; Pucar, Emilija Beker] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Allegret, Jean-Pierre] GATE Lyon St, Lyon, France; [Allegret, Jean-Pierre] Univ St Etienne, Lyon Univ, Etienne CNRS, St Etienne, France; [Allegret, Jean-Pierre] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lyon, France",University of Novi Sad; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Jean Monnet; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON),"Josifidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",,,"Beker Pucar, Emilija/0000-0002-6369-3225",,,,,19,5,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We consider four alternative methods for counting patents, using two possible filters: weighting patents by patent family size and including only patent applications filed in multiple countries. For each patent count, we create knowledge stocks representing the global technological frontier. We find that technological advances do lead to greater investment, but the effect is small. Investments in other carbon-free energy sources, such as hydropower and nuclear power, serve as substitutes for renewable energy.

The classical approach of NPV perspective to price the target enterprise of M&A has been replaced by integration of contemporary perspectives such as NPV perspective, real options perspective, game perspective, and so on. In this paper, the dynamic analyses model to price the target enterprise of M&A is developed from the perspective of real options integrated with game theory under stochastic surroundings. The synergy multiplication coefficient is introduced into the evaluation model to reflect the synergy management process of M&A, and the equilibrium price formula is proposed by applying the famous offer-counteroffer Rubinstein theorem, which is improved to fit for the stochastic surroundings. The price formula is further discussed on condition that the operating cost is more than or less than profit flow, which is assumed to follow geometric Brownian motion process.

Profit-maximizing automakers will equate the marginal cost of compliance using the loophole, which is observable, with the unobservable costs of strategies that genuinely improve fuel economy. Based on this insight, we estimate that tightening standards by one mile per gallon would have cost automakers just $9-$27 per vehicle in recent years.

We show that using inappropriate objectives generates relatively large welfare costs. When expressed in terms of 'consumption equivalent' units, these costs correspond to permanent decreases in steady-state consumption of up to two percent. The latter are generated by both the inappropriate choice of weights and the omission of variables. In particular, it is costly to assume an interest-rate smoothing incentive for central bankers when it is not socially optimal to do so. Finally, a parameter uncertainty decomposition indicates that uncertainty about the properties of markup shocks gives rise to the largest welfare costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The implication of John Kenneth Galbraith's example and writings on the war in Vietnam are linked to the author's actions in Australia during Australia's involvement in the war. The relevance of Veblen's damning critique of J.B.

This review suggests that host economy size, labor costs (defined to include the influences of productivity and labor quality) and agglomeration of Japanese investors were among the most important factors influencing location choice by Japanese MNCs. However, evidence regarding a wide range of other potential determinants was more mixed. Principles underlying the literature review are then illustrated by constructing an index of investment attractiveness from 140 components used to measure the influence of 10 groups of determinants, and ranking the 11 largest Asian hosts to Japan's manufacturing MNCs in a baseline and 14 alternative scenarios. The baseline and four of the five alternative scenarios prioritizing local or export markets reveal China to be the most favorable location, usually followed by Singapore and Hong Kong. In nine alternative scenarios with lower weights on domestic and export markets but higher weights for cost factors, Singapore, followed by Hong Kong and China, were usually the most attractive locations. At the other end of the scale, India, Vietnam and the Philippines ranked lowest in the baseline and in most alternative scenarios, with Indonesia ranking slightly higher. Baseline index rankings were similar to rankings of affiliate sales for China, India, Vietnam and the Philippines, but diverged for the other seven economies.","[Ramstetter, Eric D.] Kyushu Univ, Int Ctr Study E Asian Dev, Kokurakita Ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan; [Ramstetter, Eric D.] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kokurakita Ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Ramstetter, ED (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Int Ctr Study E Asian Dev, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Otemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",ramst@icsead.or.jp,,,,,,,136,7,9,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

In the neoclassical model, habits modify the economy's growth rate and generate transitional dynamics in fertility; stationary income per capita is associated with either increasing or decreasing population and output, depending on the strength of habits. In the AK specification, growing population and increasing consumption per capita require that the habit coefficient lie within definite boundaries; outside the critical interval, positive growth is associated with either declining consumption due to overcrowding, or extinction paths with declining population. In both frameworks, habits reduce fertility: the trade-off between second-period consumption and spending for bequests prompts agents to decrease fertility in order to make parental altruism less costly. This mechanism suggests that status-dependent preferences may explain part of the decline in fertility rates observed in most developed economies.","[Schaefer, Andreas] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Valente, Simone] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Leipzig University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Valente, S (通讯作者)，CER ETH, ZUE F-13,Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",svalente@ethz.ch,,"Schaefer, Andreas/0000-0002-4703-7914",,,,,37,6,5,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The signalling and learning dynamics between the CB and a representative private-sector agent under asymmetric information is investigated. Inflation positively reacts to contractionary monetary policy because the change in the interest rate is perceived as a signal of the CB's private information about higher future inflation and output by the public. The empirical section of the paper validates this theoretical argument using a VAR specification about the US economy. Besides providing an explanation for the price puzzle, the results of this paper has practical implications about transparency and monetary policy. The theoretical and empirical findings indicate that asymmetric information causes significant frictions in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. These frictions induce short-run undesired effects like increase in expected inflation and actual inflation as a response to contractionary monetary policy which is identified as the price puzzle.

Such complementarity could invite virtuous cycles of development. Using a measure of corruption as our proxy for the quality of governance, and rainfall as an instrument for income, we explore this issue and find evidence to the contrary. For a panel of African countries, positive income shocks on average tend to invite extra corruption. Closer inspection, however, reveals that this result can be attributed to the most corrupt countries. Conversely, countries with a sufficiently low level of corruption can escape the detrimental effect of income booms on corruption and may actually experience a virtuous cycle of development.","[Voors, Maarten J.; Bulte, Erwin H.] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bulte, Erwin H.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Damania, Richard] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Wageningen University & Research; Tilburg University; The World Bank,"Voors, MJ (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, POB 8130, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",maarten.voors@wur.nl,"Assari, Shervin/B-3062-2011","Assari, Shervin/0000-0002-5054-6250; Bulte, Erwin/0000-0001-9491-5268; Voors, Maarten/0000-0001-5907-3253",,,,,65,9,11,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

It is conventionally believed that removal of uncertainty always brings additional stability to an existing equilibrium. This paper shows that the relation between information and equilibrium stability may not be monotonic. Removal of information lag may sometimes destabilize the otherwise stable continuous model. Economic applications to Cournot and Bertrand competition are examined where the role of improved information on stability is shown to be cost-structure specific. Elimination of lags may cause stability loss.

We apply a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model and analyse the possible asymmetric behaviour of real wages in response to different macroeconomic shocks. Finally, we use the NBER business cycle periodisation to evaluate how real wages interact with the different shocks during contractions and booms. The results indicate that real wages cyclicality substantially depends on the driving forces of business cycle fluctuations. Different time periods are dominated by different types of shocks. When the business cycle is mainly driven by supply-side shocks real wages present a pro-cyclical behaviour. On the contrary, when the business cycle is driven by aggregate demand shocks real wages move counter-cyclically.","[Altavilla, Carlo] Univ Naples Parthenope, CSEF, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Vinci, Concetto Paolo] Univ Salerno, I-84100 Salerno, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of Salerno,"Altavilla, C (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, CSEF, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",altavilla@uniparthenope.it; cpvinci@unisa.it,"Vinci, Concetto Paolo/AAD-8293-2020",,,,,,36,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

J,"Ambrosi, GM",,,,"Ambrosi, Gerhard Michael",,,Keynes' abominable Z-footnote,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Keynesian economics; 45-degree line; Aggregate supply; Employment; Microfoundations,,"Keynes' concept of a Z(w)-function relates the value of aggregate supply in wage units to employment. It aroused much controversy until the very recent past. A special bone of contention was the question of whether Keynes intended the Z(w)-curve to be drawn as a 45 degrees line. This note argues that the 45 degrees line, which Keynes did mention referred to equilibrium conditions 'on' the Z(w)-curve but not to the shape of the curve itself. Keynes assumed that the Z(w)-curve is linear and its slope is determined by the share of wages in total income. The linearity assumption is helpful for consistent aggregation. This curve is based on conventional (neo) classical assumptions of profit maximisation under atomistic competition and on well-behaved production functions on the microeconomic level. The Z(w)-curve is the basis for Keynes's claim that there is a reliable relation between effective demand and employment. Seeing this concept in vicinity to (neo) classical analysis is important for three reasons: (i) it substantiates Keynes's claim to have a General Theory in the sense that it contains the classical analysis; (ii) the approach refutes what the note calls 'Hayek-type' criticism of Keynes, namely the claim that classical theory shows that Keynes is wrong in claiming the existence of a reliable relationship between effective demand and employment; (iii) the approach refutes what the note calls 'Hawtrey-type' criticism, namely that the (neo) classical analysis is logically so flawed that on this basis no connection can be derived between effective demand and employment.","Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Ambrosi, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",ambrosi@uni-trier.de,,"Ambrosi, Michael/0000-0001-6011-6871",,,,,15,4,4,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In particular, how fast do the mechanisms converge to the stage game Nash equilibrium and how does that speed of convergence depend on the mechanism parameter gamma. Prior theoretical and experimental work provide little guidance. Neither do existing behavioral models designed for small games with a small finite number of strategies. For example, even though experience weighted attraction learning is very successful in modeling behavior in one-shot games with very small, finite strategy spaces, it is not successful in modeling behavior in repeated games with a continuum strategy space unless one wants to be involved in fine tuning. We provide a behavioral model, individual evolutionary learning. The time to first convergence is predicted to be smooth and U-shaped in gamma. These predictions are robust to a wide range of parameter values. To test the IEL predictions, we ran our own experiments at the California Institute of Technology. Qualitatively, the data from those experiments are consistent with the IEL predictions about convergence and the U-shaped curve. Quantitatively, the human subjects are a little faster, a little less stable, and slightly less efficient than IEL But for gamma = 50 and 100, the differences between humans and IEL are very small.

A model is estimated that relates services exports and output to world activity, competitiveness and the rate of corporation tax. This model indicates that a reduction in the rate of corporation tax in the 1990s stimulated exports and, even allowing for profit repatriations by foreign firms and replacement of lost tax revenue, it resulted in an increase in domestic output. The increase in profitability suggests that some of the increased output involved relocation of profits to Ireland by multinational firms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our results hold even when controlling for the possible endogeneity of grants and the boundedness of the linkage variable. We conclude that governments should not apply a one-size-fits-all approach to incentivizing foreign multinationals.","[Goerg, Holger; Hanley, Aoife] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Goerg, Holger; Hanley, Aoife] Univ Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Goerg, Holger] Aarhus Sch Business, CEPR, Aarhus, Denmark; [Goerg, Holger] Aarhus Sch Business, GlobID, Aarhus, Denmark; [Strobl, Eric] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",goerg@economics.uni-kiel.de; hanley@economics.uni-kiel.de; eric.strobl@polytechnique.edu,,,,,,,33,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We condition the current capacity utilization of firms on their current and planned price adjustments. The non-inflationary capacity utilization rate is then defined as the rate where a firm feels no price adjustment pressure. One of the main advantages is that this methodology uses structural aspects and does not make it necessary to operate with - often rather arbitrary - statistical filters. We show that our aggregate NIRCU performs remarkably well as an indicator of inflationary pressure in a Phillips curve estimation.Dans ce memoire, on propose une methode simple pour deriver le taux non-inflationniste d'utilisation de la capacite (NIRCU) a partir de micro-donnees. On etablit l'utilization de la capacite des firmes sur la base des ajustements (presents ou anticipes) de prix. Le taux non-inflationniste d'utilisation de la capacite est alors defini comme celui ou la firme ne ressent aucune pression pour ajuster ses prix. L'un des principaux avantages de cette approche est que cette methodologie utilise les aspects structurels et ne necessite pas qu'on utilise des filtres statistiques souvent arbitraires.

We find that the share of independent directors on the board has an insignificant relationship with firm performance. We suspect that the result is driven by the lack of institutional reforms in relation to the appointment of independent directors. Our analysis shows strong empirical support for the proposition that family control (family ownership and family involvement on the board) is negatively related to firm performance. However, the significant effect of family ownership disappears when family involvement on the board is taken into the model. This result indicates that family ownership is more detrimental to firm performance whenever the family is highly involved in control decisions. Our results suggest that Indonesia needs to implement governance reforms that prevent majority owners from exercising excessive control over firms.","[Simpson, John] Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Prabowo, Muhammad] Univ Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Indonesia",Curtin University; Sebelas Maret University,"Simpson, J (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, WA, Australia.",simpsonj@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,48,39,41,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The evidence on the short-term dynamics is also consistent with the tax-and-spend hypothesis. One implication of this finding is that the size of the government at the state-local level is not determined by expenditure demand, but rather by resource supply.

While being scanned in two adjacent MRI scanners, pairs of subjects had to simultaneously perform a simple estimation task that entailed monetary rewards for correct answers. We show that a variation in the comparison subject's payment affects blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the ventral striatum. This brain region is engaged in the prediction and registration of primary rewards such as food delivery as well as more abstract forms of rewards like money. In particular, we show that activation in the ventral striatum increases in absolute income and - for a given level of absolute income - decreases in lower relative income. Using a male and a female sample allows us to study whether the perception of relative and absolute incomes is gender specific. We find that the effects of absolute and relative incomes are strong and relatively similar for both genders. Finally, we analyze the importance of joy of winning. i.e., the impact of outperforming another subject.

Perhaps less well known is the fact that the returns to capital and equity are identical in the neoclassical growth model. This paper constructs a measure of the return to business capital for the U.S. The S&P 500 return is roughly six times more volatile than the return to business capital. Owing to the equivalence between the returns to capital and equity in the neoclassical growth model, papers in the real business cycle literature that successfully account for the time series variation in the S&P 500 return must fail to account for the time series properties of the return to capital. A fairly basic real business cycle model captures most of the observed variability in the return to capital. What is needed is a theory of the stock market that breaks the equivalence between the returns to equity and capital. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This research seeks to examine this seemingly counter-intuitive fact in a heterogeneous duopoly consisting of an adaptive price-taker and a dynamic optimizer who dynamically optimizes its either absolute or relative profit stream over an infinite planning horizon. With conventional economic assumptions, the Hamiltonian system always converges to a saddle point. If goal of the dynamic optimizer is absolute profit, the price-taker produces more than the dynamic optimizer at the equilibrium, around which there exists a long-run relative profitability portion for the price-taker. Consequently, the price-taker unconsciously makes higher relative profit than the dynamic optimizer in the long-run. In contrast, if the dynamic optimizer pursues the relative profit, both firms produce at the competitive level at the equilibrium while the whole optimal path lies in the relative profitability regime of the dynamic optimizer so that it will enjoy a higher profit than the price-taker before reaching equilibrium. These results provide economical justification for ever-growing evolutionary game theoretical literatures in appreciating price-taking behavior and additionally clarify possible misunderstandings in interpreting their conclusions.

This paper returns to two old ideas: linkages and complementarity. First, linkages between firms through intermediate goods deliver a multiplier similar to the one associated with capital in a neoclassical growth model. Because the intermediate goods share of output is about one-half, this multiplier is substantial. Second, just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, problems along a production chain can sharply reduce output under complementarity. These forces considerably amplify distortions to the allocation of resources, bringing us closer to understanding large income differences across countries.(JEL: D57, E23, O1O, O47)","[Jones, Charles I.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jones, Charles I.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jones, CI (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 518 Mem Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",chad.jones@stanford.edu,,,,,,,62,162,217,5,48,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

While behavioural finance has drawn on ideas from psychology in order to explain evidence of behaviour that deviates from the rationality axioms, it is argued that the way in which psychology is framed by this approach is unduly limiting. Minsky's structural theory of financial instability, with its Keynesian (and ultimately Humean) roots, incorporates psychology into the theoretical foundations. In particular, cognition and sentiment are shown to be interconnected rather than separable. It is concluded that the policy implications for addressing the current crisis, while apparently similar between these different approaches, are in fact very different. The underlying theory involves different methodology, and indeed different framing, from behavioural finance. The way in which the crisis is understood is therefore important for policy.","Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Dow, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",s.c.dow@stir.ac.dk,,,,,,,78,46,50,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The article constructs a unique data set of open source software projects. The data identify the contributors who work on each project and thus enable us to construct a two-mode network: a project network and a contributor network. The article demonstrates that the structure of these networks is associated with project success and that there is a positive association between project closeness centrality and project success. This suggests the existence of both direct and indirect project knowledge spillovers.

Patent holders, however, may face a dynamic problem, namely the intertemporal consistency problem of the durable-goods monopolist that is induced by durability on the demand side. Licensing practices such as exclusive licensing contracts and most favored customer clauses allow patentees to solve or mitigate this dynamic consistency problem. There are situations, however, where these practices are not possible either due to the nature of the patent (the case of information goods) or due to compulsory patenting laws. We study the effects of the intertemporal consistency problem on patent licensing in these situations. Relative to the existing literature, we obtain the following main results: (i) all of the firms that remain in the industry will be using the innovation; (ii) royalty licensing may be superior to fixed-fee or auction licensing from the licensor's point of view; (iii) social welfare and consumer surplus may be lower than when the patent holder can commit not to make additional sales; (iv) even for non-drastic innovations, the price of the good that is produced may be lower than the competitive price corresponding to the initial situation (before the innovation was discovered).

Opposed to most of this literature we analyze allocation scheme rules, which assign payoffs to all players in all coalitions. We introduce several closely related allocation scheme rules, each resulting in a population monotonic allocation scheme (PMAS) whenever the underlying coalitional game with transferable utilities has a PMAS. Monotonicities, which measure the payoff difference for a player between two nested coalitions, are the driving force. These monotonicities can best be compared with the excesses in the definition of the (pre-)nucleolus. Variants are obtained by considering different domains and/or different collections of monotonicities. We deal with nonemptiness, uniqueness, and continuity, followed by an analysis of conditions for (some of) the rules to coincide. We then focus on characterizing the rules in terms of subbalanced weights. Finally, we deal with computational issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reviews alternative customer baseline designs, focusing on administrative and contractual approaches. Administrative customer baselines have been developed over many years to provide estimates of the counterfactual consumption levels that would have prevailed without demand-response programs. However, experience suggests that this approach is vulnerable to opportunities for gaming and could result in illusory demand reductions. With full locational marginal price (LMP) payment, this approach imputes double-payment incentives that could induce excessive demand reduction undermining the efficiency of DR programs. Alternatively, a contractual customer baseline approach provides transparent rights and obligations for a robust framework that restores efficient DR under full LMP payment. As a retail rate design that provides two-sided contractual customer baselines, demand subscription service and DR programs form a much needed connection between the wholesale and retail markets in ways that promote price-responsive demand in a smart grid future.","ISO New England Inc, Holyoke, MA 01040 USA",,"Chao, HP (通讯作者)，ISO New England Inc, 1 Sullivan Rd, Holyoke, MA 01040 USA.",hchao@iso-ne.com,,,,,,,32,88,103,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Its objective is to explore how the presence of more or less myopic individuals affects pension design when individuals differ also in productivity. This double heterogeneity gives rise to an interesting interplay between paternalistic and redistributive considerations, which is at the heart of most of the results that are presented. The main part of the paper is devoted to the issue of pension design when myopic individual do not save enough for their retirement because their myopic self' (with a high discount rate) emerges when labor supply and savings decisions are made. Some extensions and variations are considered in the second part. In particular we deal with situations where labor disutility or preferences for consumption are subject to habit formation and where sin goods have a detrimental effect on second period health. Myopic individuals tend to underestimate the effects of both habit formation and sinful consumption, which complicates public policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Payday loans are small, high interest rate loans that constitute the marginal source of credit for many high risk borrowers. I find no evidence that payday loans alleviate economic hardship. To the contrary, loan access leads to increased difficulty paying mortgage, rent and utilities bills. The empirical design isolates variation in loan access that is uninfluenced by lenders' location decisions and state regulatory decisions, two factors that might otherwise correlate with economic hardship measures. Further analysis of differences in loan availability-over time and across income groups-rules out a number of alternative explanations for the estimated effects. Counter to the view that improving credit access facilitates important expenditures, the results suggest that for some low-income households the debt service burden imposed by borrowing inhibits their ability to pay important bills.

J,"Shan, H",,,,"Shan, Hui",,,The effect of capital gains taxation on home sales: Evidence from the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Housing; Taxation; Capital gains,MOBILITY; POLICY,"The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97) significantly changed the tax treatment of housing capital gains in the United States. Before 1997, homeowners were subject to capital gains taxation when they sold their houses unless they purchased replacement homes of equal or greater value. Since 1997, homeowners can exclude capital gains of $500,000 (or $250,000 for single filers) when they sell their houses. Such dramatic changes provide a good opportunity to study the lock-in effect of capital gains taxation on home sales. Using 1982-2008 transaction data on single-family houses in 16 affluent towns within the Boston metropolitan area, I find that TRA97 reversed the lock-in effect of capital gains taxes on houses with low and moderate capital gains. Specifically, the semiannual sales rate of houses with positive gains up to $500,000 increased by 0.40-0.62 percentage points after TRA97, representing a 19-24% increase from the pre-TRA97 baseline sales rate. In contrast, I do not find TRA97 to have a significant effect on houses with gains above $500,000. Moreover, the short-term effect of TRA97 is much larger than the long-term effect, suggesting that many previously locked-in homeowners took advantage of the exclusions immediately after TRA97. In addition, I exploit the 2001 and 2003 legislative changes in the capital gains tax rate to estimate the tax elasticity of home sales during the post-TRA97 period. The estimation results suggest that a $10,000 increase in capital gains taxes reduces the semiannual home sales rate by about 0.1-0.2 percentage points, or 6-13% from the post-TRA97 average sales rate.

In general, stock dividends send a positive market signal that is stronger for larger stock dividends and simultaneous cash dividend declarations. Companies take advantage of this positive announcement reaction when they are cash poor, or have low profitability. In addition, when the overall market underperforms, cash dividends decrease while stock dividends increase significantly. Non-tradable shares are owned by two distinct groups that have different incentives and trading ability and therefore are likely to prefer different dividend policies. Consistent with this, we find evidence that state-owned shareholders prefer cash dividends, while legal person shareholders prefer stock dividends.","[Anderson, H.

We also derive the optimal information dissemination policy and find that (i) for a given level of ambiguity, it may be better not to release information, and (ii) if ambiguity can be chosen freely, it is optimal to release the most precise information, but with an appropriate degree of ambiguity.","[Arato, Hiroki] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakamura, Tomoya] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nakamura, Tomoya] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Tokyo Metropolitan University; Kyoto University; Osaka University,"Arato, H (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",arato@tmu.ac.jp; tomoya_a_25e@yahoo.co.jp,"ARATO, Hiroki/ABC-3903-2020","ARATO, Hiroki/0000-0003-1982-1004",,,,,8,7,7,0,8,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

One reason for choosing to examine the Japanese case is that long time series of relatively detailed data are available. A Hodrick-Prescott filter is applied to identify cycles in annual data from 1955 to 1995 and bilateral cross-correlations of prefectural GDPs are calculated for all pairs of prefectures, in our results we find fairly high cross-correlations. The paper then turns to an econometric explanation of the cross-correlation coefficients in the augmented gravity model framework. Two prefectures with similar GDPs and a shorter distance between them lead to business cycle synchronization whilst those with larger regional gaps in factor endowments (capital, labour, and human capital) result in more idiosyncratic business cycle.","[Artis, Michael] Univ Swansea, Dept Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Okubo, Toshihiro] Kobe Univ, RIEB, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Okubo, Toshihiro] Univ Oxford, OxCarre, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",Swansea University; Kobe University; University of Oxford,"Artis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Swansea, Dept Econ, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",Michael.Artis@manchester.ac.uk; okubo@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,44,15,15,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The quasi experimental nature of the evaluation data collected for the purposes of evaluating the impact of PROGRESA enables comparison of welfare indicators among noneligible households in treatment areas and control areas. The analysis finds that noneligible households in treatment areas show significantly higher levels of food consumption and asset holdings following the introduction of PROGRESA, compared to noneligible households in control areas. These results are interpreted to suggest that transfers in poor rural areas in Mexico enable agents to interact more strategically such that nonbeneficiaries, as well as beneficiaries, reap consumption and production advantages.","[Sabates-Wheeler, Rachel] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Barrientos, Armando] Univ Manchester, Brooks World Poverty Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Sussex; University of Manchester,"Sabatés-Wheeler, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",r.sabates-wheeler@ids.ac.uk,,"Barrientos, Armando/0000-0003-0672-7094",,,,,22,7,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main factors of the demand are found to be various price indicators with respect to individual market, two income series and the variable of economic environment. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that the price elasticity of demand on both markets is below zero. The autonomy in price increases is limited due to positive cross-price elasticity of demand for direct mail with regard to price fluctuations for TV commercials. Substitution effects on the direct mail market are even more evident with regard to price fluctuations for advertisements in magazines and daily papers. An additional finding is that the demand on both markets varies seasonally in all models estimated by us. Finally, coefficients of income elasticity of demand for direct mail services show that the total number of mail deliveries on the direct mail market increases faster than the retail revenue in real terms.","[Jagric, Timotej] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor 2001, Slovenia; [Beko, Jani] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Polit Econ, Maribor 2001, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Jagric, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Razlagova 14, Maribor 2001, Slovenia.",timotej.jagric@uni-mb.si,,"Beko, Jani/0000-0002-7778-5745",,,,,30,0,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our analysis is based on nonlinear robust regression methods which have never been applied before to this kind of data. The growth rates distributions we observe are well described by a Subbotin distribution with a shape parameter significantly lower than 1, suggesting a noticeable departure from the Laplace behaviour reported in previous works on Italian and the US data. At the same time, the variance of growth rates depends negatively on size and the relationship does not seem to be linear, with larger firms possibly displaying lower variability in their growth dynamics. At the disaggregate level, we observe significant heterogeneity in the firm size distributions across sectors, while the shape of the sectoral growth rates density displays a surprising degree of homogeneity.","[Bottazzi, Giulio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy; [Coad, Alex] Max Planck Inst Econ, Jena, Germany; [Coad, Alex; Jacoby, Nadia] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Secchi, Angelo] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Max Planck Society; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; University of Pisa,"Bottazzi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy.",bottazzi@sssup.it,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528; Bottazzi, Giulio/0000-0003-2565-4732",,,,,35,83,85,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although self-efficacy has been linked to health, task accomplishment, greater socio-economic status and income (Seeman and Seeman, 1983; Stretcher et al., 1986; Gecas and Seff, 1990; Judge et al., 2002; Zagorsky, 2007), there has been no study that investigates whether self-efficacy is also a predictor of greater wealth creation over a specific period of time. Applying a theoretical framework based on self-efficacy, this article investigates household financial behaviours using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) data-set. For the purpose of this study, change in wealth across time and financial market participation is modelled as a function of socio-economic and demographic variables drawn from prior literature.

Economic systems that have failed to provide for people's most basic survival needs, or that are simply unable to fulfil expectations of decent living standards, drive people to look outside their country of birth for a better life. The consequences of labour migration usually are assessed analysing migration theories. At present, there is no single, coherent theory of international migration, only a fragmented set of various theories. Scientists of various fields focus on slightly different but interrelated reasons for the decision to migrate. Economists emphasize that reasons leading to migration are motivated and sustained by three major types of influences: demand-pull factors in the destination area; supply-push factors in the origin area; network factors that link origin and destination areas. Sociologists describe a chain migration process: migration begets additional migration. The first person emigrating from the area sends information to those in the home country about jobs, housing, and schools in the new setting. Anthropologists emphasize changes in the standard of living and cultural reasons. First-hand accounts from new immigrants as well as media accounts of the country's standard of living entice people to immigrate to the new country for a better way of life. Psychologists describe importance of personality factors on migration decisions. Those who want to resettle in another country tend to be more work-oriented and to have higher achievement and power motivation, but lower affiliation motivation and family centrality, than those who do not want to leave their country of origin. Political scientists emphasize ethno political reasons. Countries may encourage emigration to ease ethnic conflict, or to establish presence in another country, by resettling particular ethnic groups voluntarily or involuntarily. Summarizing different migration theories and focus of various scientists, the authors of the paper present the model of decision making about migration. Based on this theoretical background empirical research was performed. Structured questionnaire survey was made in spring of 2010. 220 Lithuanian students participated in the poll. The analysis of empirical research showed that the main push and pull factors among surveyed Lithuanian students' economic reasons were identified. 85 percent of respondents selected economic factor as the main reason for migration. Other factors affecting migration decision making were the following ones: political (32 percent), social-demographic (24 percent), cultural (23 percent) and demographical (15 percent).","[Ciarniene, Ramune; Kumpikaite, Vilmante] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciarniene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ramune.ciarniene@ktu.lt; vilmante.kumpikaite@ktu.lt,"Kumpikaitė-Valiūnienė, Vilmantė/D-3736-2016","Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, Vilmante/0000-0002-8099-2737",,,,,34,16,17,4,44,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The calibrated model matches the highly skewed wealth and income distributions of entrepreneurs. We provide an accurate solution to the model despite significant nonlinearities that are absent in the economy with uninsurable labor income risk. The model is capable of generating the average private equity premium of roughly 3% and a low risk-free rate. The model also produces procyclicality of the risk-free rate and countercyclicality of the private equity premium. The countercyclicality of the equity premium is largely driven by tightening (loosening) of financing constraints during recessions (booms).,"[Covas, Francisco] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Fujita, Shigeru] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Covas, F (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA.",francisco.b.covas@frb.gov; shigeru.fujita@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,31,3,3,1,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

While many related studies have highlighted the problems associated with shock asymmetries, very few analyses have attempted to weigh these against potential benefits. In our model, the benefits of monetary union come from a more credible monetary policy and a correspondingly lower inflationary bias, while the costs derive from both output shock asymmetries (which are identified with different terms of trade movements) and fiscal disparities. Using African data, we estimate key equilibrium relationships of the model. These capture quite well the cross-country variation in inflation and fiscal revenues, allowing us to calibrate the full model. The model simulations indicate that the proposed East African Community, Economic Community of West African States and Southern Africa Development Community monetary unions bring about net benefits to some potential members, but that many other prospective members record relatively modest net gains and sometimes net losses. The paper also discusses how strengthening domestic monetary and fiscal institutions is an alternative that can provide some of the same benefits of monetary unions and therefore reduce their relative attractiveness.","[Debrun, Xavier; Pattillo, Catherine] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Masson, Paul R.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",International Monetary Fund; University of Toronto,"Pattillo, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",cpattillo@imf.org,,"Debrun, Xavier/0000-0002-6355-6626",,,,,52,3,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using the linear regression approach, it provides evidence that Slovak left-wing voters are resistant to economic voting, which is demonstrated by the fact that changes in the preferences of the Slovak left-wing government during 2006 2008 did not react to changes in the CPI and the unemployment rate. By contrast, the Slovak right-wing is held accountable by its voters both for rising prices and unemployment. Thus, our research unveils a new, unexpected difference between left- and right-wing voters. Furthermore, it is argued that, under constantly decreasing monetary and fiscal sovereignty in EU member states, political parties that have voters highly responsive to economic conditions are in a disadvantage as their preferences are dependent on factors they can influence less than in the past.","[Domonkos, Stefan] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Domonkos, Tomas] Inst Econ Res SAS, Bratislava 81105 1, Slovakia",University of Mannheim; Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Domonkos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, A 5 6, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",Stefan.Domonkos@mzes.uni-mannheim.de; tomas.domonkos@savba.sk,"Domonkos, Tomáš/AAC-8930-2019",,,,,,30,1,1,0,12,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Recent research has found, however, that the commercialisation levels of cooperative members do not differ significantly from those of non-member farmers in Ethiopia. We argue though that the impact of cooperative membership on commercialisation may vary significantly depending on the type of cooperative organisations considered. Applying propensity score matching as well as regression analysis to a set of farm household living in rural areas where the commodity exchange system was to become operational, we consistently find significantly higher commercialisation rates, when compared with non-member famers, for farmers belonging to marketing cooperatives. Livelihood cooperatives, on the other hand, appear to have insignificant or negative impact on Ethiopian farmers' commercialisation. We conclude that the selective inclusion of marketing cooperatives in the commodity exchange system has the potential to simultaneously reduce the rural poverty and maximise agro-commodity commercialisation in Ethiopia.","[Francesconi, Gian Nicola] UNOPS, IFPRI, DSGD, Dakar, Senegal; [Heerink, Nico] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Wageningen University & Research,"Francesconi, GN (通讯作者)，UNOPS, IFPRI, DSGD, Immeuble Ousseynou Thiam Gueye,Rue Thies,Point E,, Dakar, Senegal.",g.n.francesconi@cgiar.org,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501",,,,,31,102,116,2,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Most studies documenting asymmetric price transmission focus on nonlinear error correction processes, as opposed to the current study which analyses potential nonlinearities in the long-run relationship between the farm and retail prices. The null hypothesis of nonlinearity in the long-run relationship between farm and retail prices in the US hog/pork supply chain is rejected in favour of a Smooth Transition Cointegration (STC) framework. The STC framework predicts downward price stickiness in retail prices. The predicted residuals of the nonlinear model are used to investigate whether it is possible to disentangle nonlinearity in the long-run price relationship from nonlinearity in the adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium. The results underline the importance of testing for linearity in the long-run price relationship before modelling nonlinearity in short-run dynamics.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Gervais, JP (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Campus Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",JP_Gervais@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,45,24,24,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We apply social network analysis based on patent data to analyse structural differences between the innovation systems of four East German regions and study the characteristics of gatekeepers therein. The regional networks appear to be significantly different with respect to the degree of interaction and with respect to their outward orientation. Concerning the characteristics of gatekeepers, we find that absorptive capacity is more important than size.

Finally, we show how a general condition for this to occur is that a matrix derived from the Jacobian matrix of best-response functions has positive leading principal minors, and how this condition generalises some existing uniqueness theorems for particular games.

In consequence of congestions there arises increasing pollution, impairment of people health and economic loss. Investigation of traffic flows is complex multidimensional task, solution complication of which depends on complexity extent of transport network. In order to analyze the particularity of forming congestions, investigation describing in details the interaction of vehicles and road facilities are necessary. The main research purpose is to determine vehicle's waste of time with flow close to system overcrowding or moving in congestion. In order to evaluate congestions expenses and rare occasional loss many parameters and assumptions are necessary, because these parameters are expressed by physical expressions. The most important of them are: value of travel time is used to convert time loss and/or reduced reliability and comfort into monetary units; variation of demand, defining reaction of possible consumers to internalization of exterior expenses of congestions. Expenses evaluation methods used are based on the evaluation of travel time. To this end lots of investigations have been performed in various European countries. Actually experts are inclined to use general VOT values for public and goods traffic. Traffic flow intensity is determined by specified averages traffic flow speeds in separate sectors, travel time and, the main thing, defining sector throughput. Flow particularity has been determined, as well, i.e. impact of a number of lanes and evaluated wasted time with different intensity of vehicles flow. Having data on traffic flows, it is possible to determine frequency of arriving and outgoing vehicles and time intervals between them and evaluate situation in a crossing. Schemes of vehicles movement were formed, projecting the arrival of vehicles one by one or by blocks, and data on flows directions and intensity collected. According to queue extent it is possible to judge about quality of traffic control system and loading of crossing with transport and forecast possible congestions. After the analysis of some transport flows in the city traffic, investigation of traffic congestions reasons, these conclusions could be made: there is no methodical facilities development programme of the city streets; roads with intense traffic crossings of the city are old-fashioned, and their throughput is three or four times smaller than streets throughput and traffic flows intensity; there is no high speed public traffic service created and this becomes a pretext to use an individual transport, increasing traffic intensity and traffic congestions; there is no reverse lanes in the streets with intense traffic, what could increase road throughput and no public transport traffic lights before crossings, which at least would reduce, congestions of this traffic. Sustainable urban traffic system development reducing congestions costs shall be based on long term sustainable people and goods mobility vision.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44312 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kersys, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kestucio Str 27, LT-44312 Kaunas, Lithuania.",arturas.kersys@ktu.lt,"Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023","Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829",,,,,38,12,13,0,41,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This paper examines how pharmaceutical firms have responded to changes in intellectual property rights and trade barriers that legalized parallel imports within the European Union (EU). The threat of arbitrage by parallel traders reduces the ability of firms to price discriminate across countries. Due to regulations on price and antitrust law on rationing supply, pharmaceutical firms may rely on non-price responses. Such responses include differentiation of products across countries and selective culling of product lines to reduce arbitrage opportunities, as well as raising arbitrageurs' costs through choice of packaging. Using a dataset of drug prices and sales from 1993-2004 covering 30 countries, I find evidence with attempts to reduce parallel trade. This may at least partially explain why parallel trade has not yet resulted in significant price convergence across EU countries. Accounting for non-price strategic responses may therefore be important in assessing the welfare effects of competition from parallel imports.","Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Kyle, M (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",margaret.kyle@tse-fr.eu,,"Kyle, Margaret/0000-0001-9862-6498",,,,,34,22,26,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, even though previous studies emphasize the role of individual and families in enhancing networks effects, none of these studies, surprisingly, have considered the heterogeneity of immigrants. Since each individual has different social and educational backgrounds, the impact of immigrants on exports may differ among individuals depending on their personal attributes. The main contribution of this paper is to go one step further in discussing the role of immigrants in enhancing host country exports. This research attempts to answer the question of whether all immigrants encourage host country exports or not. Using US state-level data, we find that the human capital level of immigrants plays an important role in enhancing US exports. Furthermore, using the data-sorting method developed by Hansen, we find that immigrants from countries with a high level of human capital increase US exports while immigrants from countries with a low level of human capital do not.","[Lim, Gieyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea; [Kim, Chong-Uk] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; California State University System; Sonoma State University,"Lim, G (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imundong, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",gylim@hufs.ac.kr,,,,,,,11,4,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

It is important to construct reasonable agriculture informatization evaluation indicator system and propose the evaluation method for promoting the agriculture informatization. This paper firstly analyzes the research status of the indicator system and evaluation method of informatization at home and abroad. On the basis of the relative literatures, the evaluation indicator system of the agriculture informatization in China is constructed, and the evaluation model of the agriculture informatization based on two-tuple and the relative operators are also constructed. This model not only can be used to rank the orders of the different areas according to the informatization level, but also can realize the qualitative evaluation of the agriculture informatization of the different areas according to the evaluation system. Finally, the application example shows that the evaluation system of the agriculture informatization constructed in this paper is effective, and the evaluation method proposed in this paper is simple and easy to use.","[Liu, Peide; Zhang, Xin] Shandong Econ Univ, Informat Management Sch, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, PD (通讯作者)，Shandong Econ Univ, Informat Management Sch, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China.",Peide.liu@gmail.com,"Liu, Peide/D-3392-2013; Liu, Pei/JFS-0950-2023",,,,,,25,17,19,3,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Banks must evaluate credit risk of credit applicants by using standardized (external rating institutions) or internal ratings-based (IRB) methods. Banks which decided to use IRB method attempt to develop precise internal credit rating models for the evaluation of creditworthiness of their borrowers. The internal rating method for the estimation of default probability requires to collect the default information from the historical data in banks. The major studies about default determinating factors are based on classification methods (Zhou, Xie, Yuan, 2008). A classification model considers the default measurement as the pattern recognition where all borrowers are divided to non-default and default groups based on their financial and non financial data. Banks attempt to construct an evaluation model that can be used to discriminate new sample. This research focuses on a credit rating model development which could attribute credit ratings for Lithuanian companies. The steps of a model's development and improvement process are described in this paper. The model's development begins with the selection of initial variables (financial ratios) characterizing default and non-default companies. 20 financial ratios of 5 years were calculated according to annual financial reports. Then statistical and artificial intelligence methods were selected for the classification of companies into two groups: default and non-default. A discriminant analysis, logistic regression and artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron) were applied for this purpose. Often statistical methods are not able to operate with a large amount of data, so the analysis of variance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and factor analysis were applied for data reduction. Artificial neural networks often are able to analyze a large amount of data so variable selection was accomplished by the network itself calculating ranks of importance for every initial variable. There were constructed 15 classification models and their classification accuracy was measured by calculating correct classification rates. The most accurate was a logistic regression model analyzing data of 3 years (97% of correctly classified companies). Then the sample of companies was supplemented with new data and changes in classification accuracy were estimated. The significant decrease of classification accuracy conditioned the need of model update. For this reason the logistic regression coefficients were recalculated. In order to classify non-default companies into 7 classes: profitability, liquidity, financial structure and individual possibility of default estimated by a logistic regression model were determined as rating criterions. Then the rating scale was constructed and credit ratings were attributed for companies in the sample. The calculated probabilities of default indicated that some lower ratings have lower probabilities of default. These imperfections were corrected by the modification of a rating scale. The research has shown that the developed model is a valid tool for the estimation of credit risk.","[Mileris, Ricardas; Boguslauskas, Vytautas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Mileris, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ricardas.mileris@ktu.lt; vytautas.boguslauskas@ktu.lt,,,,,,,40,14,14,2,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the analyses, Kalman filter is applied to a small-scale macroeconomic model of the Turkish economy to estimate the unobserved variables for the period 1989 to 2005. In addition, two alternative specifications for neutral real interest rate are exploited in the analyses. The first model uses a simple random walk model for the neutral rate, whereas the second one employs more structural specification, which specifically links the neutral rate with the trend growth rate and the long-term course of the risk premium by adapting the model proposed by Laubach and Williams (2003) to allow for small open economy consideration. Model evaluations clearly indicate the use of more structural specification against random walk specification. Results point out that the variation in the long-term course of the risk premium could be an important determinant of the neutral real interest rate in Turkey. Though there is relatively high uncertainty surrounding the neutral rate estimates to use them directly in the policy-making process, estimates appear to be very useful for ex post monetary policy evaluations.","[Ogunc, Fethi] Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Batmaz, Inci] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Stat, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Prime Ministry Turkey; Middle East Technical University,"Ögünç, F (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",Fethi.Ogunc@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

J,"Podrecca, E",,,,"Podrecca, Elena",,,Labour market institutions and wage setting: evidence for OECD countries,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EUROPEAN UNEMPLOYMENT; EMPLOYMENT; RIGIDITIES; RISE,"The main channel through which labour market institutions are supposed to work in affecting unemployment is through their effects on the key parameters of the wage curve. In particular, labour market institutions may have both a direct wage push (or level) effect, i.e. change the level of the real wage for any given level of the unemployment rate and productivity, and an indirect slope effect, i.e. change the responsiveness of the real wage to the unemployment rate. The question this article addresses is whether there is any evidence that these transmission mechanisms were at work in a group of 20 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the period 1960 to 1999. The analysis is accomplished in two steps. Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimates of a wage equation including unemployment, productivity and a set of wage push institutions are first obtained, allowing only a subset of institutional coefficient to be homogeneous, while leaving the unemployment and other coefficients free to differ across countries. The country specific estimates of the unemployment coefficients are then used to investigate whether and to what extent cross-country heterogeneity in the estimated wage response to unemployment is related to institutional differences. The results support the existence of significant wage push effects of union density and benefit replacement rates, and of significant slope effects of benefit replacement rates, benefit duration and employment protection. A more generous unemployment benefit structure is found to lower the wage responsiveness to unemployment, while higher employment protection, contrary to what one expects, is found to enhance it. No significant level and slope effects are found for the tax wedge and bargaining coordination.","Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Podrecca, E (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali Matemat & Stat, Piazzale Europa, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",elena.podrecca@econ.units.it,,,,,,,47,4,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study aims to determine if the level of NPLs has declined and the asset quality has improved since the 1997-1998 crisis. In addition, it also aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Danaharta, Malaysia's national asset management company, in addressing the NPL problem in banking institutions of Malaysia. The trend of gross NPL ratios and percentage of total Man provisions, the ageing of NPLs and the percentage of NPLs restructured and disposed were some of the indicators used on the secondary data collected from Bank Negara Malaysia and Danaharta. Results show that the level of NPLs has declined since the 1997-1998 crisis. In addition, a less volatile rate of change in the NPL ratios after year 1998, and the decline in NPL ratios along with a decline in total NPL provisions after year 1999 suggests that better prudential practices on NPLs are followed and asset quality in banking institutions has been improving after the 1997-1998 crisis. Danaharta has been effective in reducing the level of NPLs in banking institutions but less effective in disposing the NPLs acquired.","[Ponnu, C.

This is because countries in a monetary union accept a one-size-fits all, resigning regions to policies that are based on some aggregate macroeconomic target rather than a country-specific one. For this reason, the cost of monetary union membership depends on the incidence of asymmetric (nation-specific) shocks rather than symmetric, or common shocks. This criteria is examined for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, who reaffirmed plans for the implementation of a single currency. This paper quantifies, using structural factor models with common factor restrictions, changes in output synchronisation, the importance of common factor or idiosyncratic shocks between the regions, and the synchronisation of these shocks across the GCC as well as the implications for GCC-wide macroeconomic policy at short-to-medium term horizons. Despite current difficulties in fulfilling the convergence criteria goals to monetary union, the results show the synchronisation of output growth fluctuations between economies of the GCC to have increased over the past 25 years. This paper also finds that a fairly sizeable proportion of output fluctuations in business cycle frequencies are driven by a common component that, to some degree, reflects U.S. monetary policy and U.S. demand shocks as well as changes in crude oil prices.

The textile industries in Japan and many other countries have also faced difficulties. This study examines future prospects for the Korean industry by investigating the presence of economies of scale and relationships among the inputs of domestic capital, labour and intermediate goods, as well as foreign intermediate goods. The findings are consistent with constant returns to scale and a substitutes relationship among all input pairs except for domestic capital and foreign intermediate goods. Thus, there appear to be no further cost reductions available through increased output and economies of scale. However, some reduction in industry output may not result in increased unit costs either. A reduction in the price of foreign intermediate goods will not only increase the demand for domestic capital, but also, at least in the short run, add stress to the industry as it decreases the demand for domestic labour and domestic intermediate goods.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,36,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is questionable whether, in this case we can speak of a real reduction in living standards, or whether it is merely a return to normal in macroeconomic theory which corresponds to the level of potential output and natural rate of unemployment. The paper The Czech Economy Development in The Shadow of The Real Economy Crisis attempts to answer this question. This study is based on macroeconomic quarterly data published by the Czech Statistical Office and Eurostat, to analyze the current economic situation in the Czech Republic, which, in connection with the conference focus and scope of the contribution will be a focus on economic growth and labor market issues. The key indicators that will be used for this analysis, we can indicate the particular real gross domestic product, gross value added, data on foreign trade, and development of the Czech labor market.","[Tuleja, Pavel] Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Ekonomie, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",,,tuleja@opf.slu.cz,"Tuleja, Pavel/J-4599-2018","Tuleja, Pavel/0000-0002-5841-8587",,,,,3,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

These countries, in turn, are reinforcing their immigration policies by making it easier to deport people back to their country of origin. This has happened in France since the summer of 2010, when the Roma became a target for the French authorities. Within a few weeks, these immigrants unwillingly switched from being invisible to visible owing to the increased media coverage of deportation procedures. Stigmatized by a baseless confusion of immigration with crime, the Roma do not however differ from other migrant groups.

This paper examines the determinants of Australia's inward FDI flows-focussing specifically on the effects of trade and investment agreements.

We can (cannot) reject the hypothesis of no adaptation to income (status) during the four years following an income (status) change. In the short-run (current year) a one standard deviation increase in status and 52 percent of one standard deviation in income are associated with similar increases in happiness. However 65 percent of the current year's impact of income on happiness is lost over the following four years whereas the impact of status remains intact, if anything growing over time. We also present different estimates of adaptation across sub-groups. For example, we find that those on the right (left) of the political spectrum adapt to status (income) but not to income (status).

The agents are assumed to be ex ante identical, but to differ ex post in the state of their health. Inequality aversion is introduced by postulating a strictly concave ex post social welfare function. It is shown that the optimal public health care system allocates health care differently than would private health insurance; specifically, people who are relatively unhealthy with and without treatment receive more health care, and people who are relatively healthy with and without treatment receive less health care. The aggregate quantity of health care under the optimal public health care system can be either greater or smaller than under private health care insurance. If the public health care system is optimally designed, allowing agents to purchase supplementary private health care insurance cannot raise social welfare and is likely to decrease it.","McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University,"Leach, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",leach@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Economic challenges arise when the increase in people surviving to old age and the decline in the number of young people alive to support them cause the growth in society's consumption needs to outpace growth in its productive capacity. The ultimate impact of population aging on our standard of living in the future depends a great deal on how long people choose to work before they retire from the labor force. Here, there is reason for optimism. A constellation of forces, some just now gaining momentum, has raised labor force participation at older ages at just the time it is needed. We examine the most important factors behind the increase in labor force participation realized to date: the shift in the skill composition of the workforce, and technological change. We argue that forces such as changes in the structure of employer-provided pensions and Social Security are likely to propel future increases in labor force participation at older ages. The labor market is accommodating older workers to some degree, and older men and women are themselves adapting on a number of fronts, which could substantially lessen the economic impact of population aging. Age-related health declines and the reluctance of employers to hire and retain older workers present challenges, but the outlook for future gains in labor force participation at older ages is promising.","[Maestas, Nicole; Zissimopoulos, Julie] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA",RAND Corporation,"Maestas, N (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA.",Nicole_Maestas@rand.org; Julie_Zissimopoulos@rand.org,,,"NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG025552, P01 AG022481] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,51,69,82,1,42,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This paper takes advantage of this unique natural experiment to study the effects of labor supply shocks on labor market outcomes. Using quarterly information on wages and employment in each city in the West Bank, the paper analyzes the short-run adjustment of labor markets to a large inflow of workers separately from the effects of political instability. The results suggest that low-skilled wages are adversely affected by an increase in the supply of low-and high-skilled workers, while high-skilled wages are only weakly negatively related to an increase in their own supply. This is consistent with a scenario in which high-skilled workers compete for low-skilled jobs, pushing the low-skilled into unemployment. This latter hypothesis is confirmed by analyzing the effects of changes in labor supply on unemployment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the reference case, regulators act as 'public servants' who strive to make the socially optimal decision, given limited information and the opportunity to observe the prior decision of another regulator. The addition of career concerns, such as a desire to avoid controversy or to implement a future employer's preferred policy, tends to reduce the degree of differentiation in sequentially taken decisions, hence increasing consistency. Therefore, it is possible to observe that the self-interested career concerns of regulators give rise to consistency in regulatory decision making. This type of consistency might lead to substantial deviations from optimal regulatory policies.","[Menezes, Flavio M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Roessler, Christian] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Queensland; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Menezes, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.menezes@uq.edu.au,"Menezes, Flavio/L-4434-2019","Menezes, Flavio/0000-0003-0889-9551",,,,,14,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Consumers are heterogeneous and can observe neighbour behaviour through social networks. Although firms do not observe them, the social networks have a significant impact on the emerging market structure. Presence of networks tends to polarize market share and leads to higher volatility in brands. Yet convergence in brand characteristics usually happens whenever the market reaches a steady state.

But Grandmont provided his result with a model in which all policies are Ricardian equivalent, no frictions exist, employment is always full, competition is perfect, and all solutions are Pareto optimal. Hence he was not able to reach conclusions about the policy relevance of his dramatic discovery. As a result, Barnett and He (1999, 2001, 2002) investigated a Keynesian structural model, and found results supporting Grandmont's conclusions within the parameter space of the Bergstrom-Wymer continuous-time dynamic macroeconometric model of the UK economy. That prototypical Keynesian model was produced from a system of second order differential equations. The model contains frictions through adjustment lags, displays reasonable dynamics fitting the UK economy's data, and is clearly policy relevant In addition, results by Barnett and Duzhak (2010) demonstrate the existence of Hopf and flip (period doubling) bifurcation within the parameter space of recent New Keynesian models. Lucas-critique criticism of Keynesian structural models has motivated development of Euler equations models having policy-invariant deep parameters, which are invariant to policy rule changes. Hence, we continue the investigation of policy-relevant bifurcation by searching the parameter space of the best known of the Euler equations general-equilibrium macroeconometric models: the path-breaking Leeper and Sims (1994) model. We find the existence of singularity bifurcation boundaries within the parameter space. Although never before found in an economic model, singularity bifurcation may be a common property of Euler equations models, which often do not have closed form solutions. Our results further confirm Grandmont's views. Beginning with Grandmont's findings with a classical model, we continue to follow the path from the Bergstrom-Wymer policy-relevant Keynesian model, to New Keynesian models, and now to Euler equations macroeconomic models having deep parameters.

In particular, although for firms in general the pay-performance link is much weaker when performance is poor, a higher proportion of non-executives strengthens this link considerably.

It is shown how intervention by a supranational body can raise welfare by internalizing the infrastructural externality.

It is shown that for an income allocation method that maximizes a social welfare function there is a monotonic relationship between the incomes allocated to individual agents in a given coalition (with at least three members) and its participation constraint if and only if the aggregate income to that coalition is always maximized. An impossibility result demonstrates that there is no welfare maximizing allocation method in which agents individual incomes monotonically increase in society's income.

It shows that a regressive taxation system and skewed allocation of subsidies increases the urban rural income gap and enhances overall inequality. Modeling these relationships indicates that the relatively poorer rural population has a net tax liability, whereas those in the richer urban areas receive net subsidies. This pattern is common in China, although the extent of the bias varies. This skewed system of tax and welfare payments is a major cause of the persisting urban-rural income gap and contributes to the overall income inequality in China. The abolishment of agriculture tax in 2006 has had a positive impact on rural people's livelihoods.","[Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Wang, Xiaobing] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Wang, Xiaobing] Univ Manchester, Ctr Chinese Studies, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Bournemouth University; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Business, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",xiaobing.wang@manchester.ac.uk; jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Wang, Xiaobing/HLX-3256-2023","Wang, Xiaobing/0000-0003-1927-2383",,,,,24,26,28,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2010,18.0,6,,,,,36,55,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01219.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,681MK,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284319600003,0

Analyzing citation data for the relevant academic field for the Journal of Evolutionary Economics, we use insights from scientometrics and social network analysis to find that, indeed, the JEE is a central player in this interdisciplinary field aiming mostly at understanding technological and regional dynamics. It does not, however, link firmly with the natural sciences (including biology) nor to management sciences, entrepreneurship, and organization studies. Another journal that could be perceived to have evolutionary acumen, the Journal of Economic Issues, does relate to heterodox economics journals and is relatively more involved in discussing issues of firm and industry organization.

The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difficult task as their allocation is typically endogenous. To overcome this identification problem, we exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former owners' land to entitle the occupants. Some original owners accepted the government compensation, while others disputed the compensation payment in the slow Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of property rights across squatters. Using data from two surveys performed in 2003 and 2007, we find that entitled families substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and enhanced the education of their children relative to the control group. These effects, however, did not take place through improvements in access to credit. Our results suggest that land titling can be an important tool for poverty reduction, albeit not through the shortcut of credit access, but through the slow channel of increased physical and human capital investment, which should help to reduce poverty in future generations.

One important point is that not all of these equilibria are at maximal differentiation. In this paper, we include an additional stage with decentralized wage bargaining. This intensifies price competition resulting in locations that are nearer to the extremes of the city. The magnitude of this effect depends on the bargaining power of the unions. Contrary to the model with exogenously given costs, if unions are sufficient strong all price equilibria in pure strategies are at maximal differentiation. With a low parameter for the curvature of the transportation cost function unions can improve the location decision from a social viewpoint.","Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Grandner, T (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Nordbergstr 15, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",thomas.grandner@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Following the literature on the endogenous timing in duopoly games, we consider a pre-play stage, where jurisdictions commit themselves to move early or late, i.e. to fix their tax rate at a first or second stage. We highlight that at least one jurisdiction experiments a second-mover advantage. We show that the Subgame Perfect Equilibria (SPEs) correspond to the two Stackelberg situations yielding to a coordination problem. In order to solve this issue, we consider a quadratic specification of the production function, and we use two criteria of selection: Pareto-dominance and risk-dominance. We emphasize that at the risk-dominant equilibrium the less productive or smaller jurisdiction leads and hence loses the second-mover advantage. If asymmetry among jurisdictions is sufficient, Pareto-dominance reinforces risk-dominance in selecting the same SPE. Three results may be deduced from our analysis: (i) the downward pressure on tax rates is less severe than predicted; (ii) the smaller jurisdiction leads; (iii) the 'big-country-higher-tax-rate' rule does not always hold.

This is the Triffin dilemma. The paper shows how it works through three examples: price of commodities, dollarization, and the international financial position of the US. And it makes a proposal to solve these issues, creating a more stable monetary system. In particular, it suggests the creation of an international monetary system of block regional currencies. Globalization and regionalization should be the two forces leading towards the new monetary system.

In this contribution, we address this empirical fact using a dynamic general equilibrium model and show that the introduction of habit-forming behavior plays a major role in accommodating the observed negative relationship between investment and government expenditure. Our numerical experiments point out the role of consumption inertia in determining the reactions of the open economy: as habit persistence gets stronger, fiscal expansion crowds out real consumption by a smaller amount and investment by a larger one, while the current account enters into a greater deficit.","[Cardi, Olivier] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Cardi, Olivier] Univ Pantheon Assas Paris 2, ERMES, Paris, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Cardi, O (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",olivier.cardi@u-paris2.fr,,"Cardi, Olivier/0000-0001-6715-394X",,,,,11,1,1,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The results of dynamic panel data and cross-sectional analysis provide support for the empirical validity of the model. Industries that are close to the core of ICT-related GPTs are characterized by greater innovative capabilities and have recently experienced a more dynamic performance.

To the extent that there are search frictions on the labor market, the return on jobs is determined by their expected duration: The time to retirement is then key to understanding older workers' employment. Countries with a retirement age of 60 are indeed characterized by lower employment rates for workers aged 55-59. Based on the French Labor Force Survey, we show that the likelihood of employment is significantly affected by the distance to retirement, in addition to age and other relevant variables. We then extend McCall's job search model by explicitly integrating life-cycle features with the retirement decision. Using simulations, we show that the distance effect in interaction with the generosity of unemployment benefits and the depressed demand for older workers explains the low rate of employment just before the eligibility age for the Social Security pension. Finally, we show that implementing actuarially fair schemes not only extends the retirement age, but also encourages a more intensive job search by older unemployed workers.

Tax havens, also known as offshore financial centers or international financial centers, are countries and territories that offer low tax rates and favorable regulatory policies to foreign investors. For example, tax havens typically tax inbound investment at zero or very low rates and further encourage investment with telecommunications and transportation facilities, other business infrastructure, favorable legal environments, and limited bureaucratic hurdles to starting new firms. Tax havens are small; most are islands; all but a few have populations below one million; and they have above-average incomes. The United States and other higher-tax countries frequently express concerns over how tax havens may affect their economies. Do they erode domestic tax collections; attract economic activity away from higher-tax countries; facilitate criminal activities; or reduce the transparency of financial accounts and so impede the smooth operation and regulation of legal and financial systems around the world? Do they contribute to excessive international tax competition? These concerns are plausible, albeit often founded on anecdotal rather than systematic evidence. Yet tax haven policies may also benefit other economies and even facilitate the effective operation of the tax systems of other countries.

In our model, which also includes public expenditure and population growth, labor augmenting technical progress is endogenous and this enriches the transitional dynamics of the economy. With respect to ideas-based growth models, we assume knowledge is produced according to a neoclassical technology, combining ideas and human capital. Such an assumption is motivated by empirical works showing the existence of significant decreasing returns in the creation of ideas at the aggregate level (as Kortum, 1993; and Pessoa, 2005) and of the weak relationship between some inputs of the knowledge production process (as the number of researchers) and the total factor productivity growth rate (as Jones, 2002).

These methodologies are applied to the distribution of households' inflation expectations collected by the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. To account for the evolution of the cross-section of inflation forecasts over time and measure the degree of heterogeneity in private agents' forecasts, we explore time series of percentiles from the empirical distribution. Our results show that heterogeneity is pervasive in the process of inflation expectation formation. We identify three regions of the distribution that correspond to different underlying mechanisms of expectation formation: a static or highly autoregressive region on the left hand side of the median, a nearly rational region around the median and a fraction of forecasts on the right hand side of the median formed in accordance with adaptive learning and sticky information.

The empirical investigation of 38 emerging market economies between 1990 and 2003 reveals that a surge in capital inflows significantly increases the probability of a sudden stop. In addition, a surge accompanied by a high current account deficit or an appreciated real exchange rate is more likely to be associated with a sudden stop. The paper also finds that a surge that is dominated by private loans and portfolio flows rather than direct investment has a higher probability to end with a sudden stop.","Western Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",Western Washington University,"Sula, O (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Dept Econ, 516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",ozan.sula@wwu.edu,"fungsen, chan/H-1983-2016",,,,,,39,30,41,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

[Short-term predictability of crude oil markets: a detrended fluctuation analysis approach, Energy Economics 30 (2008) 2645-2656]. In this paper, we test for the efficiency of WTI crude oil market through observing the dynamic of local Hurst exponents employing the method of rolling window based on multiscale detrended fluctuation analysis. Empirical results show that short-term, medium-term and long-term behaviors were generally turning into efficient behavior over time. However, in this way, the results also show that the market did not evolve along stable conditions for long times. Multiscale analysis is also implemented based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. We found that the small fluctuations of WTI crude oil market were persistent; however, the large fluctuations had high instability, both in the short- and long-terms. Our discussion is also extended by incorporating arguments from the crude oil market structure for explaining the different correlation dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops a cobweb-like commodity market model that takes into account the behavior of technical and fundamental speculators. We show that interactions between consumers, producers and heterogeneous speculators may produce price dynamics which mimics the cyclical price motion of actual commodity markets, i.e., irregular switches between bullish and bearish price developments. Moreover, we find that the impact of speculators on price dynamics is non-trivial: depending on the market structure, speculative transactions may either be beneficial or harmful for market stability.

Consumers are allowed to choose the optimal order in which to search firms and firms are able to influence this order through their choice of search costs and prices.

It then relates this concept to current policy concerns about climate change and energy and presents research results about what a low-carbon energy system might look like and how it could be achieved. It then briefly explores the policy implications and possible macro-economic costs of moving to a low-carbon energy system. Technological transitions are relevant. to climate change and energy because the energy system is a major technological system in society, and to reduce its carbon emissions dramatically, as is required if dangerous anthropogenic climate change is to be avoided; will require a full technological transition. There are many low-carbon technologies with the potential for large-scale deployment. Simulations suggest that the decarbonisation of the electricity system, involving any or all of carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and renewables, with increasing use of electricity in the residential and transport sectors, will be required. There may also be a role for bioenergy and hydrogen. In all cases strong public policies will be required to achieve large cuts in carbon emissions, involving carbon pricing, technology support and removing barriers to lifestyle and behaviour changes. Currently, while many different policies have been implemented, they have not been strongly enough applied to achieve sustained emissions reduction. Most models suggest that the macroeconomic costs of substantial cuts in carbon emissions are relatively small (1-4% GDP by 2050) compared to the costs of unabated climate change. However, the political costs of implementing the required policies may mean that politicians are unable in practice to prevent runaway climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,47,3,3,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The comoment criterion provides a unifying framework for the two equilibrium models of production under uncertainty, has the merit of being based on information which is readily available to firms, and provides greater insight than the theoretical criterion into the risk characteristics of its profit stream that a firm should focus on when choosing its investment plan.","[Quinzii, Martine] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Southern California,"Quinzii, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mmquinzii@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

This paper considers both of them together in a simple New Keynesian monetary business cycle model. A full set of rational expectations solutions is derived analytically. The analytical characterization allows an explicit comparison of news about future monetary policy and sunspots. The key distinction between the shocks lies in their relation to the realized policy shock. If monetary policy is passive, both types of shocks affect model dynamics through forecast errors. The effect of the news on forecast errors is not unique, and the dynamics induced by news and sunspot shocks can be observationally equivalent. If monetary policy is active, the sunspots are irrelevant, and the model responses to the news shocks are unique. In both cases, news shocks strengthen the endogenous propagation of the model, since anticipation of future changes prolongs agents' reaction.

In this note, we incorporate this spillover effect into a scale-invariant quality-ladder model. We find that the modified model features multiple steady states (1) a high-R&D steady state, (2) a low-R&D steady state and (3) a zero-R&D steady state. As for dynamics, when R&D spillovers are small, only the zero-R&D steady state is stable, and it emerges as a no-growth trap. In this case, the economy is subject to sunspot fluctuations around this trap (i.e., local indeterminacy). When R&D spillovers are large, both the zero-R&D and high-R&D steady states are stable and locally indeterminate. In this case, increasing patent breadth may cause the high-R&D steady state to become unstable and the economy to converge to the no-growth trap. Therefore, strengthening patent protection may stifle innovation through the occurrence of a bifurcation.","[Chen, Been-Lon; Chu, Angus C.] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chu, Angus C.] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, BL (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",bchen@econ.sinica.edu.tw; angusccc@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,48,9,9,0,22,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Moreover, the paper examines how the monetary authorities will set its optimal anchor of the money growth rate from the viewpoint of welfare maximization. Several main findings emerge from the analysis. First, when investment does not involve adjustment costs, the monetary equilibrium is locally determinate regardless of the strength of the labor externality and the extent of world capital market imperfections. Second, in the presence of investment adjustment costs, the monetary equilibrium may exhibit indeterminacy when the aggregate increasing returns-to-scale in production is sufficiently strong. Third, in the presence of world capital market imperfections, the Friedman rule of a zero nominal interest rate fails to be optimal. Fourth, in the face of perfect world capital markets, the optimal nominal money growth rate is maintained at the rate that is conformable to the Friedman rule, regardless of whether investment involves adjustment costs or not.","[Lai, Ching-chong] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-chong] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Chin, Chi-ting] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei 111, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; Feng Chia University; Ming Chuan University,"Lai, CC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",cclai@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,32,16,17,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Building on the work of the renowned archeologist James Deetz, this essay argues that the difference between Europeans' and Americans' use of knives and forks at the dinner table is an artifact of British mercantilism, which inflated the price of tableware in the American colonies and preserved the table fork as a colonial luxury long after it was an ordinary utensil in England. Pressures of conformity at the table have locked in these manners, which persist as an enduring effect of the British Navigation Acts.

We develop an axiomatic framework that takes as a primitive the preferences of an agent for each possible status quo option, and provide a characterization according to which the agent considers a full-dimensional set of possible priors and abandons her status quo option only if she finds an alternative that returns a higher expected utility for each of these priors. We then show that, in this framework, the very presence of a status quo induces the agent to be more uncertainty averse than she would be without a status quo option. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

With respect to the asymmetric adjustment, the response of government revenues to a worsening budget is faster (in absolute terms) than to an improving budget.

Assuming that government spending is a given fraction of output, the paper shows how a flat tax system balanced between labor and corporate tax rates can be second best optimal. It then computes how actual Baltic tax reforms from 2000 to 2007 affect the growth rate and welfare, including transition dynamics. Comparing the actual reform effects to hypothetical tax experiments, it results that equal flat tax rates on personal and corporate income would have increased welfare in all three Baltic countries by more than the actual reforms. Experiments show that movement towards a more equal balance between labor and capital tax rates, through changing just one tax rate, achieve almost as high or higher utility gains as in actual law for all three countries.

We are particularly interested in the role of gender segregation within sector-specific occupations in explaining relative wages. We find that, irrespective of labour market sector, the gender wage gap among low-paid, Australian workers is more than explained by differences in wage-related characteristics. The gender wage gap among high-wage workers, however, is largely unexplained in both sectors suggesting that glass ceilings (rather than sticky floors) may be prevalent. Gender differences in employment across occupations advantage (rather than disadvantage) all women except those in high-paid jobs, whereas disparity in labour market experience plays a much more important role in explaining relative private-sector wages. Finally, disparity in educational qualifications and demographic characteristics are generally unimportant in explaining the gender wage gap.","[Baron, Juan D.; Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Baron, Juan D.] Banco Republ, Cent Bank Colombia, Cartagena De Indias, Colombia",Australian National University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Barón, JD (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Cent Bank Colombia, Calle 33 3-123, Cartagena De Indias, Colombia.",jbaronri@banrep.gov.co,"Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013","Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886",,,,,42,59,68,4,59,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

Related to that observation, the ratio of wages of skilled to unskilled workers - the skill premium - shows two important features over time and across countries. In the US the skill premium decreased during the first half of the 20th century and increased after 1950, evolving in a U shaped pattern. On the other hand, the same measure across countries around 1990 is hump shaped when countries are ordered by GDP per worker. By modeling the decisions for factor accumulation and technology adoption, this paper gives a systematic explanation as to why we see ever more skill intensive technologies being adopted both over time in the US and across countries.

I show that not modelling the entry threat may underestimate the true degree of market power, as incumbents' blunted price responses to demand shocks resemble perfectly competitive behavior. Evidence from Brazilian cement markets points to an important role for imports in determining domestic cement prices, despite the near absence of imports. On assuming autarky, models with market power are rejected in favor of competition among incumbents. However, allowing a role for imports rejects the autarky assumption and precludes one from rejecting the presence of market power.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Salvo, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",a-salvo@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Salvo, Alberto/R-6286-2019","Salvo, Alberto/0000-0002-0293-1410",,,,,26,31,37,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0741-6261,,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Therefore, the adjustment role of a flexible exchange rate as an efficient mechanism in face of external shocks will be subject to the degree of exchange rate pass-through to both imported consumption goods and intermediate goods. In this paper, we develop a small open economy model with intermediate goods trade to investigate the implication of exchange rate pass-through to input prices for economic dynamics and the desirability of flexible exchange rates. Our model shows that in the presence of either terms of trade shocks or non-traded productivity shocks, the degree of exchange rate pass-through to input prices affects the economy more than does the degree of pass-through to goods prices. Furthermore, we find that, compared with the full exchange rate pass-through case, a delayed pass-through to input prices leads to more welfare loss than does a delayed pass-through to goods prices.

The effectiveness of such protection depends on the ability of local politicians to extract rents from enterprises. They can do so when local monopolies can be effectively sustained and electoral competition is weak. To analyze effects of political decentralization in a country with powerful regional industries, we build a simple general-equilibrium model where local politicians' electoral positions are levels of competition in the regional market, heterogenous firms provide campaign finance and compete in the labor market, and voters care about their wages, but could be influenced by campaign spending.

This out-of-equilibrium threat eliminates many of the pathologies of the standard treatment. There typically exists a unique equilibrium with trade guided by natural comparative advantage. And, when a country has CES preferences and any finite elasticity of substitution between goods, gains from trade are ensured.","[Grossman, Gene M.; Rossi-Hansberg, Esteban] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Grossman, GM (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,"Rossi-Hansberg, Esteban/0000-0002-5886-1108",,,,,35,29,38,2,28,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

Teachers have a disproportionate effect on the transmission of beliefs. Therefore, they generate a bias which makes it harder for the population to learn the true parameters of the economy if these are favourable to the market economy. Two parameters determine this bias. Social entropy defines how predictable one's occupation is as a function of one's beliefs. Heritability is the weight of the family's beliefs in the determination of the priors of a new generation. Both heritability and social entropy reduce the bias and make it easier to learn that the market economy is good, under the assumption that it is.","Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Saint-Paul, G (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,8,20,20,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The goal of the government is to minimize the time it takes to reach the appropriate product quality level at low costs. We simulate a dynamic profit maximization problem of the firm and derive the optimal path of the product quality development, then test the efficiency of the three types of subsidy methods: Constant Subsidy, Quality Matching Subsidy and Time-limited Subsidy methods. Our model yields a number of intriguing results: (i) not every subsidy methods guarantee product quality development, although the same amount is subsidized. (ii) the matching fund style subsidy is more efficient than providing constant amount of subsidy. (iii) Time-limited Subsidy improves product quality faster than the unlimited subsidy method. (iv) Time-limited Subsidy improves quality much faster than other methods with less subsidy cost. (v) there is an optimal combination between the subsidy and the time limits. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using a modified version of the Granger causality test developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), we found a unidirectional causality running from nuclear energy consumption to economic growth in Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland; the opposite uni-directional causality running from economic growth to nuclear energy consumption in Canada and Sweden; and a bi-directional causality running between economic growth and nuclear energy consumption in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA, increases in nuclear energy consumption caused increases in economic growth implying that conservation measures taken that reduce nuclear energy consumption may negatively affect economic growth.

This paper explores these important questions and finds that the persistence of inflation dynamics in China experienced a significant reduction in the late 1990s. By using counterfactual simulations we show that systematic monetary policy change is the main contribution to the observed structural change. Our result implies that although inflation is less persistent and hence less responsive than it used to be to shocks, monetary authorities must be vigilant in monitoring potential inflation rise and to take preemptive action to anchor inflation expectations against any indication that they may rise in the coming periods.

Two sets of experiments look at the combined effect of these three features while varying the order of moves, an aspect of the problem that previous research has found significantly affects the likelihood of a successful trade. In both cases high levels of trust and low levels of trustworthiness are observed.

The results suggest that release dates of movies are too clustered around big holiday weekends and that box office revenues would increase if distributors shifted some holiday releases by one or two weeks.

It relies on sequential moves with asymmetric information, making the model particularly attractive for studying (common) situations where player asymmetries are important.

Differences in the frequency of wage changes between firms are mainly attributable to the institutional framework of the labor market in which they operate. There is evidence of both nominal and real downward wage rigidity. Moreover, when facing a negative shock, European firms prefer to reduce the amount of labor rather than cutting wages. Among those that decide to cut wages a majority prefers to cut flexible wage components rather than base wages. The rigidity of base wages is largely explained by fairness and efficiency considerations.

A simple labour market search model is developed in which a firm can search for a second employee while producing with a first worker, and this creates the equilibrium size distribution of firms. A firm expands employment even if the instantaneous payoff to a large firm is less than that of staying small - a firm has a precautionary motive to expand its size. In addition, this motive is enhanced by a greater market tightness. Because of this effect, firms' decisions become interdependent - a firm creates a vacancy if it expects other firms to do the same, creating strategic complementarity among firms and thereby self-fulfilling multiple equilibria. An increase in productivity can cause a qualitative change in labour market tightness and the rate of unemployment.","[Kudoh, Noritaka] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Econ, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan; [Sasaki, Masaru] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Hokkaido University; Osaka University,"Kudoh, N (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Dept Econ, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan.",kudoh@econ.hokudai.ac.jp; sasaki@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Kudoh, Noritaka/A-8843-2012",,,,,,30,3,3,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

This paper departs from this framework by assuming that a rent-seeking politician chooses policies. If the politician chooses extractive policies, citizens throw him out of power. We analyse the efficient sustainable equilibrium. Unlike in the standard economy, temporary economic shocks generate volatile and persistent changes in taxes along the equilibrium path. This serves to optimally limit rent-seeking by the politician and to optimally generate support for the politician from the citizens. Taxes resembling those of the benevolent government are very costly since the government over-saves and resources are wasted on rents. Political distortions thus cause the complete debt market to behave as if it were incomplete. However, in contrast to an incomplete market economy, in the long run, taxes do not converge to zero, and under some conditions, they resemble taxes under a benevolent government.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Yared, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,44,52,66,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals or on occasions fails to deal with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

The results contrast with the evidence found for the US, by showing no sign that differences in investor type generate significant variation in the dynamic behaviour of trading volume, ordinary autocorrelation, or trading in the event of major market movements. Differences in autocorrelation are found when the level of mutual funds ownership of a stock is included in the analysis. These findings are consistent with the view that it is not only the institutional nature, but also the different investment targets of these agents, that can influence trading volume dynamics.","[Del Rio, Cristina; Santamaria, Rafael] Univ Publ Navarra, Navarra, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Del Río, C (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Navarra, Spain.",,"del río, Cristina/G-8849-2015; Santamaria, Rafael/G-5755-2015","del río, Cristina/0000-0002-0901-122X; Santamaria, Rafael/0000-0001-7656-6412",,,,,34,1,1,0,6,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

The present paper, in contrast, argues that pure market and hierarchy, including their potential formal hybrids, are an empirically void set and that coordination forms have to be conceptualized in a fundamentally different way. A relevant organizational space must reflect the dilemma-prone direct interdependence in a complex world that either leads to (1) informally institutionalized, problem-solving cooperation (the instrumental dimension of institutionalization), or (2) mutual blockage, lock-in, and power- and status-based market and hierarchy failure (the ceremonial dimension of institutionalization). Institutionalized cooperation is established as a genuine organizational dimension that generates a third attractor in the new organizational space. Thus, an organizational triangle is constructed as a more realistic heuristic device for empirical organizational research. The Organizational Triangle is then tentatively applied in a couple of case studies.","[Elsner, Wolfram; Hocker, Gero; Schwardt, Henning] Univ Bremen, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany",University of Bremen,"Elsner, W (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany.",,,"Schwardt, Henning/0000-0002-1171-7213",,,,,95,12,15,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Central models of risk choice, including expected utility theory, give a simple prediction of choice under weak conditions, as one decision is always first-order stochastically dominating. We document frequent, systematic and costly violations of dominance. Many contestants appear to have a systematic expectation bias that can be related to Tversky and Kahneman's (Cogn.

With imperfect risk sharing, the strict zero-inflation policy is no longer optimal even when the zero-inflation steady-state equilibrium is made (conditionally) efficient. Quantitative results depend on how the idiosyncratic earning loss due to unemployment varies over business cycles. If the idiosyncratic income loss is acyclical, the optimal policy differs very little from the zero-inflation policy. However, if it varies countercyclically, as evidence suggests, the deviation of the optimal policy from the complete price-level stabilization becomes quantitatively significant. Furthermore, the optimal policy in such a case involves stabilization of output to a much larger extent. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It first describes the role of services in production and trade in goods. Next, it proposes two models for analyzing the impact of services trade liberalization on industrial structure. The first captures the role of trade in tasks when countries have different technology i) in production of services; and ii) in organizing production. The latter has to the author's knowledge not been analyzed in the trade literature before. Countries with superior organizational technology (e.g. Japan) will strengthen their comparative advantage in manufacturing following trade liberalization in services. The second model explores the interrelationship between intermediate goods and services i) when they are substitutes; and ii) when they are complements. In both models the gains from trade liberalization is non-linear in trade costs. Going the last mile of liberalization has a much larger impact than taking the first steps. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that SOEs are better able than GAs to monitor top executives, as indicated by a higher sensitivity of top executive turnover to firm performance. However, corporate governance mechanisms have no significant impact on the sensitivity of top executive turnover to firm performance. This study suggests that incentives for controlling shareholders are more important than governance mechanisms in replacing executives due to poor performance in a transitional economy such as China's, where institutions that support governance mechanisms are still being developed.

Critics of the present German system argue that the downward adjustment of the pension for early retirees is too small compared with a 'fair' system and thus encourages early retirement. We discuss several notions of 'fairness' of early-retirement provisions and propose a concept called 'distributive neutrality', which states that the ratio between total benefits and total contributions should not depend systematically on the individual's ability. By applying this concept to the German retirement benefit formula and taking empirically estimated relationships between annual income (as a proxy for ability), life expectancy and retirement age into account, we show that at the present discount rate of 3.6% per year there is redistribution from low to high earners, which, surprisingly, could be attenuated by raising the discount rate.","[Breyer, Friedrich] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Breyer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box D135, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",Friedrich.Breyer@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,19,12,12,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The goods from the South are assumed to be ethically unsound (i.e. dubious social content) while those from the North ethically sound. We then study the consequences of monitoring ethics in the North on the nature (fair or unfair) and the volume of North-South trade. On the one hand, an increase in the probability of inspection of goods from the South leads to an increase in imports to the North from the South. This result goes against the idea that this kind of social monitoring is akin to a protectionist measure.

Our data spans 27 months of house sales: 7 months before, and 20 months after the startup of crematory operations. Results indicate that proximity, measured both in terms of direction and distance from the crematory, imparts a statistically significant negative impact on average house sale prices-an increase of 0.3 to 3.6% of average sale price for every one-tenth mile increase up to one-half mile in distance away from the crematory, but depending on direction from the crematory.

This impact could be attributed to the Internet's universal access to information as well as its applications in all walks of life. Various services of the Internet and tools (chat rooms, e-mails, etc.) provide users with a wide range of benefits. In their study, Colley and Maltby (2008) indicated that one important research area over the last decade has been the impact of the Internet upon different social groups in the society. The differences in various aspects of Internet usage across demographic groups have also become an interesting research area (Yang and Tung, 2007; Jaeger, 2003) because demographic attributes were found to influence individuals' actions before they engage in a given behaviour (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980; Zhang, 2005; Jaeger, 2003). Zhang (2005) reported that although studies of computer and Internet attitudes are abundant, the majority of these researches use college students (Zhang, 2005; Hwang et al., 2006; Li and Kirkup, 2007; Chen, 2008) or ordinary citizens (Fisher and Jacob, 2006; Fang and Yen, 2006; Colley and Maltby, 2008) as samples. However, employee populations constitute one of the largest groups and play a very important role in the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, employees' use of Internet services may show entirely different patterns than other groups in the society (Jin et al., 2007). Furthermore, the basic concepts of the Internet have been developed in the Western World and most of the empirical research focusing on Internet usage is either US/EU or Far East based (Teo and Lim, 2000; Usiner, 2005). Although they cover very valuable territory and provide useful insights that can provide direction in the examination of the issues from a global perspective, the results of these studies may not be applicable to other parts of the world due to the existence of social and economic differences (Bertot, McClure and Owens, 1999; Zhang, 2005). Nowadays, there is a growing divide between Western countries and the developing countries and, comparatively, very little has been researched in the field of ICT in the latter. Keeping these in view, the present study was undertaken to investigate the predictive effect of employees' gender and sector in their Internet usage and purpose of using the Internet. For the purpose of this study, public sector refers to national government departments and private sector comprises private corporations (Akman et al., 2005). Here, it is important to note that institutions providing nonprofit public services (e. g. universities, local government, etc.) have been categorized as a public sector. Our study focused on employees from private and public sector organizations. A sample of employees was used for this purpose. The independent (decision) variables were gender and sector of employees. The dependent variables were categorized into two empirical factors: (i) usage profile (average daily use of Internet and reason for using Internet) and (ii) usage pattern (average daily use of Internet for communication services, average daily use of Internet for information services and average daily use of Internet for electronic services). For this purpose, a survey was conducted among employees from public and private sector organizations. Interestingly, the results indicated that gender and sector both have significant impact on average daily use of Internet for communication services. This impact is significant for gender on average daily use of Internet for information services and for sector on average daily use of Internet. Another interesting finding is that there is no significant predictive effect of gender and sector on the reason for using Internet.","[Akman, Ibrahim; Mishra, Alok] Atilim Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University,"Akman, I (通讯作者)，Atilim Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey.",akman@atilim.edu.tr; alok@atilim.edu.tr,"Mishra, Alok/AAE-2673-2019","Mishra, Alok/0000-0003-1275-2050",,,,,65,6,7,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We propose a novel price setting model that fully captures heterogeneity in individual pricing behavior. Specifically, we assume that there is a continuum of firms that set prices according to a Calvo mechanism, each of them with a possibly different price adjustment parameter. The model is estimated by maximum likelihood and closely matches individual consumer and producer price data. Incorporating estimated price setting rules into a standard DSGE model shows that fully accounting for pricing heterogeneity is crucial to understanding inflation and output dynamics. The standard calibration that assumes within sector homogeneity, as in Carvalho (2006), is at odds with micro data evidence and leads to a substantial distortion of estimates of the real impact of monetary policy.","[Alvarez, Luis J.; Burriel, Pablo] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Alvarez, LJ (通讯作者)，Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",ljalv@bde.es,,,,,,,41,8,8,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The analysis is conducted in the framework of a VECM, since this allows accounting for endogeneity between the variables. Our results imply that a long term relationship between investment and subsidies exists, making subsidies an adequate tool to influence residential investment and hence the business cycle. In addition, a disaggregated approach taking into account several different types of fiscal measures highlights that tax and interest rate subsidies are the most efficient fiscal tools for influencing residential investment. When accounting for financial factors by means of households' borrowing capacity, we find that the latter also impacts residential investment positively. Moreover, this alternative specification underlines the robustness of the above mentioned results, as it confirms subsidies as the most efficient measure to influence residential investment.","[Antipa, Pamfili] Banque France, Paris, France; [Schalck, Christophe] ESG Management Sch, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Antipa, P (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",pamfili.antipa@banque-france.fr; cschalck@pole-esg.fr,,"Antipa, Pamfili/0000-0002-8570-2217",,,,,26,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,385,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_17,0.0,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200017,0

If banks differ in their exposure to dubious assets, fragile banks may claim to be sound only in order to manipulate investors' expectations. Then sound banks must pay a larger interest rate than in a perfect information set-up. A stronger sanction for false information would improve the situation of the low-risk banks but would deteriorate the situation of the high-risk banks. The total effect on the economy-wide frequency of default of credit institutions is ambiguous. It can be shown that, in some cases, the optimal sanction is lower than the sanction that rules out any manipulatory behavior.","[Besancenot, Damien] CEPN, Paris, France; [Besancenot, Damien] Univ Paris 13, Paris, France; [Vranceanu, Radu] ESSEC Business Sch, F-95021 Cergy, France",Universite Paris 13; ESSEC Business School,"Besancenot, D (通讯作者)，CEPN, Paris, France.",besancenot.damien@u-paris13.fr; vranceanu@essec.fr,"besancenot, damien/Q-5893-2019","Vranceanu, Radu/0000-0003-2050-8269",,,,,14,1,1,0,5,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We analyse a unique exception to this rule and a potential policy innovation in the battle against obesity: a weight loss betting market. If obese individuals have time-inconsistent preferences then commitment mechanisms, such as personal gambles, should help them restrain their short-term impulses and lose weight. Correspondence with the bettors confirms that this is their primary motivation. However, it appears that the bettors in our sample are not particularly skilled at choosing effective commitment mechanisms. Despite payoffs of as high as $7350, approximately 80% of people who spend money to bet on their own behaviour end up losing their bets. Empirical analysis of the betting market yields further insights. Males are treated very differently compared to females: being male is considered equivalent to having an extra 6 months to lose the same amount of weight. Movements in the market price also confirm the belief that rigidity is preferred to flexibility in setting successful weight loss targets.","[Lynham, John] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Burger, Nicholas] RAND Corp, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; RAND Corporation,"Lynham, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Saunders Hall 507,2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",lynham@hawaii.edu,,"Lynham, John/0000-0002-5816-9648",,,,,23,12,16,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

But only by including the interest-rate differential in our error correction model do we obtain results that align with economic theory. The economic theory of PPP suggests that exchange rates and prices are cointegrated, with exchange rates moving proportionally to prices in the long run.

Initially, to determine the best indicator for the recovery period, we construct a simple forecasting model that incorporates three indicators: lagging, leading and coincidence indices, with two proxies of economic performance, macroeconomic and financial variables. We estimate a two-variable vector error correction model (VECM) using monthly and quarterly data covering the period 1980 to 2000. We alternate between the three indicators and we evaluate each model using out-of-sample forecast. Using the results of the initial process of analysis, we predict the recovery period of Malaysian economy from the current global economic crisis. It is found that lagging index is the best indicator of financial performance of the economy. From the half-life calculation base on error correction term, the study found that Malaysia was able to recover from the previous 1997 crisis within a two to four year period after the crisis. Given that the current crisis environment is similar to the previous 1997 crisis, a similar time period could apply to the current global crisis recovery.","[Duasa, Jarita] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Econ Kuliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Nursilah] Islamic Sci Univ Malaysia, Fac Econ & Muamalat, Nilai, Negari Sembilan, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia,"Duasa, J (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Econ Kuliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Malaysia.",jarita@iiu.edu.my,"Duasa, Jarita/AAP-3895-2021","Duasa, Jarita/0000-0002-6432-777X; Ahmad, Nursilah/0000-0002-4243-4697",,,,,8,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

To do so, I first present a theoretical model of exchange-rate determination that bridges the gap between existing microstructure and traditional models. The model examines how dispersed microeconomic information known to individual agents outside the foreign exchange market is aggregated and transmitted to dealers via transaction flows (i.e., order How); and how the information is then embedded in the spot exchange rate. I then report empirical evidence that strongly supports the presence of the link between the macroeconomy, order flow, and high frequency exchange rate returns implied by the model. In fact, my empirical results indicate that between 20 and 30% of the variance in excess currency returns over one- and two-month horizons can be linked back to developments in the macroeconomy. This level of explanatory power is an order of magnitude higher than that found in traditional models - even the newly developed monetary models incorporating central banks reaction functions. Moreover, it provides a straightforward solution to the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle. Namely, the high frequency behavior of spot exchange rates reflects the flow of new information reaching dealers concerning the slowly evolving state of the macroeconomy, rather than the effects of shocks that drive rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions.

RM addresses three basic categories of demand-management decisions: structural, price, and quantity decisions. Network revenue management models attempt to maximize revenue when customers buy bundles of multiple resources. The dependence among the resources in such cases is created by customer demand. Network revenue management can be formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming problem whose exact solution is computationally intractable. Solutions are based on approximations of various types. Most approximation methods use a simplified network model or decompose the network problem into a collection of single-resource problems. Approximation methods based on extensions of the basic approaches are proposed in the paper.","[Fiala, Petr] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,pfiala@vse.cz,"Fiala, Petr/K-6823-2015",,,,,,8,4,4,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,132,137,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900023,0

Our analysis is predicated on the notion that car use is an individual decision, albeit one that is dependent on intra-household allocation processes, thereby building on a growing body of literature that has identified the importance of socioeconomic factors such as employment status, gender, and the presence of children in determining both access to and use of the car. To capture this two-stage decision process, we employ the two-part model, which consists of probit and OLS estimators, and derive elasticity estimates that incorporate both the discrete and continuous choices pertaining to car use. With fuel price elasticity estimates ranging between -0.45 and -0.50, our results suggest raising prices via fuel taxes to be a promising energy conservation and climate protection measure.

Maintenance costs are one of the biggest costs categories in life cycle costing so it is very hard to estimate them. This costs category has some unique estimation characteristics; one of them is that maintenance costs are spent during a long period. So estimation of material, spare parts or direct labour costs is very difficult therefore maintenance costs calculation is based mostly on assumptions. One of the maintenance classifications is based on maintenance strategies. The objective of any maintenance strategies is to minimize the total costs and maximize the asset operation time after setting preventive or corrective actions. Optimal decision is to pay attention to two main strategies corrective and preventive maintenance. The purpose of corrective maintenance is to renew asset efficiency as soon as possible. Preventive maintenance is performed periodically before breakdown occurs. Correct costs allocation has the main impact on deciding about the maintenance strategies. However, only a few companies pay attention to costing and cost effectiveness analysis. Maintenance cost planning ensures assets productivity, safety and profit maximization. Life cycle profit can be improved by reducing costs, improving ownership effectiveness and efficiency related to operations and management, as well as improving support. But minimizing the costs does not necessarily result in maximized profit. Production equipment operation, maintenance, and support planning need to be based on market dynamics. Opportunities for profit may be lost because of unavailability caused by badly planned preventive maintenance, unplanned corrective maintenance, as well as ineffectiveness in operations and maintenance strategy. In order to choose which maintenance strategy shall be used marginal break even between maintenance strategies is calculated The procedure is demonstrated according to one of the iteration methods - string method The main aspect of this method is that the chosen interval should be isolating and it should meet all the requirements for isolating interval: 1. Function changes its sign in the interval; 2. The first derivative function does not change its sign in the interval; 3. The second derivative function does not change its sign in the interval. The calculation manifests that in the economical age 1.78 preventive maintenance costs are equal to corrective maintenance costs so it is worth to use preventive maintenance strategy starting from this point for Renault model vehicles.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gokiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ruta.gokiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

With this purpose, a Ramsey type dynamic applied general equilibrium model (AGE) is used to the case of Spain. The results show that the costs of post-Kyoto phase can be maintained at acceptable levels, if the necessary steps towards a low-carbon economy are induced. It also notes that the influence of the timing is not significant compared with the relevance of stronger targets. However, provided that technology advances at the current levels, a reduction of emissions 15% above Kyoto levels implies a doubling of the mitigation costs in the future.","Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"González-Eguino, M (通讯作者)，Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Spain.",mikel.gonzalez@bc3research.org,"Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Gonzalez-Eguino, Mikel/M-6057-2013","Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Gonzalez-Eguino, Mikel/0000-0002-0033-9202",,,,,31,0,0,0,14,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

It means, individuals have to fulfill their obligations to the creditors to the end of their life. During the social welfare crisis period that is present in Lithuania at the moment this issue is especially relevant. In spring of 2009 the project of legal act concerning bankruptcies was registered in Seimas (Parliament) of Republic of Lithuania, but in spite of the opinion existing in academic literature that legalization of bankruptcy of natural persons is absolute necessity, the adoption of the respective legal act in Lithuania was postponed indefinitely. Although professionals criticized some of the clauses of the proposed legal act, the enactment of the act was postponed not because it was imperfect in its form but because at the moment its legalization would be irrational in the face of society's expenditure and benefits. The objective of the article is to generalize and evaluate necessity of the legalization of insolvency of natural persons and to present a conceptual model for legalization of individual insolvency. The first part of the article is devoted to the analysis of arguments of supporters and opponents of the legalization of individual insolvency. The insolvency of an individual and legalization of procedures of bankruptcy are aimed at solving the recovery of the debts from the insolvent individual in a civilized way by balancing all of his creditors' interests. From the analysis of supporters' and opponents' arguments interesting conclusion can be drawn that individual bankruptcy can be ranked as a form of limited liability for individuals. It gives reason for premise that a debtor in some cases will behave opportunistic, but in spite of that fact, the global experience shows that the rule of limited liability is very socially and economically useful. The survey also proves that there are neither legal nor economic arguments for suspension of legalization of bankruptcy of natural persons. The second part of the article is devoted to modeling the conceptual model for legalization of individual insolvency. Suggested model gives the understanding that Fresh start doctrine cannot be associated with the straight discharge from the debts. The natural person can be discharged from the debts if only he meets the requirements for an application to court for bankruptcy procedures and if only he fulfilled the payment plan and successfully passed prevention and rehabilitation procedure. The issue of procedures of prevention and integration of the debtor is highly important and complicated. The detailed system of such procedure is the object of another research based on the experience of other countries. This research would develop a longitudinal picture of the debtor after bankruptcy and would reveal whether most debtors really get a fresh start and why some of them fail.","[Gruodyte, Edita; Kirsiene, Julija] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Gruodyte, E (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, K Donelaicio St 58, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania.",e.gruodyte@tf.vdu.lt; j.kirsiene@tf.vdu.lt,"Gruodyte, Edita/ABC-4109-2020; Kirsiene, Julija/AEH-8693-2022","Gruodyte, Edita/0000-0003-1105-9860; Kirsiene, Julija/0000-0003-2196-5648",,,,,41,3,3,0,4,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Over 5000 listings of both new and used compact discs were collected from eBay (which provides sellers a choice between two mechanisms: auction or posted price) and its Subsidiary, Half.com (which features only posted prices). Despite the often cited revenue-dominance property of auctions, many sellers choose to post a fixed price. To explain this anomaly, I examine empirically the determinants of the revenue earned by sellers in this market. I find that posted-price goods sell for higher prices, while auctioned goods sell with a higher probability. Further results suggest that the size of a seller's inventory is the key factor in the choice between selling in an auction and posting a fixed price. In particular, sellers with large inventories are more likely to use the posted-price mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on the cohort of males born in 1973. This cohort was conscripted during a time of rapid change in Swedish security policy and substantial cutbacks in the armed forces. As a consequence, a relatively large proportion of the cohort was assigned a service category after the enlistment test but one third of these individuals were never conscripted. We argue that these organizational changes, along with data on important background variables, make it possible to rely on selection on observables. A clear finding is that military training has a positive effect on annual earnings at the age of 30 for those men in the category 'private soldier' who do not subsequently obtain a high level of educational.","[Hanes, Niklas; Norlin, Erik; Sjostrom, Magnus] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Hanes, N (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",niklas.hanes@econ.umu.se,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,14,4,5,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

It argues that the regulation of mobile termination rates based on fully allocated costs, or long-run incremental cost plus, exacerbates the network effects associated with  tariff-mediated network externalities, by increasing mobile networks' on-net/off-net price differentials. This reduces welfare and acts as a barrier to growth for smaller networks and new entrants. The paper argues for the adoption of bill-and-keep for mobile termination rates, and responds to recent theoretical arguments which suggest that such a move might harm mobile subscribers.","[Pagnozzi, Marco] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,,manalysis@aol.com; pagnozzi@unina.it,,,,,,,68,23,25,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We expand on the wage contract literature that emphasises the role of firm-specific human capital and that explores problems of contract efficiency in the face of information asymmetries between the firm and the worker. We first explore a simple wage-hours contract without overtime and show that incorporating hours into the contract may itself produce efficiency gains. We then show how the introduction of overtime hours, remunerated at premium rates, can further improve contract efficiency. Our modelling outcomes in respect of the relationship between the overtime premium and the standard wage rate relate closely to earlier developments in hedonic wage theory. Throughout, we emphasise the intuitive reasoning behind the theory and we also supply relevant empirical evidence. Mathematical derivations are provided in an Appendix. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the nature of perceived security of tenure and housing consolidation in seven informal settlements across Fiji. Understanding of the security of tenure needs to move beyond a legal/illegal dichotomy and focus on perceived security of tenure, which accepts that a much wider continuum of land-use rights typically exists. Housing consolidation or 'self-help' housing improvements are also linked to security of tenure but have not been sufficiently investigated through a perceived security-of-tenure framework, especially with respect to the use of customary land. The study finds that both perceived security of tenure and housing consolidation are greater than might be expected. Policy implications are discussed and interventions are encouraged that look to increase perceived security of tenure and housing consolidation in existing settlements.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci Te Kura TatAi Aro W, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Kiddie, GL (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci Te Kura TatAi Aro W, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,"Kiddle, Gabriel/0000-0002-4059-9834",,,,,43,5,5,0,11,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

A standard econometric approach is to estimate the relationship between cigarette prices and smoking participation at a point in time. I extend this approach to model past-year decisions to start, resume or quit smoking. Considering reverse causality, I apply an instrumental variable (excise taxes) for cigarette prices. I include an index of state-level anti-smoking sentiment to control for omitted variable bias. After estimating separate models for smoking initiation, relapse and cessation and for different age groups, I find no evidence that increasing taxes on cigarettes can prevent the onset of youth smoking. Neither does it effectively induce young smokers to quit.

J,"Mets, T; Kaarna, K; Kelli, A",,,,"Mets, Tonis; Kaarna, Kalev; Kelli, Aleksei",,,Intellectual Property - Lever or Barrier to the Globalization of Knowledge-intensive SMEs of Small Country Origin,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,accelerated internationalisation; International Entrepreneurship; knowledge leverage; IPR,INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"Although hundreds of research papers have been published on the issue of accelerated internationalisation, Born Globals and International New Ventures, the advancement for common theory of International Entrepreneurship (IE) has been limited. Little attention has been paid to Intellectual Property (IP) and its strategies in rapidly internationalising companies. Researching the role of IP in the internationalisation process is especially important in case of knowledge intensive small and medium size companies (KSME). It has been shown that KSME leverage knowledge and other resources in order to internationalise rapidly and gain competitive advantage on global market. This includes building on existing knowledge of markets and technology, and incorporating new knowledge domains until the value of products or services, incorporating all the knowledge, becomes more valuable than the sum of different knowledge domains. The paper aims to explore the role of intellectual property in the process of becoming global technology-and knowledge-intensive SME of small open economy country origin. The authors suggest that the impact of IP on globalization can be threefold. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) can be a barrier to internationalisation, it can be a blocker for constraining competitors' ability to leverage, and it can support the market and knowledge leverage. Conducted case study analysis is based on POM-strategy model, the process theory and market-knowledge leverage framework of globalization of KSMEs, and above mentioned IPR categorisation. Four companies were chosen for case studies: Regio (mobile positioning software company), Skype Technologies S.A. (global VoIP company), Asper Biotech (small global biotech company), and Icosagen (small biotech company). For all companies obtaining IP rights or not obtaining them has been a barrier. Patenting is costly for companies in early stages. In case of software, the best strategy can be the utilisation of copyright and trade secret protection (as in case of Regio). Skype, Asper and Icosagen have used patenting also for either blocking their competition or guaranteeing freedom to operate for themselves. All four case companies gained VC funding or financial support from academic institutions. In case of Regio the funding was gained despite the lack of protected IP in form of patents. The companies used the financing and funding in different development stages and for different purposes. Only two companies out of the four have used their patents to leverage their knowledge domains or market penetration. Protected patent portfolio has allowed Skype to advance to different markets and increase the number of services provided. Icosagen has been able to standardise their patent protected technology, which is heavy blocker, but also creates leverage effects for Icosagen technology. KSMEs have usually relatively low resources for marketing, but not only, there is a lack of resources for anything. But this can be not disturbing to global breakthrough as seen on the example of Skype. Clever business model, protected IP and free of charge basic service can create absolutely new approach in the industry. Moving from a single product/knowledge domain to a high system products is not the absolute rule. Market can cause the contrary processes, i.e. simplifying complexity of the product and its IP protection. For SME the focus on the concrete technology and product creates preconditions for global breakthrough, but is not the guarantee for leverage of all accumulated competences globally. It depends on happy combination of product development and IP, allied partnerships and market, and business model linking all these factors together.","[Mets, Tonis; Kaarna, Kalev; Kelli, Aleksei] Univ Tartu, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Mets, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Ulikooli 18, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia.",tonis.mets@ut.ee; kalev.kaarna@gmail.com; aleksei.kelli@ut.ee,"/AHD-4125-2022; Mets, Tõnis/A-8428-2008; Mets, Tõnis/AAH-2926-2019; /ABA-9691-2021; Kaarna, Kalev/HJH-8042-2023; Kelli, Aleksei/J-2986-2015","Mets, Tõnis/0000-0003-3972-5204; Kelli, Aleksei/0000-0002-0856-1000",,,,,49,7,7,1,83,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This study examined the role and effectiveness of independent regulators through comparative case study analyses of the three countries, based on insights drawn from semi-structured interviews with telecommunications officials, operators, regulators and users. It found that the early regulatory reforms in the Pacific showed evidence of 'regulatory capture' through legislative amendments and political influences on the operation of the office of the regulator. Further, the reliance of independent regulators on the national parliament's budget appropriation and the lack of technical and financial resources imposed burdens on the independent regulators. On the other hand, the study found that the legal contractual agreement-the deed of settlement-signed between governments and the incumbent telecommunications operators and competition from new entrants provided immediate policy certainty to the reform process and catalysed the finalisation of the reform package.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Ofa, SV (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

This paper suggests a new methodology for estimating HIV prevalence and incidence using inference from mortality data. This methodology can be used to generate prevalence estimates from early in the epidemic.

Pindyck demonstrated that an irreversible investment opportunity is similar with a financial call option and proposed an efficient method to include the option value of waiting in the traditional profitability analysis. The positive potential of the investment is taken into consideration by using real option analysis (ROA) in traditional or modern approaches. The main objective of this article is to present a critical analysis of different dynamic valuation methods capable to offer more realistic support in strategic decision-making applications in PPPs for the infrastructure in tourism.

The first stage of the research consisted of the existing literature on the subject, i.e. concerning other research on the partnering relations of construction enterprises. There is a lack of research on this subject in Poland and the neighbouring countries. Next, the author elaborated her own model of partnering relations using 14 parameters and based on multi-criteria analysis of the phenomenon of partnering. She elaborated her own method of assessing the partnering relations of a construction enterprise with four essential transactors in its environment, as well as a simplified method of assessment of a construction enterprise's success. According to this method, the success of a construction enterprise is assessed by means of the following three indexes: index of the competitiveness of bids, timely completion of tasks, performance quality index. A further stage was to prepare a project of questionnaire research and conduct questionnaire-based interviews in construction enterprises in a selected region. The research results were elaborated using the author's own method of partnering relation assessment, the simplified method of assessment of an enterprise's success and, next, the mathematical correlation model and the linear regression model. The research was conducted with the participation of 147 experts-representatives of medium-sized and large construction enterprises which employ more than 50 workers and are based in the Malopolska Voivodship, Poland, the said representatives being owners, managers or building site managers of such enterprises. In most researched cases the result shows that the linear correlation between the level of partnering relations of a construction enterprise and the success index are significant. The highest regression significance level for the index of the success of a construction enterprise is shown in relation to indices of timely performance and quality performance. These indices are in direct relation to the level of the partnering relations of a construction enterprise. Partnering relations with the suppliers of machinery and equipment ensure the timely performance and high quality of supplies, which entails that the construction enterprise is capable to deliver investment projects in a timely manner and ensure high quality of deliveries. The lowest regression significance level is shown by the index of the competitiveness of bids. The index of the competitiveness of bids is in relation to the number of bidding procedures won by the enterprise. In the event of bidding procedures, the investor may not establish partnering relations with construction enterprises. This is why the index of the competitiveness of bids does not directly depend on the level of partnering relations of the enterprise. The index may depend on these relations only indirectly. Construction enterprises which maintain partnering relations at high levels are characteristic also of high quality and timely performance indices, and hence, such enterprises are perceived to be reliable and trustworthy, which increases their chance to win bidding procedures. The research analysis confirms the hypothesis formulated above and explains the need for the development of partnering relations between construction enterprises on the business-to-busines market.","Cracow Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Radziszewska-Zielina, E (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",eradzisz@izwbit.wil.pk.edu.pl,"Radziszewska-Zielina, Elżbieta/AAP-7077-2020","Radziszewska-Zielina, Elżbieta/0000-0002-3237-4360",,,,,67,15,15,2,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This article offers a quantitative assessment of base erosion. We construct time series of a representative state sales tax base and its price index, and estimate a structural demand system for 'taxed' and 'untaxed' commodities. We use the estimates to forecast the sales tax base over coming years. Time-series forecasts and a weighted-average forecast are constructed, to reduce the likelihood of forecast error. The results suggest slow, but relentless, base erosion and possible recurring fiscal stress, in states where sales tax revenues make up sizable fractions of total tax revenues.","Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Russo, B (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",brusso@uncc.edu,,,,,,,34,2,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is rather obvious that the SEE countries have not succeeded in reforming their electricity sectors in a way that would enable development of stable and self-sustainable free markets for electricity, either within national borders or on the regional level. The most important research question of this article is: why did this happen? After an examination of the barriers to trade in electricity that are still present throughout SEE one can conclude that all of them can be directly traced to a single cause - rigid pricing policies that have been in place for decades and have not been removed. However, it would be too simple to say that this problem could easily be solved if only governments had the political will to do it. Since all of them carry a heavy burden of socio-economic problems that have arisen during the last two decades of post-communist transition, they would need to create a clear political strategy to gradually release their grip on electricity prices. The main conclusion is that the only possible way to finish the reform of the electricity sector in these countries successfully is to allow all market participants to do business under normal economic conditions, which seems still to be rather difficult for the governments of SEE countries.","[Sabolic, Dubravko] HEP Transmiss Syst Operator, Zagreb, Croatia; [Grcic, Branko] Univ Split, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Sabolic, D (通讯作者)，HEP Transmiss Syst Operator, Zagreb, Croatia.",dubravko.sabolic@hep.hr,"Sabolic, Dubravko/AAU-5403-2020",,,,,,15,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,3,,,,,367,385,PII 925512132,10.1080/14631377.2010.498685,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,636WF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280773700006,0

Structural differences in economies can be seen as significant differences in values of these parameters. Difference is regarded as significant, if data fit of models which allow for different values of these parameters are better than data fit of those models with the common values of these parameters.

From 1995 to 2008, fourteen states relaxed or repealed their bans on the Sunday sale of packaged alcohol. This paper leverages these repeals to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of Sunday sales bans on alcohol related crash fatalities. Previous published studies in this area have found conflicting results regarding the effect of Sunday sales on traffic accidents and fatalities, but these studies have focused on repeals in single states, cities, or provinces; are outdated; or have failed to control for underlying changes in traffic fatalities that may be correlated with repeals but are due to other factors affecting traffic safety. Drawing upon data from the lower 48 states from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), this paper finds that only the repeal in New Mexico led to an increase in fatalities. The effect is evident only in New Mexico because this repeal led to larger increases in drinking in New Mexico than in other states, residents of New Mexico drive more than residents of the other repeal states, and there is a greater fraction of traffic fatalities involving alcohol in New Mexico than in the other repeal states.","Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Stehr, MF (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Dept Econ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Stehr, Mark/G-5871-2013",,,,,,18,16,18,0,11,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

According to our inference, the market dynamically adjusts the bid/ask at any moment to generate enough price improvement return in order to cover the adverse selection risk and the nonexecution risk faced by the liquidity providers of both side. We find that the asset volatility is the key determinant of the adverse selection risk and the nonexecution risk, and thereby the bid-ask spread is positively associated with the asset volatility.

The paper introduces a new Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) method. In order to illustrate the described ARAS method a real case study of evaluation of microclimate in office rooms is presented. The case study aims to determine the inside climate of the premises, where people work, and to define measures to be taken to improve their environment. Based on the analysis, the following criteria for inside climate evaluation are suggested: air turnover inside the premises, air humidity, air temperature, illumination intensity, air flow rate, and dew point. The criteria weights were determined by the method of pairwise comparison based on the estimates of experts.","[Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Turskis, Zenonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; zenonas.turskis@vgtu.lt,"Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021; Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,67,461,467,3,50,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

For example, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 require all working procedures to be traceable and auditable. To meet satisfactory requirements, each management system demands a lot of documentation, written procedures, checking, control forms and other paper work It has been proved that it is a challenge to handle three separate management systems to ensure their alignments with the organization's strategy. An Integrated Management System (IMS) has thus been advocated. This paper explores empirically motivations and benefits obtained in implementing an integrated management system (IMS) for enterprises. The aim of this paper is to understand challenges and critical issues involved in implementing IMS. In this study, questionnaire survey and interview discussions are conducted in China. Technique of power spectrum is used to analyze the experience of the firms in operating the IMS. It is revealed that the main motivations for implementing IMS are: to satisfy customers' requirements, to respond to government's appeal and to cope with stress from competitors. The noticeable benefits obtained are: to simplify certification process, decrease management costs and decrease paper work From an empirical perspective, the study provides a better understanding for enterprises in implementing IMS.","[Zeng, Sal X.] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Sch Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Tam, Vivian W.

There are scientists and schools, mainly representatives of liberal and neo-liberal approach, who advocate free economic run and implicitly free flow of capital. This point of view was on its highest in the middle of the twentieth century and proved to be proved to be dangerous and crisis-enhancing in the first decade of the twenty-first century. On the other hand, there are scientists and schools, representatives of Keynesian school, who provide more critical and more realistic approach (Blackamn, A., Wu, X., Razin, A., Sadka, E., Hausmann, R., Xan X. Vo and others). Pro-FDI scientists and policy makers have a number of arguments when praising foreign direct investment. They argue that incoming foreign capital ensures economic efficiency firstly, via new jobs created, secondly, via enabled technology transfer; thirdly, via encouraged competition in domestic markets; fourthly, via human capital development as foreigners engage (more) in employee training. One more argument is often used in favour of foreign direct investment, namely that FDI has an advantage over other investment forms (portfolio or loans) as it proved to be more resilient in times of economic crisis. On an empirical level, there is a body of evidence that suggests possible positive correlation between FDI and economic growth in developing countries. Yet, while much evidence indicates a one-way causality between FDI and growth, there are many indications that the causality may run both ways. Benefits brought by some foreign investment in one country it does not necessary mean that the same will happen in another one. Methods that gave some positive effects in North Africa might prove as unsuitable when investing in Eastern Europe. Increased competition may be beneficial for the host economy, or it may not. International corporations may push out national businesses if they are yet not able to compete. In that case many jobs might be lost instead of creating. Foreign flow of capital might spread good practices of corporate governance, accounting rules, and legal traditions, and it may also not. Incoming FDI can limit ability of local government to implement bad policies but it might also result in encouraging host government to implement bad policies and so to spread bad practices instead. According to the dependency school, in the long-run, FDI tends to impede economic growth and development of recipient economies. The evidence appears that FDI is favourable to economic welfare only if appropriate conditions exist in the host economy. This includes such factors as adequate absorptive capacity and human capital, a capacity of domestic businesses to face and hold out foreign competition, a capacity of local government to make rational and transparent decisions, abundance of projects and market gaps that cannot to be filled up by home producers etc. Thus it seems convenient to look deeper into the world practice by measuring the effects of FDI.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Zilinske, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.zilinske@ktu.lt,,,,,,,35,14,14,2,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This additional feature results in an endogenous interest-rate spread and affects equilibrium allocations and inflation by altering the Ramsey planner's sequence of implementability and sticky-price constraints. Qualitatively, the trade-off confronting a planner in sticky-price models shown in recent literature, between using inflation surprise and labor-income tax, is eliminated by the liquid bond channel. We find that the more sticky prices become, the more the optimal fiscal-monetary policy stabilizes prices and also creates less distortionary and less volatile income taxes by taxing the liquidity service of bonds. Quantitatively, we show that the additional tax instrument created by the bond liquidity channel can yield a sizable welfare gain from an economy without this channel. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In estimating productivity, we control for a Possible simultaneity bias by using semi-parametric estimation techniques. We find that Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (HMT) invested fit ins generate negative horizontal spillovers, while Non-HMT foreign invested firms (mostly from OECD countries) tend to bring positive horizontal spillovers in China. These two opposing horizontal effects seem to cancel out at the aggregate level. We also find strong and robust vertical spillover effects oil both state-owned firms and non-state firms. However, vertical spillover effects from export-oriented FDI are weaker than those from domestic-market-oriented FDI. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In Japan, the growth rate of the labour force has been much less important than its quality improvement-i.e. labour saving technical change-while in the USA, the growth rates of labour and population have contributed more than their quality improvement.

This beneficial effect of unemployment insurance on employment stability is pronounced in countries with relatively generous benefit systems, and for recipients who have remained unemployed for at least six months.

It finds reasons to suggest that the 'region' is of less importance, but argues that the use of the term 'spatial' does not reflect dissatisfaction with regional economics, but rather it signals the reinvigoration of the subject from its formal connection to mainstream economics. This is primarily in the form of the new economic geography model, although limitations with this have led to an unsatisfactory form of regional policy that is based on growth theory.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 3PA, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Wren, C (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Sch Business, 5th Floor,Ridley Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 3PA, Tyne & Wear, England.",c.m.wren@ncl.ac.uk,,"Wren, Colin/0000-0001-5117-9379",ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,5,5,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

This paper revisits the efficiency issue in an otherwise standard one-sector growth model where consumption externalities affect a utility via their effects on the time preference. We find that even if preferences are homothetic, the externality changes the marginal rate of substitution between now and future and leads to a disparity in the intertemporal elasticity of substitution between the centrally planned economy and a decentralized economy. As a result, a competitive equilibrium is inefficient in transition dynamics. We characterize an optimal tax/subsidy structure that enables the allocation in a decentralized economy to replicate the social optimum. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

High-quality vertical IIT (VIIT) was the highest of Korea's HT indices in China and increased faster than horizontal IIT and low-quality VIIT, implying that Korea's product quality in its trade with China has improved over time. Low-quality VIIT is the highest of Korea's HT indices in the USA. The IIT index of processing/assembly goods is higher than are those of primary materials and consumer goods for Korea's trade with both countries. The regression results show that Korea's foreign direct investment (FDI) in China has increased high-quality VIIT, whereas Korea's M in the USA has decreased high-quality VIIT In addition, US FDI in Korea has increased low quality VIIT The relation of Korea's FDI in China and high-quality VIIT appears complementary. However, Korea's FDI in the USA and high-quality VIIT appear to be a substitute rather than a complement. In Korea's HT with both countries, the greater the difference in income between the two countries is, the larger is Korea's IIT.","[Joo, Kyeongwon] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Kwangju, South Korea; [Kwon, Taek Ho] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Kwangju, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Chungnam National University,"Joo, K (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Kwangju, South Korea.",thk5556@cnu.ac.kr; kewjoo@hanmail.net,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

South extracts the resource using raw labor, in the process generating local pollution. We study optimal regional policies in the presence of local pollution and technology spillovers from North to South under both non-cooperative and cooperative modes of trade. Non-cooperative trade is inefficient due to stock externalities. Cooperative trade policies are efficient and yet do not benefit North.

A few articles indicate that there should be no differentiation of environmental policies between sectors in the economy if the government uses indirect instruments such as emission taxes. However, we show that discrimination of emission taxes may occur in an economy that imposes foreign investment quotas. In particular, the possibility that ecological dumping occurs is higher if export goods are more labor intensive than import goods (as in developing countries). Moreover, in the case where import goods are the most capital intensive, both emission tax rates may be lower than the marginal environmental damage, and ecological dumping may occur.

For most countries, lower prices heighten global competition but also allow importing a cheaper and wider set of inputs and consumer goods. This paper investigates the balance of these two forces in Kenya, Mauritius and the Southern Africa Customs Union, the largest exporters of manufactured goods in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper uses the economic geography model of Redding and Venables (in Economic geography and international inequality, Journal of International Economics, 62, 53-22, 2004) to decompose the import growth of a large number of countries into supply and demand capacities. This decomposition allows for analysis of the extent to which China's export growth has altered manufacturing import and export prices for the selected countries. The study finds that China has significantly decreased world prices in major markets for manufactures, especially textiles, wearing apparel and footwear, potentially displacing the clothing exports of the selected African countries. As a consequence of China's export growth, these focus countries have also seen substantial reductions in their import prices across all manufacturing sectors. However, an estimation of their terms-of-trade suggests that the reductions in export prices outweigh the decrease in import prices and the countries are deemed to lose from China's manufactures export expansion.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Villoria, NB (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, 403 W State St,Room 645, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",nvillori@purdue.edu,,"Villoria, Nelson/0000-0003-1929-0725",,,,,39,11,11,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This matters because Robbins' attitudes are echoed in modern economics, best exemplified by the calibration methodology of Kydland and Prescott, which is vulnerable to similar criticisms.","[Backhouse, Roger E.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Backhouse, Roger E.] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Durlauf, Steven N.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",University of Birmingham; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Backhouse, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,"DURLAUF, Steven/H-4965-2016",,,,,,56,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2009,76.0,,,1,SI,,873,890,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00805.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,508CX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270906300007,0

Before production can take place, bargains have to be struck with each patent holder over the royalty per unit produced. In the negotiations, a patent holder must be mindful of the fact that a large royalty will increase the product price and lower demand for the final product. Hence each patent holder would prefer to gain a large royalty at the expense of rivals. When the producer makes the first offer in an alternating offer framework, we analyze whether it should conduct negotiations sequentially with some grouping of patent holders or simultaneously. We demonstrate that the producer will prefer simultaneous negotiation. An individual patent holder would prefer to negotiate early with the producer, and then to see remaining rights holders negotiate simultaneously. A firm that holds several patents would want to negotiate royalties on each one sequentially and then have simultaneous negotiation of payments to other rights holders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a model in which national university systems and their respective national firms and industries are considered as co-evolving. National firms compete on a worldwide level and they rely on the progress of science and the availability of scientists to innovate. As the global industry develops, firms try to mold their national university systems. but they achieve different degrees of success. Apart from highlighting the role of institutional responsiveness as a source of competitive advantage, our model points to the access to essential inputs for production, the technological and strategic characteristics of firms, the international diffusion of knowledge, and the initial distribution of market demand as key sources of leadership and industry growth. The international mobility of scientists seems to foster the emergence of industrial leadership shifts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies emphasise the importance of anger and its role in motivating individuals to punish free riders. However, we find that anger also triggers retaliatory behaviour by the punished individuals. This makes the enforcement of a cooperative norm more costly. We show that in addition to anger, 'social' emotions like guilt need to be present for punishment to be an effective deterrent of uncooperative actions. They play a key role by subduing the desire of punished individuals to retaliate and by motivating them to behave more cooperatively in the future.","[Hopfensitz, Astrid] Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Reuben, Ernesto] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Northwestern University,"Hopfensitz, A (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France.",,"Reuben, Ernesto/E-1939-2013; Hopfensitz, Astrid/C-1236-2014","Reuben, Ernesto/0000-0001-9425-4607; Hopfensitz, Astrid/0000-0002-6503-6114",,,,,64,121,137,2,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The apparent reluctance of mobile network operators to lower roaming tariff is generating many antitrust concerns. This paper presents in a two-country two-firm framework the functioning of the current system governing wholesale international roaming agreements based on interoperator tariffs. The focus is on the role of traffic management; thanks to the emergence of traffic direction techniques, mobile network operators are allowed to select the roaming partner. We show that, unless these techniques do not allow for perfect control on traffic flows, traffic management does not improve the market's efficiency. In line with the regulatory mechanism recently adopted by the European Commission, we show that a simple price cap mechanism may restore partial efficiency in the wholesale market. We also show that although cross-border cooperation at the wholesale level is Pareto efficient, it will not emerge as an equilibrium of a two-sided matching game.","[Manenti, Fabio M.] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ M Fanno, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Lupi, Paolo] Autorita Garanzie Nelle Comunicaz, Direz Anal Mercati Assetti & Concorrenza, Naples, Italy",University of Padua,"Manenti, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ M Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",fabio.manenti@unipd.it,"Manenti, Fabio Maria/ABE-8936-2020","Manenti, Fabio Maria/0000-0003-2671-0900",,,,,19,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

On the one hand, there is an incentive to increase debt and delay taxation, so as to reduce current distortions. On the other hand, inflating current prices lowers the real value of nominal debt and so there is a motive to reduce it now. The size of long-run debt will depend on the interaction of these two opposing incentives. The critical determinant is the willingness of households to substitute away from goods being taxed by inflation. Numerical simulations show that the model matches some qualitative and quantitative properties of U. S. policy variables, including the fact that wars are frequently financed with a mix of instruments. The theory interprets the unusual post-World War II inflation and fast liquidation of accumulated debt as being due to higher long-run debt and expenditure in the period leading up to the war.

Technological change is especially affected by changes in relative input prices and their level, of which the price of labor is particularly important. Input prices are affected by institutional variables. Such prices also impact on the firm's efficiency, which in turn affects growth rates as well as the rate of technical change. As relative factor prices or their level increase, firms are induced to innovate or adopt extant technology to remain competitive or to maintain current profit rates. High wage firms can be expected to engage in such induced technological change, leading the growth process thereby yielding lower unit costs and increasing the level of material welfare. Relatively low wage economies can be locked into a state of economic inefficiency and laggard technological progress, especially in the long run.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Altman, M (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.",morris.altman@vuw.ac.nz,"Altman, Morris/H-2338-2016","Altman, Morris/0000-0002-6779-6547",,,,,120,12,14,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Top income shares are highest in the 1930s, fall sharply during the first decade of the Franco dictatorship, then remain stable and low till the 1980s, and have increased since the mid 1990s. The top 0.01% income share in Spain estimated from income tax data is comparable to estimates for the United States and France over the period 1933-1971. Those findings, along with a careful analysis of all published tax statistics, suggest that income tax evasion and avoidance among top income earners in Spain was much less prevalent than previously thought. Wealth concentration has been about stable from 1982 to 2005 as surging real estate prices have benefited the middle class and compensated for a slight increase in financial wealth concentration in the 1990s. We use our wealth series and a simple model to analyze the effects of the wealth tax exemption of stocks for owners-managers introduced in 1994. We show that the reform induced substantial shifting from the taxable to tax exempt status, hence creating efficiency costs.

This paper addresses the issue in the context of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. We analyze whether the slow convergence in per capita incomes between East and West Germany and the lower international openness of East Germany are linked. We address the endogeneity of openness by adapting the methodology proposed by Frankel and Romer (1999) to a panel framework. We instrument openness with time-invariant exogenous geographic variables and time-varying exogenous policy variables. We also distinguish the impact of different channels of integration. Our paper has three main findings. First, geographic variables have a significant impact on regional openness. Second, controlling for geography, East German states are less integrated into international markets along all dimensions of integration considered. Third, the degree of openness for trade has a positive impact on regional income per capita. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

One rationale for this preference for flexibility is individuals' incentive to postpone the final choice in order to better learn their underlying preferences over basic alternatives. In this paper we show that even in the absence of learning, preference for flexibility arises if individuals are risk-averse or, at least, are not very risk-seeking. Thus, individual's attitude towards risk provides yet another rationale for preference for flexibility. One of our results is that in the absence of learning, risk-neutral as well as risk-averse individuals display the same, maximal preference for flexibility.","[Karamychev, Vladimir A.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Erasmus Sch Econ & Business Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ficco, Stefano] Europe Econ, London WC2A 1QU, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Karamychev, VA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Erasmus Sch Econ & Business Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Ficcos@europe-economics.com; Karamychev@FEW.EUR.NL,,"Karamychev, Vladimir/0000-0001-9123-3894",,,,,13,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Recent research introduced a promising mechanism, the probabilistic serial that has superior efficiency properties than the most common real-life mechanism random priority. On the other hand, mechanisms based on Gale's celebrated top trading cycles method have long dominated the indivisible goods literature (with the exception of the present context) thanks to their outstanding efficiency features. We present an equivalence result between the three kinds of mechanisms, that may help better understand why efficiency differences among popular mechanisms might arise in random environments. This result also suggests that the probabilistic serial and the random priority mechanisms can be viewed as two top trading cycles based mechanisms that essentially differ in the initial conditions of the market before trading starts.

Wealth inequality, after rising steeply at the beginning of the 1990s, leveled off during the second part of the period in question.

In an example we show that if the incumbent is challenged more often, then the equilibrium type of the incumbent is higher on average.

Under commitment the policymaker adjusts the nominal rate with lagged output to impact public expectations. Within this class of rules, 1 provide a condition for nonexplosive and determinate solutions. Expectational stability obtains for any nonnegative response to lagged output. Simulation results show that modified commitment is best under least-squares learning. However, in the presence of parameter uncertainty and/or measurement error in the policymaker's data on public expectations, the best policy is one of partial commitment, where the response to lagged output is less than under modified commitment.

For better estimation of the impact of events on crude oil price volatility, this study attempts to use an EMD-based event analysis approach for this task. In the proposed method, the time series to be analyzed is first decomposed into several intrinsic modes with different time scales from fine-to-coarse and an average trend. The decomposed modes respectively capture the fluctuations caused by the extreme event or other factors during the analyzed period. It is found that the total impact of an extreme event is included in only one or several dominant modes, but the secondary modes provide valuable information on subsequent factors. For overlapping events with influences lasting for different periods, their impacts are separated and located in different modes. For illustration and verification purposes, two extreme events, the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2003, are analyzed step by step. The empirical results reveal that the EMD-based event analysis method provides a feasible solution to estimating the impact of extreme events on crude oil prices variation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Quite surprisingly, the existing literature fails to consider the relationship between intrinsic motivations and social capital formation. The present paper increases the understanding on the effect of intrinsic motivations by studying the role that different motivations to volunteer have on the creation of volunteers' social capital which is intended as networks of cooperative relations. Our empirical analysis considers three indices of social capital, aimed at measuring both the quantitative (number) and the qualitative (degree of familiarity and cooperation) character of social relations, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to volunteer (ideal motivations, the desire to feel useful to others, the pursuit of social recognition and the desire to increase the number of acquaintances or friends). We find that the creation of social capital through participation in voluntary associations is not indifferent to the motivations which induced the volunteer to start his/her unpaid activity. In particular, we show that intrinsic motivations enable people to extend their social networks by creating relations characterized by a significant degree of familiarity. By contrast, extrinsic motivations, and in particular the decision to join an association in order to increase the number of acquaintances or friends, promote the creation of networks from a quantitative point of view, but they do not facilitate the creation of relations based on a particular degree of confidence.",,,,giacomo.degliantoni@unimib.it,"Degli Antoni, Giacomo/GPC-8295-2022","Degli Antoni, Giacomo/0000-0001-9736-2400",,,,,30,64,86,0,65,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2009,62.0,3,,,,,359,370,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00440.x,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,469GJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267883700002,0

If local capture is pervasive, however, central mandates may not be effective. Despite the popularity of this combination of decentralization and centralized control, there is little empirical evidence which separately identifies their effect on investment in public goods, and hence assesses the effectiveness of central mandates. This paper provides such evidence, using data collected by the authors for the North Indian state of Punjab, an economy where economic conditions facilitate such an analysis.

The findings indicate that, in the long run, German aid is associated with an increase in exports of goods that is larger than the aid flow, with a point estimate of 140% of the aid given. In addition, the evolution of the estimated coefficients over time shows an effect that is consistently positive but that oscillates over time. Interestingly, after a decrease in the 1990s, the estimated coefficients of the effect of aid on trade show a steady increase in the period between 2001 and 2005. The paper distinguishes among recipient countries and finds that the return on aid measured by German exports is higher for aid to countries considered 'strategic aid recipients' by the German government.

Within the literature adopting this approach, however, there are two potentially important issues that so far have not been given the attention they might deserve. A first issue concerns the procedure by which the discrete alternatives are selected to enter the choice set. Most authors choose (not probabilistically) a set of fixed points identical for every individual. Some authors adopt instead a sampling procedure and also assume that the choice set may differ across households. A second issue concerns the availability of the alternatives. Most authors assume all the values of hours of work within some range are equally available. At the other extreme, some authors assume only two or three alternatives (for example, nonparticipation, part-time and full-time) are available for everyone. Some studies account instead for the fact that not all the hour opportunities are equally available to everyone specifying a probability density function of opportunities for each individual. In this paper we explore by simulation the implications of (i) the procedure used to build the choice set (fixed alternatives versus sampled alternatives); (ii) accounting or not accounting for a different availability of alternatives. The results of the evaluation performed in this paper show that the way the choice set is represented has little impact on the fitting of observed values, but a more significant and important impact on the out-of-sample prediction performance. Thus, the treatment of the choice sets might have a crucial effect on the result of policy evaluations.","[Colombino, U.] Univ Turin, Dept Econ, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,,,"Colombino, Ugo/E-9866-2013","Colombino, Ugo/0000-0002-0194-2943",,,,,27,12,14,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

These principles remain timely because the fundamental causes of the instability of the international monetary system are as valid today as they were in the early forties. The new supranational money would be created against domestic earning assets of the Fed and the ECB and its quantity would be demand-driven. Our proposal is not an agreement on exchange rates, which while possible is not essential to the functioning of the SBM. NICU would not hold open positions in assets denominated in national currency and consequently would not bear exchange rate risk. NICU would be more than an office recording credit and debit entries of the supranational bank money.

We explore various treatments to provide insight into the conditions that foster the growth of specialisation and exchange within this weak institutional framework.","[Crockett, Sean] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA; Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Crockett, S (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA.",,,"Wilson, Bart/0000-0001-5770-0102",,,,,18,34,38,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

There are signs that some 'old' theories and insights will have a comeback. This paper argues that among them economists should not forget the lessons that have been learnt from three decades of several financial crises in developing countries. We emphasise two important lessons. First, preventing crises in developing countries requires not only the regulation of domestic financial systems, but also a consistent set of macroeconomic policies. In particular we stress the need for consistency between the exchange rate rule, the capital account regime and the domestic financial market regulations. Second, financial crises in developing countries tend to worsen both the balance of payments and the fiscal balance. Traditional adjustment policies tend to exacerbate the recessive trends in output and employment. This is just the opposite of what is required and what governments in developed countries are able to do. Developing countries should push for an agenda that helps them deal with these problems.","[Frenkel, Roberto; Rapetti, Martin] Ctr Estudios Estado & Sociedad CEDES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Frenkel, Roberto] Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rapetti, Martin] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Buenos Aires; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Frenkel, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Estudios Estado & Sociedad CEDES, Sanchez de Bustamante 27,C1173AAA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",frenkel@cedes.org,,,,,,,27,40,46,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

THE ROLE OF INTERINDUSTRY LINKAGES IN US MANUFACTURING,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MACROECONOMY RELATIONSHIP; OIL; SHOCKS; INDUSTRY; MODELS,"There is considerable empirical evidence that energy prices had a large effect on the U.S. economy between World War II and the 1980s. This paper argues that linkages between manufacturing industries amplify the effect of an energy price shock and help explain the large effect. In particular, energy-intensive industries are important input suppliers to other industries. When the price of energy increases, energy-intensive industries contract, raising materials prices for other industries. Because of the reduction in materials supply, the downstream industries also contract, which I refer to as the supply effect. Using data from the Census of Manufactures, I find that the supply effect accounted for about one half of the sensitivity of value added to the price of energy. I use plant-level census data to show that the supply effect caused similar changes in value added per plant as in value added per industry. A price increase caused a small, although statistically significant, decrease in entry and had no effect on exit. Finally, the supply effect reduced plant-level labor demand.

His argument relies on the arbitrary assumption that when the future rate of return of capital (RRC) is uncertain, one should invest in any project with a positive expected net present value. We examine an economy with a risk-averse representative agent facing an uncertain evolution of the RRC. In this context, we characterize the socially efficient stochastic consumption path, which allows us in turn to use the Ramsey rule to characterize the term structure of socially efficient discount rates. We show that Weitzman's claim is qualitatively correct if shocks on the RRC are persistent. On the contrary, in the absence of any serial correlation in the RRC, the term structure of discount rates should be flat.","Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA & IDEI, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gollier, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA & IDEI, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",gollier@cict.fr,"Gollier, Christian/G-4476-2012",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 9,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200925,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208143600002,0

The auctioned 700 MHz spectrum bands represented a large part of the US's digital dividend, which was created by transitioning to more efficient digital television broadcasts. The FCC set out to accomplish many laudable goals with the 700 MHz auction such as promoting new entry and rural deployments in wireless broadband, creating a band of commercial spectrum with requirements for open access, and creating a nationwide interoperable public safety network. Unfortunately, poor 700 MHz band license configurations and auction rules for their assignment prevented the FCC from meeting most of its goals. The two largest national wireless incumbents won most of the licensed frequencies so there will be no new national entrants, rural build-out is unlikely to be promoted, and the spectrum band set aside to aid the development of a public-private partnership for public safety is still unassigned. Furthermore, the large variation in prices within the auction does not support the notion that the auction assigned licenses efficiently. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we exploit information on product specific technical assistance for trade and estimate a simple partial equilibrium model to assess the impact on the key measurable outcome - exports of the product subject to assistance. We apply a difference in differences approach to isolate the impact of the policy interventions and draw four main conclusions: on average, export development (ED) programs have coincided with or predated stronger export performance; such programs appear to be more effective where there is already significant export activity; there is some concern about the additionality of the programs and that support may be being channeled to sectors that would have prospered anyway; ultimately, conclusions strongly depend on what one postulates would have happened in the absence of the policy intervention, so the definition of a credible counterfactual is of utmost importance for the evaluation of technical assistance for exports.","[Brenton, Paul; von Uexkull, Erik] World Bank, Int Trade Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Brenton, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, Int Trade Dept, MSN MC2-201,1818 H St St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",pbrenton@worldbank.org,,,,,,,13,25,26,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

First, the estimated marginal propensity to consume (MPC) for unanticipated transitory income shocks is Often much higher than what the theory warrants. Second, the estimated MPC is typically much bigger for small shocks of this type than for large shocks. Third, consumption is often smoothed against large anticipated future income changes but not always against small changes. This paper argues that these findings can be reconciled within a RE-PIH model that includes a cash-in-advance constraint and an assumption that the agent is required to pay a fixed transaction cost to transfer wealth between cash and assets. Key results of the paper include first, the agent follows an s-S rule with respect to cash holdings when lie makes wealth-transfer decisions; second, the MPC within the no-transfer band is higher than that out of the band, and can be as high as exactly equal to one: and third, the agent smoothes consumption in response to news of large future income changes but not necessarily to small ones.

This is a puzzling development for two reasons: first, during the early phase of the transition process Hungary was ahead of Slovakia, and second, the high level of political polarisation and general public disillusionment are shared characteristics of the two countries and not conducive to reforms in either case. In order to address these contradictions a theoretical framework is developed examining the conditions of structural reforms in a low-trust environment, where promises about long-term benefits for short-term costs are not believed. After the identification of three potential factors - perception of crisis, emergence of credible reformers, elite consensus - that can help to overcome the gap in credibility, the theoretical framework is applied to the transition history of the two countries. It is shown that while in the past decade all three factors had been present in Slovakia, the former success of Hungary strongly contributed to the absence of such special circumstances.

Using the asymmetric correlation test of Hong et al. (2007), we examine five major currencies against the yen and thirty-three Japanese sectoral stock returns. Significant asymmetric responses in stock returns to exchange rate changes are found in the pharmaceutical, real estate, and air transportation industries. These findings are consistent with the pricing-to-market and hysteretic behavior for the pharmaceutical and air transportation industries and with the hedging behavior for the real estate industry.

Using data on 521 Chinese SIPs during 1994-2005, this paper investigates the firm and stock market characteristics that determine the fraction of shares sold to the general public and the degree of underpricing at SIP. We find that in the early stages of SIP, highly leveraged and heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises issue more new shares. Variables capturing the firm's financing needs from investment opportunities positively affect public share allocation, whereas internal cash generation has a negative impact, but only in later years. The determinants of underpricing further illustrate the uniqueness of SIPs compared with private-firm IPOs in developed countries. Overall, there is little evidence that uncertainty over the value of firm assets influences first-day abnormal returns. In contrast, variables measuring government commitment to privatization significantly affect underpricing. Finally, we document that public share allocation and underpricing are jointly determined, especially in more recent years, after the quota system was abolished and lower-quality firms were privatized.

Financial frictions substantially amplify the impact of shocks, and also reinforce the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of interest rate rules on output. However, these effects are reversed relative to new Keynesian models: under limited participation. interest rate rules are stabilizing for productivity shocks, but imply an output-inflation tradeoff for demand shocks. Moreover, because financial frictions imply excessive fluctuation, stabilization via an interest rate rule can be a welfare-improving response to productivity shocks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings are consistent with the view that both in Germany and in the United States, technological change is responsible for the widening of the wage distribution at the top. At the bottom of the wage distribution, the increase in inequality is better explained by episodic events, such as supply shocks and changes in labor market institutions.

In fact, its paradigmatic situation is the judge who must evaluate testimonies, rather than the gambler who must evaluates odds. Unlike a gambler, who faces a definite set of possibilities, a judge maybe forced to change her evaluation because of novel possibilities suggested by unexpected testimonies. In this sense, Evidence Theory provides a formalization of some among Shackles intuitions. While the details of the connections between Shackle's theory and Evidence Theory have been explored elsewhere, this article is devoted to a detailed explanation of the working of Evidence Theory.

Flexibility at the margin produces a gap in separation costs between temporary and permanent workers which causes fixed-term contracts to be the main workforce adjustment device. It also leads to a productivity gap, due to high turnover and lack of on-the-job training of temporary employees. To explain the high volatility of the Spanish labour market we develop a matching model with temporary and permanent employees where these gaps play a central role. This model is calibrated and simulated to match the stylised facts and assess the cyclical implications of the 1984 and 1997 labour market reforms.","[Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Silva, Jose I.] Univ Jaume I Castello, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat Jaume I,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017; Silva, José I I/G-3365-2015","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790;",,,,,44,12,12,0,10,FUNDACION SEPI,MADRID,"QUINTANA 2, 3A PLANTA, MADRID, 28008, SPAIN",0210-1521,1575-4367,,INVEST ECON-SPAIN,Investig.

At the same time technological innovation, especially in the domain of ICT, has also experienced a rapid diffusion. Several works have tried to disentangle the linkage between innovation and its determinants as well as to uncover the relation between techno-organizational changes and firm economic performances. I likewise conduct an empirical investigation using original information collected through a questionnaire administered to union representatives of manufacturing firms with at least 20 employees located in a province of Northern Italy, Reggio Emilia. The phases of the analysis are two: at first, the aim is to uncover the relationship between a participative industrial relations regime, contractual flexibility and the propensity to innovate; secondly, I investigate on the existence of linkages between several innovation activities, namely technology, organization, ICT and training, on the one hand, and firm economic performance, on the other. The results can be summed up as follows. First, the participative aspects of the industrial relations system and contractual flexibility show a nexus mainly with two kinds of innovative spheres: organization and training. Second, firm performance is linked to all four innovation spheres. Since the regressions are also conducted in principal components, evidence of complementarities between innovation spheres is provided.","Univ Ferrara, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ, Ist Territorio, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Antonioli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ, Ist Territorio, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",ntndvd@unife.it,,,,,,,86,16,16,0,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We show that the policy instruments that are used to calculate the marginal labor income tax rate for each ability-type give rise to intertemporal tax base effects.

Our survey classifies the large number of papers on the subject according to the welfare measure they use: inequality (on wages and household income) or poverty. Our survey shows that a sound methodological approach evaluating the welfare effects of trade liberalization should take into account: the degree of tariff to price transmission, all income sources (not only wages), employment effects, gender and regional heterogeneity of trade's impact, and second-order as well as general equilibrium effects. Two methodologies represent the latest efforts in this direction. (1) Income generation models with an explicit relationship between changes in tariff and changes in household real income (Porto, 2007), this methodology is capable of testing the different transmission channels linking trade policy and inequality and poverty. (2) The Macro-Micro approach (Bourguingon et al, 2008) which combines a CGE with a micro-simulation model evaluates the welfare effects of trade policy taking into account general equilibrium effects. These two approaches can be combined to get the short- and long-term welfare effects of trade policy, respectively.","[de Hoyos, Rafael] Secretaria Educ Publ Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lustig, Nora] El Colegio Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"de Hoyos, R (通讯作者)，Secretaria Educ Publ Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rdehoyos@sems.gob.mx; nlustig@gwu.edu,,,,,,,108,0,0,0,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Specifically, the generosity of public sector pensions which induces civil servants to retire 5 years prematurely (at age 55 rather than at age 60) is often associated with decreases in steady state output (GDP) of almost 3% and welfare losses in the private sector of more than 3% of consumption.

First, we show that the effect of oil demand and supply shocks on the merchandise trade balance and the current account, which depending on the source of the shock can be large, depends critically on the response of the non-oil trade balance. Our results provide evidence of an intermediate degree of international financial integration. Second, we document the presence of large and systematic valuation effects in response to these shocks.

The empirical analyses, based on cross-sectional and panel data from the Level of living surveys 1974-2000, are guided by two main hypotheses: (a) that educational mismatch reflects human capital compensation rather than real mismatch, and (b) that educational mismatch is real but dissolves with time spent in the labour market, so that its impact on wages tends toward zero over a typical worker's career. Our findings do not support these hypotheses. First, significant differences in contemporaneous economic returns to education across match categories remain even after variations in ability are taken into account. Second, we find no evidence that the rate of wage growth is higher among overeducated workers than others. Our conclusion is that the overeducated are penalized early on by an inferior rate of return to schooling from which they do not recover. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Prescription drug insurance escapes that trade-off and achieves an elusive goal: lowering static deadweight loss, without reducing incentives for innovation. As a result of this feature, the public provision of drug insurance can be welfare-improving, even for risk-neutral and purely self-interested consumers. The design of insurers' cost-sharing schedules can either reinforce or mitigate this result. Schedules that impose higher consumer cost-sharing requirements on more expensive drugs help ensure that insurance subsidies translate into higher utilization, rather than pure increases in manufacturer profits. Moreover, some degree of price-negotiation with manufacturers is likely to be welfare improving, but the optimal degree depends on the size of such transactions costs, as well as the social cost of weakening innovation incentives by lowering innovator profits. These results have practical implications for the evaluation of public drug insurance programs like the US Medicaid and Medicare Part D programs, along with European insurance schemes.

This paper studies the factors contributing to the gender gap in early-career wage growth. The analysis shows that the size of the gender gap in average wage growth varies with mobility status, the gap being higher with employer changes compared to wage growth within firms. Several explanations for the gender gap in wage growth based on human capital theory and theory of compensating wage differentials are considered. However, much of the gap in wage growth remains unexplained. The distributional analysis of the wage growth shows that the female wage penalty increases significantly as we move along the conditional wage growth distribution, the increase being stronger with employer changes compared to within-firm wage growth.

Trade restrictions are one means for doing so, but trade restrictions pose new problems, particularly if they are applied to enforce economy-wide emission limitation agreements.

We explore firm level data on employment, capital, and output, city level data on economic characteristics and new administrative data measuring enforcement of regulation at the city level. Since enforcement may be endogenous, we instrument this variable with the distance between the city where the firm is located and surrounding enforcement offices, while controlling for a rich set of city characteristics (such as past levels of informality in the city). We present suggestive evidence of the validity of this instrument. We find that stricter enforcement of labor regulation constrains firm size, and leads to higher unemployment.

Education breeds skepticism; higher levels of education were associated with more negative perceptions of economic conditions and reform efforts. Other demographic markers such as gender or provincial origin are not robustly correlated with attitudes. Instead, personal experiences appear to be central: a significant number of the respondents were unaware of the humanitarian aid program and the ones who knew of it almost universally did not believe that they were beneficiaries.

The multi-utilities that operate in different sectors are characterized by a strong unobserved heterogeneity. Therefore the measurement of their performance poses an important challenge for the regulators. The purpose of this paper is to study the potential advantages of recently developed panel data stochastic frontier models in the measurement of the level of efficiency for multi-utility companies. These models are estimated for a sample of 34 multi-output utilities operating from 1997 to 2005. The alternative models are compared regarding the cost function slopes and inefficiency estimates. For the inefficiency estimates, the correlation between different models and the effect of econometric specification have been analyzed. The results Suggest that the inefficiency estimates are substantially lower when the unobserved firm-specific effects are taken into account. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Social preferences have been shown to enhance contract enforcement in these markets, while at the same time generating considerable wage and price rigidity. Reputation powerfully amplifies the positive effects of social preferences on contract enforcement by increasing contract efficiency substantially. This effect is, however, associated with a considerable bilateralisation of market interactions, suggesting that it may aggravate price rigidities. Surprisingly, reputation in fact weakens the wage and price rigidities arising from social preferences. Thus, in markets characterised by moral hazard, reputational incentives unambiguously increase mutually beneficial exchanges, reduce rents, and render markets more responsive to supply and demand shocks.","[Fehr, Ernst] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zehnder, Christian] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Lausanne,"Fehr, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Zehnder, Christian/0000-0001-6199-4975",,,,,60,37,41,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

More centralized collective bargaining seems to increase female unemployment. The size of most effects appears to be substantial, particularly among young people.

What are the health consequences of 'keeping up with the Jones'? Many developed countries (e.g., US and Japan) have experienced significant income growth between 1950s and 2000s but population survey shows that on average the population is not growing more satisfied with life. Theories that attempt to respond to these findings hypothesize that as income grows, people may spend more on conspicuous consumption because they compare themselves with others in their peer groups and care about their position in socio-economic distributions relative to others. Indeed, public health studies have found a relationship between income inequality and adult health outcomes in developed countries. Specifically, there seems to be a correlation between social hierarchy and mortality, as well as a correlation between social hierarchy and morbidity. China is a prime study site due to its growing spatial inequalities in the past decade. Though China has been committed to economic reform, different regions and cities have encountered very disparate rates of development and growth. In this paper, we utilize a set of panel data collected in China (China Health and Nutrition Survey 1989-2004) to examine the effects of peer groups, relative deprivation, and income disparities on individual health outcomes such as the probability of high waist circumference, body mass index categories, probability of hypertension. nutritional intake as well as health behavior such as smoking. We use a combination of multi-level mixed effects modeling as well as factor analysis to examine these effects and find significant and differential effects of income quartiles, peer groups, relative deprivation, and Gini coefficient on health.

The unexpected electoral victory of Ahmadinejad, the populist candidate in the 2005 presidential election, has been widely attributed to rising poverty and inequity. Using household survey data, I examine the trends in poverty and inequality for the last three decades and show that this thesis is not grounded in facts. Survey data show that poverty has substantially declined in recent years, and is low by international standards and in comparison with pre-revolution years. This finding is consistent with pro-poor policies of the Islamic government, mainly in provision of basic infrastructure such as electricity, safe drinking water, and health. However, the same policies have not been as effective in reducing inequality, which, after an initial decline following the Revolution, has remained basically constant in the post-Revolution period.","Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Salehi-Isfahani, D (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",salehi@vt.edu,,,,,,,41,44,52,0,14,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation of the sequential schooling decision model reveals important dynamics of the gender difference in educational attainment, intrahousehold resource-allocation patterns, and transitory income and wealth effects. In the descriptive statistics as well as the econometric analyses, we find a high educational retention rate and observe that school progression rates between male and female students after secondary school are comparable. in particular, we find gender specific and schooling-stage-specific birth-order effects on education. Our overall findings are consistent with the implications of optimal schooling behavior under binding credit constraints and the self-selection of education-friendly households. Finally, we find serious supply-side constraints which might arise from a village-level lack of demand for primary schools for girls. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the variance decomposition analysis due to Pesaran and Shin [Pesaran M.H. and Shin, Y.

The results of our multivariate modified Granger causality analysis due to Toda and Yamamoto [Toda, H.Y. and Yamamoto, T.

In contrast, results of our variance decomposition analyses show that in eleven out of the seventeen countries, energy is no more than a contributing factor to output growth and not an important one when compared to capital and labor. Labor and capital are the most important factors in output growth in fifteen out of the seventeen countries. However, these results should be interpreted with care as they may not be sufficiently robust enough to support the inference that energy consumption plays a minor role in the economic growth of African countries.

This nonlinearity is explicitly modeled using a fairly general Markov switching error-correction model with satisfactory results.

In this paper, empirical results on strategic tax setting by cantonal governments are presented for a panel of the Swiss cantons from 1984 to 1999.

In the presence of regional or sectoral asset and liquidity shocks, interbank markets can distribute liquidity efficiently, but fail to respond efficiently to asset shocks. Broad banks can condition on the joint distribution of both shocks and hence, achieve an efficient internal allocation of capital. This allocation involves the cross-subsidization of loans across regions or sectors. compared to regional banks that are linked through well-functioning interbank markets, broad banks lead to higher levels of aggregate investment, higher output, and less fluctuations within regions. However, broad banks generate endogenously aggregate uncertainty. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find that unanticipated permanent changes in tax rates have only small effects on aggregate investment, since macroeconomic dynamics are dominated by mature firms for which dividend taxation is not distortionary. Anticipated or temporary dividend tax changes, on the other hand, create incentives for firms to engage in inter-temporal tax arbitrage so as to reduce investors' tax burden. For example, a temporary tax cut - the type most likely to be enacted by policymakers - induces firms to accelerate dividend payments while tax rates are low, which reduces their cash holdings and makes them capita I-constrained when large investment opportunities arise. This can significantly lower aggregate investment for periods after the tax cut. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We show that, for plausible parameter values, wage and price staggering are complementary in generating monetary persistence. We do so by proposing the new measure of quantitative inertia, after discussing weaknesses of the contract multiplier, a standard measure of monetary persistence. The existence of complementarities means that beyond understanding low wage and price staggering work in isolation, it is important. to investigate their interactions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the degree of monetary persistence generated by wage vis-a-vis price staggering depends on the relative competitiveness of the labor and product markets. We show that the conventional finding that wage staggering generates more persistence than price,staggering holds under homogeneous capital accumulation. Under firm-specific capital, wage staggering generates more persistence only when the labor market is sufficiently competitive relative to the product market.","[Merkl, Christian] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Merkl, Christian; Snower, Dennis] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Snower, Dennis] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, CEPR, CESIfo, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Ifo Institut,"Merkl, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Duesternbrooker Weg 120, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",christian.merkl@ifw-kiel.de,,"Merkl, Christian/0000-0001-5607-8286",,,,,41,3,3,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, the cointegrating vector is significantly different from [1, -1], thus raising doubts on the validity of the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis. Following Elliott (1998), we show that if the exchange rate and relative price series contain near-to-unit roots in the context of a bivariate system, then any inference on the cointegrating vector and consequently on PPP, which is based on standard cointegration estimation methods, will be misleading. We then argue that the existing evidence against the PPP hypothesis in the British pound-US dollar market can be attributed to the finite sample bias of the standard cointegration estimators, arising from an endogenous and nearly nonstationary regressor. We also show that when robust procedures are employed the evidence favors the PPP hypothesis.","[Pittis, Nikitas; Christou, Christina] Univ Pireus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Kalyvitis, Sarantis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece; [Hassapis, Christis] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Cyprus,"Pittis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pireus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Karaoli & Dimitriou 80, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",npittis@unipi.gr; christou@unipi.gr; skalyvitis@aueb.gr; christis@ucy.ac.cy,"Kalyvitis, Sarantis/AAI-4581-2021; Hassapis, Christis/S-1287-2017","Hassapis, Christis/0000-0002-7808-270X; Kalyvitis, Sarantis/0000-0002-7540-6019",,,,,40,1,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Moody and Marvell criticize that calculation for not extrapolating our trend estimates further, but since we had limited post-passage data for roughly half of our states, we were uncomfortable projecting crime trends far beyond our data. Our caution has now been validated, as the sharp crime declines of the 1990s disappeared after 2000. Moody and Marvell now repeat our state-specific regression-based calculation using county data through the year 2000 (but with a slightly altered specification), which finds that RTC laws have increased crime costs by $3 billion (in total) for 23 of the 24 jurisdictions they evaluated (Florida is the exception). Nonetheless, they conclude that RTC laws are generally beneficial because they claim that the Florida RTC laws (inexplicably) reduced crime costs by $31 billion. But the one paper to focus on the impact of Florida's RTC law - of which Marvell was a coauthor! - found that the law had no impact on crime. If Marvell's Florida paper is correct, then the Moody and Marvell findings are reconciled with Ayres and Donohue's Table 14 showing RTC laws increase crime costs (Ayres and Donohue 2003a). We also show that estimating aggregate (rather than state-specific) effects of RTC laws using the same data and same specification of Moody and Marvell provides statistically significant evidence of increases in aggravated assault, and no evidence of crime decreases. Similarly, Ayres and Donohue (2003b) showed that, after we corrected some coding errors in John Lott's data set used in Plassmann and Whitley (2003), their aggregated analysis on 1977-2000 county data also showed statistically significant evidence only of crime increases from RTC laws.","[Ayres, Ian; Donohue, John J., III] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Ayres, I (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,,,,,,,27,13,17,0,14,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

One variant, the double referendum mechanism, requires respondents to state twice how they would vote for a given policy proposal given their cost of the good. Data from these surveys often exhibit anomalies inconsistent with standard economic models of consumer preferences. There are a number of published explanations for these anomalies, mostly focusing on problems with the second vote. This article investigates which aspects of the hypothetical task affect the degree of nondemand revelation and takes an individual-based approach to identifying people most likely to non-demand reveal. A clear profile emerges from our model of a person who faces a negative surplus i.e. a net loss in the second vote and invokes non self-interested, non financial motivations during the decision process.","[Carson, Katherine S.] USAF Acad, Dept Econ & Geog, HQ USAFA DFEG, Colorado Springs, CO 80840 USA; Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hutchinson, W.

We distinguish those negotiations that take place previous to a potential conflict (peacekeeping), and negotiations inside the conflict (peacemaking). In these contexts, we study the role of a mediator who tries to achieve a certain balance between the efficiency of the agreement and the equality of the final sharing. We show that the credibility of the mediator comes from her willingness to impose delays in the negotiation, even if that implies costs. We also find how the player with a weak bargaining position in a conflict can strategically profit from the mediator's quest for equality. Finally, we show how the capacity of the mediator to induce a higher equality in the sharing is always higher in a peacemaking situation than in a peacekeeping one. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results present that both proposed models can earn excess returns over the buy-and-hold strategy and support that both can be used to trade. However, the univariate Markov-switching model, which only uses daily returns series does not successfully capture the trend in the stock market, especially during a bull market. This implies that high-frequency returns series contain lots of noises. In order to overcome this problem, the Markov-switching vector autoregression model that combines a leading indicator and returns is performed in this study. The results indicate a better trading pattern. We conclude that the leading indicator chosen from open interest in the future market increases useful information and reduces noises to improve model estimation, which can well identify the position of bull and bear markets.","[Chang, Tzu-Pu; Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Chang, TP (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",tzupuchang@yahoo.com,"Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935; Chang, Tzu-Pu/0000-0003-4040-5208",,,,,13,8,9,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

One common reason analysts refer to is individual's myopia in planning insurance well ahead of need. We attempt to test this by empirically eliciting the willingness to pay for a hypothetical long-term care insurance policy at two different periods of time namely: (a) current respondent time and (b) assuming the respondent is 40. We draw upon data from Spain where no insurance was available at the time of the study. We find that on average only one-fifth of the respondents find LTCI a suitable alternative and that interestingly, the willingness to pay does not seem to change significantly when individuals are at an 'optimal' purchasing age. The willingness to pay for LTCI is driven by individual's perceptions of risks conditional on survival instead.","[Costa-Font, Joan; Font, Montserrat] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Costa-Font, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Catalonia, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Barcelona,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",J.Costa-Font@lse.ac.uk,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",,,,,9,7,8,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The empirical component of the analysis quantifies the effects of U.S. interest rate shocks on the Turkish economy. The theoretical component constructs a business cycle model that can successfully match the empirical impulse response functions. The model is estimated on quarterly Turkish data. It is found that the relationship between financial integration and macroeconomic volatility due to foreign interest rate shocks depends on the level of outstanding external debt. Financial integration mitigates the economy's responses to foreign rate shocks for higher levels of external debt and it magnifies the responses for lower levels of external debt.,"Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Demirel, UD (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",demirel@colorado.edu,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,2,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In the analysis exercise presented, we compared different products of Italy and China through disaggregating the available statistical data and highlighting the qualitative differences between Made in Italy and Made in China goods.

This analysis, based on the Polish national sample from 2006, is aimed at casting light on regional variation in the influence of education on income levels. Building a conceptual framework based on the theory of human capital we investigate to what extent pay-offs for human capital differ across administrative districts in Poland. By incorporating contextual characteristics, we examine how micro- and macro-level factors shape labour market outcomes. Our finding provides support for the hypothesis that there is much regional variation in the returns to education, which suggests that there are better and worse places for the development of meritocratic distribution of incomes. It appears that education pays more in more economically developed regions, marked with higher rate of occupational activity. It leads to the conclusion that, on the one hand, such places create higher motivation to reward individuals according to human capital in more efficiently operating markets.

The empirical setting is inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovakia from 1990 to 2007. The findings indicate that when predicting market selection and performance, a formative index of the new psychic distance scales is a significantly better predictor variable than the traditionally employed scale based on Hofstede's (1980) dimensions of national culture. However, for predicting entry mode choice, the results are more ambiguous. This leads us to an unexpected result of our analyses. The classic TCE-based entry mode model does not appear to provide significant predictive power with respect to FDI entry mode choice in Slovakia.

Our theoretical approach allows for corruption to influence economic growth directly and indirectly through different investment and governance channels. All previous empirical work on this issue has been based on national income and product accounts (NIPA) data, which do not normally break down gross domestic investment into its private and public sector, and if they do, they misclassify investment by public enterprises as private investment, potentially biasing empirical findings. In this article we use a data set from the International Finance Corporation that bypasses these problems. We find that the impact of corruption on the level of public investment appears to be more ambiguous than it has been found in the previous literature. We, however, find that the impact of corruption on the accumulation of private capital is significantly more damaging than what has been previously found. We also find that the impact of corruption on governance is unambiguously negative, which further deters economic growth.","[Everhart, Stephen S.] Corp 1100, Overseas Private Investment, Washington, DC 20527 USA; [Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Econ Dept & Int Studies Program, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [McNab, Robert M.] Defense Resources Management Inst & Naval Postgra, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,,,"McNab, Robert/K-7212-2019","McNab, Robert/0000-0002-0093-3973",,,,,73,31,36,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Fragmentation is based on the assumption that it is possible to split the set of an individual's behavioural motives into separable and disjoint subsets. However, this assumption runs counter to the insights in psychology. Moreover, even if splitting up were possible, the different subsets of motives finally need to be checked on consistency and weighted so as to obtain a comprehensive description and explanation. Another serious drawback is that specification of empirical models on the basis of one school of thought or one sub-discipline leads to omitted variables bias and hence biased estimators and tests. Finally, fragmentation may lead to a 'pick-and-mix package', whereby policy-makers and politicians feel free to use what suits them. The social rationality model together with the methodological approach prevalent in modern sociology is presented as a framework for integrating the schools of thought in economics and the social science sub-disciplines.","[Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Social Sci, NL-6700 HB Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Wageningen University & Research,"Folmer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 72, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",henk.folmer@wur.nl,,,,,,,56,27,27,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,2,,,,,258,274,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00435.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,433FA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265188500008,0

(PART II),ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC FORECASTING,,,English,Article,,,,,,globalisation; services; international trade; FDI; New EU Member States,,"In the current debate on services offshoring, the New EU member states (NMS) have focused increasingly the attention of economists and politicians, as well as the public at large. Particularly in the light of the recent waves of EU enlargement these countries have been considered as highly attractive locations for offshored services both from a European and global perspective. While a fairly large amount of anecdotal evidence documents the NMS high potentialities in terms of services offshoring, academic research on this topic is limited. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion. Drawing on recent literature on the complex issue of services globalisation, the paper investigates NMS trade and FDI flows in services over the 1995-2007 period to find evidence of enhanced offshoring-related activities in these countries. The focus is on NMS-10, i.e. NMS-12 excluding Cyprus and Malta. Given the shortcomings of available statistical data and instruments for gauging the scale and impact of services offshoring, the paper adopts a three-tier approach based on BoP trade and FDI statistics, complemented by alternative sources of information. Notwithstanding the caveats associated with this kind of empirical exercise, the paper documents an accelerated pace of offshoring-related activities in the selected NMS, under both forms: international outsourcing and captive offshoring. Its findings show that the fastly growing exports in some individual services categories over recent years, coupled with the ongoing favourable changes in the structure and performance of NMS services trade are largely driven by enhanced offshoring activities hosted by their economies. Further, the paper highlights the NMS capabilities to cope with the challenges raised by the increasingly competitive global offshoring landscape, as measured by competitiveness indicators. Finally, the findings of the paper confirm that current anecdotal information and consulting companies-based projections on NMS growing attractiveness as targets of offshoring decisions by TNC originating both inside and outside EU-15 are widely backed up by available statistical data.

The main characteristics of China's economic growth pattern include high cost, investment-driven, export-dependent, and low-cost competition. Long-term extensive mode of development resulted in internal and external imbalances in the Chinese economy, low business innovation, and economic growth accompanied by high consumption and high pollution. The required changing patterns in the growth of the Chinese national economy are analyzed in the paper. China's economic growth mode transformation should be the basic direction of change in mode of development, the adjustment of economic structure, changes in macro-distribution system, and improve enterprise innovation capability.","[Ke, Changhua; Zhang, Lei] Xiangfan Univ, Xiangfan 441053, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Arts & Science,,zhangltj@hotmail.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,2,2,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-071-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,390,393,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQC52,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280689800087,0

Over the period of urban economic reform, rural-urban migration was allowed to increase in order to fill the employment gap as growth of labour demand outstripped that of the resident labour force in urban areas. However, as reforms gained pace and controls were lifted, it is plausible that competition for work between migrants and urban residents would have increased. The paper examines whether the relationship is one of segmentation or competition in the labour market. It uses attitudinal responses from two urban surveys. The urban workers who perceive competition from migrants are those who are most vulnerable. The findings are consistent with the presence of continued labour market segmentation, but suggest also that competition between the two groups is increasing.","[Knight, John] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Knight, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",john.knight@economics.ox.ac.uk; linda.yueh@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-107-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,36,41,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Significant evidence of sunk costs was found, based on the observed persistence of export activity and the explanatory power of previous exporting experience on current export status. A measure of sector tradability was also used and as expected firms in more easily traded sectors were most likely to be exporters.

These facts are used to argue in favor of monetary policy that prevents excessive building of homes and cars with preemptive rate increases in the middle of expansions when housing starts are above normal and growing higher. This contrasts with the traditional approach which is to raise rates late in expansions when inflation is apparent, but when the markets for homes and durables are very fragile because of excessive building earlier.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Leamer, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",edward.leamer@anderson.ucla.edu,,,,,,,57,6,6,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Like others, we show that the subsidy succeeds in reducing environmental damage only when the substitution effect (the reduction in pollution associated with the clean technology) exceeds the output effect (the extent that the subsidy increases output). Here, we add product differentiation and diffusion dynamics. When the substitution effect dominates, environmental damage decreases monotonically during the diffusion process. The extent of technology diffusion (the degree to which clean technology replaces dirty) is decreasing in the degree of product differentiation. Further, as products become closer substitutes, it is more likely that the subsidy will reduce environmental damage. Finally, the subsidy for clean technology will spill over to the remaining dirty producers, increasing their profit as well. In a free-entry equilibrium, the subsidy decreases pollution when product differentiation is low compared to the relative pollution intensity of the clean technology.","[McGinty, Matthew] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [de Vries, Frans P.] Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Stirling,"McGinty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",mmcginty@uwm.edu; f.p.devries@stir.ac.uk,,"de Vries, Frans P/0000-0003-0462-5035",,,,,27,9,9,0,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

More specifically, we test whether the marginal revenue obtained by the public sector from taxpayers holding an additional educational level is higher than the marginal public expenditure on them. To accomplish this aim, we extend Psacharopoulos ( 1981) analysis and calculate internal rates of return for public expenditure in schooling. Our results suggest that taxpayers with an additional educational level, including those attaining post-compulsory educational levels, are profitable for the public sector.","[Murillo, Ines P.; Pedraja, Francisco] Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Murillo, IP (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,4,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2009,,188,,,,,9,29,,,,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,441BK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265744100001,0

The statistics show that in recent years, Vietnam's demographics have been changing remarkably with an increase in the labor force as well as a decrease in the dependency ratio. This change offers a great opportunity for the economy to enhance its economic growth at least in the short and medium terms. Our estimated results from regression models also indicate that Vietnam has utilized this opportunity: The change in demographics has contributed up to 15% of economic growth during the last five years. Another finding is that while being categorized as dependent, the aged population seems to have no negative impact on Vietnam's economic growth, but the young population does. Vietnam's population will probably shift from a demographic dividend to demographic debt in about 10 years. Therefore, it is very important for Vietnamese government to take advantage of this dividend period in order to improve human capital and technology and prepare a coming period of demographic debt. In addition, building up sound pension and health care systems in the medium term is also a must.","Natl Econ Univ, Math Econ Dept, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam,"Nguyen, TM (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Math Econ Dept, 207 Giai Phong St, Hanoi, Vietnam.",minhkthn@gmail.com,,"Nguyen, Minh/0000-0002-5935-5186",,,,,10,5,5,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

J,"Rossi, S",,,,"Rossi, Sergio",,,The Swiss National Bank: a bookmark of flexible inflation objectives,INVESTIGACION ECONOMICA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,inflation targeting; fixation of interest rate; macroeconomic stabilization; strategies of monetary policy; price stability,,"The monetary-policy strategy that the Swiss National Bank has been implementing since January 1, 2000 offers an interesting case study for those central banks aiming to refer to a 'principles-based' framework as a valid alternative to a rigidly defined inflation-targeting regime. This paper shows that Swiss monetary policy, characterized by its high flexibility degree since the years of monetary targeting, has been able to consider both price stability and economic stabilization in its decision-making process. As a matter of fact, the central bank in Switzerland stands ready to allow temporary deviations from its price stability goal, when the domestic economy is (likely to be) suffering from output and employment losses, owing to internal or foreign disturbances or economic shocks. All in all, empirical evidence supports a monetary-policy regime marrying a long-run nominal anchor for price stability-defined by the central bank rather than government-with short-run flexibility in view of actual and expected economic performance in the real sector. Inflation-targeting monetary authorities ought to consider moving from a hierarchical view of policy goals to a flexible approach based on sound macroeconomic principles. This case study shows the way for any central banks enjoying a high level of credibility and reputation, and willing to improve the policy record on both (real and monetary) fronts.","Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Rossi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",sergio.rossi@unifr.ch,"Rossi, Sergio/AAO-6365-2020","Rossi, Sergio/0009-0002-5926-5356",,,,,35,3,3,0,5,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The Case of Mexico (1992-2004),TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,,WORLDS POOR; WELFARE,"This paper advocates that although an absolute notion of poverty should remain an essential ingredient in the evaluation of the standard of living in developing and transition economics, it is time that relative poverty begins to be systematically estimated for those same economies. This prescription is applied to Mexico for the 1992-2004 period, where the Fox Administration had officially determined for the first time an absolute poverty line for 2000. As in the Second European Poverty Programme at the end of the 1980s, the relative poverty line is fixed at 50% of mean equivalent expenditures. Absolute and relative poverty behave in opposite ways during the 1992-2000 business cycle, but both decline significantly during the 2000-2004 stagnation period. Relative poverty is above absolute poverty from 1992 to 1994, below it during 1996-1998, and above it again in 2000-2004. In any case, relative poverty in Mexico is well above relative poverty in developed countries.","Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Ruiz-Castillo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain.",,"Ruiz-Castillo, Javier/O-8180-2019",,,,,,68,1,1,0,10,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

I use a simple theoretical model to illustrate how an exogenous shock to prices of new durable goods affects prices and trade frequencies of corresponding used goods. The model predicts that if prices of new durable goods increase, then prices of used goods will also increase. In addition, if the distribution of consumer preferences for quality are relatively concentrated among those with a high preference for quality, then trade in used good markets will slow. The predictions of the model are supported by an empirical analysis of the market for new and used wide-body commercial aircraft following a major change in effective aircraft prices caused by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Act effectively increased prices of new aircraft by an average of $6.5 million. At the same time, used aircraft prices increased by an average of $2.9 million to $7.7 million and used aircraft sales fell between 23 to 36 percent. These results suggest that policies that affect new durable good markets can have significant effects on used markets as well.","Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Smith, LK (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",lsmith2@ftc.gov,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

There is no unique concept in scientific literature for determining the notion of infrastructure, for distinguishing and measuring its components and various models which provide different results are used for measuring the impact of infrastructure. Lack of unique methodology in academic literature hinders evaluation of the infrastructure investments impact on social and economic development. The authors emphasize different insights on this relationship which provides wide methodological background but there is lack of conceptual methods which could be adjusted for certain countries and life-spans. Characteristic of each country determines the set of infrastructure components and the aspect of impact on social and economic development: economic growth, income inequality, output, regional competitiveness, labour productivity and welfare. The analysis of infrastructure development impact is based on three main factors: definition of infrastructure, determination and measurement of its components, formation of a model for evaluation of the impact. They are crucial for accurate testing of the impact of infrastructure investments. The authors of the paper present scientific approaches on these factors and provide hypothetical test of the impact of infrastructure on the development in the Baltic States: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The issue of infrastructure investments is very important as infrastructure development in these countries is supported by Structural Funds of European Union and other financial mechanisms. The authors of the paper faced the problem of data availability and the results of causal relationship estimations between growth and infrastructure variables in different countries are presented for the period 1995-2007. Statistical measurement of relationship between infrastructure and economic growth determinants in the Baltic States proved that several variables are not enough to evaluate the impact of infrastructure on development. The full-scale method is a must in order to measure this relationship. Empirical test also proved that the direction of relationship differs in Lithuania and Latvia which are attributed to the same level development and these results contradict the findings in scientific literature. For this reason it is important to acknowledge that the model of infrastructure impact evaluation must involve determinants of regional peculiarity. The authors will continue analyzing these academic issues in their further researches.","[Snieska, Vytautas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Simkunaite, Ineta] PVC, Publ Inst, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.snieska@ktu.lt; ineta@pvcentras.lt,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",,,,,42,40,49,4,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Higher mineral wealth is associated with elevated levels of human capital in a cross-section of countries. Matching the overall level of economic development and political instability and violence, weakens but does not reverse this conclusion. These results are economically significant. Moving up from the bottom to the top quartile for subsoil wealth per capita decreases illiteracy by approximate to 12% among young and adult females. Conversely, moving down from the top to the bottom quartile for subsoil wealth per capita decreases the average years of primary and total education by approximate to 1.5 years for females. Results are consistent with Hirschman's conjecture that enclave economies have weaker production linkages but stronger government revenue linkages than other activities. Most importantly, this article argues that caution should be exercised when discouraging countries from exploiting their mineral wealth, especially for countries where human capital is scarce. I know, [there is] no safe depositary of the ultimate powers of society, but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education.

In the theoretical part of the article there have been identified two scientific approaches towards SME' support. Some scientists think that the SME's support is unjustifiable, because government intervenes into the dictated processes of the market and violates them, but the other part claims that the SME's support politics implemented by the government helps to solve business and economics' problems. Both sides have their own arguments, but those are more marginal approaches. Currently, the Lithuanian government supports SME's stimulation, support and versatile help, but in reality due to financial resources' lack small or medium size enterprise is maintained according to resources. When Lithuania became the EU member, there emerged more possibilities for small or medium size enterprises, opening new vistas for business people, A number of the provided projects shows that the required support sums are exceeding funds possibilities. Therefore it is important to base the need for the support of a particular company. In the article there have been analyzed the European Agriculture and Guarantees' Fund (EAGF) requirements, which the enterprise must correspond in order to get the EAGF support. One of the main requirements is that economic vitality rates (general liquidity rate, the net profitability, loan repayment rate, loan rate, the internal repayment rate, the average asset profitability) corresponded to the set critical values. In the investigative part of the article there have been carried out the activity development analysis of the JSC Kaimas in order to get the support of the EAGF. While validating the support's need there has been oriented to economic vitality rates and their impact on the company. There has been carried out the analysis of the planned economic activity, risk factor and financial commitments. The need for additional financial support has been also analyzed There has been estimated that investments could be financed from private, loan's and the EU support funds. There have been grounded the company's manufacturing equipment modernization possibilities while purchasing the needed long-term assets. There has been estimated that part of the company's production is to be exported. It is forecasted that manufacturing outlays (materials, energy) would increase 10 per cent annually. The company loan servicing, economic vitality and investment effectiveness, and manufacturing self-cost statistical tables have been prepared. The analyzed main economic enterprise rates allow to claim that the project is viable and financially useful and paying off. The received economic vitality rate values are better than the critical values; therefore, JSC KAIMAS is a suitable applicant for the EAGF support. The carried out calculations show that the forecasted activity programs' implementation will guarantee that the activity would be profitable and will allow to implement the allocated investments for economy modernization.","[Tamosiunas, Teodoras; Lukosius, Saulius] Siauliu Univ, LT-76285 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Tamosiunas, T (通讯作者)，Siauliu Univ, Vilniaus G 88, LT-76285 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,25,12,12,0,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The agent in charge of the final production can obtain soft information about the other agent's effort choice by investing in monitoring. I investigate the circumstances under which it is optimal for the principal to use a centralized organization in which she designs the contracts with both agents or to use a decentralized organization in which she contracts with only one agent, and delegates the power to contract with the other agent. It is shown that in this setting a decentralized organization can be superior to a centralized organization. This is because the principal is better off under monitoring and the incentives for an agent to invest in monitoring can be higher in a decentralized organization. The circumstances under which this is true are related to monitoring costs and the importance of each agent for production.

The (relative) price of health care varies significantly across states but does not appear to have real effects on the amount of resources (measured in real dollars) a state devotes to health care.","Texas A&M Univ, Private Enterprise Res Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Wang, ZJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Private Enterprise Res Ctr, Allen Bldg,Room 3038, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",z-wang@neo.tamu.edu,"wang, zhiwen/JDV-9990-2023",,,,,,31,38,43,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the experiment, a grader is offered a bribe along with a demand for a better grade. We find that graders respond more favorably to bigger bribes, while the effect of higher wages is ambiguous: it lowers the bribe's acceptance, but it fosters reciprocation. Monitoring and punishment can deter corruption, but we cannot reject that it may also crowd-out intrinsic motivations for honesty when intensified. Finally, our results suggest several micro-determinants of corruption including age, ability, religiosity, but not gender. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model of training in imperfectly competitive product and labour markets. The model indicates that there are two contrasting effects of deregulation on training. As stressed in the literature, with a given number of firms, deregulation reduces the size of rents per unit of output that firms can reap by training their employees. Yet, the number of firms increases following deregulation, thereby raising output and profit gains from training and improving investment incentives. The latter effect prevails. In line with the predictions of the theoretical model, we find that the substantial deregulation in the 1990s of heavily regulated European industries (energy, transport and communication) increased training incidence.

IaaS; Economics. Information Technology,DIFFUSION; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION,"Cloud computing brings together several existing technologies including service oriented architecture, distributed grid computing, virtualization, and broadband networking to provide software, infrastructure, and platforms as services. Under the old IT model, companies built their own server farms designed to meet peak demand using bundled hardware and software solutions. This was time consuming, capital intensive and relatively inflexible. Under the cloud computing model, firms can rent as many virtual machines as they need at any given time, and then either design or use off-the-shelf solutions to integrate company-wide data in order to easily distribute access to users both within and outside of the company firewall. This converts fixed capital costs into variable costs, prevents under and over provisioning, and allows minute by minute flexibly. Consumers are also increasingly turning to the cloud for computing service through such applications as Gmail, Pandora, and Facebook. The purpose of this paper is to discuss this new and transformative technology, survey the existing economics literature on the subject, and suggest potential directions for new research.","[Conley, John P.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Bayrak, Ergin; Wilkie, Simon] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Vanderbilt University; University of Southern California,"Conley, JP (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",ebayrak@usc.edu; j.p.conley@vanderbilt.edu; swilkie@usc.edu,,,,,,,42,14,17,0,26,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Unit root tests allowing for nonlinearities and structural changes suggest that the unemployment rate is not stationary in most of the sample countries. Tests allowing for fractional integration, however, reveal that shocks are highly persistent, implying a slow rate of convergence to the natural rate of unemployment. The unemployment rate is least persistent in Hungary and Slovenia, more persistent in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States and extremely persistent in Poland. The degree of persistence appears to reflect the different levels of economic and institutional development in the countries and possibly also the role of the government.

The MPI is the amount of money one can extract from a consumer who violates the axioms. It is also a statistical test for the hypothesis that a consumer is rational when behavior is observed with error. We present an application using a panel data set of food expenditures. The data exhibit many violations of the axioms. Mostly, the MPI for these violations is small.

In this study, we use Barnes's manufacturing strategy formation process as frameworks with some new changes. Also a case study methodology was used to investigate the process of formation of manufacturing strategy in six small manufacturing companies in Iran like Barnes did in the UK. The results of this study are the main features of the process of manufacturing strategy formation and manufacturing strategy formation model in the case companies. In the case study method, external validity is inevitably compromised due to the limited number of companies that can be studied.

We consider a double-extensive model of labor supply where each spouse makes a labor force participation choice for given hours of work. We present simple and intuitive optimal tax rules that generalize existing findings on the optimal taxation of single-person households with extensive responses (Saez, 2002) to the case of two-person households with double-extensive responses. Without income effects on labor supply, optimal tax rules as a function of sufficient statistics are the same under the unitary and collective approaches. With income effects on labor supply, optimal tax rules under the two approaches continue to depend on the same sufficient statistics, but the collective model features an additional Pigouvian term arising from a within-family participation externality. Finally, we present microsimulations of tax reform for 15 European countries suggesting that a reduction of tax rates on secondary earners relative to primary earners is associated with strong welfare gains in all countries.

This article analyses the characteristics of publications co-authored by Hungarian university researchers with non-academic partners. Scientometric indicators are used as primary methodological tools. Our sample was the publication output of 12 universities, which covers 90% of the university sphere's publications, between 2001 and 2005 and was taken from the publications of Hungarian institutions of higher education appearing in the Web of Science database. The authors employed a new, important aspect in the cooperation activity of Hungarian universities: their connection with the non-academic partners. The selection and the institutional location of the co-authors resulted in an important database for further analysis. Based on the empirical analysis of the publication and citation performance data of 12 such universities the authors concluded that the proportion of citations to publications co-authored with either academic or non-academic partners is significantly higher for international partners than it is for Hungarian ones. For one publication, the proportion of citations to articles co-authored with foreign non-academic partners, such as firms or health care institutions, was five times higher than the number relating to papers co-authored with Hungarian firms or health care institutions. Higher citedness of the joint articles with the foreign country institutes than domestic partners are in harmony with observation in other countries. Generally the rate of the co-authored articles with non-academic partners is rather low. However it scatters to a great extent concerning the different universities. The presence or absence of medicine in the profile of the universities seems an important factor of that difference.","[Inzelt, A.] Financial Res Co, IKU Innovat Res Ctr, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary; [Inzelt, A.] OECD Natl Experts Sci & Technol Indicators NESTI, Working Grp, Paris, France; [Inzelt, A.] CUB, Budapest, Hungary; [Inzelt, A.] UNESCO, Paris, France; [Schubert, A.] Hungarian Acad Sci, ISSRU, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Schubert, A.] Hungarian Acad Sci, ISSRU, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"Inzelt, A (通讯作者)，Financial Res Co, IKU Innovat Res Ctr, Felhevizi Ut 24, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary.",inzelt.annamaria@penzugykutato.hu; schuba@iif.hu,"Schubert, Andras/H-8045-2015","Schubert, Andras/0000-0001-8348-1775",,,,,18,2,2,1,30,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The first and more limited phase from August 2007 to August 2008 stemmed from losses in one relatively small segment of the US financial system-namely, subprime residential mortgages. Despite this disruption to financial markets, real GDP in the United States continued to rise into the second quarter of 2008, and forecasters were predicting only a mild recession. In mid-September 2008, however, the financial crisis entered a far more virulent phase. In rapid succession, the investment bank Lehman Brothers entered bankruptcy on September 15, 2008; the insurance firm AIG collapsed on September 16, 2008; there was a run on the Reserve Primary Fund money market fund on the same day; and the highly publicized struggle to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) began. How did something that appeared in mid-2008 to be a significant but fairly mild financial disruption transform into a full-fledged global financial crisis? What caused this transformation? Did the government responses to the global financial crisis help avoid a worldwide depression?

The paper argues that although these two trilemmas stem from the same root cause, financial integration, the financial trilemma is particularly acute for countries that have chosen to resolve the monetary trilemma by entering into a monetary union. The lesson from the recent crisis is that eurozone countries need to replace their national financial supervision institutions by supranational institutions capable of managing and resolving financial crises. This will require pooling together some of their fiscal sovereignty.","[Sapir, Andre] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Bruegel, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Sapir, A (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Bruegel, Belgium.",asapir@ulb.ac.be,"Sapir, Andre/IAS-0343-2023","Sapir, Andre/0000-0001-6493-0352",,,,,25,11,11,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

I develop a model in which firms and workers may agree to report less than the true amount of earnings to the fiscal authorities. I show that introducing a minimum wage creates a spike in the distribution of declared earnings and induces higher compliance by some agents, thus reducing their disposable income. The comparison of food consumption and of the consumption-income gap before and after the massive minimum wage hike that took place in Hungary in 2001 reveals that households who appeared to benefit from the hike actually experienced a drop compared to similar but unaffected households, thus supporting the prediction of the theory.

Ultimately, a case is made for the underpinning of both analog and digital computing theory in constructive mathematics. Some conceptual confusion in the meaning of analog computing and its non-reliance on the theory of numerical analysis is also discussed. Digital computing has its mathematical foundations in (classical) recursion theory and constructive mathematics. The implicit, working, assumption of those who practice the noble art of analog computing may well be that the mathematical foundations of their subject is as sound as the foundations of real analysis. That, in turn, implies a reliance on the soundness of set theory plus the axiom of choice. This is, surely, seriously disturbing from a computation point of view. Therefore, in this paper, I seek to locate a foundation for analog computing in exhibiting some tentative dualities with results that are analogous to those that are standard in computability theory. The main question, from the point of view of economics, is whether the Phillips Machine, as an analog computer, has universal computing properties. The conjectured answer is in the negative.","[Velupillai, K.

The dependent variable is the volatility of discretionary fiscal policy, which does not represent reactions to changes in economic conditions. Our baseline results thus give support to the strengthening of institutions to deal with excessive levels of discretion volatility, as more checks and balances make it harder for governments to change fiscal policy for reasons unrelated to the current state of the economy. Our results also show that bigger countries and bigger governments have less public spending volatility. In contrast to previous studies, the political factors do not seem to play a role, with the exception of the Herfindahl index, which suggests that a high concentration of parliamentary seats in a few parties would increase public spending volatility.

Following a court case between Starbucks and the Ethiopian government regarding the trademarking of 'Sidamo', Ethiopian government engaged in a public relations campaign to raise awareness for the Initiative, which was widely publicised in the international media especially after Oxfam organised a public campaign. This paper evaluates the effect of these interventions on the export prices of trademarked Ethiopian coffees. We find that the prices of the trademarked coffees increased by about 10% relative to the non-trademarked coffees following these interventions. The magnitude of this change is comparable with the farm gate prices reported in the literature; however, we cannot establish direct causation or observe the passthrough into farm gate prices.","[Arslan, Aslihan] Kiel Inst World Econ, Poverty Reduct Equ & Dev Res Grp, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Reicher, Christopher P.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Monetary Policy Market Imperfect Res Grp, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Arslan, A (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Poverty Reduct Equ & Dev Res Grp, Dusternbrooker Weg 120, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",aslihan.arslan@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,38,4,4,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

A natural interpretation to this quick exit from the export market is that firms did not predict the profitability of their variety correctly before entry. In this paper a firm heterogeneity model is put forward to account for this type of exporting uncertainty due to lack of information. Firms are heterogeneous with respect to the popularity of their good, technically the CES weight, and the popularity of a good varies across markets. Therefore, firms are uncertain about the profitability of their good in the export market. Upon payment of sunk export costs the popularity of the good is revealed and some firms stay in the export market while others leave. Comparative statics show that lower sunk export costs lead to higher probability that firms start to export, but to lower probability of export success. Lower fixed export costs instead lead to both a higher probability to start exporting and to be successful in exporting.","Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Bekkers, E (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",eddybekkers@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

On the one hand, economic activity is proxied by aggregated industrial production in the EU 27 (as it provides the best performance in a preliminary forecasting exercise vs. other indicators). On the other hand, brent, natural gas and coal prices are selected as being the main carbon price drivers (as highlighted by previous literature). The interactions between the macroeconomic and energy spheres are captured in a Markov-switching VAR model with two states that is able to reproduce the 'boom-bust' business cycle (Hamilton (1989)). First, industrial production is found to impact positively (negatively) the carbon market during periods of economic expansion (recession), thereby confirming the existence of a link between the macroeconomy and the price of carbon. Second, the brent price is confirmed to be the leader in price formation among energy markets (Bachmeier and Griffin (2006)), as it impacts other variables through the structure of the Markov-switching model. Taken together, these results uncover new interactions between the recently created EU emissions market and the pre-existing macroeconomic/energy environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the case of the sequential bilateral accident in which the victim's care level is observable to the injurer, the victim's care level can be a signal of the unforeseen contingency.

It is found that oil price shocks depress firms' investment decisions, and do so differentially by depressing investment more for more uncertain firms. Oil shocks affect investment for at least the first and second year after the shock. In the short term, the mere existence of a shock drives most of the effect.

We assessed India's position in terms of reserve adequacy and found that India is well placed and has sufficient stock of international reserves to meet the minimum adequacy requirements. Also, the results reveal that the central bank is holding substantial excess reserves and the related opportunity cost (1.5% of GDP) appears to be quite considerable. Further, the estimates of reserve demand function suggest that scale of foreign trade, uncertainty and profitability considerations play significant role in determining India's long-term reserve demand policies. More importantly, validating the monetary approach to balance of payment, our results show that national monetary disequilibrium does play a crucial role in short-run reserve movements. An excess of money demand (supply) induces an inflow (outflow) of international reserves with an elasticity of 0.56 which also implies that Reserve Bank of India responds to correct the domestic money market disequilibrium; and did not just leave it completely on the mercy of reserve inflows.

Before trade liberalization, due to prohibitively high tariffs, one domestic firm in each country behaves as a monopoly. With trade liberalization, each firm can export to the other country with zero tariffs. Each firm produces the final product by combining an input supplied by an international monopoly and the other input supplied in the competitive market., Our results show that with trade liberalization, the technology with a lower Marginal cost and higher fixed cost is adopted. Since marginal cost becomes lower, the market price decreases and the output increases. With trade liberalization, the profit of the firm that supplies the monopoly input and the consumer surplus increases. With a sufficiently larger market, the profit of the firm that produces the final goods decreases, but the social welfare increases.","Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea",Sogang University,"Wang, GH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, 1 Shinsoo Dong, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",ghwang@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,10,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Regret-averse preferences are characterized by a utility function that includes disutility from having chosen ex-post suboptimal alternatives. We show that the presence of regret aversion raises or lowers the optimal bank interest margin than the one chosen by the purely risk-averse bank, depending on whether the probability of default is below or above a threshold value, respectively. Regret aversion as such makes the bank less prudent and more prone to risk-taking when the probability of default is high, thereby adversely affecting the stability of the banking system.

The approach utilised here is based on the maximal overlap discrete Hilbert wavelet transform (MODHWT). Firstly, via a broad set of simulation experiments, we examine the small and large sample properties of two wavelet estimators of the scale-dependent time delay. The estimators are the wavelet cross-correlator and the wavelet phase angle-based estimator. Our results provide some practical guidelines for the empirical examination of short-and medium-term lead-lag relations for octave frequency bands. Further, we point out a deficiency in the implementation of the MODHWT and suggest using a modified implementation scheme, which was proposed earlier in the context of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. In addition, we show how MODHWT-based wavelet quantities can serve to approximate the Fourier bivariate spectra and discuss issues connected with building confidence intervals for them. The discrete wavelet analysis of coherence and phase angle is illustrated with a scale-dependent examination of business cycle synchronisation between 11 euro zone countries. The study is supplemented by a wavelet analysis of the variance and covariance of the euro zone business cycles. The empirical examination underlines the good localisation properties and high computational efficiency of the wavelet transformations applied and provides new arguments in favour of the endogeneity hypothesis of the optimum currency area criteria as well as the wavelet evidence on dating the Great Moderation in the euro zone.","Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Logist, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Bruzda, J (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Logist, Torun, Poland.",bruzdaj@uni.torun.pl,"Bruzda, Joanna/ABF-8475-2021; Bruzda, Joanna/AAD-5199-2020","Bruzda, Joanna/0000-0002-7451-3592",,,,,40,1,1,0,1,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 5,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,201116,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-16,0.0,,,47,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865CB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298287300001,0

We take advantage of spatial and temporal variation in the regulations' implementation to show that federal gasoline standards, which allow refiners flexibility in choosing a compliance mechanism, did not improve air quality. This outcome occurred because minimizing the cost of compliance does not reduce emissions of those compounds most prone to forming ozone. In California, however, we find that precisely targeted, inflexible regulations requiring the removal of particularly harmful compounds significantly improved air quality.

We introduce a new concept called regret as a measure for inequality of subjective well-being. Regret is the probability with which a respondent who chooses an option in a multiple-choice question pertaining to subjective well-being does not choose any other option indicative of better well-being. Regret is estimated in connection with demographic factors using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and data of the World Values Survey. Furthermore, the relationships between regret and GDP per capita and the changes therein are shown to investigate those between inequality of subjective well-being and economic conditions.

The model has several features that are distinguished from previous studies: endogenous labor force participation, different job-search decisions and imperfect insurance markets. I find that the model is able to account for the U.S. labor market, especially the gross labor-force transition rates. I also find that firing costs as a type of firing tax have a negative effect on the layoff rate, the job-finding probability and the participation rate. In particular, the effect of a decrease in the job-finding probability is greater than the effect of a decrease in the layoff rate, and this results in an increase in the unemployment-to-population ratio. Finally, firing costs make individuals' job tenures longer and skew the asset distribution to the right. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

When each government maximizes its steady state economic and environmental welfare and one country is a net foreign creditor and the other one a net foreign debtor, it is nationally optimal for the creditor country with sufficiently high environmental preferences to chose a stricter permit level than the debtor country. However, the resulting Nash equilibrium permit levels are not Pareto efficient. Depending on the direction and strength of the countries' differences in external balances and environmental preferences, Pareto efficiency mandates that their permit levels are either adjusted in opposite directions or reduced in both.

In a first step, we employ the Luenberger productivity indicator to estimate and decompose productivity change. A Malmquist productivity index is also used for a comparative purpose. The results paint a picture of mixed productivity performance in the Portuguese energy sector. The first decomposition underlines that, in average, the productivity variation is explained by the technological change. Then, in a second step, we analyse the nature of this technical change by using the recent concept of parallel neutrality (Briec et al., 2006).

It is not yet clear, however, whether state energy policy portfolios can generate results in a similar magnitude or manner to their presumed carbon mitigation potential. This article seeks to address this lack of policy evidence and contribute empirical insights on the carbon mitigation effects of state energy portfolios within the U.S. electricity sector. Using a dynamic, long-term electricity dispatch model with U.S. power plant, utility, and transmission and distribution data between 2010 and 2030, this analysis builds a series of state-level policy portfolio scenarios and performs a comparative scenario analysis. Results reveal that state policy portfolios have modest to minimal carbon mitigation effects in the long run if surrounding states do not adopt similar portfolios as well. The difference in decarbonization potential between isolated state policies and larger, more coordinated policy efforts is due in large part to carbon leakage, which is the export of carbon intensive fossil fuel-based electricity across state lines. Results also confirm that a carbon price of $50/metric ton CO(2)e can generate substantial carbon savings. Although both policy options - an energy policy portfolio or a carbon price - are effective at reducing carbon emissions in the present analysis, neither is as effective alone as when the two strategies are combined.

If a firm in the developed country outsources the production of its intermediate goods to a supplier in the developing country, it faces an adverse selection problem. If it chooses to produce the intermediate goods in its own subsidiary in the developing country, it faces an inefficient monitoring problem. My analysis of this tradeoff provides a new explanation for the observation that FDI is concentrated in capital intensive industries and yields two empirical hypotheses: more firms should adopt outsourcing instead of FDI after trade liberalization; the share of intra-firm trade in total trade should be increasing in the degree of productivity dispersion across intermediate goods suppliers in the developing country.

Formula approaches are of increasing importance in trade talks, because of the large number of countries involved, the wider dispersion in initial tariffs (e. g. tariff peaks), and gaps between bound and applied tariff rates. This paper presents a two country intra-industry trade model with heterogeneous firms subject to high and low tariffs. We examine the welfare effects of applying three different tariff reduction formulas discussed in the literature that were used and proposed in previous and current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/WTO negotiations (1) a proportional cut, (2) the Swiss formula and (3) a tiered formula. No single formula dominates for all conditions. The ranking of the three tools depends on the degree of product differentiation in the industry and the achieved reduction in the average tariff.","[Jorgensen, Jan Guldager] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Schroder, Philipp J.

On this basis, we argue that a greater level of de facto trade openness is associated with a higher degree of informational efficiency in these emerging stock markets because the former signals higher future firm profitability, and investors tend to react faster to information when there is less uncertainty about a firm's future earnings or cash flows.

The world has seen an increase of farmers' organic products, certification and the Earth's surface designed to produce organic products as well as sales of organic products. The role in the retail distribution of the produced organic products becoming a more significant. Bearing all this in mind, this paper will deal, first, with the trend in retail development and characteristics of organic food observed globally, by country and formats (types of stores). Then we point out the key determinants of retail sales of organic food, and especially we will, as a primary goal of this paper, give a detailed overview of the theoretical-methodological and empirical problems, as well as the specific measurement of financial performance of retail sales of organic food. Research into these problems is, for the purpose of considering the practical dimensions, based on recent relevant empirical data. The research results should serve as the basis for the creation of appropriate policies and strategies and, especially, for building integrated system of managing business and financial performance of retail organic food in the future. This is particularly true for of retail originating from a country with the distinction in the market development of organic food, as is the case with Serbia.","Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Lukic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade, Serbia.",rlukic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Lukic, Radojko/ABG-3813-2020",,,,,,29,13,13,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The results suggest that not all energy sources are spatially homogenous in prices and the processes of energy price cointegration are different over sub-periods: over groups of fuels; and over regions. Coal and electricity prices have co-moved since 2003 while gasoline and diesel prices have co-moved since 1997. The results show that there are clearly variations in the emergence of energy price co-movement over regions, implying that regional fuel markets have emerged in China. Important lessons that can be learnt from the results are that an energy market has, to some extent, already emerged in China and, as a result, energy prices are substantially less distorted than before. If correct, these findings have significant global implications both in terms of future emission reductions, emission trading and trade negotiations where China should be treated as a 'market driven economy'.

The GARCH modeling methodology is introduced to accommodate the possibility of serial correlation in volatility since the daily peak demand data exhibits non-constant mean and variance, and multiple seasonality corresponding to weekly and monthly periodicity. The proposed Reg-SARIMA-GARCH model is designed in such a way that the predictor variables are initially selected using a multivariate adaptive regression splines algorithm. The developed models are used for out of sample prediction of daily peak demand. A comparative analysis is done with a piecewise linear regression model.

This implies a shift away from per se prohibitions of certain practices towards case-by-case analysis - a move that has been hotly debated, especially in Europe. Using a case study of the recently concluded British American Tobacco case, we study the core features of an effects-based approach to vertical restraints.

Empirical results show that the estimated patent elasticity of R&D is lower than that for OECD countries, indicating relatively low R&D productivity for China's high-technology industries. The direct innovation effect of technology imports is negative, while the absorptive ability embodied in R&D helps in gaining external sources of knowledge, thus contributing to innovations.

Types differ in a key parameter governing price expectations which are supposed to be adaptive. The unique steady state of the resulting economic dynamics is characterized in terms of stability and the impact of the number of firms types is studied: to this end the notions of structural and behavioural degree of instability, which are introduced in the paper, prove to be crucial in determining whether stability or instability prevail. The case of market integration is also considered and conditions to have stability (or instability) in terms of the original markets' parameters are given. The baseline structure is extended in two directions. The first extension assumes the point of view of an authority who is uncertain about the firms types. In this case the structural degree of instability determines how heterogeneity affects the probability of ending up with a stable outcome. The second extension consists in endogenizing the choice of predictors through a discrete choice-based evolutionary mechanism. In both cases the amount of the heterogeneity and its possible variations play a critical role in shaping the range of possible long-run outcomes of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the literature does not focus directly on the political decision-making process and assumes that the desired tax policy is responding to objective underlying tradeoffs. Based on an original survey of members of the German national parliament (Bundestag) in 2006/07, we document a strong ideological bias among policy-makers with respect to the perceived mobility of international tax bases (real capital and paper profits). Ideology also influences, directly and indirectly, the perceived national autonomy in tax setting and preferences for a European Union minimum tax for companies. There seems little consensus as to what the efficiency costs of capital taxation in open economies are, even though our survey falls in a period of extensive debate about, and actual adoption of, a company tax reform bill in Germany.","[Janeba, Eckhard] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, CESifo, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Heinemann, Friedrich] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Mannheim; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Janeba, E (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, CESifo, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",janeba@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,34,11,11,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Further, this paper shows that the ratio of bilateral trade to the product of partner incomes is increasing in the extent of specialization and in the intensity of intra-industry trade.

GHG emissions associated with energy extraction and use are a major component of any strategy addressing climate change mitigation. Non-emitting options for electrical power and liquid transportation fuels are increasingly considered key components of an energy system with lower overall environmental impacts. Renewable energy technologies (RETs) as well as biofuels technologies have been accelerating rapidly during the past decades, both in technology performance and cost-competitiveness - and they are increasingly gaining market share. These technology options offer many positive attributes, but also have unique cost/benefit trade-offs, such as land-use competition for bioresources and variability for wind and solar electric generation technologies. This paper presents a brief summary of status, recent progress, some technological highlights for RETs and biofuels, and an analysis of critical issues that must be addressed for RETs to meet a greater share of the global energy requirements and lower GHG emissions.

A plant-level microsimulation based upon the industry structure of Bernard et al. (2003) is linked to a multi-sector computable general equilibrium model. This linkage permits an analysis of plant-level behavior that encompasses the trade-induced changes in factor prices and consumption patterns. The methodology is applied in the examination of two counterfactual trade policy scenarios on the Chilean manufacturing sector. The results suggest that trade liberalization leads to a reallocation of output toward the most productive producers. This result is driven by two primary causes: (a) a reduction in the price of inputs that promotes the expansion of output by the most productive producers and (b) increased competition from overseas that drives the least productive producers out of the market.

Since keeping up with the Joneses leads an individual consumption's to impose a negative externality on the consumption of others. a consumption tax and tariff are thereby socially desirable to correct this distortion. Due to the fact that the government has to account for additional distortion caused by consumer ethnocentrism and that keeping up with the Joneses in the consumption of domestic goods tends to reinforce the influence of ethnocentrism on the purchase of domestic products, the consumption of imported goods is subject to a higher tariff rate because of the cross-market externality. Of interest, if consumption only involves an own-market externality. there is no cyclical consequence for the optimal taxes. However, if consumption involves both own- and cross-market externalities, the optimal tariff is state-contingent and, more specifically, is countercyclical. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that investment overseas by SOEs is a double-edged sword as far as its impact on domestic reform is concerned. Investing overseas offers opportunities to deepen structural reform in China, but such investment could also strengthen the monopoly position of some SOEs, which is inconsistent with the objective of domestic reform. Therefore, it is important for China to deepen domestic reform with respect to competition, ownership and regulations, to maximize the benefits from investing overseas. The present paper also discusses how building market-compatible institutions will result in increased innovation. This provides opportunities for Chinese firms to effectively catch up with the advanced technologies to remain competitive in overseas markets.","[Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Yang, Jidong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongsheng] State Council, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Renmin University of China,"Song, LG (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",ligang.song@anu.edu.au; yangjidong2001@163.com; zys@drc.gov.cn,"Yang, Jidong/AAW-7706-2020","Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352",,,,,23,50,57,2,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2011,19.0,4,,,SI,,38,53,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01249.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,800XJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293400700003,0

As this is quite a departure from traditional unidimensional and multidimensional poverty measurement-particularly with respect to the identification step-further elaboration may be warranted. In this paper we elucidate the strengths, limitations, and misunderstandings of multidimensional poverty measurement in order to clarify the debate and catalyse further research. We begin with general definitions of unidimensional and multidimensional methodologies for measuring poverty. We provide an intuitive description of our measurement approach, including a 'dual cutoff' identification step that views poverty as the state of being multiply deprived, and an aggregation step based on the traditional FGT measures. We briefly discuss five characteristics of our methodology that are easily overlooked or mistaken and conclude with some brief remarks on the way forward.","[Alkire, Sabina; Foster, James] Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England; [Foster, James] George Washington Univ, Inst Int Econ Policy, Elliott Sch, Washington, DC USA",University of Oxford; George Washington University,"Alkire, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England.",sabina.alkire@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,315,365,13,183,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

When auditing is costless, a nominal interest rate equal to zero is optimal and attained when all agents are audited and both types of labor are taxed at the same rate.

The policy was regressive in that fertility incentives were so large and greatest among the rich. Similar policies whose fertility benefit increases with income are being implemented today.

Using longitudinal data from professional distance running covering a period of nearly 40 years (1973-2009) I first confirm the findings of most previous studies by demonstrating that on average the women's races were - for most years - indeed less competitive than the men's contests. Closer inspection of the data. however, reveals that the women's races over distances with large amounts of prize money and/or prestige at stake (5000 m track, 10,000 m road, half marathon, and marathon) have always been particularly balanced. Moreover, although it still exists, the gender gap has considerably narrowed over the years. These findings are not compatible with the hypothesis that gender differences in competitiveness reflect evolved biological differences and/or psychological predispositions. It is, however, compatible with two other (complementary rather than substitute) hypotheses: due to changing socio-cultural conditions boys and girls are today socialized similarly in many parts of the world and due to the increasing returns to success (i.e. identical prize money levels and distributions) women are nowadays motivated to train as hard as comparably talented men.

When voting is costless, a positive fraction of voters abstains for any finite population, but abstention vanishes in the limit of an arbitrarily large election. I demonstrate that in large elections, a single vote changes second period policies by an amount exponentially large compared to the probability of influencing the first period election if the probabilities with which voters vote for the two candidates differ. Using this, I prove that the limiting voting behavior in the first election is independent of the first period policy choices of the candidates. The incentive to vote to signal one's preferences thus dominates the incentive to vote to increase the chances of electing one's preferred candidate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A logit model is also used to identify the major factors in exchange rate exposure. The empirical results in the case of using the standard deviation of exchange rates suggest that: the number of firms showing significant exchange rate exposure has been relatively increasing; exchange rate exposure is more likely for export-oriented manufacturing industries than for nonmanufacturing industries; and large firms using hedging methods are likely to show a low degree of exchange rate exposure.,"[Kang, Sammo] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul 100715, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong Wook] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Seoul 100794, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong Wook] Bank Korea, Seoul 100794, South Korea",Dongguk University; Dongguk University; Bank of Korea,"Kang, S (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul 100715, South Korea.",sammokang@dongguk.edu; jwlee@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Using a dynamic, general equilibrium model, we simulate the implications of the major changes of the reform: a higher maximum pension rate, changes to the income means test and an increase in the eligibility age. The simulation results show positive long-run effects of the reform on labour supply, output, consumption and the capital stock as well as reduced pension expenditures. The reform generates large short-run welfare gains for older generations of low- and middle-income households due primarily to the increased maximum pension. The reform is potentially Pareto improving, yielding a small aggregate efficiency gain.","[Woodland, Alan D.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Woodland, AD (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.woodland@unsw.edu.au,"Woodland, Alan/AAG-6239-2020; Woodland, Alan/J-9157-2012","Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Kudrna, George/0000-0002-7553-0618",,,,,17,13,13,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Development Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations. The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order. The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time before they reach the end of their lists. These observations suggest a simple strategy for testing whether personal solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the beginning, ceteris paribus. If so, then a marginal personal solicitation matters. Our main finding is that the location in the alphabet - and hence, a marginal personal solicitation - has a strong effect on the probability of making a gift. A rough estimate of the elasticity of the probability of giving with respect to the probability of receiving a personal solicitation is 0.15. However, there is no statistically discernible effect on the amount given, conditional on donating. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, the evolution of social welfare can be distinguished between two different regimes that arise naturally during the process of economic development. At relatively early stages, status concerns are inactive and welfare increases following the rising consumption of normal goods. During the later stages, however, individuals engage in some type of status competition that does not allow consumption to improve their well-being: their welfare actually declines as successive generations of agents increase labour effort at the expense of leisure.

The estimated coefficients using FMOLS, DOLS, and PMG are 0.38, 0.58, and 0.36, respectively, for the sample as a whole for the period from 1970 to 2006. These results confirm previous studies' findings that capital was relatively mobile in African countries compared to OECD countries. In addition, our study shows that there are marked differences in savings retention coefficients for different country groups in Africa (CFA franc zone and non-CFA franc zone countries, oil-producing and non-oil-producing countries, civil law and common law countries). These results have some policy implications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However these tests all specify a unit root under the null hypothesis against a stationary alternative, such as in the paper by Lee and Chang (2008), making the two theories of unemployment mutually exclusive over the sample period. This paper moves away from this dichotomy by allowing for switches between hysteresis and the natural rate theory using the recently developed test of Leybourne, Kim and Taylor (2007). We find that in countries like the United Kingdom, the natural rate theory is detected in the post-World War Two period of stabilisation: the time leading up to the seminal works of Friedman and Phelps. Hysteresis is found over the First World War and Great Depression periods, and in the period from the 1970s; a time characterised by rising trade union power. We also compute numerical measures of persistence using grid-bootstrap estimates of the autoregressive parameter, following Hansen (1999). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We modify the standard, synchronous-action, model by supposing that players observe an underlying public signal of the opponent's actions at random and privately known times. In one modification, the public signals are Poisson events and either the observations occur within a small epsilon time interval or the observations have exponential waiting times. In the second modification, the underlying signal is the position of a diffusion process. We show that in the Poisson cases the high-frequency limit is the same as in the Fudenberg and Levine (2007, 2009) study of limits of high-frequency public signals, but that the limits can differ when the signals correspond to a diffusion.

Everyone is initially endowed with an information item that he is the only player to hold. Players are offered a finite number of periods to centralize the initially dispersed items in the hands of any one member of the network. In every period, each agent strategically chooses whether or not to transmit the items he holds to his neighbors in the network. The sooner all the items are gathered by any individual, the better it is for the group of players as a whole. Besides, the agent who first centralizes all the items is offered an additional reward that he keeps for himself. In this framework where information transmission is strategic and physically restricted, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a group to pool information items in every equilibrium. This condition is independent of the network structure. The architecture of links however affects the time needed before items are centralized in equilibrium. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In light of developing Asia's dependence on imported oil and food, we can expect higher global food and oil prices to result in higher domestic consumer prices in the region. However, the actual impact of the global commodity shocks on consumer price inflation in developing Asia depends on a number of other factors, including government policy measures. The objective of this paper is to examine empirically the extent of the pass-through of global food and oil prices to domestic consumer prices in nine countries in the region. The main empirical result is that the magnitude of the pass-through has been limited. Government policy measures, for example, subsidies and price controls, played a role in reducing or delaying the pass-through of oil and food price increases to domestic prices.","[Jongwanich, Juthathip] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, Bangkok, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Jongwanich, J (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Technol, Sch Management, Bangkok, Thailand.",,,,,,,,8,27,29,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The framework features two sectors: the first uses labor to purify water, while the second uses labor and purified water for irrigation to produce an agricultural consumption good. Purified water can also be used as potable water for drinking purposes. The planner allocates the available factors of production between the two sectors every period, and determines the optimal amounts of purified water, potable water, and irrigation water. The geometry characterizes the optimal path depending on whether the irrigation sector is more labor intensive than the purification sector. When the irrigation sector is labor intensive, the optimal path is a non converging cycle around the golden rule stock of purified water, while if the purification sector is labor intensive, there is a damped cyclical convergence to the golden rule stock.","[Khalifa, Sherif] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Hurcan, Ihsan Kaler] Mitsui & Co Europe PLC, London EC4R 9AJ, England",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Khalifa, S (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",skhalifa@fullerton.edu; i.hurcan@mitsui.com,,,,,,,18,1,1,1,9,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

This article studies and compares results from three possible supply chain scenarios, (1) Manufacturer Stackelberg, (2) Retailer Stackelberg, and (3) Vertical Nash. This research concludes that consumers receive higher service level when every channel member possesses equal bargaining power (e.g., Vertical Nash). An interesting result shows that as the market base of one product increases, the competitor also benefits but at a lesser amount than the manufacturer of the first product. Furthermore, when one manufacturer has some economic advantage in providing service, the retailer will act to separate market segment by selling the product with low-cost/lower-quality service at a low price and selling the product with high-cost/high-quality service at a high price. The results and the modeling approach are useful references for managerial decisions and administrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

(1977). The tradeoff between the efficiency gain and coordination cost in production determines the efficient level of division of labor. Consequently, the traditional comparative advantage becomes endogenous. The model is able to explain how the recent progress in information technology (IT) would affect the efficient level of division of labor and competitive margin. In particular, we show that absolute advantage in division of labor and relative labor supply play a crucial role in determining the different effects of universal IT progress on a country's competitive margin in international trade.","Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Yu, ZH (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",zhihao_yu@carleton.ca,,,,,,,25,1,3,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Countries decide whether to establish free-trade links while firms decide whether and with whom to form RJVs. A double-layer pairwise stability concept is introduced to characterize equilibrium network structures. In contrast with conventional wisdom, it is shown that global free trade generally reduces collaborative R&D levels. We give conditions for which pairwise stable R&D networks are welfare maximizing. Stability and efficiency are congruent when R&D cost is either too high or too low.

These experiments, however, were conducted using hypothetical questions. To test whether the relative thinking bias also exists in real-world situations, a field experiment where subjects could purchase either a bagel or a bagel with cream cheese was conducted. The monetary addition for the cream cheese was kept constant ($0.20) in both treatments, but the bagel's price varied ($0.05 in one treatment and $0.30 in the other). Relative thinking then implies that more people should add the cream cheese when the bagel's price is higher, because the relative price increase for the cream cheese is then smaller. However, the results did not document any relative thinking-more people (in percentage of those who purchase) added the cream cheese when the bagel's price was lower (the difference between the treatments, however, was not statistically significant). A replication of the experiment as a hypothetical-scenario experiment did document relative thinking, suggesting that introduction of financial incentives might alleviate relative thinking.

Exposure to electricity in early adulthood and children-ever-born are negatively correlated for the relevant cohorts. The Amish, who used modern technologies much less than other US households, experienced a coincident baby boom.

We identify a separability condition on monotone preferences that is necessary and sufficient for one's own demand to be independent of the allocations and characteristics of other agents in the economy. Given separability, it is impossible to identify ORPs from market behaviour: agents behave as if they had classical preferences that depend only on own consumption in competitive equilibrium. If preferences, in addition, depend only on the final allocation of consumption in society, the Second Welfare Theorem holds as long as any increase in resources can be distributed in a way that makes all agents better off. The First Welfare Theorem generally does not hold.

There are two types of physicians: loyal physicians always prescribe first the product-line extension and then either the off-patent drug or a generic drug while the non-loyal ones prescribe taking into account the prices of the drugs. We consider a two-stage game. In the first stage, the incumbent firm decides the level of innovation. In the second-stage, all firms decide sequentially their prices, with the incumbent firm acting as a Stackelberg leader. We find two equilibria in the pricing-decision game. For relatively large levels of innovation, the incumbent firm competes for the price-sensitive physicians. However, for low levels of innovation, the incumbent firm prefers to exploit the loyal physicians and to charge the monopoly price.

In the Bernard et al. (2007) tradition, statistics describe the prevalence of trading activity, typology of firms by internationalisation, and concentration of trade volume within and across sectors both for exports and imports. There are several similarities as well as differences to key US and EU findings. Trade concentration in Hungary is slightly higher than in most European countries and foreign ownership and the role of foreign firms in trade is higher. Furthermore, firm heterogeneity is also studied in terms of traded products as well as partner countries. While the share of single-product exporters is similar to the US, there are certainly fewer Hungarian single-country exporters. With some transition-related differences, we find Hungarian trade activity to broadly match most open economy evidence. Throughout the paper, we use the IEHAS-CEFiG Hungary dataset, an almost universal panel of balance sheet information (1992-2006) merged with firm-product-country level customs data (1992-2003) taken until the 2004 EU accession.

However, they have now expanded their analysis to encompass renewable sources, such as corn and soybeans, under the current low-carbon biofuel obligations. This paper employs GARCH(1,1) and ARJI models to estimate the one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) of the optimal dynamic biofuel portfolio, which consists of crude oil, corn and soybeans. The optimal blended standard is subject to the dual limitations of minimum production costs and the lowest biofuel using requirements. Our empirical findings confirm that the ARJI model is more suitable than the GARCH (1,1) model and further captures the discontinuous jump behavior from the in-the-sample data. The results of out-of-sample forecasts also are represented that our models play important roles in VaR estimation and risk management for biofuel portfolio. We therefore suggest that the petroleum companies should simultaneously pay attention to jump risk in hedging material costs in the prices of energy-related crops. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Favorable tax treatment of owner occupied housing in the form of home mortgage interest and property tax deductibility, and the untaxed nature of imputed rents, provides a financial incentive for home-ownership over renting as well as an incentive to over-consume housing since houses are not fungible. Since the favorable tax treatment of housing disproportionately creates tax savings for the upper quantiles of the income distribution, we quantify how it contributes to the heavily right skewed distribution of wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. We consider a revenue-neutral government response to the counter factual experiments of removing the current tax structure on housing. Our quantitative analysis shows that, in terms of distributional effects, removing all of the preferential tax treatments results in an aggregate increase in welfare. However, we do not find any reduction in inequality. We also find that while some re-allocation toward financial assets occurs, households primarily increase their consumption when imputed housing rents are taxed and the property tax deduction is removed. Thus housing tax policy may be effective at encouraging more overall saving through housing assets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The procedure does not require item-specific price/unit value data and price index numbers can be calculated from consumer expenditure data grouped by per capita income/total consumer expenditure class in a situation where unit level data are not available. To illustrate the method, we use published state-specific data of the 50th round (1993-94) and 55th round (1999-2000) consumer expenditure surveys of India's National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) and calculate the spatial consumer price index numbers for 15 major states of India, with All-India taken as base, separately for the rural and the urban sector for each round.","[Chattopadhyay, Somnath] Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, Kolkata 700108, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Chattopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India.",pikluchatterjee@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,23,24,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Although there were important innovations in the Upper Paleolithic, evidence from paleodemography indicates that population densities were driven more by climatic conditions than by technological innovations in food acquisition. We develop a model in which technological knowledge is subject to mutation and selection across generations. In a static environment, long run stagnation is the norm. However, climate shocks can induce experimentation with latent resources. This generates punctuated equilibria with greater technical capabilities and higher population densities at successive plateaus. The model is consistent with archaeological data on climate, population, diet, and technology from the Upper Paleolithic through the early Neolithic. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The factor decomposition of disposable income into single income components shows that capital income is exceedingly volatile and that its share in disposable income has risen recent years. Moreover, capital income makes a disproportionately high contribution to overall inequality in relation to its share in disposable income. This applies to Germany and the USA in particular. Thus capital income accounts for a large part of disparity in all three countries.","[Fraessdorf, Anna; Schwarze, Johannes] Univ Bamberg, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, Fak Sozial & Wirtschaftswissensch, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Grabka, Markus M.; Schwarze, Johannes] German Inst Econ Res, DIW Berlin SOEP, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Grabka, Markus M.] TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schwarze, Johannes] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Frässdorf, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, Fak Sozial & Wirtschaftswissensch, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",fraessdorf@uni-bamberg.de; mgrabka@diw.de; johannes.schwarze@uni-bamberg.de,,,,,,,49,22,22,0,13,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Substitution of oil for power generation and heating has progressed since the 1970s, but substitution of oil in transport remains elusive. This paper examines the progress of clean energy and compares the unfolding co-evolution of technologies, markets and institutions with what we know about substitution of oil and technological paradigm shifts. While the rhetoric in favour of clean energy is strong, technologies, policies, and supportive infrastructure investments are still in a formative stage. The transformative process will evolve over the next 10-20 years and change irreversibly the demand dynamics for oil. Although decline in the demand for oil is not imminent, the impact of the clean energy transition on international oil is evident, even now. High oil prices accelerate commitment, policies, and market prospects for clean energy options and speed up the market-readiness of substitutes for oil. While 20 years appears a long time for the development and scale-up of alternatives to oil, it is a short period in the context of the required paradigm shift. For international oil, it is well within the time frame for resource rent optimization, strategic planning, and investment decisions.

This paper examines whether the implementation of immediate fiscal austerity during a fragile economic recovery is justified and whether it is the best means of achieving deficit reduction. The paper points out that although the austerity strategy can lead to deficit reduction and prevent insolvency in the case of an indebted individual, this may not necessarily be the outcome in the case of national indebtedness. The problem is accentuated when austerity measures are replicated in many interdependent economies. The paradox is in general valid when it is assumed that fiscal policy is effective and that fiscal multipliers are positive, assumptions that the New Consensus Macroeconomics theoretical framework that underpins the austerity strategy, inappropriately, rejects. The overall conclusion is that synchronized fiscal austerity cannot solve the problem of ballooning public debts that need to be tackled in conjunction with attempts to reform the international banking and financial system.","Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, London W1R 8AL, England",University of Westminster,"Kitromilides, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, London W1R 8AL, England.",,"Bracaite, Edita/A-6100-2012",,,,,,26,13,16,1,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0160-3477,,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The adopted framework allows to analyze interdependence by estimating volatility spillovers, and also contagion by testing for possible shifts in the transmission of volatility following the introduction of the euro and EU accession. Further evidence on possible changes in the transmission mechanism (namely, on whether there is contagion) can be obtained by examining the conditional correlations implied by the estimated model over different time periods. The empirical findings suggest that there is significant co-movement (interdependence) of these CEEC markets with both the Russian and the UK ones. Furthermore, whilst the introduction of the euro has had mixed effects, EU accession has resulted in an increase in volatility spillovers between the three CEECs considered and the UK (contagion).","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria; Spagnolo, Nicola] Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, London UB8 3PH, England",Brunel University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk; Nicola.Spagnolo@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,22,22,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

More precisely, we analyse the determinants of the differences in the efficiency levels of conservation activity of the nine Sicilian heritage authorities over the period 1993-2005. Economic, political and managerial variables are used to distinguish nondiscretionary from discretionary causes. The results show that the efficiency scores seem to be affected by economic and political factors, whereas the managerial variables do not affect the performance of heritage authorities.","[Castro, Massimo Finocchiaro] Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Law & Social Sci, I-85100 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Guccio, Calogero; Rizzo, Ilde] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-95121 Catania, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria; University of Catania,"Castro, MF (通讯作者)，Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Law & Social Sci, Via Tommaso Campanella 38-A, I-85100 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",massimo.finocchiaro@unirc.it; guccio@unict.it; rizzor@unict.it,"Guccio, Calogero/M-4127-2015","Guccio, Calogero/0000-0002-1053-4968; FINOCCHIARO CASTRO, Massimo/0000-0001-6598-204X",,,,,26,23,24,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

As a conclusion, The counterproposal of the issuing bank is as follows. Firstly, a more adequate procedure is requested for the required documents to be forwarded to the issuing bank by two subsequent courier parcels. Secondly, if documents are lost, an issuing bank should request copies. of documents and data on the sending method from the nominated bank and securely check them They also have to request evidence about the date of presentation of the documents and the expiry date of the L/C and check if the documents were lost in transit. Thirdly, an issuing bank should cooperate with an applicant's L/G request and suggest that an applicant make a request to the shipping company to cancel the L/G. Also a nominated bank should fulfill the conditions and terms of the. L/C and maintain copies of complying documents presented under the L/C in order to be protected under the second paragraph of Article 35. Also, when a nominated bank is required to send the copies of documents, they should perform, it quickly, comply with the sending manners and methods and maintain the evidence for this action. For an applicant, he should request an L/G.

The consequences of the bursting of this financial bouble were currency and banking crises, collapsing asset prices, mass unenployment and large fiscal deficits. There are some lessons which can be learnt by analyzing these events, and they are presented in this paper.

The algorithms differ substantially in terms of speed and accuracy, and a clear trade-off exists between the two. Perturbation methods are very fast but invoke large approximation errors except at points close to the steady state; the projection methods considered are accurate on a large area of the state space but are very slow for specifications with many state variables; stochastic simulation methods have lower accuracy than projection methods, but their computational cost increases only moderately with the state-space dimension. Simulated series generated by different methods can differ noticeably, but only small differences are found in unconditional moments of simulated variables. On the basis of our comparison, we identify the factors that account for differences in accuracy and speed across methods, and we suggest directions for further improvement of some approaches.

Using US consumer price index microdata to track inventory shortfalls, I find that taking on high financial leverage increases shortfalls. Highly leveraged firms appear to be degrading their products' quality in order to preserve current cash flow for debt service. Although reducing quality can erode both current sales and customer loyalty firms appear to be willing to risk these outcomes in order to achieve benefits associated with debt finance.

The factors behind this dramatic surge are varied and, to an extent, remain contested, although fundamental shifts in patterns of demand, the effects of climate change, and the greater use of grains and oilseeds as fuel substitutes played a major role. Financial factors, including asset-price bubbles in commodity-backed securities, may also have played a role. As more recent events suggest, the era of high and volatile food prices is likely to persist which demands a better understanding of the economics and political economy of food price shocks in low-income economies. The papers in this volume, drawn from an AERC conference in May 2009, examine key issues in the origins and consequences of the recent global food price surge and seek to identify the public policy lessons for government and their international partners.","[Adam, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Ajakaiye, Olu] AERC, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Oxford; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Adam, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",christopher.adam@economics.ox.ac.uk; olusanya.ajakaiye@aercafrica.org,,,,,,,2,5,5,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The evidence shows that agreements produce a remarkable reshuffling of voting power (Shapley value) among participants. In particular, the first owner gains much voting power at low levels of ownership concentration, and his gain is decreasing in his ownership stake; the opposite happens for the other participants. In addition, the likelihood that a supermajority rule is included in an agreement contract is increasing in the first owner's share of equity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that agreements are used to correct situations where the first owner's power is at one of the two extremes: either too low (leading to insufficient monitoring over managers and gridlocks in decision-making) or too high (enabling him to extract large private benefits of control).","Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Baglioni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",angelo.baglioni@unicatt.it,,,,,,,20,6,9,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that in such an environment, which more or less characterises most Eastern European countries, neoclassical theoretical motives do not provide sufficient (endogenous) incentives for shareholders and managers to manage risk within their firms. We argue that the compulsory use of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) disclosure requirements induces managers to actively analyse and manage risks. We see this exogenous push as a necessary but unfortunately not a sufficient mechanism to induce managers to manage risk within their firms since managers perceive the reporting requirements primarily as cost-enhancing. We argue that, in order to endogenise the incentives, governments need to create market conditions in which managers will also see the added value of risk management.

Reputation builder behavior is more predictable than implied by equilibrium, and so reputation information has more economic value than implied by equilibrium.

Our TFP measure does not assume technical or allocative efficiency which are inherent drawbacks of usual TFP indices. We show that catching-up processes can be very different between sub-periods and across countries. A significant catching-up process was in progress in the manufacturing sector between 1970 and 1986, then it overturned over the period 1987 to 2001. During the first sub-period, the speed of technological catching-up of the Eurozone countries was definitely higher than those of the other European or OECD nations, whereas the divergence noted in the second sub-period had the same order of magnitude amongst the three groups.","[Briec, Walter] Univ Perpignan, LAMPS, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Boussemart, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lille 3, Sch Management, LEM IESEG, Lille, France; [Tavera, Christophe] Univ Rennes, Dept Econ, CREM, Rennes, France",Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; IESEG School of Management; Universite de Rennes,"Briec, W (通讯作者)，Univ Perpignan, LAMPS, Via Domitia, F-66025 Perpignan, France.",briec@univ-perp.fr,"BRIEC, Walter/JQI-6978-2023; Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/X-3545-2019","Boussemart, Jean-Philippe/0000-0001-7932-6940",,,,,24,3,3,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This suggests that trade policies can increase knowledge spillovers from abroad. Public support to R&D can be motivated both by positive internal knowledge externalities and by its ability to expand absorptive capacity. This dynamic, empirical, general equilibrium analysis models these interplays between R&D, trade and productivity. It compares public R&D support and export promotion of R&D based products with respect to long term growth and welfare impacts. We find that export promotion is inferior to R&D support in spurring R&D. However, it is not outperformed in terms of welfare generation. The reason is that existing and politically persistent policy interventions create inefficiencies that can be counteracted by R&D-based export promotion as a second-best policy.","[Bye, Brita; Faehn, Taran] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Gruenfeld, Leo A.] Menon Business Econ, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Bye, B (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",bby@ssb.no; tfn@ssb.no; leo@menon.no,,,,,,,65,10,10,0,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

To account for this sequence of events, this paper constructs a model where excessive risk-taking by investors leads to a bubble in asset prices, and where the supply of credit to these investors is endogenous. We show that the interplay between excessive risk-taking and the endogeneity of credit may give rise to multiple equilibria associated with different levels of lending, asset prices, and output. Stochastic equilibria lead, with positive probability, to an inefficient liquidity dry-up, a market crash, and widespread failures by borrowers. The possibility of multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling crises is shown to be related to the severity of the risk-shifting problem in the economy.","[Challe, Edouard] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Challe, E (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",edouard.challe@polytechnique.edu; xavier.ragot@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,8,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This article employs the contract mechanism to analyse environmental protection effects when the central government directly subsidizes the local governments. The results reveal that subsidies from the central government are not only unable to solve the problem of the inconsistent investment preferences among the central and local governments but also induce the free-riding behaviour of local governments. Because of the free-riding behaviour of the local governments, there is no such equilibrium in which the central government prefers the sequential investment mode while the local governments prefer the simultaneous investment mode.","[Chang, Ming-Chung] Kainan Univ, Dept Risk Management, Luchu, Taiwan; [Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Kainan Univ, Dept Risk Management, Luchu, Taiwan.",changmc@mail.knu.edu.tw,"Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019; Chang, Ming-Chung/AAY-2919-2021","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935; Chang, Ming-Chung/0000-0001-9249-0489",,,,,24,6,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I capture heterogeneity by postulating two skill levels: high and low. All low-skill workers can produce in only low-skill jobs, whereas some high-skill workers can produce in both high-and low-skill jobs. My analysis highlights the importance of a vertical type of transitory skill mismatch, in which workers accept jobs below their skill level to escape unemployment and upgrade by on-the-job search, in explaining why employment is typically lower and more procyclical at lower skill levels. The model is also consistent with other important features of the labor market, such as a procyclical rate of job-to-job transitions and evidence on cyclical changes in the composition of job quality. In recessions outflows from unemployment shift the distribution of high-skill workers toward low-skill jobs, while expansions allow them to upgrade to high-skill jobs through job-to-job transitions.","Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Chassamboulli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.",andricha@ucy.ac.cy,,"Chassamboulli, Andri/0000-0001-7831-6732",,,,,48,6,6,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The number of products, qualities, prices, and the extent of the market coverage are endogenously determined. We show that when unit costs of quality improvement are increasing and quadratic, each firm has an incentive to provide a disconnected set of similar qualities approximating a continuum. The finding contrasts sharply with the single-quality outcome when the market coverage is exogenously determined. We also show that allowing for multiple qualities intensifies the level of competition, lowers the profit of each firm, and raises the consumer surplus and the social welfare in comparison to the single-quality duopoly.","[Cheng, Yi-Ling] Tunghai Univ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Cheng, Yi-Ling; Peng, Shin-Kun] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; [Peng, Shin-Kun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tabuchi, Takatoshi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",Tunghai University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; University of Tokyo,"Cheng, YL (通讯作者)，Tunghai Univ, Taichung, Taiwan.",ylcheng@thu.edu.tw; speng@econ.sinica.edu.tw; ttabuchi@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We compute three different measures of volatility for European Union Allowances, based on daily data (EGARCH model), option prices (implied volatility), and intraday data (realized volatility). Based on the methodology developed by Zeileis et al. (2003) and Zeileis (2006), we detect instability in the volatility of carbon prices based on two kinds of tests: retrospective tests (OLS-/Recursive-based CUSUM processes, F-statistics, and residual sum of squares), and forward-looking tests (by monitoring structural changes recursively or with moving estimates). We show evidence of strong shifts mainly for the EGARCH and IV models during the time period. Overall, we suggest that yearly compliance events, and growing uncertainties in post-Kyoto international agreements, may explain the instability in the volatility of carbon prices.

Because of the complexity of the interaction between the nonlinearities and noise, a commonly used, often called indirect, approach to the study of HAMs combines theoretical analysis of the underlying deterministic skeleton with numerical analysis of the stochastic model. However, it is well known that this indirect approach may not properly characterise the nature of the stochastic model. This paper aims to tackle this issue by developing a direct and analytical approach to the analysis of a stochastic model of speculative price dynamics involving two types of agents, fundamentalists and chartists, and the market price equilibria of which can be characterised by the stationary measures of a stochastic dynamical system. Using the stochastic method of averaging and stochastic bifurcation theory, we show that the stochastic model displays behaviour consistent with that of the underlying deterministic model when the time lag in the formation of price trends used by the chartists is far away from zero. However, when this lag approaches zero, such consistency breaks down. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, the skill-biased impact of general outsourcing on labour productivity is larger than that of international outsourcing. Second, we find that the wage gap between skilled and unskilled labour, which is defined as their marginal productivity gap, can be better explained by general outsourcing than by international outsourcing. These two results imply that the wage inequality of US manufacturing industries during 2002-2005 was mainly due to the skill-biased labour productivity effect of general outsourcing rather than that of international outsourcing.","[Hur, Jung] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Chongvilaivan, Aekapol] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",Sogang University; National University of Singapore,"Hur, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Shinsu Dong, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",ecsjhur@sogang.ac.kr,"Chongvilaivan, Aekapol/W-7941-2019; Hur, Jung/AAV-7700-2021",,,,,,29,6,8,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In some works, the lack of fiscal dominance might simply reflect the non use of dynamic methods of estimation able to capture a delayed monetary response to deficits. Secondly, the survey shows how results depend significantly on the period under examination, making it convenient to consider breaks when dealing with long-term studies.
