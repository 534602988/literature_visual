The New Zealand government has taken this challenge one step further by incorporating it into country's legislation. As a consequence all road land transport authorities are committed to implementing initiatives to respond to both the challenge and the legislation. A benchmarking process for the transport sector is one of these initiatives on a national level. Benchmarking is a well known and utilised technology for the measuring of performance for infrastructure, for example within the water provision sector in England. This paper presents the development of a national benchmarking process for the transport sector of New Zealand. This development is part of a strategy to encourage road land transport authorities to improve the performance of transport in achieving sustainability and environmental targets. The development involved a literature review, proof of concept and the full implementation stage. A total of nine key performance indicators were developed to indicate the status of transport sector performance. The project and its outcomes are considered to be of benefit to road land transport authorities across the world who wish to develop a benchmark process of their own. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the trespassing cattle case (Ellickson in, Stanford Law Rev 38(3): 623-687, 1986) shows that neighbours do not refer to legal entitlements and settle their disputes without monetary transaction, which may be due, according to us, to other impediments to bargaining than transaction costs: some social norms prevent the market from developing. Such a market exists in the pollinating bees case (Cheung in, J Law Econ 16(1): 11-33, 1973), but we show that, if transactions over 'externalities' are facilitated, other externalities, which remain at its borders, are also handled with social norms.

We use Interpol arrest data and data on utilization of Interpol resources by member countries to compute counterfactual benefit measurements, which, when matched with costs, yield benefit-cost ratios. The average of these ratios is approximately 200 over 12 alternative counterfactual scenarios, so each dollar of Interpol counterterrorism spending returns approximately $200. This paper also puts forward a perspective on benefits derived from Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Document database. Interpol provides an inexpensive proactive measure against transnational terrorism that, unlike military operations, does not result in backlash attacks.","[Sandler, Todd; Arce, Daniel G.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Enders, Walter] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",,,,,,,,36,35,37,1,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The database is in continuous development and can be updated anytime through the introduction of new morphotypes based on information submitted by buyers (their dimensions values). In this paper is developed a method for searching the human dimensions in database by using similarity of human body shape. Clustering is the process of organizing a set of bodies into groups in a way that the bodies within the group are more similar to each other than they are to other bodies belonging to different clusters. In clustering the objects of similar properties are placed in one class of objects and a single access to the disk makes the entire class available. The objectives are to have comprehensive databases that centralize human body types using 3D scanning systems and types of products recommended for such objects using advanced production management systems Lectra.

When estimating from sample L-moments, L-moments are more robust to the presence of outliers in the data. Experience also shows that, compared to conventional moments, L-moments are less prone to bias of estimation. Parameter estimates obtained using L-moments are mainly in the case of small samples often even more accurate than estimates of parameters made by maximum likelihood method. Using the method of L-moments in the case of small data sets from the meteorology is primarily known in statistical literature. This paper deals with the use of L-moments in the case for large data sets of income distribution (individual data) and wage distribution (data are ordered to form of interval frequency distribution of extreme open intervals). This paper also presents a comparison of the accuracy of the method of L-moments with an accuracy of other methods of point estimation of parameters of parametric probability distribution in the case of large data sets of individual data and data ordered to form of interval frequency distribution.

But very often quality management techniques to control and monitor these optimized processes are not scheduled at that stage. Before the production line was not set up, quality management techniques are getting realized in the ramp-up phase or in the beginning of the series production. For this reason the production start-up is delayed seriously and high additional efforts are necessary, because many operational determinations have already been made so far and many basic conditions have to be accepted as unchangeable. Virtual Quality Management contains the capability for eliminating these severe deficits. Within this paper an overview will be given over the road map for the efficient set up quality-orientated process models and the reference model for developing virtual quality management techniques. Within the research work at the Chair Quality Management and Manufacturing Metrology in Erlangen ( Germany), different models have been created with an accuracy of more than 98 % in specific terms of condition.

The case of Barcelona metropolitan area (BMA) is particularly relevant following a rapid growth of immigrant population over a very short period. This empirical study seeks to see if this rapid growth has changed the spatial segregation patterns of immigrant groups and led to the emergence of ethnic enclaves. First, we calculate five indices according to the classic dimensions of residential segregation. Then, we use an adapted version of the Poulsen et al. typology in order to identify ethnic enclaves. In the period under study, there was a general increase in two dimensions: Exposure and clustering. There was a decline in evenness and concentration, and a variety of situations in terms of centralization. The evolution of the segregation indices indicates a diversity of segregation patterns: an increase of segregation according to exposure and clustering dimensions, a decline in evenness and concentration, and a variety of situations in terms of centralization. Finally, the findings confirm the presence of ethnic enclaves following seven years of growth in the immigrant population.","[Carles Martori, Joan] Univ Vic, Dept Econ & Business, Vic 08500, Spain; [Apparicio, Philippe] INRS Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada",Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC); University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Martori, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Vic, Dept Econ & Business, C Sagrada Familia 7, Vic 08500, Spain.",martori@uvic.cat; philippe.apparicio@ucs.inrs.ca,"Martori, Joan-Carles/K-8641-2014; Apparicio, Philippe/K-6086-2013","Martori, Joan-Carles/0000-0002-8400-5487; Apparicio, Philippe/0000-0001-6466-9342",,,,,77,24,25,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The SME cooperation framework combines in a unique model the three main dimensions involved in SME cooperation (strategic, management and social) with the internal and external factors influencing business collaboration. Using the developed framework, the author summarizes why SMEs should co-operate, the problems SMEs face adopting collaborative approaches and the factors influencing interfirm collaboration effectiveness. The findings of this work provide some important implications for managers concerned with adopting collaborative approaches. From a managerial perspective, it shows that co-operation between SMEs is a valid approach for improving their performance as long as the success factors are considered, which in turn, reduces the risk of alliance failure.","[Casals, Francesc Estanyol] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,,francesc.casals@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,3,3,0,8,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,118,124,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200025,0

In obtaining the composites, the use of recycled materials (rubber and plastics) represent a novel trend, providing tailored materials for sustainable products. Due to its properties, recycled rubber represents the matrix while PET is a promising reinforcing material because it has good mechanical properties, particularly in high-modulus and low shrinkage. However, PET is a relatively inert polymer, with insufficient adhesion to rubbers. Therefore, a third component is necessary to enhance adhesion between PET fibers and rubber. The compatibility can be obtained using another polymer, such as high density polyethylene (HDPE). The use of fly ash (another waste material) proved to be beneficial for the mechanical properties of the composite material, also supporting the novel concept of product design and development, using 100% wastes. By adding wood to these composites the properties can be further tailored for indoor and outdoor applications, especially for building components and products for inner design.

Finally, we draw attention to the dynamic and evolving characteristics of eco-innovation systems that result from recurrent re-specifications of the problem in focus, as partial solutions emerge and as the political and economic dimensions are reframed.","[Gee, Sally; McMeekin, Andrew] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [McMeekin, Andrew] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Gee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",sally.gee@mbs.ac.uk,,"McMeekin, Andrew/0000-0001-5392-8361",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E019188/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E019188/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,35,39,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This study seeks to expand our understanding of the Tbilisi population's urban transport attitudes and behavior. It elaborates on the perceived strengths, weaknesses, and potentials of the public transport system, and seeks to understand the reasons for the increased use of private automobiles. A questionnaire survey was conducted among Tbilisi car drivers (n=159) and public transport users (n=163). The results show that most of the survey respondents preferred to use a private car and avoid using public transport. Particularly important factors include time issues such as schedules and frequency, plus comfort and safety issues. Tbilisi residents value their time and want to use it efficiently. Changing residents' travel behavior will require making the public transport options competitive with the perceived advantages of the car. The study offers recommendations for more effective urban transport policy, including incentives to encourage greater use of public transport in Tbilisi. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A high degree of education and culture and the facilities provided by the industries of communication give now the new shape of the current society. The new economic and social reality imposes changes in all fields of activity and the landmark of each action is knowledge. In a knowledge-based society, exports get a new feature. The importance of exports grows higher and higher, especially of those that which include knowledge, whichever its form. Exports have always represented a factor of economic growth and development; moreover, in the knowledge-based society and in the context of an intense economic crisis at the world level, they have become an anchor and grant hope for recovery and rebalance, especially to the developing countries. Knowledge allows the creation of high technique products, in a wide range and with low production costs and which, advantageously capitalized on the external market, stimulate the economic growth and development; that aspect has been factually demonstrated a few decades ago by some Asian states known as the Asian tigers. Right when exportation, as a factor of economic growth and development, started to be regarded as outdated, the world economic crisis and the booming of knowledge bring it back to the attention of theorists and practitioners, transforming it into a primary element of the macro-economic and regional policies.","[Haller, Alina-Petronela] Acad Romana, Iasi Branch, Iasi, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,,hallalina@yahoo.com,"Haller, Alina/P-2459-2019","Haller, Alina/0000-0002-2069-9889",,,,,4,1,1,0,2,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,513,516,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900129,0

Striking problems in approaching a wrong lifestyle nation-wide are highlighted, by underlining the weight won of unnatural or over-processed food products as a result of income growth. A critical analysis of food consumption is made and health implications of its qualitative depreciation are identified. The results show that consumption of food products is closely linked to income variation. When the level of average income increases, people extend their purchase to some products less natural or over-processed: non-alcoholic beverages, beer, fish products etc. The findings have implications for predictions made based on the types of products that have greater importance in the daily basket and that can characterize dietary patterns in Romania.","[Ion, R.

Sovereign credit rating announcements from three major credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) are examined. Event study methodology is employed to estimate the price reaction on the announcement day. Results indicate that both downgrades and upgrades of one CEE country have an economically significant price impact on the stock markets of other CEE countries.

Dynamic model specifications for the parameters in the model are not required. We show that signal extraction based on Kalman filtering and smoothing can be made dependent on time-varying sample spectra. Our new procedure starts with specifying the time-varying spectrum as a semi-parametric flexible spline function that can be formulated in state space form and can be treated by multivariate Kalman filter and smoothing methods. Next we show how a time series decomposition model can be made dependent on a time-varying sample spectrum in a frequency domain analysis. The key insight is that the spectral likelihood function depends on the sample spectrum. The estimates of the model parameters are obtained by maximizing the spectral likelihood function. A time-varying sample spectrum leads to a time-varying spectral likelihood and hence we obtain time-varying parameter estimates. The time series decomposition model with the resulting time-varying parameters reflect the time-varying spectrum accurately. This approach to model-based signal extraction includes a bootstrap procedure to compute confidence intervals for the time-varying parameter estimates. We illustrate the methodology by presenting a business cycle analysis for three quarterly US macroeconomic time series between 1947 and 2010. The empirical study provides strong evidence that the cyclical properties of macroeconomic time series have been changing over time.

Finally, it integrates the innovation approaches with the service elements and constructs a new and practical approaches system that can guide and speed service enterprises to innovate.","[Li Jiabin] Henan Inst Engn, Dept Business & Management, Zhengzhou 451191, Peoples R China",,,ljbzzei@126.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-10-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,89,95,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBA19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306259300011,0

Students of three elementary schools, namely Yangmingshan, Sanyu and Shilin, all located in the Shilin District of Taipei, were chosen to provide sample data. The negative binomial regression model and multinomial logit model were used to analyze trip generation and travel mode, respectively. This study reached the following empirical findings: (1) mixed land use, employment density, walkway quality, leisure facility supply and leisure travel distance encouraged generation of leisure trips for children; (2) intersection density, building density, employment density and walkway quality encouraged a child to use transit systems or non-motorized travel modes for leisure travel; and (3) vehicle density and leisure travel distance discouraged walking and biking but encouraged the use of transit systems for leisure travel involving children. Local government can use the empirical findings of this study to develop urban planning strategies to encourage children to perform leisure activities outside the home using transit systems or non-motorized travel modes.

This method is based on OECD Employment Outlook 2009 and 2010 methodology consistent with Davis and Haltiwanger (1999). We use the employment by time since job started indicator provided in quarterly data as proxy for job tenure in view to calculate the annual hiring flows (number of hiring into a year). We calculate the annual values for: workers hiring flows, workers separation flows, workers total reallocation flows and workers excess reallocation flows in both its relative and absolute (levels) dimensions broken down by the marginal employment age groups [15-24 years] as entrance group, [50-64 years] as exit group as well as for [15-64] years active age group. The provided data permit us to calculate these values for the years 2008 and 2009, for Romania as well for other European countries. The effect of economic crises as a global demand shock from the gross worker flows values obtained for the analysed years for the interest groups is presented as a secondary contextual result. The management decision to hire/dismiss is strongly conditioned by a changing environment that is lately globally affected by common factors as the intergenerational skills mobility under the technological change.

Education institutions play a significant role for business start-ups and should be able to react on actual needs of entrepreneurship education. This paper is focused on problems of entrepreneurial education and linkages between entrepreneurship education and development of entrepreneurship and competitiveness in the Czech Republic. The level of entrepreneurship education and its influence on entrepreneurship development is evaluated thanks to authors' empirical research realized in the year 2010. For this research was used questionnaire method divided in two parts and focused on two respondent groups. Respondents of the first questionnaire were university students with business education. This survey was aimed to relations of university students to entrepreneurship and evaluation of provided school education and its contribution to entrepreneurial skills development. The second questionnaire was carried out by Czech enterprises and was focused on the preparation of the graduates for practice. The aim was to discover the main missing entrepreneurial knowledge and skills. The obtained results were compared with similar existing surveys in the Europe, especially with Eurobarometer. The survey results shown that the level of entrepreneurship education in the Czech Republic ( neither generally in the European Union) is not so positively evaluated. A significant part of interviewing graduates does not feel that provided education influences their interest in entrepreneurship activities. The majority of them prefer a status of an employee than an entrepreneur. They feel to have lack of entrepreneurial competency. Since last years there has been implemented several activities at the Czech universities in order to support graduate entrepreneurs but still it seems not have such extent and system access as at some foreign institutions. There is missing a comprehensive conception of entrepreneurship education and general education system that leads to entrepreneurship behaviour development in the Czech Republic. The entrepreneurship education is provided at some universities on the base of individual access. The survey results demonstrated the insufficient integration of entrepreneurial skills education into education systems in the Czech Republic. Not only the state should react to these facts by creation of entrepreneurship development politics, but especially each university should consider a crucial factors and methods of entrepreneurship education. It must be still considered that investments to the human capital are the decisive factor of competitiveness. Finally, there are stated the recommendation for entrepreneurship education development at the universities in the Czech Republic. Especially, the idea of business incubators aimed to graduate entrepreneurs is discussed.","[Prochazkova, Petra Tausl; Horova, Michaela] Univ W Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,pprochaz@rek.zcu.cz; mhorova@kfu.zcu.cz,"Prochazkova, Petra Tausl/I-5990-2016; Krechovská, Michaela/C-5510-2016",,,,,,9,5,5,1,22,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,737,741,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800088,0

The purpose is that of exploring the sources of resistance to change, its main forms of manifestation and solutions to overcome the resistance behavior, based on the case of a Romanian governmental agency facing resistance to a technological change. Prior work: The reform in the Romanian public administration has been a subject extensively discussed by academics and the community at large, the need for better performing public institutions being acknowledged by all these parties. The Total Quality Management (TQM), Common Assessment Framework (CAF) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) are the main frameworks mentioned in this context. Adopting these frameworks is not easy, as resistance to change is common, according to a UCRAP (Central Unit for Public Administration Reform in Romania) research on change management. Methodology: While the resistance to change in Romanian public institutions is acknowledged, little evidence exists on qualitative aspects such as actual forms of resistance behavior, causes for resistance and practical ways to overcome them. The authors employ the action research method, in order to capture and influence these aspects in an actual situation of technological change: a Romanian governmental agency adopting the BSC performance measurement and management system. Results: The action research allowed the authors (one of them being facilitator of the BSC implementation) to observe and address the internal resistance to adopting the new management system. The workshops and interviews conducted made possible the identification of resistance behavior, possible causes and improvement actions to overcome resistance in complying with the BSC system. Implications: While limited to a single organization under investigation, making the results not easily replicable, the research is relevant for academics, as starting point for further, more extensive studies and managers that aim to drive technological change in their institutions, pointing ahead key areas of possible resistance to change. Originality: Referring to a topic of major actuality in the Romanian public environment, the research stands out by the authors' actual involvement in the BSC adoption, enabling them a deep dive into the resistance to change, which ensures the high quality, accuracy and veracity of results.","[Racolta-Paina, Nicoleta-Dorina; Pop, Marius Dorel; Mone, Sorina-Diana] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,Nicoleta.Paina@euro.ubbcluj.ro; marius.pop@econ.ubbcluj.ro; sorina_md@yahoo.com,"Nicoleta Dorina, Racolta-Paina/C-6998-2015","Nicoleta Dorina, Racolta-Paina/0000-0002-1245-0223",,,,,15,0,0,0,9,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,529,532,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000133,0

There are also those which participate significantly in the Czech national export - these are the production of plastics and rubber commodities (DH), the metal industry (DJ), the optical and the electronics industries (DL), and the automotive industry (KM). The examination of comparative advantage dynamics consists of industry concentration, regional specialization, and the technology gap. Using data regarding sectoral employment by means of the relative Gini index of spatial concentration, we figure out the time scale of industrial concentration and development, with the aim to detect agglomeration or dispersion trends. Using the same data in another way, we calculate the modified Gini index of specialization with an aim to specify the respective industrial specialization in the NUTS3 regions. The technology gap is gathered by means of shift share analysis and represents regional technological convergence regarding the technological development of a selected benchmark. We also explore the possible causality of foreign direct investment and regional technological convergence, aimed at FDI contribution for regional development.

At the same time, uncertainty in the global marketplace has given rise to a fundamental change in innovation strategies, causing Open Innovation (OI) to develop into standard practice in many organizations. However, the focus of OI studies on large multinational companies (MNCs) has led to an unfortunate bias within the literature. This study addresses this gap in current research by analysing the sources of openness for innovation in the context of UK high-tech SMEs. Theoretically, the paper refers to the resource-based view and stresses the importance of internal capabilities in OI activities. The research is based on three case studies of SMEs in the Cambridge technopole region, a mature high-tech business eco-system in the East of England. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews as well as in-depth research into the case-companies. The data was then coded and categorised in order to identify common sources of openness for innovation. The main findings reveal that while SMEs are generally open towards OI activities key differences remain within the OI process compared to larger companies. Credibility and trustworthiness of external actors involved seems essential to OI implementation in SMEs. Moreover, sources of openness for innovation in SMEs seem to be rather external compared to MNCs, which benefit from a more sophisticated internal eco-system.

We claim that evaluation and its criteria, together with its linkage to research institutions' financing, are likely to affect the direction of research in a problematic way. As the Italian case documents, it is specifically economists who adopt unorthodox paradigms or pursue less diffused topics of research that should be concerned about research evaluation and its criteria. After outlining the recent practice of economic research in Italy and highlighting the relevant scope for pluralism that traditionally characterizes it, we analyze the publications submitted for evaluation to the VTR. By comparing these publications to all the entries in the EconLit database authored by economists located in Italy, we find a risk that the adopted ranking criteria may lead to disregarding historical methods in favor of quantitative and econometric methods, and heterodox schools in favor of mainstream approaches. Finally, by summarizing the current debate in Italy, we claim that evaluation should not be refused by heterodox economists, but rather that a reflection on the criteria of evaluation should be put forward at an international level in order to establish fair competition among research paradigms, thus, preserving pluralism in the discipline.","[Corsi, Marcella; D'Ippoliti, Carlo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social Econ Actuarial & Demog Studies, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Lucidi, Federico] Fdn Giacomo Brodolini, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Corsi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social Econ Actuarial & Demog Studies, Viale Regina Elena 295-E, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",marcella.corsi@uniroma1.it; carlo.dippoliti@uniroma1.it; lucidi@fondazionebrodolini.it,"D'Ippoliti, Carlo/GWU-7191-2022","D'Ippoliti, Carlo/0000-0003-4518-5523",,,,,21,33,35,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The recession probabilities of these models provide a clearer classification of the business cycle into expansion and recession periods, and superior performance in the ability to correctly call recessions and avoid false recession signals. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these models are far superior, as is their ability to signal recessions in a timely fashion.

We study whether the yield spread still qualifies as a useful predictor of real activity in the presence of structural change. Based on tests for multiple structural breaks, we find strong evidence of instability in the relationship between the yield spread and output growth, which allows us to pin down the exact dates associated with these breaks for the different countries. We find that the window selection methods recently developed for forecasting in the presence of structural change generally offer some improvements in terms of forecast accuracy.

However, such a big bang perspective misrepresents the sophistication of economic debates prior to Whitaker's report as well as distorting the interpretation of subsequent developments. This paper reappraises Irish economic thinking before and after the publication of Economic Development. It is argued that an economically liberal approach to Keynesianism, such as that favoured by T. K. Whitaker and George O'Brien, lost out in the 1960s to a more interventionist approach: only later did a more liberal approach to macroeconomic policy triumph. The rival approaches to academic economics were in turn linked to wider debates on the influence of religious authorities on Irish higher education. Academic economists were particularly concerned with preserving their intellectual independence and how a shift to planning would keep decisions on resource allocation out of the reach of conservative political and religious leaders.","Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Brownlow, G (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",graham.brownlowe@qub.ac.uk,"Brownlow, Graham/ISV-1857-2023","Brownlow, Graham/0000-0001-5715-5431",,,,,69,8,8,1,6,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

It was also found that the Standard & Poor's stock price index accounts for a significant portion of the variations in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's All Share index.

Furthermore, deal premiums are greater in selected industries and in smaller deal sizes.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Sonenshine, RM (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",RSonenshine@RSRMarketing.com,,"Sonenshine, Ralph/0000-0002-9923-4450",,,,,32,4,4,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This paper provides an inter-market comparison of the forecasting accuracy of bookmakers and a major betting exchange. Employing a dataset covering all football matches played in the major leagues of the Big Five (England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain) during three seasons (5478 games in total), we find evidence that the betting exchange provides more accurate predictions of a given event than bookmakers. A simple betting strategy of selecting bets for which bookmakers offer lower probabilities (higher odds) than the betting exchange generates above average, and in some cases even positive returns.

From a position of relative strength, with large surpluses and a low debt to GDP ratio, the Irish public finances have rapidly deteriorated, culminating in an Excessive Deficit Procedure being launched in early 2009. In hindsight, it is evident that tax revenues were on an unsustainable path in recent years due, in large part, to structural imbalances within the economy, mainly associated with the housing market. The excess growth in the latter culminated in large and transitory tax revenue windfalls, which ultimately proved unsustainable. These windfalls contributed to large general government and cyclically adjusted budget surpluses. This paper seeks to quantify the windfall gains associated with property taxes through modelling housing related tax receipts over the period 2002 to 2009. From this, estimates are derived as to the underlying or property adjusted fiscal position, which is found in various years, to have diverged greatly from actual outturns.",,,,diarmaid.smyth@centralbank.ie; kmcquinn@centralbank.ie,"McQuinn, Kieran/JCE-1122-2023","McQuinn, Kieran/0000-0003-0246-8179",,,,,19,13,13,0,5,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The first of these is stochastic search variable selection, which is an automatic model selection device that allows coefficients in a possibly over-parameterized VAR to be set to zero. The second extension allows for an unknown number of structural breaks in the VAR parameters. We investigate the in-sample and forecasting performance of our model in an application involving a commonly-used US macroeconomic data set. In a recursive forecasting exercise, we find moderate improvements over a standard VAR, although most of these improvements are due to the use of stochastic search variable selection rather than to the inclusion of breaks.

Despite the overall effectiveness of this method, it may allow forecasters to introduce biases in statistical forecasts when they judgmentally adjust them. This paper considers three types of bias: (1) optimism bias, (2) anchoring bias, and (3) overreaction bias. We explore the effects of particular individual differences, specifically personality, motivational orientation, and work locus of control, on forecasting biases. The results indicate that a forecaster's personality and motivational orientation have significant effects on forecasting biases, whereas work locus of control has no effect on forecasting biases. Our analysis further indicates that experience, work locus of control and motivational orientation drive a forecaster's willingness to judgmentally adjust a statistical forecast.

Companies in capital-intensive industries need to maintain a high level of capacity utilization in order to stay economically viable, however, their efforts to uphold the throughput of their systems often have the unforeseen and unintended consequence of limiting their ability to introduce new products and services. Nevertheless, some companies have managed to resolve these tensions by introducing what we describe as osecond-order innovationso, a type of innovation which acts on the innovation process itself and enables new products and services to be introduced without a steep decline in capacity utilization. By focusing on these cases and discussing their theoretical implications, we want to contribute to the existing literature on high throughput systems by identifying key mechanisms for introducing and maintaining such second-order innovations and describing the patterns of industrial evolution that they create.","[Gronning, Terje] Univ Oslo, Inst Educ Res, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Fevolden, Arne M.] Norwegian Def Res Estab, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway",University of Oslo; Norwegian Defence Research Establishment,"Gronning, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Inst Educ Res, PB 1092 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",terje.gronning@ped.uio.no,"Gronning, Terje/J-9241-2014","Gronning, Terje/0000-0002-8963-9948",,,,,80,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The stochastic frontier approach was used to estimate technical efficiency of both small- and medium-scale sawmills, while the ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis was used to estimate the determinants of the observed technical inefficiency.

It has a key role in the employment sector as well as in diversifying the economy due to the purchasing power of tourists. Tourism sector is also effected by globalising trends and the rapid and continuous changing demand of the tourism market is searching for more flexible reactions from the macro- and microenvironment. The accommodation market needs to meet these new expectations. Prior to the economic crisis, huge investments have been carried out within the hotel industry by foreign investors, creating a rapid growth within the supply market. Uniqueness and peculiarity were focused along with the investments to enlarge bed-place capacity. In the global market of new services, competitiveness is measured by quality, diversification and innovation. In most destinations local culture and local labourforce contribute to the success of tourism product. Spatial concentration is one of the characteristics of the Hungarian tourism supply and this is clearly seen also in the case of the distribution of public accommodation establishments. Hungary is a strongly seasonal country, especially if we do not consider spas and thermal springs and the capital, Budapest, which are visited during the whole year. Moreover, tourism is not only concentred in the summer season, but presents a strong spatial distribution as well. The aim of this paper is to analyse the spatial Concentration of public accommodation establishments and the effects of this spatial segmentation on tourism supply. The recent economic crisis had a strong impact on the Hungarian hotel industry creating the need for new market behaviour. The influence on efficiency generated by spatial concentration is also studied. During the research, based on statistical data, we analyse the qualitative and quantitative variables of public accommodation establishments in various touristic regions. Furthermore, the changing tendencies in spatial concentration are also highlighted. The primary research hypothesis is that the changing economic situation due to the crisis requires efficient and flexible reaction which higly influences the quality as well as the quantity development of the sector.",,,,kokenyi@uranos.kodolanyi.hu,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,3,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,274,288,,,,,,15,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700023,0

Many discussions on pots-Kyoto GHG emission reduction strategies and energy options have raised the increasing role of nuclear power in enhancing energy security and mitigating climate change together with concerns over disposal of nuclear waste. In addition the increasing interest in carbon capture and the geological storage of CO2 has brought up a range of questions as well. Lithuania is currently dealing with two major problems in energy sector: final closure of Ignalina Nuclear Power plant (Ignalina NPP) in the end of 2009 and nuclear waste disposal and climate change mitigation issues because of the replacement of nuclear capacities with fossil one and anticipated increase in GHG emissions. Lithuania has two main options in energy sector: to construct new nuclear power plant also taking into account nuclear waste disposal problems or to burn imported fossil fuel and to apply carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for GHG emission reduction. These two main options should be carefully investigated in Lithuania based on various studies conducted in Lithuania and other countries dealing with geological carbon storage and nuclear waste disposal potentials. There are no long-lived nuclear waste geological storage capacities in Lithuania and there is no pilot projects on CCS developed in Lithuania; therefore, there are no experience in this field. The aim of the article is to review the state-of-the-art in geological CO2 and nuclear waste storage fields focusing on the assessment of comparative similarities and differences of the geological disposal of CO2 and nuclear waste and to perform comparison of these technologies possible application in Lithuania.","[Streimikiene, Dalia; Mikalauskiene, Asta; Pusinaite, Rasa] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines G 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt; astam@mail.lei.lt; rasapusinaite@yahoo.com,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,20,2,2,0,8,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In general, the implementation of such projects entails building governance regimes at the city or regional level, but this often means forging partnerships between public and private actors to serve as policy instruments. Each city government formulates its own strategy for coping with the complexities of various levels of policy-making, thereby establishing multi-level governance regimes. And each city has its own particular experience with the implementation trajectory: long or short, successful or unsuccessful. This paper focuses on how the complexities of multi-actor governance influence the implementation of these projects. The purpose is to show how the macro-level institutional context affects the project's success and to analyse the challenges posed by multi-actor governance.

The Directive extends liability that usually refers to personal injuries and private property to harm where private property does not exist (e.g. biodiversity and endangered species). In these cases, problems with multiple causation and uncertain causation tend to be even more severe than for cases where solely private property is affected. Nevertheless, the otherwise very ambitious Directive remains silent about how to deal with these problems. We focus on uncertain causation and analyze second best optimal standards of proof in a model where benefits of risky activities are private information, and where the firm's care level chosen to avoid the damage is only imperfectly observable. We derive three results: first, we characterize the factors determining the second best standards. Second, and conversely to the previous literature, high standards of proof such as proof beyond reasonable doubt can be second best optimal even though they lead to inefficiently low care levels. Third, legislators should leave discretionary power to courts which allows them to choose the standard of proof conditional on factors such as the degree of uncertainty over causation or the information quality about care levels as taken by injurers.","[Muehlheusser, Gerd] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Sports Sci, IZA, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Feess, Eberhard] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Wohlschlegel, Ansgar] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Econ, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Muehlheusser, Gerd] Northwestern Univ, Management & Strategy Dept, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Bielefeld; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Frankfurt School Finance & Management; RWTH Aachen University; Northwestern University,"Muehlheusser, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Sports Sci, IZA, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",e.feess@frankfurt-school.de; gerd.muehlheusser@uni-bieleleld.de; ansgar.wohlschlegel@rwth-aachen.de,,"Wohlschlegel, Ansgar/0000-0001-7620-2539",,,,,37,13,13,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Specific goods are made for a single customer while generic goods are produced irrespective of which final customer will buy them. Theoretically, the distinction lays on a different relationship with time, based, for specific goods, on the trade-off between transport duration and cost and, for generic goods, on optimal stock. We claim that the distinction might affect shippers' valuation of freight transport attributes such as value of time, value of transport time reliability and value of the risk of loss and damages. Since neither the sign nor the size of the effect can be established on pure theoretical grounds, an empirical analysis is carried out to test whether shippers value freight service attributes differently for the two types of goods. It is found that the value of transport time is significantly larger for generic than for specific goods.","[Massiani, Jerome; Danielis, Romeo] Univ Trieste, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Marcucci, Edoardo] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy",University of Trieste; Roma Tre University,"Massiani, J (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",jmassiani@units.it; romeod@econ.univ.trieste.it; edoardo.marcucci@uniroma3.it,"MArcucci, Edoardo/AAP-5143-2021; marcucci, edoardo/AAJ-6539-2020","marcucci, edoardo/0000-0002-9813-3973; Danielis, Romeo/0000-0002-5972-288X",,,,,18,8,8,0,5,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Drawing on work that analyses how discourses of shareholder value have led to the re-organization of firms, the article argues that large law firms have undergone 'surgery' as part of attempts to make them appear more and more profitable when assessed using the metric profits per equity partner. The influence of geographical context-English regulation and institutions relating to the legal profession-on 'surgery' in the period 1993-2008 are also outlined as part of a situated analysis of the way regulations and institutions together prevent or enable the reproduction of financialized practices in different industries and places through the creation of conjunctural moments that help financial logics gain legitimacy.","[Faulconbridge, James R.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Geog, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Muzio, Daniel] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Lancaster University; University of Leeds,"Faulconbridge, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Geog, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",j.faulconbridge@lancaster.ac.uk,"Faulconbridge, James/JZE-5154-2024; muzio, daniel/I-5924-2012","Faulconbridge, James/0000-0003-1809-4271",,,,,53,61,64,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We consider a vertically organized distribution system with two levels, traffickers and retailers. The two questions concern which type of sellers have to be prosecuted and which law enforcement policy should be implemented that is, the probability of being caught and the severity of the punishment. We show that a trafficker-oriented law enforcement regime can avoid counter-productive policies. Moreover, decriminalization or depenalization is optimal under some conditions depending on the relationship between social harm and consumption. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In order to render the index more meaningful for policy-makers, a partial decomposition into strategic groups of airlines along distinct geopolitical scopes of air traffic is suggested. Air traffic across airports is considered an aggregate of complex networks that are subject to multiple constraints, such as geopolitics or technology. A multi-layered analytic approach accounts for network operators as economic agents that behave in strategic ways within these constraints. Our approach allows for comparing traffic distributions in Europe with that of the US and, in particular, introduces a normative component by isolating patterns in airlines' strategies that are likely to induce different degrees of spatial concentration and balanced traffic distributions within these common markets.

The model is estimated via maximum likelihood technique for quarterly data over the period of 1970:1-2000:4. Based on a recursive estimation using the Kalman filter algorithm, out-of-sample forecasts from the NKDSGE model are compared with forecasts generated from the classical and Bayesian variants of vector autoregression (VAR) models for the period 2001:1-2006:4. The results indicate that in terms of out-of-sample forecasting, the NKDSGE model outperforms both the classical and Bayesian VARs for inflation, but not for output growth and nominal short-term interest rate.

Timing is the calendar time we accept. as right just before we take a decision. First, an extensive literature search has been attempted in such disciplines as Management, Decision- making and Decision Support Systems. Unfortunately, traditional disciplines have frequently offered the excuse for not dealing with timing of decision- making due to 'lack of information' and to 'limited predictive techniques'. Moreover, modern disciplines (in particular chaos theory) also excuse themselves from addressing the question of timing on the grounds that real phenomena are 'inherently unpredictable'. The concept of time in finance has been presented here as applied by Mandelbrot (1997) [and Albert Einstein (in 1905)] and stressed that time is flexible. Moreover found that time series have a speed and a long-term memory. A non-parametric method called 'Rescaled Range Analysis' applied which indeed deals with cycles and long term memories. The research directed also to the discipline of modeling and forecasting, both classical and chaotic (fractal). This brought us to address the question: should ARIMA (random) or ARFIMA (fractal) models be here and in similar applications employed? The final conclusion was that Rescaled Range Analysis was the most appropriate for the analysis of both freight market and second hand ship price market. Additionally, the normality test by Jarque-Bera test (33>5.99) for freight market has shown the absence of normality and the existence of excess kurtosis (-1.51) as well as excess skewness (0.21). Moreover, a strong memory in freight rates of H=0.92<1 (H is the Hurst exponent, indicating a persistent time series or black noise) and a fractal dimension of 1.084 as well as alpha=1.092 were found. The Joseph effect' of Mandelbrot was detected, too. A discussion is then made about shipping cycles. Non-periodic freight cycles were detected from 17 days to 33, and from 80 days to 160. Also, the second hand 85000 dwt tanker market showed cycles of 4 and 8 years in the past. In this paper second hand price cycles for Aframax were detected of 26 and 78 months. Moreover, the freight rates were predicted round 5000 units of the BPI index that would prevail in March-April 2007. This prediction proved to be accurate, as the actual level of the index was 5031 in March and 5390 in April 2007 (as shown by data collected after the bulk of this paper had been written). Finally, we concluded after all that the best timing for decision-making is that which follows a best forecasting which we have tried finally.","[Goulielmos, Alexandros M.; Goulielmos, Marcos A.] Univ Piraeus, Dept Maritime Studies, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Goulielmos, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Maritime Studies, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",am.goulielmos@hotmail.com; ag@unipi.gr,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,10,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Sales, mortgaging, and leasing restrictions on the Agua Caliente Reservation land created large transaction costs to development on those lands; consequently, there was very little housing investment. The non-Indian blocks, which were extensively developed, provide a benchmark for efficient outcomes for the Agua Caliente lands. Once the restrictions on Agua Caliente lands were relaxed in 1959, the number of homes and real estate values converged to those of non-Indian-owned lands as predicted by the Coase theorem.","Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Akee, R (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,,"Akee, Randall/0000-0003-2133-9866",,,,,23,22,30,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

When parties do not observe each other's costs of care at the time of the accident and are unable to determine which party is the least-cost avoider, they fail to anticipate the outcome of the adjudication. Under these circumstances, accident avoidance becomes a commons problem because care by each individual party reduces the prospect of liability for both parties. As a result, parties suboptimally invest in care. We show that regulation removes this problem and is superior to tort liability both when parties act simultaneously and when they act sequentially. We further examine how different liability rules perform in this respect.

In particular, here we discuss the flows of students in Great Britain from domicile into university and then the flows of graduate human capital from university into first employment. We then estimate the local/non-local pattern of these flows as a function of the characteristics of the university, of the student population, and of the local region. Our findings suggest that university attendance in Great Britain is generally associated with very significant levels of human capital mobility, and only certain types of higher education institutions play a significant employment role in their local economies.","[Faggian, Alessandra] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton, Hants, England; [McCann, Philip] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England; [McCann, Philip] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Waikato, New Zealand",University of Southampton; University of Reading; University of Waikato,"Faggian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Geog, Southampton, Hants, England.",a.faggian@soton.ac.uk; pmccann@waikato.ac.nz,"Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; Faggian, Alessandra/B-5332-2012; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",ESRC [RES-171-25-0032]; HEFCE; Scottish Funding Council; HEFCW; DELNI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); HEFCE(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)); Scottish Funding Council; HEFCW; DELNI,"We acknowledge the support of the 'Impact of Higher Education Institutions on Regional Economies Initiative' (ESRC grant number RES-171-25-0032 co-funded by HEFCE, Scottish Funding Council, HEFCW and DELNI).",,38,132,146,3,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This notion usually refers to norms, values, networks, reciprocity or trust which are held in a community and can lead to positive social and economic outcomes. Despite its popularity as a fashionable concept in the literature, the exact meaning of social capital is far from clear. This paper criticises the dominant conceptions of social capital in economic geography and regional studies and aims to place the debate in a different perspective. It argues for an alternative understanding of social capital defined as resources embedded in social networks which can be accessed or are used for actions. The potential to overcome the current weaknesses in the literature is illustrated through discussing social capital of economic clusters.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of Cambridge,"Huber, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",fh259@cam.ac.uk,,,Gates Cambridge Scholarship,Gates Cambridge Scholarship,"I am grateful to Karenjit Clare, Mia Gray, Will Harvey and Charlotte Werndl for helpful comments on previous versions of this paper.

In this article, we examine the widely held belief that the expansion of these chain stores, Wal-Mart in particular, has had a large negative impact on the small locally owned retail sector. Our analysis of four types of independent retailer entries and exits in Florida from 1980, prior to the opening of the first Wal-Mart store in the state, to 2004, reveals that Wal-Mart's impact varies with independent retailers' market overlap with and proximity to Wal-Mart. Notably, our findings suggest that within zip codes, the Wal-Mart effect is driven by the suppression of entry rates, but not by the increase in exit rates, while in adjacent zip codes, it is driven by exit rates increasing more than entry rates. Our results provide empirical evidence that may help economic developers, public officials, and owners of small businesses make informed decisions about economic development in their communities.","[Paruchuri, Srikanth] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Baum, Joel A.

Developmental lags of the Republic of Croatia were determined by the bird's eye view method in terms of the observed developmental indicators, and suggestions were provided for their development. The impact of the analysed indicators and their components on the economic growth of the Republic of Croatia and the selected countries was established by regression analysis. The paper provides possible developmental guidelines for certain components. The results of the research proved that the Human Resources Development Index is insufficient in the analysis of economic development, as well as the existence of the expected correlation between trained human resources, which enable technological progress, and economic growth of a country. Taking into consideration the correlation between the growth of the Human Resources Development Index, Research Capacity Index, Technology and Innovation Index, and the Ability to Absorb Knowledge and Technology Index and economic growth, which was determined by the application of a model, Croatia has to make additional investments in the growth of human capital and labour productivity in order to reduce developmental lags.","[Aksentijevic, Nada Karaman; Jezic, Zoran] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Aksentijevic, NK (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipov 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nkaraman@efri.hr; zjezic@efri.hr,"Jezic, Zoran/R-3598-2018; Aksentijevic, Nada Karaman/R-4302-2018","Jezic, Zoran/0000-0002-6852-8747; Aksentijevic, Nada Karaman/0000-0001-5599-2738",,,,,30,6,7,1,21,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which organisational responses to the new reporting regime may have changed over time. This is done by analysing the quality and technical accuracy of the goodwill disclosures reported by these organisations together with an assessment of evidence of variation. The sample consists of 249 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia that disclosed the existence of goodwill in each of the first two years of the FRS adoption.

In studies of management and organization the multi-project organization (MPO) and its managerial implications has received an increased attention during the last decade, but its implications for the use of accounting information has not been studied in any depth. Accordingly is the aim of the paper to explore how the MPO's dimensions of temporality and permanency shapes the use of accounting information in a multi-project organization. The aim will be pursued by a case study of a Swedish building and construction company. Based on the empirical data it is concluded that the temporality of operations implies that higher level managers need more encompassing non-financial information in order to judge accounting information and by that they also get more involved in operations. At the same time, operation managers, i.e. the site manager in a project, have a central role when accounting information for higher level managers is generated. Finally is it suggested that multi-project organizations needs to be categorized in future studies of the use of accounting information in multi-project organizations.","[Linderoth, Henrik C.

In the United States of America, Japan and in the Western Europe countries the method of company funding through IPO has been applying for several decades already. The first public stock offerings began to be applied in these markets in higher volumes from the beginning of the 60th of the last century. From that period importance of IPO goes up globally and the initial public stock offerings begin to be applied more and more even in the Central and Eastern European countries. Under the conditions of the Czech capital market this way funding of development of the company, connected with its entering into the capital market, is not very usual. The Strategy of Sustainable Development of the Czech Republic considers this situation the weakness of the Czech economy, and its resolving has to be paid a due care. The present paper aims at analyzing major characteristics of IPOs that were done in the Czech market in its modem-time history as well as at understanding approaches, views and experience of individual companies that did the IPOs.

A lot has been written in terms of customer value definition and quite a few research studies have been conducted in this area focusing on various aspects of the value construct. The concept of customer value is discussed in many streams of marketing literature including relationship marketing, customer relationship management (CRM) pricing, consumer behaviour, in total quality management as well as in strategy literature. It has become an important factor in attracting and retaining customers and a fundamental basis in competitive strategies. The paper discusses various conceptual models of customer value found in the literature. Based on the literature study, it presents findings of the research focused on the concept of customer value, its attributes in clothing retailing. For the purpose of the research, a framework presented by Simova (2007) was used. Customer value was defined and measured in terms of get (benefits) and give (sacrifice) components. The concept of customer value based on price and quality dimensions was broadened by adding another value dimensions composing customer values such as functional, social, and emotional aspects of value in relation to perceived sacrifices. The term sacrifice was perceived in terms of both, monetary and non-monetary costs instead of price only. Multivariate data analysis, In particular, factor analysis was used to identify the main elements of customer value in clothing retailing. Five components with eigenvalues larger than one were extracted for benefit attributes of customer value (psychological aspects, physical appearance of merchandise, quality of merchandise and shopping, environment and communication, personnel) three components (price and discounts, shopping incentives, effort made when shopping) were extracted for sacrifice attributes of customer value.",,,,jozefina.simova@tul.cz,,"Simova, Jozefina/0000-0003-0809-8180",,,,,18,10,10,1,30,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This previous work is not relevant when the forecasts involve binary decisions: up-down or win-lose. In this paper we use Cohen's kappa coefficient, a measure of inter-rater agreement involving binary choices, to evaluate forecasts of National Football League games. This statistic is applied to the forecasts of 74 experts and 31 statistical systems that predicted the outcomes of games during two NFL seasons. We conclude that the forecasters, particularly the systems, displayed significant levels of agreement, and that levels of agreement in picking game winners were higher than in picking against the betting line. There is greater agreement among statistical systems in picking game winners or picking winners against the line as the season progresses, but no change in levels of agreement among experts. Higher levels of consensus among forecasters are associated with greater accuracy in picking game winners, but not in picking against the line. (C) 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.

This assessment is done from the perspective of a proper economic geographer. The basics of Krugman's NEG models are presented and discussed in the lights of the state-of-the-art of current theoretical and empirical work on NEG. A considerable effort is undertaken to identify the specific strengths and weaknesses of this attempt to explain spatial concentration of economic activities in the scope of spatial equilibrium models. Despite the fact that most of the proper economic geographers, naively in Germany, have hitherto been quite reluctant in working with NEG models and its propositions the message targeted at economic geographers is clear: they should use the huge potential of the NEG available for empirical and policy-related research more intensively than before. Thus, the decision of the Nobel Prize committee is good news not only for economists interested in spatial concentration, but for proper economic geographers as well.

The nonparametric, data-driven approach allows the full range of relations among variables to be captured, including nonlinearities that usually remain hidden in parametric models. The nonparametric approach does not assume a functional form, so specification error is not an issue. This study finds that the nonparametric regression model fits the data far better than the logarithmic regression model employed by most applied researchers; it also fits the data much better than a polynomial regression model. The nonparametric model yields substantially different estimates of the elasticity of box-office revenue with respect to production budgets and opening screens, and the model also has very good out-of-sample predictive ability, making it a potentially useful tool for studio management.","Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Walls, WD (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",wdwalls@ucalgary.ca,,"Walls, W.

It also explores technological changes, such as computerised databases and the Internet, which have recently made disclosure of company accounts by small companies potentially less costly and more valuable, thanks to electronic filing and universal online access to credit information systems. These recent developments favour policies that would expand the scope of mandatory publication for small companies in countries where it is voluntary. They also encourage policies to reduce the costs and enhance the value of disclosure through administrative reforms of filing, archive and retrieval systems. Survey and registry evidence on how the information in the accounts is valued and used by companies is consistent with these claims about the evolution of the tradeoff of costs and benefits that should guide policy in this area.","[Arrunada, Benito] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Arrunada, Benito] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",benito.arrunada@upf.edu,"Arruñada, Benito/M-3408-2019","Arruñada, Benito/0000-0003-1391-9895",,,,,103,26,28,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Abstracting from the potential for efficiencies, this article defines an UPP-related benchmark of 15 percent using data from a review of Federal Trade Commission merger challenge decisions. While the historical record highlights the importance of diversion ratios, the other key input into the UPP index, the margin, appears to play little role in the review process. A supplemental analysis of the case-specific evidence associated with unilateral merger review serves to confirm the benchmark results. Moreover, a detailed case study of unilateral-effects analyses identifies a number of application issues that may negate the finding of an UPP-based competitive concern. Thus, careful study should be undertaken before (1) using an UPP index as a merger screen with a benchmark well below 15 percent (diversions well below 30 percent), (2) customizing the UPP calculation for either high or low values of the margin, or (3) using an UPP index to impose a strong presumption of a competitive concern.","Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Coate, MB (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",mcoate@ftc.gov,,,,,,,14,8,8,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In Continental Europe, the majority of firms that become private do so following a buyout offer with squeeze-out (BOS0); using this mechanism, the controlling shareholder can cash out minorities and take the firm private. We argue that the decision to go private results from a cost-benefit analysis. Moreover, we pay particular attention to the consequences and the related costs of compliance resulting from the passage of the French Financial Security Law (FSL) in 2003. A quantitative study was performed using a unique dataset spanning 1997-2006. This data set consists of 140 French firms, of which 70 were voluntarily delisted via BOSO and 70 were industry-matched control firms. Univariate analysis and logistic regressions support the cost-benefit analysis: when listing benefits decrease because of weak liquidity and/or weak analyst coverage, it seems better for the firm to go private. Furthermore, the inherent characteristics of delisted firms (i.e. performance, leverage, and risk as measured by the beta factor) appear to be important driving factors of delisting. The passage of the FSL has strengthened the impact of these characteristics on the decision to go private. Mature firms that have weak performance and low specific risk and that are not financially constrained by debt will decide to go private because they cannot afford the listing status anymore. Finally, we show that the driving factors of delisting differ according to the identity of the controlling shareholder; specifically, the level of risk appears to be the strongest determinant for family firms, while non-family firms also consider their own financial structure.

This is true both for countries with high and low levels on the party institutionalization index. This article analyzes the identification with parties according to a set of socio-demographic and political variables. Conclusions are, first, that although party identification has declined consistently in the region, reasonable levels of political identification have been maintained on the left-right axis. Second, that while many youth have lower identification levels, this does not apply uniformly to all countries. Thirdly, one of the most stable predictors of party disaffection corresponds to the difficulties of the state in providing basic public goods for citizens.","[Morales Quiroga, Mauricio] Univ Diego Portales Chile, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile; [Morales Quiroga, Mauricio] Observ Electoral, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales,"Quiroga, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales Chile, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile.",mjmorale@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,9,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The forecasting methods considered include the autoregressive (AR) model, the AR model using the bias-corrected bootstrap, seasonal ARIMA models, innovations state space models for exponential smoothing, and Harvey's structural time series models. We use thirteen monthly time series for the number of tourist arrivals to Hong Kong and Australia. The mean coverage rates and widths of the alternative prediction intervals are evaluated in an empirical setting. It is found that all models produce satisfactory prediction intervals, except for the autoregressive model. In particular, those based on the bias-corrected bootstrap perform best in general, providing tight intervals with accurate coverage rates, especially when the forecast horizon is long.

Drawing on an analysis of governmental records of the firms that participated in every U.K. project between 1987 and 2009, this article traces the extent to which stable partnerships are used to produce private finance transportation initiatives. The findings highlight an important tension between the benefits and drawbacks of repeat collaborations on one-off projects. On the one hand, the extensive use of repeat-partnership relationships lowers transaction costs, encourages innovation, and supports learning from past experiences. On the other hand, deep embeddedness within social networks that encourages frequent repeat collaborations can reduce competition within the industry and contribute to higher delivery costs and lower-quality public services. Through this analysis, the article addresses the key economic geography literatures that are related to project ecologies, embeddedness, and repeat collaborations within networked production processes.","Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Toronto,"Siemiatycki, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Sidney Smith Hall,Room 5041,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",siemiatycki@geog.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,83,28,33,1,69,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We also find that scale economies and technical change have positively contributed to TFP growth over the sample period; in turn, all models find a decline in technical efficiency.

Under this method, the labour market is divided into a number of skill cells, where the cells are defined by groups with similar ages and levels of education (or age and occupation). Regression analysis is then employed to assess whether the average wages of natives across skill cells is affected by the share of immigrants across cells. When the cells are based on education/age, our results suggest a negative relationship between native wages and immigrant shares. However, the opposite appears to hold when the cells are based on occupation/age. These contradictory findings suggest that care should be exercised when applying this method as inaccurate impressions of the impact of immigration on wages may arise.","[Barrett, Alan; Bergin, Adele; Kelly, Elish] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Barrett, A (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Alan.Barrett@esri.ie,,"Kelly, Elish/0000-0001-7035-2392; Barrett, Alan/0000-0002-1106-2528",,,,,26,12,12,0,12,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Our analysis covers technical aspects regarding fair value measurements, accounting literature debates and particularities from Romanian evaluators perspective. Technical aspects regarding fair value measurements require a close analysis of the foresights of accounting regulation in the international arena. Literature review methodology was employed in assessing fair value debates in accounting literature. Finally the questionnaire was used in order to obtain Romanian evaluators feedback on the concept of fair value. The results of our paper synthesize the latest developments in terms of accounting regulation in the area of fair value measurements. The arguments of both opponents and supporters of fair value are discussed and organized based on accounting literature's main publications. Romanian evaluators' responses fail to document their interest in this area. This is useful in suggesting future actions in order to ensure better understanding and implementation of such a complex concept.","[Bonaci, C.

The new organization needs workers willing to permanently learn and perfect, with a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. The magnitude of change that was triggered by the technological development of the last decades is extensive. The world today is characterized by rapid changes and uncertainties and the organizations must increase their flexibility in order to survive in this new and increasingly competitive economic environment. Thus, the scientific literature underlines the fact that the organizational development is now based on the understanding of the fact that the most important elements for market competitiveness are knowledge and creativity, the valorization of the intellectual capital. This alters the way we work and our work related perceptions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the manner in which these changes are perceived by the Romanian workers. A questionnaire of 72 questions was applied on 590 employed persons. The questionnaire explores perceptions on different aspects of the Romanian labour market. The paper presents only a part of this extensive investigation, focusing on perceived changes of organizational culture triggered by the transition towards a knowledge economy. After an overview of the literature on the evolution of the world of work in the new economy, the study investigates how the changes are perceived by the Romanian workers. Some of the investigated themes are workers' adaptability to change through lifelong learning, opportunities for career development and organizational culture. As the goal of the economic science is that of increasing human beings' quality of life, the perceptions of the individuals should be an important tool in assessing the closeness to this outcome. Thus the results of this paper can be useful to policy makers as a type of diagnosis and a starting point for a more specific research.

Nevertheless, measurements are necessary to gather information for example about products or processes. Although this important role of the metrology is generally accepted, the request for cost cutting comes up again and again. This has to be managed - but how? Is it possible to quantify the economic efficiency of measurements and to design the measurement process towards an optimal cost-benefit-ratio? Basically, a system is called economic efficient if the cost of producing a given output is as low as possible. Whereas (theoretically) the calculation of the costs of a measurement result is simple, the monetary valuation of the output of a measurement is much more difficult. The primary output of metrology consists of measurement results. But in the context of manufacturing metrology the measurement result itself is not in the centre of interest. Instead the relevant information gained by measurement results is a statement about the conformity of produced parts or the quality of manufacturing processes. These statements are the relevant output of manufacturing metrology. But how the economic benefit of these statements can be expressed by a monetary value? The paper describes a method to answer this question.","[Dietlmaier, Adrian; Weckenmann, Albert] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,,Adrian.Dietlmaier@qfm.uni-erlangen.de; Albert.Weckenmann@qfm.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,57,62,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600013,0

This study focuses on spatial homogamy, which is the similarity regarding the geographical origin of partners. Adopting a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods, the geographical dimension of partner choice is explored for the Netherlands. Distance decay is highly pertinent for Dutch cohabitation partners: half of them meet within a 6 kilometre distance. The level of spatial homogamy not only varies by demographic and socio-economic characteristics of individuals, but also exhibits a spatial distribution. The spatial variation can be explained by a combination of cultural, geographical and socio-economic factors. In a case study in a rural area in eastern Netherlands, villagers indicated that a partner from close by is seen as convenient, familiar and trustworthy. The distance at which partners are found is influenced by the perceived mentality and culture of neighbouring places.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Haandrikman, K (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",karen.haandrikman@humangeo.su.se,"Haandrikman, Karen/AAD-8269-2022","Haandrikman, Karen/0000-0002-1246-2427",,,,,34,1,1,1,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

J,"Hawkins, G",,,,"Hawkins, Gay",,,Packaging water: plastic bottles as market and public devices,ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,hybrid forum; markets; vital materiality; publics; affective force,MATTER,"The emergence of bottled water as one of the fastest growing markets in the global beverage industry has attracted much attention, most of it negative. It seems that no sooner had the plastic bottle of water appeared as a mass rather than a boutique commodity than it became a matter of concern. A huge variety of activist campaigns have sprung up against bottles, focusing on everything from plastic wastes to chemical leaching. There is now no question that, in many places, diverse environmental publics stalk this commodity. How then does the framing of bottled water as a controversial issue interact with its markets? Using a range of examples, this paper investigates Callon's idea of markets as hybrid forums and key sites for the proliferation of the social. However, rather than focus on the deliberative processes of democracy the idea of hybrid forums is extended with an analysis of how affect, vital materiality and the evanescence of publics can reveal the fecundity of an issue. By sticking to the bottle the aim is to understand how, in particular arrangements, the vital materialism of plastic can be unleashed, inviting consumers to reflect on its origins and afterlife, long after games of value are exhausted. Analysis of affective modulation and vital materialism extends debates in economic sociology in critical ways. First, it shows how objects can acquire political capacity, how their material force, or 'thing-power' as Jane Bennett calls it, can become ethically and politically potent. Second, it reveals more-than-human politics and publics as often affective, as caught up in the play of ontological meaning and disturbance.","Univ Queensland, Ctr Crit & Cultural Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Hawkins, G (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Ctr Crit & Cultural Studies, Level 4,Forgan Smith Tower, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",g.hawkins@uq.edu.au,,"Hawkins, Gay/0000-0002-9057-6729",,,,,31,51,54,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

To turn the tide, many local authorities invest in place marketing aimed at attracting new residents and firms. This paper deals with the question as to how useful place marketing to beat demographic shrinkage really is. Theoretical and empirical insights from geography (e.g. place fuzziness, sense of place and locational inertia), are used to argue that there are limits to place marketing to attract newcomers. To illustrate this argument, some examples and data from European territories are presented. We conclude that it is more useful for Europe's shrinking territories to focus on 'warm' marketing that tries to retain rather than to attract place customers.","[Hospers, Gert-Jan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Hospers, Gert-Jan] Univ Twente, Inst Innovat & Governance Studies, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Twente,"Hospers, GJ (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",g.j.hospers@utwente.nl,,,,,,,27,31,32,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The authors focus on analyzing how specialized restaurants have until now contributed to the development of a genuine tourist offer and how they can support its development, given its poor tourist industry and its highly appreciated cuisine. Opportunities and threats of a changing environment must be carefully managed. Our previous researches have focused on several tourism topics related to Transylvania and Romania as tourist destinations; aspects concerning branding issues and tourist destination management, the reasons and motivations of the main Romanian hospitality investors, cultural heritage promotion and exploitation within tourism products, project management and the development of the Romanian tourist industry, strategic management and management of change in tourism, etc. This paper valorizes our findings and drives the research into a new direction by connecting the gastronomic offer with the overall performances of the tourist industry. During the past two decades, it has become clear that Romania does not have any gastronomic identity at all nor such tourist products; this is a clear example of poor management of the opportunities provided by a changing environment. We start from the analysis of the websites of specialized restaurants authorized to function in Romania, aiming to identify organizational culture elements and to study how they relate to the host destination. Finally, we assume that the most efficient enterprises (income statements) are also the most developed from the point of view of their corporate identity and, obviously, they can promote the destination. Their performances illustrate their capability to manage the challenges of change. Brief conclusions reveal that there are very few specialized restaurants that have a genuine culture, their impact on the travel market near to null, their involvement in the destination's development is rather inexistent, while most of them are far from performing, they struggle to survive on a crowded, yet underdeveloped market that they do neither know, nor understand. Their management skills are limited when it comes to taking advantage from environment and technological changes. Given the novelty of our approach, the case study is the most appropriate tool for this analysis, as it provides the authors valuable resources for the presentation of the investigated topic.","[Ilies, L.; Dulau, A.

The U.S. Forest Products Module (USFPM) was created to enhance the modeling of the U.S. forest sector within the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM), providing a more detailed representation of U.S. regional timber supply and wood residue markets. Scenarios were analyzed with USFPM/GFPM ranging from a baseline 48% increase to a 173% increase in annual U.S. consumption of wood for energy from 2006 to 2030, while consumption of fuelwood in other countries was assumed to increase by around 65% in aggregate. Results indicate that expansion in wood energy consumption across the range of scenarios may have little impact on U.S. forest sector markets because most of the expansion can be supplied by logging residues that are presently not being utilized and also mill residues that will increase in supply with projected expansion in wood product output in the decades ahead. However, analysis also suggests that forest sector markets could be disrupted by expansion in wood energy if much higher levels of wood energy consumption occur, or if projected recovery in housing demand and wood product output does not occur, or if more restrictive constraints or higher costs are imposed on wood residue utilization.

This is also the case hi the Member States, regardless of the fact if they joined EU-15 or EU-12, i.e. new countries undergoing transformation that joined the European Union in 2004. Increase in youth unemployment, i.e. among people who are just starting their career and facing barriers to utilizing human capital, is a particularly alarming phenomenon observed in the Member States. In 2010, overall unemployment rate among people aged 15-64 amounted to 9.7%, whereas the rate among young people under 25 stood at 20.6% in the European Union. It was then that increase in unemployment (expressed in percentage points) in the first-mentioned age group was over 2.4 times higher compared to 2006, i.e. a year before the world crisis. This evidently proves the importance of problems to be faced both by countries undergoing transformation and EU-15 states. Due to the significance of the issue, the present article is aimed at analyzing youth unemployment in comparison with overall unemployment in the Member States (EU-27). The analysis covered two age groups, i.e. people aged 20-24 and people aged 25-29. The year 2006, i.e. one year before the world crisis, was adopted as a base year.

It describes the processes of social miniaturization implemented in the organization of Balao's work processes, the particular ergonomics of democracy that resulted from the new model layout and the vexing question of the project's landfall: its limited impact as a 'demonstration experiment' for a more democratic organization of production.","Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",University of Oxford,"Lezaun, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Said Business Sch, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",javier.lezaun@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,26,27,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In our paper, this behaviour is characterized by the evaluation of risks, specific circumstances and vulnerabilities, where the management needs more input to better adapt itself to change. We describe the labour market under dynamic perspective through characteristics like workers' hiring flows, workers' separation flows, workers' total reallocation flows and workers excess reallocation flows in both their relative and absolute (levels) dimensions, broken down by gender. We assess the effect of the economic crises as a global demand shock on the gross worker flows for the interesting groups. A better understanding of the organization background, considering the gender differences in gross worker flows offers a useful reference for the manager's process in taking the firm's decisions regarding employment, as the core mechanism of the management of change. In these decision processes, several aspects are involved: resources, efforts and strategic choices, in view to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities induced by the pressure of change, to diminish the crises effects and to offer adequate instruments to apply an effective management of change.

In literature, tourism is considered as a clean industry, and that's why this new approach makes this study and its result to be very interesting for this domain. The impact of various activities on the environment has been approached by many specialists (Cicerone I., C. Teodosiu, M.

Research make a methodological correlation between the classical method of analysis of environmental impacts and the proposed method. In the research, steps were followed: 1. Systematic organization for data collection which must be compatible with both methods of analysis 2. Collection of data on a sample area standard considered (centralization of data collected, and grouping them according to criteria to ensure compatibility with both methods of analysis) 3. Data correlative analysis by both methods of analysis and interpretation of results. The research results consist of - Achieve a methodological correlation in the research regarding the impact of tourism activity on the environment - Proposes a new method adapted from the analysis of industrial activities effect on the environment to quantify, the environmental impact induced by specific activities of tourism. - In the literature suggests a new approach: the idea that tourism has an impact that is not always positive.

Various indicators have been analyzed in correlation analysis in order to build macroeconomic model (with unemployment as dependent variable) and estimate its parameters, for example GDP, household consumption, government consumption, investments, inflation, wages, rate of employment and participation rate. It is widely accepted that GDP is one of the strongest predictor for forecasting of unemployment trend but with some delay because labour market reacts later as legislation rules are strict. In the paper relation between GDP and unemployment rate for the case of the Czech Republic is introduced considering time delay. Importance of GDP and GDP growth rate was not approved based on real data analysis. Moreover, one regression model is proposed and estimated.

This will be pursued through 3 specific objectives: the definition of the features of the qualitative principle of servicity being most consistent with managing processes in knowledge society, finding possibilities for quantification and the definition of a common implementation structure of European projects. In the present article, European project implementation is shown as a new management tool and the servicity concept is defined as a feature for it. Its aspects characterizing technological change and level are strictly divided in really productive and formally productive. Main points in project implementation and in quantifying servicity, for the measurement of project implementation's results are underlined. Main results achieved will target new qualitative management approaches of European projects implementation. European projects, which are already in implementation stage, are analyzed from a structural side in order to better manage and direct technological change and to improve its final results, which influence the regional economic growth of the eligible area. The added value of the paper consists of the unique combination of the original actuality - but purely theoretical issue of servicity with empirical facts and results from the present matter of European project implementation, as a quality improving feature at empirical level. The approach, methodology and instruments used represent a contribution to the management of transformation and, with future research, can become a basis for a future quality catalyst in the regional development. Conclusions refer to how servicity should be the main qualitative element in quantifying projects results.","[Popovici, A.; Jivan, A.; Dogaru, T.] W Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,adinap_12@yahoo.com; alexandrujivan@gmail.com; ddteo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,721,724,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000181,0

Cases of threat and optimal rotation,JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Threat; Risk; Optimal rotation; Discount rate,OPTIMAL FOREST ROTATION; STAND; FIRE; MANAGEMENT; PRICES,"As with financial risk in markets, physical risk (threat or hazard) has sometimes been treated by adding a premium to the discount rate for NPV calculations applied to forestry options. A discount premium reflecting the rate of threat gives the correct rotation for a perpetual succession of crops, and, by simple adjustment, the correct land expectation value, but only if the threat occurs at a constant rate throughout the rotation and if destruction - if it happens at all - is complete. This is true irrespective of the number of intermediate cash flows (e.g. from thinnings). If some value can be salvaged following the destructive event, neither optimal rotation nor NPV is correctly determined by using a threat premium. Partial salvage of value may make the rotation longer or shorter than the threat-free one. A threat-adjusted rate does not give a correct result when threat level changes during the rotation. These findings are illustrated with thinned, wind-susceptible crops in the UK, and crops subject to illicit felling in India. (C) 2010 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea Sweden.

The main focus is measurement of intangibles. The purpose of the research is an attempt to add unmeasured by now knowledge as a capital, which could, lead to change in financial evaluation methods of the companies, and in the same time might be limited by ethical issues. Design methodology/ approach: The research approach used for the purpose of this paper is based on qualitative observational research. Ethnographic research combined with literature review form powerful wide-ranging and in the same time personally oriented approach. Findings: Developing a strategy is not news anymore. Balanced Scorecard methodology is one of the most powerful tools for developing of strategy, digging deeply into performance measures. Measuring non-measurables or so-called intangibles, is a difficult task. In some cases it has never been done. Businesses have implemented widely quantitative and qualitative performance measures, with a majority of quantitative ones. But when it comes to subtle qualities and their quantities, for example human capital or knowledge in the company, it comes to uncertainties. There is capital which currently is not possible to be measured. There isn't a methodology of doing this. Furthermore, there isn't an agreement who should possess this value - the company, or the personality. In addition, there aren't codes of law in legislative systems dealing with such issues, which could reflect on new evaluation of the businesses and their market assessment. Research limitations: As the research has been held in business (Fortune 100), and higher education institutions in UK, Germany and Bulgaria, as an excerpt of European Union (EU) countries, it is limited to EU and its legislative systems and social environment. Originality/ value: This paper analyses and suggests monetizing intangibles as a natural step over measuring performance. It discusses the questions related to the readiness of the society to evaluate knowledge and add it into the balance sheets in the businesses. Developing intellectual property portfolio of the company is just one of the ways to add value to the company. There is a knowledge, which is still not measured at all. The paper rise the issues related to monetising intangible capital which is going to lead the business and society to next level revolution.","[Todorova, Yanka] Univ Sofia, Fac Math & Informat, BU-1126 Sofia, Bulgaria",University of Sofia,,yanka@todoroff.co.uk,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,827,831,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800099,0

This paper reviews the first 5 years of this new regime. The reform has increased transparency and made competition the sole criteria for the evaluation of mergers. There is evidence that most mergers notified have no competitive effect within Ireland, suggesting that the legislation is too broad in scope. Although relatively few notified mergers raised any competition concerns, this paper identifies problems in the Competition Authority's analysis in a number of these cases. The Authority has tended to rely on qualitative rather than quantitative evidence. In some instances, its analysis is inconsistent with economic theory. This applies particularly to its analysis of efficiencies. This paper therefore recommends that the Authority urgently review its merger procedures and introduce additional checks and balances in the merger review process. In addition, it should review its approach to efficiencies. This paper also suggests possible legislative reforms to reduce the number of unnecessary notifications and provide third parties with a right of appeal against decisions by the Authority.","Compecon Ltd, Dublin, Ireland",,"Massey, P (通讯作者)，Compecon Ltd, Dublin, Ireland.",pmassey@compecon.ie,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The paper utilizes a micro-dataset on the Palestinian labor force combined with time-series data on foreign workers in Israel. The data covers the period 1999-2003, a period in which Israel enforced a strict closure on labor (and goods) movement, particularly in 2001 and 2002. The evidence suggests that foreign workers in Israel do not affect Palestinian employment; however, an increase in the number of foreign workers in Israel tends to reduce Israeli wages paid to Palestinian workers from the Gaza Strip. The Israeli closure policy appears to be the main cause for the substantial reduction in long-run Palestinian employment levels in Israel, not the presence of foreign workers.","[Aranki, Ted N.] Sveriges Riksbank, Monetary Policy Dept, S-10337 Stockholm, Sweden; [Daoud, Yousef] Birzeit Univ, Dept Econ, Birzeit, Israel; [Daoud, Yousef] Birzeit Univ, Ctr Dev Studies, Birzeit, Israel",Sveriges Riksbank; Birzeit University; Birzeit University,"Aranki, TN (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Monetary Policy Dept, S-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",ted.aranki@riksbank.se,"Daoud, Yousef/AAU-5001-2021","Daoud, Yousef/0000-0002-0795-6043",,,,,29,4,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

A key advantage of this method is that it allows for both input contraction and output expansion in determining relative efficiencies and productivity changes. For comparative purposes, a Malmquist index is also estimated. The Malmquist index overvalues the Luenberger productivity indicator. Results indicate that public bus companies have similar efficiency to private bus companies. Several interesting and useful managerial insights and policy implications arise from the study.

However, it is well known that this distribution, while convenient and simple to implement, underestimates the kurtosis demonstrated in most financial returns.

In this paper we extend their approach to the Monte Carlo simulation of VaR on both linear and non-linear instruments with application to the South African equity market.

There has been considerable focus on the policies that can be implemented at international and national levels; however, sub-national bodies can also play an important and influential role. In order to identify what this role may be, it is important for sub-national governments to have an understanding of the size of their potential emissions responsibility. At present there is no widely accepted methodology for the apportionment of either international or domestic aviation emissions to sub-national levels. This paper assesses a number of existing consumer- and producer-based CO2 apportionment regimes that could be used to allocate the emissions from aviation to regional and other sub-national levels. This is followed by the presentation of a new hybrid consumer-producer apportionment regime applicable to aviation. This new approach is designed to provide an emissions baseline for a region that reflects its share of responsibility for the UK's aviation emissions as both a producer of emissions and consumer of the services provided by aviation.

We focus on the distinct influences of convergence and agglomeration on growth in the number of start-up firms as well as in employment in these new firms in a given region-industry. While reversion to the mean and diminishing returns to entrepreneurship at the region-industry level can result in a convergence effect, the presence of complementary economic activity creates externalities that enhance incentives and reduce barriers for new business creation. Clusters are a particularly important way through which location-based complementarities are realized. The empirical analysis uses a novel panel dataset from the Longitudinal Business Database of the Census Bureau and the US Cluster Mapping Project. Using this dataset, there is significant evidence of the positive impact of clusters on entrepreneurship. After controlling for convergence in start-up activity at the region-industry level, industries located in regions with strong clusters (i.e. a large presence of other related industries) experience higher growth in new business formation and start-up employment. Strong clusters are also associated with the formation of new establishments of existing firms, thus influencing the location decision of multi-establishment firms. Finally, strong clusters contribute to start-up firm survival.","[Delgado, Mercedes] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Porter, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Business Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stern, Scott] Northwestern Univ, MIT Sloan Sch, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Stern, Scott] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Harvard University; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Delgado, M (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, 1801 Liacouras Walk,542 Alter Hall 006-14, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",mdelgado@temple.edu,"Delgado, Mercedes/L-9707-2014","Scheifler, Alexandre Batista/0009-0000-8390-5777",,,,,68,464,540,14,395,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This article provides the first formal analysis of this form of indemnification. Targeting employees with unindemnifiable sanctions carries the social cost of exposing employees of law-abiding firms to the risk of mistaken government prosecution. Deterrence is typically achieved more efficiently by sanctioning the firm alone. We find the circumstances under which the government should additionally sanction employees to be quite limited and the circumstances under which the government should ban indemnification of these sanctions to be more limited still. One circumstance is when an unindemnifiable employee sanction provides prosecutors with leverage to adjust the employee's sanction in exchange for his cooperation against the firm.

This results in different legal costs to assess the plaintiff's win rate. The paper analyses pretrial negotiations and revisits the selection hypothesis in the case where these legal expenditures are private information. Our general result is that pretrial negotiations select cases with the smallest legal expenditures as those going to trial, while cases with largest costs prefer to settle. Under the one-sided asymmetric information assumption, we find in contrast to the usual finding of the literature, that the American rule yields more trials and higher aggregate legal expenditures than the French and British rules. The two-sided case leads to a higher rate of trials, but in contrast provides less clear-cut predictions regarding the influence of fee-shifting. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanism is that scarcity of raw labor increases the return of human relative to physical capital. While a reduction in the birth rate is shown to unambiguously increase educational efforts, increases in the survival rate have ambiguous effects. Falling birth rates also increase capital per worker, but the effects of rising survival rates are again ambiguous.

It upholds that Christianity predisposed the West to discover institutions of freedom when Islam didn't. In the first section it explains the decline and economic rise of the Orient and Occident as derived from Kant's hypothesis (2.1) and geographical conditions (2.2). It explains in the second section the invention of institutions of freedom in Europe by two moral innovations: the secularising of law and the invention of the individual (3). The secularising of law was the result of Christian property theology which recognised man's place in God's creation (3.1). Secularising of politics and the Christians' desire for autonomy vis-A -vis political authorities originated in individual rights being conceived as normal and incited man to insist upon respect from public authorities. The advent of individual rights was at the origin of the implementation of a secular constitutional right applying to all men, even the sovereign (3.2). The third section explains why political and social Islam did not predispose Muslims to discover the institutions of freedom, capitalism. Islamic law distanced the Orient from capitalism as it developed a religion of community salvation hostile to individualism and its rights (4.1); it never disassociated the rule of God from the rule of law (4.2) and it did not consider individual rights sacred or private property (4.3). The article concludes with the way in which economic theory could conceive of the religion variable in economic growth and development (5).","[Facchini, Francois] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Facchini, Francois] Univ Reims, Reims, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Facchini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",facchini@univ-paris1.fr,"Facchini, Francois/AAD-9399-2019","Facchini, Francois/0000-0001-9471-0385",,,,,89,21,22,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

A review,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon trading; Aviation; Climate change; EU ETS,DEMAND; IMPACT,"The European Community, motivated by the rapid growth of the aviation industry and related impacts on climate change, has decided to include aviation in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Mitigation policies such as the EU ETS are considered to be necessary in order to change travel behaviour and induce operational and technological changes in the aviation industry that will result in lower environmental impacts. This paper reviews the available impact assessments of the proposed emissions trading scheme for airlines published between 2005 and 2009. It analyses the methods used and finds that the models used are often over-simplified, omitting important variables or that the reliability and robustness of the modelling results are reduced by linking models that are based on different assumptions. The paper also summarises the possible environmental (CO(2) emissions) and economic (air fares, demand for airline services, supply of airline services, competitiveness. GDP, carbon price) impacts in the studies reviewed for the year 2020. Overall, the effects are found to be small: for example, CO(2) emissions are expected to decline by a maximum of 3.8% and the maximum impact on GDP in the EU Was found to be -0.002%. The reasons for these insignificant impacts are analysed in this paper; it is also found that there are some positive aspects of including aviation in the EU ETS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that private capital flows have a positive impact on growth in low-income countries with well-developed financial sector but have a negative effect in the presence of poor financial sector development. Well-developed financial sectors are ones that are themselves crucial for economic growth.

Another impulse for the catching-up process has come in the form of the accession of CEE countries to the EU in 2004 and 2007. The EU funds have become one of the major drivers of economic development in the countries situated on the eastern side of the former Iron Curtain. However, it should be emphasized that the effects of the EU integration seem to be spread unevenly across Central and Eastern Europe. Taking into account all those facts one should state that the EU Cohesion Policy may have a different impact on the social and economic development across countries of the CEE region. The main aim of this paper is to carry out a comparative analysis of the impacts of the EU Cohesion Policy on GDP at market prices, employment and labour productivity as well as cumulative multipliers in Poland (the largest CEE economy and the major beneficiary of EC Cohesion Policy) and Slovakia (one of the fast-developing CEE economies in the recent years). The analysis in question is based on the macroeconomic HERMIN models for Poland and Slovakia which are the research tools that have been used by the European Commission to assess the impact of the EU funds on a range of macroeconomic variables. They are a part of the EU Cohesion System of HERMIN Models (CSHM) developed by the international research team led by dr J.Bradley the part of which is Wroclaw Regional Development Agency (WARR). The preliminary results derived from the analysis imply that there is a similar (approximately 2,6%) average impact of the EU Cohesion Policy on GDP at market prices in both countries in question. It must be also noted that the EU Cohesion Policy has a greater impact on the labour market in Slovakia than in Poland (on average 1,8% and 1,1%, respectively). The average impact of the EU funds on the labour productivity is stronger in Poland relative to Slovakia (1,4% and 0,8%, respectively). Both countries in question are characterised by similar values of cumulative multipliers (2,0 in 2020 for Poland, 2,2 in 2020 for Slovakia) which indicate that the efficiency of operational programmes is similar in those states, however, below the analogues values for several EU Cohesion countries.","[Mogila, Zbigniew; Tomaszewski, Pawel] Wroclaw Reg Dev Agcy, Wroclaw, Poland",,,zmg@warr.pl; ptm@warr.pl; janusz.zaleski@warr.pl,"Mogila, Zbigniew/AGE-3481-2022","Mogila, Zbigniew/0000-0001-5554-2841",,,,,9,2,2,0,7,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,98,115,,,,,,18,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700006,0

Ontology explores the meanings of entities as the objects of knowledge to posit the orientation of knowledge. Heidegger developed hermeneutical ontology, focusing on the self-understanding of Dasein (human beings), which consists of the projection of its possibilities into the future and the thrownness of it into the restrictions by the past history. Dealing explicitly with the pre-structure of knowledge, hermeneutics opens the perspective of knowledge much broader than permitted by the analytical tradition of philosophy. It is the contention of this paper that Schumpeter from the Austrian subjectivist circle could cope with this approach in social science by the use of the concepts of innovation and tradition or creation and routine. The paper discusses the relationship between Heidegger and Schumpeter on various philosophical issues and derives what might be called the Heidegger = Schumpeter theses.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Shionoya, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",y.shionoya@blue.ocn.ne.jp,,,,,,,16,1,4,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

An analysis of a case at the Supreme Court of Norway demonstrates that the opposite might be true. It will be argued that both purchasers and vendors will be better off if the Directive is interpreted in accordance with economic theory. Harmonization of consumer protection across EU countries might be counterproductive. The analysis is of general interest in the sense that it demonstrates that mandatory changes in rights and obligations among contracting parties may have distributive effects different from what is commonly assumed.","Univ Oslo, Dept Private Law, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Eide, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Private Law, Pb 6706 St Olavs Plass, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",erling.eide@jus.uio.no,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In contrast to the existing literature, indirect network effects are determined endogenously, through consumers' taste for variety and producer competition. Three new aspects of platform pricing structures are derived. First, the optimal platform pricing structure shifts towards extracting more rents from producers relative to consumers when consumers have stronger demand for variety, since producers become less substitutable. With platform competition, consumer preferences for variety, producer market power, and producer economies of scale in multihoming also make platforms' price-cutting strategies on the consumer side less effective. This second effect on equilibrium pricing structures goes in the opposite direction relative to the first one. Third, variable fees charged to producers can serve to trade off producer innovation incentives against the need to reduce a platform holdup problem.","Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Hagiu, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Morgan Hall 212,Soldiers Field Rd, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",ahagiu@hbs.edu,,,,,,,29,178,222,8,182,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

With the advent of antitrust legislation in 1890, American courts have been pressed to consider what constitutes conspiracies between corporate entities to restrain commerce. By the 1980s, courts started to characterize conspiracies by negation-that is, by extending the status of single entity to certain types of agglomerations. Efforts both in economics and in the law to sort out what constitutes a firm or single entity have focused on control. A difficulty is that neither the law nor economics offers an operationally significant concept of control. Even so, both the law and economics contribute concepts other than control that provide a way of understanding economic organization. These concepts-adaptation and control rights-suggest how one can subsume the sometimes confusing array of single entity tests proposed in the case law within a two-stage sequence of tests.",,,,dean.williamson@usdoj.gov,,,,,,,34,6,6,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

I argue that markets are composed of social as well as economic networks. The reliance of these networks on social connectivity and proximity makes the development of new markets particularly suited to established financial centers like London and New York and reinforces the importance of these centers. London and New York provide not only resources and financial infrastructure, but also institutional proximity that develops routines and practices between complementary firms. I investigate three levels of complementarity between ( existent and new) markets and within the new carbon markets: the complementarity of expertise and information, the complementarity of institutions and services and the complementarity of market systems. Case studies constructed from expert interviews in London and New York are used to support the argument.

Secondary data came from a national household survey (CASEN, 2003). Results showed that in terms of absolute mobility, there is a higher correspondence between parents and children with higher education. On the other hand, the study identified an important component for absolute intergenerational social mobility associated directly with occupational mobility. In relation to relative mobility, there is a high probability that someone coming from a blue collar family can move up to a higher social status.","[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Espinoza, Oscar] Polit Educ Super Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez, Luis Eduardo] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Uribe, Daniel] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Harvard University; Universidad de Chile,"Espinoza, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",oespinoza@academia.cl; legonza@netline.cl; daniel.uribej@gmail.com,"Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019","Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980",,,,,35,7,13,0,12,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Unlike existing explanations on central bank independence, we show that the structural independence of the Fed is not the result of intentional design but a product of compromise among disparate groups. Using agenda-constrained ideal point estimation techniques to estimate both the preferences of senators on key questions of Fed structure and the locations of alternative forms of the bill with respect to those preferences, we show that the structural features of the Fed in the final bill differed markedly from the original preferences of legislators representing competing groups. The result was a compromise that offered the prospect of significant independence for the new agency. The Fed case shows that political compromise can provide useful bureaucratic insulation when the short-term incentives of political principals promote unstable, self-seeking policy choices (JEL N41, N21).","[Jeong, Gyung-Ho] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Miller, Gary J.; Sobel, Andrew C.] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Washington University (WUSTL),"Jeong, GH (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",gyung-ho.jeong@cgu.edu,"Jeong, Gyung-Ho/JDV-6992-2023","Jeong, Gyung-Ho/0000-0002-7476-3241",,,,,53,13,16,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The basic problem is that complex systems such as the atmosphere or the economy can not be reduced to simple mathematical laws and modeled accordingly. The equations in numerical models are therefore only approximations to reality, and are often highly sensitive to external influences and small changes in parameterisation - they can be made to fit past data, but are less good at prediction. Since decisions are usually based on our best models of the future, how can we proceed? This paper draws a comparison between two apparently different fields: biology and economics. In biology, drug development is a highly inefficient and expensive process, which in the past has relied heavily on trial and error. Institutions such as pharmaceutical companies and universities are now radically changing, their approach and adopting techniques from the new field of systems biology to integrate information from disparate sources and improve the development process. A similar revolution is required in economics if models are to reflect the nature of human economic activity and provide useful tools for policy makers. We outline the main foundations for a theory of systems economics. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To these ends, a field study of a descriptive-analytic nature was made. The empiric referent consisted of 20 neighborhood associations distributed in parishes that make up the municipality. The instrument used consisted of a standard type questionnaires; emphasis was placed on direct or participative observations, open interviews and analysis of documents provided by key informants. Findings indicated: a) Social capital of the neighborhood associations in the municipality is distinguished as being moderately positive, but it faces serious threats. b) Confidence and ethical values are oriented toward the low side and work against social action and the management of demands from the neighborhood associations; c) participation as a dimension of social capital is restricted, limited only to the vote; therefore, it de-legitimates the action of the local government. All this reflects lack of confidence toward this type of organization. e) A very limited space for building citizenship and generating mechanisms for citizen empowerment is perceived. f) Inconsistency is noted between discourse, action and the results of governmental management.

The Victorian government has recently embarked on programs to (1) extend a network of premium trunk routes to address a 'mass transit' agenda and (2) upgrade local routes to 'safety net' minimum service levels, to address a 'social transit' agenda (reducing transport disadvantage and social exclusion). The paper reviews recent experience from the service upgrades to assess how effective they have been in terms of these agendas. Analysis of patronage growth trends and the impacts of these upgrade programs suggest reasonable minimum service levels are required to attract new riders in times of modal shift, and are effective at building social capital.

This is especially true for firms engaged in information intensive activities and those that have a strong need for advanced services such as broadband. Despite the suggested importance of these technologies, quantitative work evaluating the link between firm location and broadband provision is sparse and existing knowledge remains largely theoretical and speculative. However, theoretical evaluations of the impact of ICTs on firm location do provide a foundation for quantitative analyses of this relationship and may be grouped into three schools of thought: the deconcentration school, the concentration school, and the heterogeneous effects school. The predictions made by these three schools of thought will be analysed in an exploratory context to better understand the relationship between firm location and ICTs, with a focus on broadband service provision. A combination of basic spatial statistical analytical tools and geographic information systems (GIS) will be used in an exploratory spatial data analysis framework to evaluate the relationship between firm location and broadband provision trends from 1999 to 2004 in the state of Ohio. Results suggest that changes in broadband provision have no relationship with changes in firm location. However, a disaggregated, firm level analysis of this relationship does provide statistically significant results for a subset of industrial sectors. Firm size is also found to impact the correlation between firm presence and broadband provision. These results suggest that firm size and industry are perhaps critical components in determining the relative importance of ICTs, such as broadband, in firm location decisions.","[Mack, Elizabeth A.; Grubesic, Tony H.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Mack, EA (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",elmack@indiana.edu; tgrubesi@indiana.edu,"Grubesic, Tony H/C-4273-2012","Grubesic, Tony/0000-0003-4517-586X",,,,,73,28,31,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

To assess the predictive performance, we use traditional measures of forecast accuracy (Theil's U statistics, RMSE and MAE), the Diebold-Mariano test, and Pesaran and Timmerman's statistic on the capability of forecasting turning points.

This article explores the effects of partial regulatory devolution in the occupational safety arena by exploiting a unique historical anomaly whereby some US states enforce protective labor regulations that are enforced elsewhere by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Analyzing data from the construction industry, this article contains several important findings. First, state inspectors use traditional enforcement tools more sparingly than their federal counterparts, typically citing fewer violations and collecting lower fines per violation. Second, although federal enforcement significantly lowers the estimated frequency of nonfatal construction injuries, it also predicts a significant increase in occupational fatalities. I suggest that although higher underreporting of nonfatal injuries in federally regulated states could explain this puzzling finding, it is equally possible that different regulatory styles have different comparative advantages in deterring nonfatal injuries on one hand and occupational fatalities on the other.

Our interest centred on a specific international area - the Baltic Sea region. This region embodies the principles of shared values and common purpose, hence portrays a promising situation for regional branding.

Development of the high technologies business depends first of all on development of the high technologies market. The success of developing high technologies depends on implementation of the 'triple helix' model covering integration of the public and private sector as well as science. The most successful 'triple helix' model for high technologies development is the one where the highest degree of cooperation between authorities, industry and academic public is indicated. Therefore the article establishes the implementation of the 'triple helix' as a leading priority for high technologies development in Lithuania.","[Chlivickas, Eugenijus; Petrauskaite, Neringa; Ambrusevic, Nikolaj] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Chlivickas, E (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",eugenijus.chlivickas@vgtu.lt; neringa.petrauskaite@vgtu.lt; nikolaj.ambrusevic@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,34,7,7,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Then the paper further analyzed the corporatization with a comparative perspective of law and economics. It pointes out that corporatization greatly promotes the development of SOE and improves its corporate governance. However, corporate governance based on property rights under corporatization also determines the fundamental legal relationship of state and SOE as that of shareholder and company. This is not only a great constrain for the achievement of particular public objectives allocated to state-owned enterprises and but also will lead to potential conflicts between state power and rule of law. The paper argues that corporatization is not the only choice for SOE's reform. If we could properly introduce public enterprises into state-owned enterprises reform in non-competitive fields, it would be an important supplementation to the corporatization reform in China.","[Li Jinjing] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Ctr Infrastruct Res, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,lijj@bjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,6,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-072-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,133,136,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQE61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280792600030,0

We all, economic agents and individuals, have to face physical and pecuniary constrains, which is why every moment and in every field, we deal with opportunity costs. As opportunity costs are those costs that do not require consumption or actual payments, the opportunity costs assessment is not carried out in compliance with the accounting system of the costs. Most of the times, opportunity costs are assessed by theoretician economists and sometimes, by managers. Although accountants are not interested in finding out these opportunity costs, all managers should establish them, because they are an important factor in the decisions taking process, regarding strategy orientation towards one of the possible ways of using the available resources. The objective of every business man is to gain profit. Therefore, he must implement strategies that increase his profit and assure a certain advantage over the other competitors. In order to reach this major objective, the business man must be capable of taking decisions that are based on the opportunity cost analysis. The general definition of the opportunity cost is the following: the value of an alternative which is waived, in favor of another one. The existence or two or more alternatives always involves losses and opportunity costs. In order to decrease and even to eliminate them, it is necessary to identify all possible alternatives and establish economic effects for every alternative, to compare them and to chose one of them. Therefore, the issue which arises is precisely the opportunity cost analysis for every variable and taking the relevant decision - minimizing the opportune cost. In this paper, we shall make a general theoretical review of the opportunity cost notion and its possible forms.","[Steliac, Nela] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,nela.steliac@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Steliac, Nela/ABA-2530-2020","Steliac, Nela/0000-0003-4661-836X",,,,,25,0,0,0,5,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,277,283,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000045,0

The GLS and VNS algorithms are compared with the best known heuristics and applied on large problem sets. The obtained results are almost of the same quality as the results of these heuristics but the computational time is reduced significantly. For some of the problems VNS calculates new best solutions. The results of the ILS algorithm, applied to large problem sets, have an average gap with the optimal solution of only 2.7%, with much less computational effort.","[Vansteenwegen, Pieter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Ind Management, Celestijnenlaan 300a bus 2422, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Vansteenwegen, P (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Ind Management, Celestijnenlaan 300a bus 2422, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",Pieter.Vansteenwegen@cib.kuleuven.be; Greet.VandenBerghe@kahosl.be; Dirk.VanOudheusden@cib.kuleuven.be,"Vanden Berghe, Greet/A-3914-2015; Vansteenwegen, Pieter/W-2501-2018","Vanden Berghe, Greet/0000-0002-0275-5568; Vansteenwegen, Pieter/0000-0002-5646-669X",,,,,29,43,45,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",0075-8442,,978-3-642-00939-6,LECT NOTES ECON MATH,,,2009,624.0,,,,,,15,31,,10.1007/978-3-642-00939-6_2,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BLV72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271188100002,0

I demonstrate, in the first instance as a matt er of immanent logic, that these actions are linked to the interplay of contradictory tendencies in the microfoundations of financialization. Under conditions of financialization, firms create additional sources of credit to capitalize their productive activities by driving their stock price into greater increases than the market average, thereby generating capital gains. Yet, the more it becomes public knowledge that the financing tricks used to inflate the stock price provide no productive benefit to the firm, the more it would seem to create incentives for fund managers to hold portfolios that replicate the stock market as a whole. In this way, they will minimize their exposure to financial misrepresentation. Such a stance undermines financialized business models, but it does in any case conform to fund managers' basic theoretical training, which revolves around the logical demonstration that an individual stock cannot systematically out-perform the market average. I review the available empirical studies of fund manager decision-making to show that they find against the existence of a simple performativity loop operating between finance theory and fund manager behaviour. However, on many points the empirical evidence does confirm the theoretically derived conclusion concerning the potentially contradictory microfoundations of financialization. Fund managers often do act in a way which is consistent with finance theory's core claim that an index-tracking strategy represents the only equilibrium portfolio, even if this is only rarely as a result of the direct performativity of the theory.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Watson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Matthew.G.Watson@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,20,23,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The evolutionary process of any emerging technology, however, is a complex, dynamic and lengthy one that involves multi-faceted interactions and interdependencies among multiple stakeholders, from the entrepreneurial effort of nurturing new ideas, to intra-firm and/or inter-firm collaboration and integration in managing technological innovation, to the diffusion and commercialization of a new technology in certain institutional and social settings. To map the evolutionary trajectory of an emerging technology and understand what and why each stakeholder plays a certain role in an institutional framework and a complex value network, a holistic process-oriented case inquiry approach is useful because of its ability to deal with processural matters and a multiple stakeholder environment. This paper describes the process-oriented, holistic, case inquiry methodology which was used to investigate the development process of mobile payment technologies, and how high-tech entrepreneurial start-ups, incubator mobile operators and government regulators played a critical role in this process, in Korea.

Practice shows that rehabilitation teams are mainly interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams generally include one or more physicians, nurse practitioners, and social workers. Nutritionists, speech, physical and occupational therapists, psychologists, and others usually participate on a case-by-case basis. Rehabilitation teams are designed to treat the whole person rather than simply the specific medical condition that may have led the person to seek treatment. Teams are concerned about an individual's living situation, independent functioning, nutritional status and collaboration with the patient's spouse. They also focus on health promotion and disease prevention. In this article the focus is on the specific specialist the nurse; the one who is one of the core specialists in rehabilitation team. Our interest is to define the exact team role which the nurse-specialist performs: a team member, a (team) case manager / a coordinator or a team administrator / care manager's? The research problem includes two questions: What are the dimensions of the specialist role in a rehabilitation team?

According to the basic hypothesis, it is possible to use dynamics analysis and development characteristics of Croatian counties in the past 20 years in order to establish tendencies of regional disparities and the key regional development problems. The meta-analysis method was used in the research because there was a great variety of information. Former development of Croatian counties was analysed in the first step, measured by the range between the minimum and the maximum value of some of the previously used development indicators of Croatian counties. The extent of relative development disparities was established, as well as whether they had been increasing or reducing. The main result of the analysis is evaluation of tendencies and the present development level in individual counties, and the key reasons which had an impact on development. Measures for reduction of development disparities are proposed. A complex multi-criteria regional development analysis conducted in the research shows that, in the period between 1991 and 2009, eleven counties were developing, three were developing at a slower pace, one was stagnating, and six counties lagged behind in development, which is the basic conclusion of the research.","[Aksentijevic, Nada Karaman; Jezic, Zoran] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Aksentijevic, NK (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nkaraman@efri.hr; zjezic@efri.hr,"Aksentijevic, Nada Karaman/R-4302-2018; Jezic, Zoran/R-3598-2018","Aksentijevic, Nada Karaman/0000-0001-5599-2738; Jezic, Zoran/0000-0002-6852-8747",,,,,17,3,3,0,8,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Giving manufacturers freedom to control retail prices is more likely to harm consumers when retailers impose positive promotional externalities on each other, and the converse is true otherwise.

The research is based on the hypothesis that higher corporate efficiency affects social responsibility development in enterprises and vice versa, that socially more responsible corporate performance have a positive effect on efficiency. In their research, many authors have proved the correlation between social responsibility and financial performance, reputation of the enterprise and added value. Cases from transition countries, which transferred to market economy and focused on socially responsible management and sustainability, have not been the subject of research. The social responsibility concept implies balance between economic, ecological and social goals, which means distribution of assets on several actors, so it may be predicted that more efficient enterprises will sooner accept the sustainability concept and act more responsibly Except for theoretical social responsibility hypothesis, the initial point in the empirical section is dynamic analysis of business activities of Croatian entrepreneurs in the period between 1993 and 2010, on the basis of which a sample of enterprises was chosen, which submit transparent reports on social responsibility. The main result obtained by univariate analysis confirms that socially more responsible enterprises have better financial results, i.e. they are more efficient, and also have better reputation. The research also had limitations in relation to qualitative determination of the social responsibility impact on efficiency. The conclusion is derived that there is a causal relationship between efficiency and social responsibility i.e. higher efficiency level enables higher allocation of resources with the purpose of socially more responsible corporate performance and vice versa; socially responsible corporate performance have an impact on reputation and on improved efficiency, measured by financial indicators.","Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Vitezic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nevit@efri.hr,"Vitezic, Neda/R-9943-2018","Vitezic, Neda/0000-0001-7495-1069",,,,,38,8,9,0,27,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

On the other hand, when the plaintiffs are individuals or nonpublic business entities, the abnormal returns are statistically insignificant. When lawsuits are filed under EPA's superfund statute, defendant firms experience significant loss in equity value.

In many application areas, demand prediction relies on statistical software which provides an initial forecast subsequently modified by the expert's judgment. This paper outlines a new methodology based on state-dependent parameter (SDP) estimation techniques to identify the nonlinear behaviour of such managerial adjustments. This non-parametric SDP estimate is used as a guideline to propose a nonlinear model that corrects the bias introduced by the managerial adjustments. One-step-ahead forecasts of stock-keeping unit sales sampled monthly from a manufacturing company are utilized to test the proposed methodology. The results indicate that adjustments introduce a nonlinear pattern, undermining accuracy. This understanding can be used to enhance the design of the forecasting support system in order to help forecasters towards more efficient judgmental adjustments.

Theoretical and empirical studies have documented the positive contribution of social capital in social welfare and development. This study empirically explores the determinants of social capital, in the form of group membership, across European countries. Data is derived from the European Community Household Panel, which covers a large sample of individuals from a set of European countries. Binary logistic regression models are applied to regress an index of individuals' group membership on a set of individual characteristics (income, education, gender, age, marital status, employment), as well as aggregate characteristics of countries (GDP per capita, income inequality, social trust, trust in public institutions, corruption, unemployment, and violation of political and civil rights). Results provide evidence of the impact of both individual and aggregate factors on group membership. These factors constitute a possible means to rebuilding patterns of social capital, especially in Southern European countries, where special-interest groups and patron-client relations prevail over generalized norms and networks of reciprocity, trust, and cooperation that promote wider social welfare and development objectives.","[Christoforou, Asimina] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Christoforou, Asimina] Univ Crete Greece, Iraklion, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Christoforou, A (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",asimina@aueb.gr,,,,,,,33,21,25,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

When the products involved in the merger case are differentiated along several dimensions, actual diversion ratios may be very different from those calculated from market shares. This again may affect the predicted post-merger price effects. This article shows how merger simulation can be performed using observed diversion ratios. To illustrate the potential effects of this approach we use diversion ratios from a local grocery market in Norway. In this case diversions from the acquired to the acquiring stores were considerably smaller than suggested by market shares, and the predicted average price increase from the acquisition was 40% lower using this model rather than a model based upon market shares. This analysis also suggests that even a subset of observed diversion ratios may significantly change the prediction from a merger simulation based upon market shares. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Nonparametric frontier methods, as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and FDH, have been applied to the efficiency analysis of decision making units (DMUs). Despite the greater popularity of DEA relative to FDH, this last method nevertheless enables a comparison to be directly made between observed ports, whereas traditional DEA only enables comparisons between the frontier projections. The main disadvantage of FDH methodology is the observation of many efficient units, which makes it difficult to obtain a hierarchal ranking. This paper solves this problem and presents a new method for ranking the efficiency of the seaports with FDH methodology.","[Sala, Ramon] Univ Valencia, Dept Math Econ & Business, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Medal, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Business Finance Dept, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Sala, R (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Math Econ & Business, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",medal@uv.es; sala@uv.es,"Sala-Garrido, Ramon/K-3164-2014","Sala-Garrido, Ramon/0000-0002-4693-3944",,,,,34,3,3,1,13,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

In other regulated network industries, such as the electricity sector, liberalization subsequently led to a significant number of cross-border mergers. A merger wave also followed the deregulation of U. S. rail freight in the early 1980s. It is therefore not unlikely that an increased number of rail freight mergers might occur in Europe in the upcoming years. This article discusses the competitive effects of such mergers in the context of recently liberalized markets. In particular, it draws from the experience of recent cross-border mergers that were notified before the European Commission.

In this article, I use a case study from Rajasthan, India, to show how conflicts that have been generated by recent trends in development funding are taking a specific shape at the scale of NGO workplaces. A process of professionalization is occurring that is altering NGO-client interactions and the hiring priorities of NGOs. I use the framework of interactive service work to argue that previously close relationships between fieldworkers and clients have become shallow encounters, characterized by a relative interchangeability of provider and customer. The work of an NGO fieldworker has become deskilled and degraded. For the NGO I studied, deskilling brought about a rapid turnover of senior staff, who were replaced by low-paid, low-caste fieldworkers. The change in staff spurred the management of employees' emotional labor as the NGO leaders attempted to generate the necessary emotional connections between fieldworkers and clients, so its contracted project could move forward successfully. Changes in the caste composition of staff, coupled with new labor processes in villages, also created tensions about the status of the NGO's work as a social service. The research adds depth to previous studies of neoliberalism's impact on service workers in the Global North and South and to the literature on the professionalization of development.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"O'Reilly, K (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, MS 3147, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",koreilly@geos.tamu.edu,"Kim, Hyung Woo/G-7525-2011",,,,,,62,17,30,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

In this context, an efficient corporate governance system may prove as a significant policy tool for the investment and growth prospective of the Spanish economy. The regulatory framework of the Spaniard capital market has been coordinate with the EU standards.

We find that alcohol consumption is a significant influence on the suicide rate among younger males. Its influence on the female suicide rate is not well-established, although there is some evidence that it plays a role in the 15-24 age group. The unemployment rate is also a significant influence on the male suicide rate in the younger age groups but evidence of its influence on the female suicide rate is lacking. The behaviour of suicide rates among males aged 55 and over and females aged 25 and over is unaccounted for by our model. The findings suggest that higher alcohol consumption played a significant role in the very rapid increase in suicide mortality among young Irish males between the late 1980s and the end of the century. In the early twenty first century a combination of falling alcohol consumption and low unemployment led to a marked reduction in suicide rates. The recent rise in suicide rates may be attributed to the sharp rise in unemployment, especially among males, but it has been moderated by the continuing fall in alcohol consumption. Finally, we discuss some policy implications of our findings.","[Walsh, Brendan] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Walsh, Dermot] Mental Hlth Commiss, Calgary, AB, Canada",University College Dublin,"Walsh, B (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Brendan.m.walsh@ucd.ie,,,,,,,36,17,20,0,69,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

A continuous increase of public debt in most European countries in past decades has recently become a great threat not only for particular economies but the EU as a whole. However the debt debate focuses mainly on public debt and not the private debt and household saving. On the other hand it was the private debt which was substantially affecting the economy development during the US housing crisis. Possibly if the market was convinced that households have high savings and the risk of massive housing sales is low, than the subsequent financial crisis could have been much weaker or not appear at all. The paper deals with the general analysis of public debt in EU member states with focus on Barro-Ricardo preposition empirical verification. We show that countries with higher public debt tend to have higher saving ratio. This is resulting in possibility of financing the public debt trough private domestic funds and to repel the public finance bankrupt. It is a question how to convince the public to finance the public debt - whether to increase the taxes or find other tools. In every case it is necessary to explain the government steps very well as although there is a scope to finance the public debt it is necessary to find the public will to do it.","[Cadil, Jan] Unicorn Coll, CZ-13000 Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Cadil, Jan; Cadik, Jindrich] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cadil, J (通讯作者)，Unicorn Coll, CZ-13000 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",jan.cadil@unicorncollege.cz; jindrich.cadik@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,115,126,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200012,0

This study systematically identifies innovation outputs used in the science park literature and argues: (a) that firms generate different outcomes at various stages of the innovation process; and (b) that their use is a possible explanation for the mixed findings reported in the field. This paper combines a knowledge production function approach, modeling knowledge transfers and spillover flowing to new technology-based firms (NTBFs) in the emerging South African economy with innovation outcomes, which are measured by using a multi-dimensional construct. The estimations produce non-consistent and non-systematic results across different dimensions of innovation outcomes, implying that results are outcome indicator specific and that it makes sense to distinguish multiple indicators of innovation outcomes referring to different phases in a firm's innovation process.","[Chan, Kai-Ying A.; Oerlemans, Leon A.

The total quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW), industrial solid waste (ISW), and hazardous waste (HW) have become a threat to the environment.

In this regard though there are many ways and means to keep the environment pollution free from such effluents which originate from different modes and have different bearing upon environment disposal of certain effluents like those of biomedical is difficult to manage.Biomedical waste consists of solids, liquids, sharps and laboratory waste that are potentially infectious or dangerous and are considered bio-waste. The biomedical waste produced in the course of health care activities carries a higher potential for infection and injury than any other type of waste. Inappropriate handling of biomedical waste may have serious public health consequences and a significant impact on the environment. It must be properly managed to protect the general public, specifically healthcare and sanitation workers who are regularly exposed to biomedical waste as an occupational hazard.The present paper proposes to focus on biomedical waste - its different types, hazards associated and strategies for purifying the environment from such waste which degrade the environment.

The article considers the crisis from the perspective of metaphor theory. Metaphor is understood as a semantic re-interpretation of reality in the sense that the speaker does not only transfer a sign to a different context, but creates new and innovative meaning. Metaphorical expressions bring specific characteristics into focus and are framed by social context. Following this view the paper ties in with new metaphor theories which have given important impulses to recent social and cultural studies. In 2009/2010 managers of machine tool industries as well as further regional actors in Germany were interviewed. The interviews showed that the crisis was understood as a 'wave' resp. a cyclical phenomenon, but also as a singular situation in the 'game' of competition.

Though, Europe's SMEs lack a systematic approach to support them in this key activity. Innovation is a highly dynamic process; within a company, if an innovation roadmap does exist, it is adapted to its needs and/or creative potential, being usually highly unstructured. Moreover, while addressing engineering problems that innovation implies, companies need to search for solutions outside of their internal knowledge, and doing this effectively is a highly difficult task. This paper introduces an innovative approach to address these challenges, by the mean of a software tool that systematically supports the innovation process within a SME. Relevant innovation tools are supported; their data is not stored in a traditional database, but in three dedicated ontologies. By the means of another dedicated ontology, the innovation process is then automatically guided, not imposed, as in the traditional approaches.","[Fulea, Mircea; Mocan, Bogdan; Brad, Stelian] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,mircea.fulea@staff.utcluj.ro; bogdan.mocan@muri.utcluj.ro; stelian.brad@staff.utcluj.ro,"Fulea, Mircea/N-9742-2018; Brad, Stelian/ABC-7027-2020; Mocan, Bogdan/AAE-1127-2020","Fulea, Mircea/0000-0001-9640-6379; Mocan, Bogdan/0000-0002-2488-7254",,,,,12,0,0,1,5,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,281,284,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600062,0

The objects of the investigation are regions which are subjects of the Russian Federation or countries of the European Union. The influence of properties and nature of innovative behaviour models on such characteristics of environment as well-being and human resources in R&D is studied. It is found out that the main factor of increasing innovation activity will be the growth of the well-being level if it is low enough. If the well-being level achieves the certain value, its influence on firms' choice of innovative behaviour model is diminished. In this case the value of human resources in R&D determines mainly the type of innovative behaviour. It is shown that those regions which are at the lowest level of economic well-being are forced to rely mainly on formally closed innovations. The improvements of welfare level give an opportunity of shifting to open innovations. The greater increase of well-being stimulates to introduce more complex modes of innovative behaviour. In this case the product diffusion is rather significant and innovations have mainly product type. Increase in both welfare and research facility supports introducing new or significant improved products. The growth of research potential moves a balance of innovations to in-house ones. The degree of product novelty and the scale of product diffusion are high. When the maximum level of human resource in R&D and well-being are achieved, the innovative behaviour mode is based on introducing basic innovations and expanding them to outside market. It is found out that the role functions of enterprises can vary during time period. These changes can have a periodic character and attached to certain stages of innovation cycles. The cycles corresponds to different modes of behaviour and may differ both in duration and substance of their stages.","[Golichenko, Oleg; Balycheva, Yulia] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Econ & Math Inst, Moscow, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Economics & Mathematics Institute RAS,,golichenko@rambler.ru; yulia.balycheva@gmail.com,"Golichenko, Oleg/M-2346-2015; Balycheva, Yulia/AAZ-2403-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,378,387,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800047,0

Previous work has shown how such an approach can be explicitly used to improve the Innovation Competency of staff through an analysis of proficiency and tailored education and development programmes (Howard, 2010). Fundamental to this approach is its reliance on hard data and the audit of measurable activity. More recent work has suggested the complexity of real world situations requires a more holistic model incorporating softer aspects. This paper reviews the concept of improving the capacity and capability of an organisation to innovate and describes an approach incorporating both hard and soft elements. Finally the paper supports the need to develop an increasing emphasis on the softer aspects in order to maximise innovation capacity.","[Howard, John] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Hlth, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,,jhoward1@uclan.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,457,465,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800056,0

[16] find that FDI is a catalyst for international tourism in the case of China. However, more empirical works are needed in the literature; therefore, this paper contributes to this literature by empirically investigating the level relationship and the direction of causality between the net FDI inflows and international tourism in a developing economy, Turkey. The present study employs the bounds test for long run equilibrium relationship as developed by [12] and Granger causality tests under vector error correction modeling with that respect. Results suggest that both variables are in long-run equilibrium relationship only when FDI is dependent variable under the ARDL (auto-regressive distributed lag) modeling approach. Results did not reveal any long run equilibrium relationship amongst these variables when international tourism variable is dependent in the bounds test of [12]. Final investigation in the present study is that international tourist arrivals to Turkey stimulates an expansion in the net FDI inflows. Thus, in opposite to the findings of [16], the results of the present study reveal that international tourism is a catalyst for foreign direct investment in the long run of the Turkish economy. The present study implicates that the Turkish authorities should promote international tourism since both its economy and foreign based investments will be positively inluenced from the development of this foreign exchange earning sector. This study shows that there is a huge need for further attention for this debate from the other researchers.","Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, N Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Katircioglu, S (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, POB 95,Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, N Cyprus, Turkey.",salihk@emu.edu.tr,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016",,,,,,22,23,24,1,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

For this purpose, we present findings from two empirical studies among Entrepreneurship students participating in a business plan competition. Our results show that narcissism and psychopathy are positively related to entrepreneurial intention, perceived desirability, and perceived feasibility. The examination of effects on performance criteria revealed different patterns for narcissism and Machiavellianism in business planning. A comparative analysis reveals that Machiavellians outperform narcissists. Their higher performance is not mirrored by an elevated interest in an entrepreneurial career but seems to emanate from their general competitive attitude. Although narcissists initiate more steps towards venture creation and are highly attracted by an entrepreneurial career, their desire and intention may be an expression of their self-enhancement and self-portrayal biases. Based on these results, we offer avenues for further research and implications for practitioners.","[Kramer, Matthias] Reutlingen Univ, Reutlingen, Germany; [Kramer, Matthias] Dublin City Univ, Dublin, Ireland; [Cesinger, Beate; Schwarzinger, Dominik; Gelleri, Petra] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany",Dublin City University; University Hohenheim,"Kramer, M (通讯作者)，Reutlingen Univ, Reutlingen, Germany.",Matthias.Kramer@Reutlingen-University.de; beate.cesinger@uni-hohenheim.de; d.schwarzinger@uni-hohenheim.de; petra.gelleri@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,44,0,1,1,57,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,535,542,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800065,0

This paper has extended the previous literatures by using unbalanced panel data methodology. The findings indicate that: first, the total debt ratio shows a negative impact on fixed investment by firms but total bank loan ratio shows a positive impact on fixed investment. It implies that the effect of debt on investment exists for Malaysian listed firms although the impact at low significance level. Second, the firms with higher Tobin's Q and larger cash flow make larger amounts of investment. Third, the bank loan ratio has a negative impact on investment by low-growth firms than by high-growth firms. These results also depict that the bank loan ratio works as a factor that restrains overinvestment by firms. This impact suggests that banks which are large creditors of listed firms in Malaysia have supervised the investment activities of firms more strongly than other creditors.","[Ma'in, Masturah] Univ Teknol MARA Malaysia, Fac Business & Management, Alor Gajah 78000, Melaka, Malaysia; [Ismail, Abdul Ghafar] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Res Ctr Islamic Econ & Finance, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Ma'in, M (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA Malaysia, Fac Business & Management, Alor Gajah 78000, Melaka, Malaysia.",masturahmain@gmail.com; agibab@ukm.my,"Ismail, Abdul Ghafar/E-7190-2016; Ma’in, Masturah/JFA-8584-2023","Ismail, Abdul Ghafar/0000-0003-2450-0168;",,,,,20,0,0,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8719-3,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,3.0,,,,,,134,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX67,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303218200028,0

Are calculated exergy losses in each component of the single stage vapor compression equipment, commonly used in food processing. This is an important path to follow seen that exergy analysis indicates the priority for the improvement. Results reveal a hierarchy of the components to be improved, being indicated solutions for technological changes. For the presented case of study, the larger amount of exergy losses will be encountered in the evaporator (28%), followed by the compressor (18%). By adopting an evaporator with a higher surface and a compressor with a better isentropic efficiency, these losses are reduced (to 17, 14, respectively 10, 87). The innovation of the refrigerating equipment continues if we talk about existing systems. These should be retrofitted by changing the refrigerant (HCFC) with a non ozone depleting one (HFC), this procedure requiring also the change of the oil (form mineral oil to polyolester). This paper contributes to the achievement of a more sustainable food processing by landing two aspects: the use of a green refrigerant and reducing exergy losses.","[Memet, F.; Stan, L.; Mitu, D.] Constanta Maritime Univ, Constanta, Romania",Constanta Maritime University,,feizamemet@yahoo.com; liviustan14@yahoo.com; dana.mitu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,73,76,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000019,0

These countries were chosen to compare the most discussed US economy with the France as a representative of the western-European type of economy and the Czech Republic as a representative economy of a transition country. The analysis is based on two principles - the difference version and the dynamic version of the Okun's law. Estimations of difference version of Okun's law coefficients show the persistence of the basic rule - the GDP growth causes the unemployment rate decrease. The estimation results express that the 1 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate is bound with 10.1% increase of the real GDP. These numbers are different for France and the USA; the 1 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate is bound with 2.7% increase of the real GDP in France and with 1.8% increase of the real GDP in the USA for the same time period. The output growth rate under a condition of the stable unemployment rate for the case of the Czech Republic is 2.4 %, while in France and in the USA is much smaller. The time changes in coefficients reveal the decreasing trend of the Czech GDP growth rate under a condition of the stable unemployment rate. The ratio of the GDP-change to the unemployment rate change has increased during the studied period. Estimations of dynamic version of Okun's law have shown the same tendencies in the Czech Republic as in other two countries.","[Mielcova, Elena] Silesian Univ Opava, Fac Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Mielcová, E (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Fac Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava, Czech Republic.",mielcova@opf.slu.cz,,"Mielcova, Elena/0000-0002-4675-740X",,,,,11,8,8,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Despite extensive research on e-business practice amongst this sector, there have been limited works to investigate the extent of Internet alignment across various business functions. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the issue concerned. A survey was carried out with 54 firms to obtain their perception on the current state of Internet alignment across three major business functions, namely sales-related, procurement-related, and internal operations. The results ascertained that alignment inconsistencies do exist at different business functions. Cluster analysis further revealed two distinct firm profiles based on their alignment pattern.

We examine different energy wood price levels under two contrasting scenarios of future global development, defined by the A1 and B2 storylines of IPCC. A1 depicts increased globalization and rapid economic growth. In B2. the economic growth is more modest, and the world is more environmentally conscious and regionally oriented. The analysis carried out using the global forest sector model EFI-GTM shows that as energy wood prices increase, the wood imports and reallocation of wood from competing industrial users such as board manufacturers or the pulp and paper industry also increase strongly. The quantity of wood directed from the forest industry to the energy sector would at most be around 20 Mtoe (million tons of oil equivalent) in terms of energy, given a price of 100 (sic)/m(3) of energy wood. Still, this would cover only around 8% of the European Union's RES target for 2020, and an even lower share for 2030. For some forest industry sectors like production of pulp and panels that would mean an important output reduction, around 20-25%. Additional felling could be an important source of wood for bioenergy in the near future, when utilization of the forest resource potential is still not very high. However, toward 2030, forest resource utilization is projected to increase and might become a limiting factor for additional biomass potentials. Given the relatively high economic growth assumed in the scenarios and the rather strong development in the demand for forest industry products, there is a considerable chance that the supply of wood biomass for energy will be largely limited to logging residues in the long run.

The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between cultural values, country of origin image and negotiation strategies on the Chinese market. The relationships are assessed using a structured questionnaire. The research among 108 Slovenian exporters and their representatives on the Chinese market showed positive impact of negative country of origin image and high respect for social norms on win-lose negotiation strategies. Furthermore, assessing the negotiation factors and their impact on negotiation strategies in China, the research confirmed that the more the emotional response of foreign counterparts, the more the contract is general (opposed to specific) and the more the foreign partner is using competitive style of conflict resolution, the higher is likelihood of Chinese to use win-lose negotiation strategies. Surprisingly, our research did not indicate any significant relationships between cultural values, country of origin image and win-win negotiation strategies. In sum, there is no other study, at least to our knowledge, that would evaluate the country of origin image, cultural values and negotiation factors on individual basis together in a comprehensive model of negotiation strategies evaluation; while the research findings might help Slovenian companies to be more effective on the Chinese market.","[Pfajfar, Gregor; Farcnik, Dasa] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Pfajfar, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",gregor.pfajfar@ef.uni-lj.si; dasa.farcnik@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,5,UNIV MARIBOR,KRANJ,"FAC ORG SCI, ECENTER, KIDRICEVA CESTA 55A, KRANJ, 4000, SLOVENIA",,,978-961-232-249-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,83,95,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8BC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000403116000011,0

Such graphs demonstrate the nonlinear relationship between increasing cost and service level given the constraints on the business. The curve represents the operating objective and many managers refer to this curve as the efficient frontier. These exchange curve analyses seldom formulated inventory trade-oils as a multi-objective optimization problem and their solution procedures were all based on single objective optimization. In this paper, a bi-objective inventory management model without redundancy is discussed first. Then a solution procedure based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization is introduced to effectively solve the fixed order model. The results show that the intrinsic multi-objective approach can find efficient policies of order size and safety factor simultaneously without estimating shortage cost or service level. By comparing historical cost and service levels to the performance levels possible, a business can gauge how much room it has for improvement and determine the mat cost-effective operating point. The cost-service trade-off can be observed in a single run of an iterative computation, so that it is more appropriate for the practice of inventory management.","[Tsou, China-Shih; Wu, Bo-Han; Lee, Yina-Hao] Natl Taipei Coll Business, Inst Informat Sci & Management, Taipei 10051, Taiwan",,,cstsou@mail.ntcb.edu.tw,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8641-7,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,2.0,,,,,,93,97,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173500021,0

The social distance aspect is introduced in the context of the business partnership literature. Empirical data were collected via a questionnaire survey (response rate is 32% (38 of 119 companies)). Data analysis shows that Lithuanian textile and apparel companies can be characterized as having a very low degree of internationalisation despite their managers having a good understanding of the importance of business partnerships and a low social distance with business partners. Thus, the study shows that an understanding of importance of close relationships with business partners does not result in a higher degree of internationalisation as there are additional factors such as social distance and intensity of relationships (for example passive relationships) which affect internationalisations process as well.","Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Vaiginiene, E (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Bldg 2,Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",erika.vaiginiene@ef.vu.lt,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

While the existing literature suggests power relations and technology to be path dependent and influenced by each other, interactions across these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood. We studied the history of four retail firms over 40 years, applying event structure analysis to explicate key dynamics. Companies exhibited two episodes of converging path dependency, where power relations further increased technological inertia. In each case, power initially concentrated outside the central headquarters. Path-breaking change led all firms to centralize power and implement networked IT systems supporting central control. We discuss the ability of converging technological and organizational path dependencies to create competitive disadvantage. New widely available technological innovations can disadvantage a firm vis-a-vis its competitors when the firm's established power structure prevents it from fully exploiting the innovation, and the path dependence of power relations prevents adaptation. Thus, company owners should create path-breaking disruptions in power relations when technological adoption provides value.","[Valorinta, Mikko] Aalto Sch Sci, Inst Strategy, Espoo, Finland; [Schildt, Henri] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Management & Org, Helsinki, Finland; [Lamberg, Juha-Antti] Univ Jyvaskyla, Strategy & Econ Hist Res Grp, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland",Aalto University; Hanken School of Economics; University of Jyvaskyla,"Valorinta, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Inst Strategy & Int Business, Sch Sci & Technol, POB 11000, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",mikko_valorinta@yahoo.com,"Lamberg, Juha-Antti/E-4226-2013; Lamberg, Juha-Antti/P-4517-2019; Schildt, Henri A/G-4462-2012","Lamberg, Juha-Antti/0000-0003-3173-0199;",,,,,75,15,18,10,77,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The large variety of continuous improvement methods, well known at this moment, makes pretty difficult the choice of most appropriate strategy for production and productivity increasing. Theoretically, any method can support a better firm's activities management and profit achievement. Yet, practically, the limited resources of time and people availability make difficult the applicability process for any method. Due to these terms, it is quite necessary to set a specific strategy that will allow a continuous improvement by using a simplified operational manner and a minimum of resources. We will display a genuine methodology for continuous improvement, based on a limited number of methods, such as: Ishikawa Diagram, Functional Analysis, FMECA, and 5S. Each of these methods is included in an organizational approach able to be fitted to every SME's. The suggested methodological tool allows a quick start of the continuous improvement of the process, and, at the same time, develops inside the firm - the opportunity to be involved in process all the functional departments. A successfully practical implementation process of the methodological tool will depend on the political support of the firm's management, and the desire level for involvement of each employee's category as well. We are having in view that the continuous improvement to become a never-ending process and, more than that, to become a never-missing part of the organizational developing strategies. Also, we recommend to the managers to implement our tool by using the PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act).

An analysis of different technical and non-technical improvement options that could be achieved at each stage of a car's life cycle was performed. The consequences of the adoption of these options on the environment were estimated. The results show that some of the options analysed could have a major positive impact on the vehicle efficiency and induce large improvements of the environmental profile of passenger cars. The highest improvements are achievable through more efficient power trains (including hybrid car), and through lightweight cars. For some options, burden shifts from one car life cycle phase to another, or from one environmental problem to another, can occur. The results show that besides the purely technological options, those that imply behavioural changes by the driver may also reduce the environmental burden substantially. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome the difficulty of evaluating the predictive likelihood, we introduce the concept of expected toe-predictive likelihoods for Bayesian models, and propose an estimator of the expected log-predictive likelihood. The estimator is derived by correcting the asymptotic bias of the log-likelihood of the predictive distribution as an estimate of its expected value. We investigate the relationship between the proposed criterion and the traditional information criteria and show that the proposed criterion is a natural extension of the traditional ones. A new model selection criterion and a new model averaging method are then developed, with the weights for the individual models being dependent on their expected log-predictive likelihoods. We examine the performance of the proposed method using Monte Carlo experiments and a real example, which concerns the prediction of quarterly growth rates of real gross domestic product in the G7 countries. Out-of-sample forecasts show that the proposed methodology outperforms other methods available in the literature. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As there are a wide range of actors with different interests involved in this process, the MAMCA methodology was applied to evaluate a set of possible policy measures being proposed to reach this objective. An important advantage of this methodology is that it is able to support the decision maker in his final decision as the inclusion of different points of view leads to a general prioritisation of the proposed policy measures.

We commence by analysing the 'behavioural' definition and, after clarifying its conditions for altruism, we argue that it is not in 'reflective equilibrium' with everyday linguistic usage of the term. We therefore consider a 'psychological' definition, which we likewise refine, and argue that it better reflects ordinary language use. Both behavioural and psychological approaches define altruism descriptively and thus fail to capture an important aspect of altruism, namely its normative component. Altruism, we argue, is a 'thick concept', i.e. one which embodies both positive and normative components. We discuss and compare various formulations of this normative component.","[Schefczyk, Michael] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Peacock, Mark] York Univ, Dept Social Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",University of Zurich; York University - Canada,"Schefczyk, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,32,10,18,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

For many migrants, international migration triggers a series of trips to visit the home country that allow for a replenishment of the depleted relationship capital with family and friends back home, but these trips incur travel costs and foregone earnings. Given plausible assumptions about the depreciation and replenishment of home country relationship capital, a steady-state level of average maintained relationship capital implies that the optimized travel frequency is inversely related to the distance and the transportation costs, and positively related to the psychological costs of separation. The total time spent at home is increasing in the trip frequency, but with an elasticity that is decreasing in cultural proximity. Empirical evidence in support of these theoretical predictions is found in a unique longitudinal sample of international travel of 13,674 New Zealand citizens and 6882 UK citizens who migrated to Australia between 1 August 1999 and 31 July 2000.","[McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [McCann, Philip] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Poot, Jacques] Univ Waikato, Ctr Populat Studies, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Sanderson, Lynda] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Groningen; University of Waikato; University of Waikato; Reserve Bank of New Zealand,"McCann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",p.mccann@rug.nl; jpoot@waikato.ac.nz; lynda.sanderson@rbnz.govt.nz,"; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Poot, Jacques/0000-0003-4735-9283; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",,,,,30,28,32,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The study relies on the postulates of De Miguel (2001) and Mendez (2000, 2004), related to the parameters for curricular evaluations referring to academic performance and conceptualization about curricular reform. Research was of the evaluative, descriptive and documentary type. The totality of six-hundred two (602) students in the school were considered as the population; their academic performance was evaluated before and after applying the reform, using documentary observation of records contributed by the program LUZ - SADIA. On reviewing student performance, the maintenance of an academic yield of fourteen (14) points was verified, considered so-so according to the proposed standard; this makes it possible to assert that, at this moment, the implemented curricular reform has not notably affected academic yield.

However, as pointed Out by Bai and Ng, the ranked factors considered in the forecasting equation depend neither on the variable to be forecast nor oil the forecasting horizon. We propose a refinement of the standard approach that retains the computational simplicity while coping with this limitation. Our approach consists of generating a weighted average of all the principal components, the weights depending both on the eigenvalues of the sample correlation matrix and on the covariance between the estimated factor and the targeted variable at the relevant horizon. This 'targeted diffusion index' approach is applied to US data and the results show that it Outperforms considerably the standard approach in forecasting several major macroeconomic series. Moreover, the improvement is more significant in the final part of the forecasting evaluation period.

This article investigates the conditions under which extending such protection to civil defendants might increase (or decrease) social welfare. If discovery is imperfect, then defendants who acquire information about the dangerousness of their actions may hide this evidence at trial if it is bad. This tends to make the private benefit from acquiring such information exceed the social benefit. Furthermore, the private benefit from acquiring this information is greater when the court will infer the information is bad if the defendant does not present it. Thus, there are situations in which a right to silence may be necessary to prevent a defendant from acquiring information for which the social costs exceed the social benefit. On the other hand, if it is hard to hide damaging information and the release of damaging information tends to induce lawsuits, then a right to silence may dampen already insufficient incentives to acquire information.

First an analytical framework is developed to identify the determinants of the real effective exchange rate. Using quarterly data and employing recent econometric techniques, the relationship between the real effective exchange rate and economic growth is then investigated. A bivariate Granger causality test was also employed as part of the methodology to examine the causal relationship between the real exchange rate and economic growth. The empirical results suggest that the real effective exchange rate correlates positively with economic growth, with a statistically significant coefficient. The results also indicate that monetary policy is relatively more effective than fiscal policy in the long run, and evidence of the real effective exchange rate causing economic growth was profound. In addition, the results showed that terms of trade, exchange rate devaluation, investment to GDP ratio and an excessive supply of domestic credit were the main determinants of the real exchange rate in Sierra Leone.","Univ Sierra Leone, Dept Econ, Freetown, Sierra Leone",,"Tarawalie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sierra Leone, Dept Econ, Freetown, Sierra Leone.",,,,,,,,28,10,10,2,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It arises from observations of three situations: a) the institutions for teacher training and continuing education in the State of Durango (IFAD), which resisted the idea of being controlled by an organic state unit; b) national and state debates about integrating the national system with the state sub-systems for teacher training; c) the faculty that educational legislation grants to each state to contribute to integrating such systems. Information was collected from interviews with key individuals who work directly training teachers in the State of Durango and from information given by those attending national meetings, such as secretaries and sub-secretaries of education in the entities and other states and federal authorities that coordinate programs related to teacher training. Research found that there are normative, political, cultural, structural, administrative and economic implications as well as power groups that influence integration of the state teacher-training system.","[Barraza Soto, Isidro] Univ San Luis, Potosi, Mexico",,"Soto, IB (通讯作者)，Univ San Luis, Potosi, Mexico.",barrazasi@hotmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Recent market socialist contributions attempt to overcome socialism's seeming resistance to markets. However, such contributions are frequently undermined by Hayek's invocation of fragmented knowledge. This article endeavours to contribute to a broadly conceived socialism that is not grounded in a particular array of institutions, but one which, via the instrumental valuation principle, the capabilities approach and Dewey's conceptualization of knowledge, offers the prospect of enhancing individual dignity. The instrumental valuation principle is viewed as key to socialism's engagement with dignity as it provides the framework for the enhancement of egalitarianism, democracy and the undermining of invidious institutional arrangements.","[Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Dept Management, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow,"Cumbers, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",andrew.cumbers@ges.gla.ac.uk; r.mcmaster@lbss.gla.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,7,7,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

However, new technologies have not been fully utilized by the farmers over the past years [16]. Technology adoption depends on farmers' behavioural change. Farmers behaviour determine by their beliefs and motives, which they have for long time. Understanding the beliefs and motives affecting farmers' adoption of improved technologies are critical to increase the production and profit in farmland. The key theory used in this paper is Theory of Planned Behaviour. It explains that ones actual behaviour is guided by three variables namely attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. There are some criticisms about prediction of farmers' behaviour by these three variables. As a result, many researches have suggested that prediction of behaviour can be increased by adding other factors into the TPB model. Motivation is one of the potential factors that can be explained individual's decision making more comprehensively. The aim of this paper is to link the different types of motivation to improve the prediction of farmers' behaviour by identifying most relevant beliefs that determine technology adoption decisions. To fulfil this purpose, different types of motivation, and how they contribute to technology adoption decisions of farmers, were identified. Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Self Determination Theory (SOT) were used as the main theoretical models. These two theories were integrated in order to develop a more explanatory model to predict individual's behaviour. The model developed by this paper will contribute to the advancement of agricultural extension and policy makers to offer better assistance to farmers.","Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Herath, CS (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic.",hmcsherath@yahoo.com,,,,,,,36,15,22,1,46,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The novelty consist in the use of a capital market analysis methodology to identify how much the evolution of macroeconomic aggregates affects the investors' perception about general economic development. We propose an event-study methodology that uses daily movements in the capital index around moment when press communicates are released by the National Institute of Statistics concerning the economic growth in the past quarters and the forecasting press communicates released by the National Commission for Forecasting concerning future movements in the GDP growth or monthly estimates for the economic environment indicators in previous months.

Despite its relatively short coastline, Germany is one of the leading economies in the global shipping industry. Although the focal point of the global shipbuilding industry has shifted eastwards by degrees over the past few decades, Germany has become one of the leading economies for shipping-related services, in particular ship financing. Many of the most important lenders both private and public are located in Germany, enabling Hamburg in particular to become one of the key locations for global ship financing. However, ship financing in Germany has been heavily hit by the global financial and economic crisis since mid 2008. The partly dysfunctional lending market has led to a significant credit crunch which could endanger Germany's leading position in the global ship financing market going forward. Some of the large commercial banks from China have recently entered the European ship financing market, and it looks like the focal point of lending capacity could shift eastwards just as shipbuilding capacities shifted from Europe to Asia over the past few decades.","KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Saleth, J (通讯作者)，KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, Palmengartenstr 5-9, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",Jochen.saleth@kfw.de,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,12,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

On the other hand, they are taken as evidence of a strong state with huge capacity for 'social engineering'. These two contrasting perspectives suggest that the state's effects are more complex than either view captures. The article brings together the two 'truths' about family policies to demonstrate the full range of its effects. Drawing on in-depth interview data, it shows that negotiations of the structural context produced by family policies generate self-consciously Singaporean meanings and normative practices, at the same time that they clarify and legitimize the state's often paradoxical positions towards the family. Ultimately, family policies give ideological and practical content to both 'state' and 'society'.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Sociol, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Teo, Y (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Sociol, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",yyteo@ntu.edu.sg,,"Teo, Youyenn/0000-0002-9972-4417",,,,,78,55,59,5,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A plenty of articles have been published on how to improve the performance of SISP by affecting the perceived factors, such as the involvement of organizational senior management, the planning inputs and the alliance between the information planning and organizational business functions. However, quite of these prior articles were conducted from the perspective of supply chain management (SCM), although people do realize the increasing importance of SCM. Therefore, the author of this article is motivated to conduct such a research aimed at exploring more knowledge of the connection between SCM and organizational SISP. There are two major findings gained from this report by utilizing case study. The first one is information system planning practice deployed by an organization, the SC integration mode, the IT enabling SCM and relationship management are identified as the major SCM considerations for SISP. The second finding is that given the fact that is SISP evolves aligned with the organizational developments, an alliance between the SISP an organization deploys and its SCM should be achieved in order to improve the general performance of organizational performance.","[Ye Guanyu] Shaoxing Univ, Yuanpei Coll, Shaoxing City 312000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Shaoxing University,,yegc@zscas.edu.cn,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,379,385,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287959400062,0

It will also propose that web page design in C2C e-commerce has significant influence on consumer online purchasing behavior and likelihood for purchasing a cross-sold product. A good cross-selling page design can increase the rate of successful cross-sales. By constructing the consumer online purchasing behavior model for cross-sold products, a conclusion is made that the cross-selling page design should follow three principles:1) Displaying an appropriate number of product to cross-sell on one page; 2) Close correlation between the product to cross-sell and the initial product of interest that the customer had requested; 3) Presentation for the product to cross-sell must provide detailed quality and utility assessment, and give a sense that the product is tangible.

A comparative and over time perspective suggests that modest reductions in income inequality are achievable within the framework of Ireland's current socioeconomic model, but bringing it below the (EU or OECD) average may well be beyond the capacity of that model. The current financial, fiscal and economic crises require very substantial increases in tax revenue and reductions in state spending. The imperative to close the fiscal deficit provides a window of opportunity to restructure the tax system in a fashion that is not only more economically efficient but also more equitable. Another core aim should be to minimise the number experiencing long-term unemployment and thus the long-term impact of the recession on labour market careers. Once the most immediate needs of the situation are met, this context may provide an opportunity to debate fundamental questions about the role of the state, the extent and nature of social provision and its financing, and the broader relationship between economic performance, the Welfare State, and the underlying goals of Ireland's socio-economic policy.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Nolan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,17,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

However, there are a few practical problems when forecasting large cointegrated processes using the well-known vector error correction model. First, it is hard to identify the cointegration rank in large models. Second, since the number of parameters to be estimated tends to be large relative to the sample size in large models, estimators will have large standard errors, and so will forecasts. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a new procedure for forecasting large cointegrated processes which is free from the above problems. In Our Monte Carlo experiment, we find that our forecast gains accuracy when we work with a larger model as long as the ratio of the cointegration rank to the number of variables in the process is high.

Once lobbying for government transfers to regions is included in an economic geography framework with size asymmetries, the standard prediction that the larger region becomes the core when trade barriers are reduced no longer holds. The establishment of manufacturing production in the economically smaller region is increasing in the level of regional integration once trade becomes freer than a certain threshold value. When free trade prevails, the relocation of industry takes place up to the point where there are as many firms operating in the South as in the North. Furthermore, lobbying slows down the agglomeration process, whereas the home market magnification effect [Krugman (1991, Journal of Political Economy, 99, 483-499)] becomes weaker.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Wiberg, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",mawi@ne.su.se,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

An inspection of global temperature data suggests that temperature is subject to irregular variations on all relevant time scales, and that variations during the late 1900s were not unusual. In such a situation, a no change extrapolation is an appropriate benchmark forecasting method. We used the UK Met Office Hadley Centre's annual average thermometer data from 1850 through 2007 to examine the performance of the benchmark method. The accuracy of forecasts from the benchmark is such that even perfect forecasts would be unlikely to help policymakers. For example, mean absolute errors for the 20- and 50-year horizons were 0.18 degrees C and 0.24 degrees C respectively. We nevertheless demonstrate the use of benchmarking with the example of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 1992 linear projection of long-term warming at a rate of 0.03 degrees C per year. The small sample of errors from ex ante projections at 0.03 degrees C per year for 1992 through 2008 was practically indistinguishable from the benchmark errors. Validation for long-term forecasting, however, requires a much longer horizon. Again using the IPCC warming rate for our demonstration, we projected the rate successively over a period analogous to that envisaged in their scenario of exponential CO2 growth-the years 1851 to 1975. The errors from the projections were more than seven times greater than the errors from the benchmark method. Relative errors were larger for longer forecast horizons. Our validation exercise illustrates the importance of determining whether it is possible to obtain forecasts that are more useful than those from a simple benchmark before making expensive policy decisions.

In particular, we allow for trust updating and trust misalignments, which may give rise to 'undertrusting' and 'overtrusting'. The core of the paper sets out a game theoretic model of contracts with dynamic adjustment of trust perceptions, which we use to explore the impact of trust misalignment both on economic efficiency (measured by expected welfare) and on investment levels. We explore flexible contracts with and without pre-payments, rigid contracts (which do not allow for post-investment renegotiation), and hybrid contracts. We then compare the efficiency of the flexible contracts to that of hybrid contracts using as a criterion the expected welfare implications of each contract. The model is used to shed light on current issues on the sustainability of private investment infrastructure contracts in developed and in developing countries, including the role of regulatory institutions.","[Dassiou, Xeni; Stern, Jon] City Univ London, Dept Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Dassiou, X (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",x.dassiou@city.ac.uk; jon.stern.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,8,8,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

However, it is not clear how well current subsidies meet these objectives. In this paper the author evaluates several public transport subsidies in the case of Santiago, Chile. This is an interesting case study because in recent years direct means-tested monetary transfers have been used to distribute public transport subsidies instead of using more traditional supply side sectoral subsidies. The results show that using the general welfare system to distribute transport subsidies performs much better than traditional supply side subsidies. The latter are very badly targeted and in some cases quite regressive. Together with some recent evidence from other developing country cities, the results of this paper imply that more effort needs to be placed on the analysis, design, and implementation of social subsidies in the transport sector.","Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Gómez-Lobo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257 1501, Santiago, Chile.",agomezlo@econ.uchile.cl,,,,,,,21,9,9,0,10,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Ragnar Nurkse (1907-1959), whose 100th birthday is celebrated in 2007, is one of the founding fathers of classic development economics. Given the recent interest in the Law & Economics of development, showing how a classic figure in the field successfully used such an approach might be of considerable interest, especially as development economics is a very emotional field which may well profit from the 'objectivizing' function of Law & Economics. Nurkse's economics-based realism, his focus on what effect a program really has, rather than what it is supposed to have, and on what a policy can steer or change and what not, based on a typically Stiglerian attention to aggregate welfare, seem especially productive. Finally, the essay suggests a set of Nurkse-based principles or theses for a Law & Economics of Development.","Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-13419 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Drechsler, W (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Sutiste Tee 21, EE-13419 Tallinn, Estonia.",drechsler@staff.ttu.ee,,"Drechsler, Wolfgang/0000-0002-2880-329X",,,,,37,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In order to answer this question most economists would probably adopt a Public Choice approach. This approach has convincingly explained some aspects of environmental policies that exist in a similar fashion across Europe. But why do many environmental policies differ across European countries? This article argues that in order to understand differences in environmental policies in Europe North's analysis of institutional change focusing on formal and informal institutions, incomplete information and path dependence is useful. North's approach is applied to explain differences in a particular field of European environmental policy: The implementation of the EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. The starting point of the analysis is the observation that participation of companies in EMAS markedly differs between countries. It is shown that these differences can be explained with differences in formal and informal institutions in the three Member States, incomplete information of relevant actors, and path dependence.","UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Wätzold, F (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",frank.waetzold@ufz.de,"Watzold, Frank/F-3122-2015","Watzold, Frank/0000-0002-4664-0113",,,,,40,7,7,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We focus on manufacturing plants by region in the Chilean food industry, which is not only a major source of employment and exports but also spatially dispersed. Our estimation of plant-level productivity corrects for possible simultaneity between productivity and conventional inputs and plants self-selection to locate in specific markets. Moreover, we account for three sources of externalities: localization, urbanization and demand-driven scale economies in our estimation. Then, a censored regression model relates regional productivity-distribution measures to agglomeration economies. We find that high-productivity (exporting) plants locate in a region where other plants in food industry agglomerate, industrial structure is diversified and market size is large. Our results suggest that plants self-selection outweighs the contribution of agglomeration economies in increasing a regions productivity level.","[Gopinath, Munisamy] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Saito, Hisamitsu] Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan",Oregon State University; Obihiro University of Agriculture & Veterinary Medicine,"Gopinath, M (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 213 Ballard Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",m.gopinath@oregonstate.edu,"Saito, Hisamitsu/E-5761-2014","Saito, Hisamitsu/0000-0002-8090-3538; Munisamy, Gopi/0000-0002-6249-7548",,,,,35,32,43,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In this paper, I shall explore to what extent geographical imagination has played a role in the Dutch historical and cultural canon and in the regional, local and thematic 'canons' that followed.

Environment has been conceived as one of the factors tied to survival; this factor delimits enterprise functions in terms of resource productivity and its implementation in obtaining goods and services. Constant improvement of environmental protection supposes not only a challenge the companies must confront, but a need that obliges a search to continue new organizational systems, new processes and new applied technologies in order to obtain the maximum quality and effectiveness level in the enterprise strategy, diminishing impact on the ecosystem. Methodology was based on a bibliographic report; using comparative analyses of readings, the ideas inserted in this document were obtained, noting that it is of a general and non-particular character, due to which, the study tried to contrast technology and environment. Conclusions were that a development process is characterized by change in social structures and upward mobility for individuals and this is achieved through improvements, such as acquiring better qualification for intellectual capital, institutions and production processes in a country. The nature of a society is determined by the predominating type of technological activity; in this sense, societies of the future will be based on economic activities with greater technological content.",,,,monely2003@hotmail.com; arevalof@telcel.net; roberdasu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,8,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Explanations for that reversal have proven elusive. In this paper, we present evidence that exposure to legalized abortion in utero for the cohort of women that became teenagers in the 1990s is one factor contributing to this decline. We estimate that the legalization of abortion in the 1970s changed the composition of women at risk of hearing children out of wedlock some 15-24 years later. This composition effect reduced out-of-wedlock teen birth rates by 6%, which accounts for roughly 25% of the observed decline in unmarried teen birth rates over this period. It also lowered rates of unmarried births for women aged 20-24. At the same time, it increased the number of married births to women 20-24, so that there is only a small reduction in total fertility over the ages 15-24. The detailed information available on birth certificates enables a more direct identification of in utero abortion exposure than prior studies looking at other outcomes such as crime.

It explores how temporary staffing markets are manufactured through the interactions between industrial relations and regulatory systems, on the one hand, and the structures and strategies of domestic and transnational temporary staffing agencies on the other. The article draws on secondary datasets and semi-structured interviews with government departments, labour unions, staffing agencies and their trade bodies to analyse the size, structure and characteristics of the Australian temporary staffing market. It argues that the Australian market differs in important ways from those other neoliberal labour market regimessuch as those in Canada, UK and USAwith which it is often compared. The article argues for an approach that seeks to explore the (often gradual) mutual transformation of temporary staffing organizations and the institutional and regulatory systems in which they are embedded, rather than privileging one at the expense of the other.","[Coe, Neil M.; Ward, Kevin] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Johns, Jennifer] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England",University of Manchester; University of Liverpool,"Coe, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",neil.coe@manchester.ac.uk,"Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061; Johns, Jennifer/0000-0003-4216-4858; ward, kevin/0000-0002-3810-0889",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-0616] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,95,46,49,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The development of the consumer behavior research has brought into the light two different types of influences. Firstly, there are the psychological or endogenous influences that come from within the consumer and which affect his behavior (motivation, perception, attitude, personality), and secondly the researches have determined the outside or exogenous influences which determine certain consumer behavior (family, social class, reference groups, culture).

Today, barriers to international trade and investment are significantly eroded and internationalization eased by improvements in technology, infrastructure and deregulation, and it is pertinent to ask: 'Does entry mode matter?' The question is addressed through a discussion of literature explicitly focused on entry modes, and that examining internationalization and international entrepreneurship more widely. Concluding that insufficient attention is paid to mode variety and motivations in both bodies of research, a series of models positioning modes within the internationalization process are advanced. The models demonstrate the confluence of influences from dynamic processes, and decision criteria on entry mode selection, motivations and internationalization path. While the role of the entry mode in current internationalization processes has evolved with changes in the world economy, it remains an important topic for research. Specifically, the authors call for research on the influence of technological change on entry modes; and deeper investigation of specific modes such as exporting, and of the role of social capital in the formation of formal modes of international business activity.","[Jones, Marian V.; Young, Stephen] Univ Glasgow, Dept Management, CIER, Glasgow, Lanark G12 8QQ, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Jones, MV (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Management, CIER, Glasgow, Lanark G12 8QQ, Scotland.",,"Jones, Marian/A-3172-2013","Jones, Marian/0000-0002-6330-2730",,,,,0,9,11,0,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,6,19,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900003,0

We test for the existence of complementarities in the use of external networking between stages of the innovation process in a sample of UK and German manufacturing plants. Our evidence suggests some differences between the UK and Germany in terms of the optimal combination of innovation activities in which to implement external networking. Broadly, there is more evidence of complementarities in the case of Germany, with the exception of the product engineering stage. By contrast, the UK exhibits generally strong evidence of substitutability in external networking in different stages, except between the identification of new products and product design and development stages. These findings suggest that previous studies indicating strong complementarity between internal and external knowledge sources have provided only part of the picture of the strategic dilemmas facing firms.","[Love, James H.] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Ctr Small & Medium Sized Enterprises, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Aston University; University of Warwick,"Love, JH (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",j.h.love@aston.ac.uk,"roper, stephen/P-1088-2016",,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-0813] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,52,53,55,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Taking Mexico City as a case study it is shown that the growing presence of a) foreign companies and b) advanced producer sector firms increases demand for office space, in particular in the high end spectrum of the market. This demand is met by the production of a new CBD in western parts of the city. Mexico City's corporate geography is, thus, characterized by two CBD, with the new one housing the majority of firms that entered the Mexican market in the last 15 years.

Firstly, the QM means the capacity of the organizations to satisfy their clients. So, one of the main factors which determine the survival of the organizations in their specific market, that is where they develop their activity, is the profound knowledge of their clients requirements as well as the full satisfaction of all their demands at an acceptable costs level. This goal can be achieved by a total implication of the company's management, of all its departments and all of its staff; they all must approach this objective as a common cause. QM can also be defined as all the activities developed in order to fulfill the objectives referring to the organization quality. So, in order to maintain or, even more, to extend the competition ad h antages, the companies have started to take into account the quality, that is not only the achievement of an objective by one of the organization departments, but also as a common cause for all the organization members; the final goal for all the attempts is to obtain long term profits. Apart from the quality management systems, already uses by a lot of small and middle enterprise, it is possible to obtain a better long term improvement by applying the total quality management (TQM). The British Quality Association defines the TQM concepts as the focus of the companies management towards the fulfillment of the clients demands at a high level of efficiency and usefulness. Another strong point for TQM, also suggested by its name, can be the orientation towards the continuous improvement not only for the production processes of an organization, but also for the other fields of activity in the company.","[Ploesteanu, Mara Gabriela] Acad Econ Studies, Fac Mkt, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,timcomara@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,253,257,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000041,0

The findings show there is a significant difference between Chinese and Western cultures. The top five factors transformed into self-reflection statements include: 1) You could accept your manager criticizing your mistake in public; 2) You avoid any conflict with your manager; 3) Objective of the project is the target for the whole project group; 4) You do not mind the methods for your performance evaluation; and 5) You pay greater attention to improve relationship among colleagues.

The company that is unable to define exactly its uniqueness and competitive advantages compared with its competitors will be forced to yield its market portion As a result, the company must observe the image created about the company in the market and decide if created image satisfies the company and influences constant beneficial results. The positive image helps the company to acquire strong competitive advantage over the others. In order to attract more customers and increase its influence, and the market share, the company must point out its major target groups of activities that help to assure successful company's development and implementation of long term company's goals. The importance of the image can be declared by the fact that the company with strong positive image maintain higher sales figures compared with the company with negative image in the market.

Using event history analysis, this article examines the determinants of the enactment of a TRAP law by states over the period 1974-2008. The empirical results find that Republican institutional control of a state's legislative/executive branches is positively associated with a state enacting a TRAP law, while Democratic institutional control is negatively associated with a state enacting a TRAP law. The percentage of a state's population that is Catholic, public anti-abortion attitudes, state political ideology, and the abortion rate in a state are statistically insignificant predictors of a state enacting a TRAP law. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that abortion is a redistributive issue and not a morality issue.","[Medoff, Marshall H.; Dennis, Christopher] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Medoff, MH (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",,,,,,,,48,28,37,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Although the literature has established macroeconomic determinants of shipping freight rates, there has been no systematic investigation of microeconomic determinants of freight rates and the delivery time of chartered ships (the laycan period) in the tanker market. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the importance of vessel and contract specific factors in the determination of tanker freight rates and laycan periods in shipping contracts. Individual tanker shipping contracts from January 2006 to March 2009 are used to estimate freight rates and laycan periods using a system of simultaneous equations. The estimation results suggest that the duration of the laycan period is an important determinant of the shipping freight rate and vice versa. Other determinants of freight rates include the vessel's hull type, fixture deadweight utilization ratio, vessel age, and voyage routes. Determinants of the laycan period include the former determinants as well as the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index and its volatility. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare resulting service levels, social welfare and consumer surplus for a number of different policies and find that: (i) dedicated bus lanes is a better stand-alone policy than transit subsidization or congestion pricing. The latter is marginally better than subsidization but has a negative impact in consumer surplus. (ii) Efficient transit subsidies are quite large since in many cases first-best transit price is negative; establishing dedicated bus lanes or implementing congestion pricing render subsidies unnecessary for high demand levels. (iii) Both subsidization and dedicated bus lanes would count with public support while congestion pricing would probably encounter opposition. (iv) Transit subsidies and/or congestion pricing do not induce large changes on optimal bus size, frequency, circulation speeds and spacing between stops in mixed-traffic conditions: dedicated bus lanes do. (v) In all cases analyzed, revenues from congestion pricing are enough to cover transit subsidies; the optimal percentage of capacity that should be devoted for bus traffic is around one third.

The model is closely inspired by the UK regulatory mechanism for the railway network. Its philosophy is one of vertical separation between ownership and operation of the rolling stock: the Train Operating Company (TOC) leases from a ROlling Stock COmpany (ROSCO) the trains it uses in its franchise. This, we show, increases the flexibility and competitiveness of the network. On the other hand, it also reduces the specificity of the rolling stock, thus increasing the cost of running the service, and the TOC's incentive to exert quality enhancing effort, thus reducing the utility of the final users. Our simple model shows that the UK regime of separation may in fact be preferable from a welfare viewpoint.","[De Fraja, Gianni; Zanchettin, Piercarlo] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Michetti, Emanuela] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, I-50133 Florence, Italy",University of Leicester; European University Institute,"De Fraja, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",defraja@le.ac.uk; emanuela.michetti@eui.eu; pz11@le.ac.uk,"De Fraja, Gianni/F-6719-2015","De Fraja, Gianni/0000-0001-6164-1002",,,,,20,1,1,0,9,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

In this paper the development of children's mobility in Denmark, Finland, Great Britain and Norway is compared to examine differences and similarities in these countries. Accessible data are used, which implies that not all of them are directly comparable, but they are employed as indicators of development. The trends are the same in these four countries, an increase in car use and decrease in bicycling and walking. Distance to school has increased, both as a result of bigger units and more children in private schools. Traffic is an important reason for taking children to school by car, but convenience for the parents is also part of it. Organized leisure activities has also contributed to less walking and cycling, in addition to more time pressure in families, increased access to car(s) and easier access to parents as a 'transport service' by the help of the mobile phone. The measures that different countries use in trying to meet the challenges of children's mobility tend to focus on the school trip and most often on traffic safety, both at national and local levels.

Based on the literature analysis, we proposed a hypothetical model which relies on behavioural approach in understanding market orientation. To empirically test the hypothetical model, we used data previously collected for 2001, and by replicating the same questionnaire now collected data for 2011. Data was analyzed by hierarchical regression analysis on the two sets of data. Our findings reveal that Croatian organizations reached the level of moderate market orientation leaving space for improvement. Findings also reveal that higher level of market orientation correlates with higher business performance. Furthermore, with development of ICT the model of market orientation modified in time in a way that in predicting successful market oriented reaction, specific information on consumer satisfaction gains importance, while general information from competitor and consumer databases lose importance. Despite the changes in the relationships among the elements of market orientation, the model itself similarly predicts performance today as it did ten years ago. Managers are advised to increase implementation of market orientation especially focusing on market responsiveness as such behaviour will lead to better performance.","[Grbac, Bruno; First, Ivana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Grbac, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",grbac@efri.hr; ifirst@efri.hr,"First Komen, Ivana/R-6063-2018","First Komen, Ivana/0000-0001-5312-6158",,,,,52,5,5,0,11,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Any compactness measure that satisfies three desirable properties (anonymity of voters, efficient clustering, and invariance to scale, population density, and number of districts) ranks districting plans identically to our index. We then calculate the relative proximity index for the 106th Congress, which requires us to solve for each state's maximal compactness-a problem that is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP hard). The correlations between our index and the commonly used measures of dispersion and perimeter are -.37 and -.29, respectively. We conclude by estimating seat-vote curves under maximally compact districts for several large states. The fraction of additional seats a party obtains when its average vote increases is significantly greater under maximally compact districting plans relative to the existing plans.","[Fryer, Roland G., Jr.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Holden, Richard] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Harvard University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Fryer, RG (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0748734] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,39,39,49,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The forecasting methods implemented in the competition are univariate and multivariate time series approaches, and econometric models. This forecasting competition differs from previous competitions in several ways: (i) we concentrate on tourism data only; (ii) we include approaches with explanatory variables; (iii) we evaluate the forecast interval coverage as well as the point forecast accuracy; (iv) we observe the effect of temporal aggregation on the forecasting accuracy; and (v) we consider the mean absolute scaled error as an alternative forecasting accuracy measure. We find that pure time series approaches provide more accurate forecasts for tourism data than models with explanatory variables. For seasonal data we implement three fully automated pure time series algorithms that generate accurate point forecasts, and two of these also produce forecast coverage probabilities which are satisfactorily close to the nominal rates. For annual data we find that Naive forecasts are hard to beat. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The model distinguishes cars by fuel, engine size and age. The modelled car stock is built up from a long history of data on sales, and calibrated to recent data on actual stock. We complement the data on the number of cars with data on fuel efficiency and distance driven - which together give fuel use and emissions - and the costs of purchase, ownership and use. We use the model to project the car stock from 2010 to 2025. The following results emerge. The 2009 reform of the vehicle registration and motor tax has led to a dramatic shift from petrol to diesel cars. Fuel efficiency has improved and will improve further as a result, but because diesel cars are heavier, carbon dioxide emissions are reduced but not substantially so. The projected emissions in 2020 are roughly the same as in 2007. In a second set of simulations, we impose the government targets for electrification of transport. As all-electric vehicles are likely to displace small, efficient, and little-driven petrol cars, the effect on carbon dioxide emissions is minimal.

In general, it can be noted that development trends of the construction industry is almost the same as the development trends of the whole country economy itself. Efficiency level of the construction and real estate industries depends on the specific quantities of the variables within micro, meso and macro context. Although factors of the macro level influence the efficiency level of the whole economy this investigation analyses its influence on the efficiency of the construction industry. Efficiency of the construction industry operation depends on the complex impact of the macro level variable factors such as economic, political and cultural level of development, construction industry are effected by the regulating documents, market, taxation system, drawing possibilities and conditions, inflation, local resources etc. (Kaklauskas et al. 2011). Construction industry development possibilities vary according to the effect of macro level factors. Crisis, spin up in 2008-2009, had differently affected the construction industry markets of the European Union countries. The general part of countries had faced the decrease of outputs, real estate transactions, and predictable reduction in employment of population and quantity of construction companies. Adverse conditions and huge deviations that had arisen due to the crisis encourage analysing the situation of the construction sector not only in the particular country but in other ones, it happens because of possibility to analyse the international experience and get the broader view of the construction sector issues and solve them correctly. Procedure, presented in the issue, provide the possibility to detect the one of 23 European countries which possesses the most effective construction sector market development according to the criteria set. Countries undergo the multi-criteria evaluation applying COPRAS methods (Zavadskas and Kaklauskas 1996), evaluation criteria relevance is determined via entropy method. The first time using the entropy concept (Shannon and Weaver 1947; Shannon 1948) for maximizing the quantity of information contained in the dataset.

The metrics range from those specific to the number of trips to more holistic measures that include the contribution of these trips directly and indirectly to economic activity. These metrics can aid decision-makers in rendering more informed judgments about resource allocation and how to design a portfolio of security and recovery strategies. The paper also provides a framework for evaluating transportation risk, including the important role of perceptions in potentially amplifying these risks. It provides a range of strategies to promote resilience as well. Resilience of a transportation system is then quantified using the real-world case of the 2005 London subway and bus bombings. In terms of ordinary resilience, we find that 77.4 percent of total journey reductions on attacked modes were offset by increases in substitute modes for the 4 months following the attacks. We also estimate that 76.9 percent of total journey reductions on attacked modes were the result of a fear factor, as opposed to capacity reductions. The paper concludes with a set of proposed prospective resilience measures to evaluate the potential resilience of a transportation system. These metrics are based on the vulnerability, flexibility, and resource availability to cope with a terrorist attack or natural disaster. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The amount of fuel surcharges and the effects of their application on fuel consumption and on GHG emissions are estimated by a model that is able to relate gasoline and diesel consumption with fuel prices. The effects of the proposed policy on fuel consumption and on GHG emissions are estimated for Italy.

This paper evaluates a specific antitrust concern by modeling the price effect of one seller's learning its rival's production costs before bidding in a duopoly procurement contest.

A Coasean market is an association of persons with competing claims on a legal entitlement that can be traded. The boundaries of both Coasean markets and Coasean firms are determined by measuring not only the costs of bargaining but also the absolute costs of moving resources from one place to another. The boundaries of a Coasean market, just as those of the Coasean business firm, are defined by the line where the marginal cost of reaching a value-maximizing bargain by trading inside just equals the marginal cost of going outside. This focus on very small markets is a defining characteristic of modern Transaction Cost Economics. In analyzing such markets Coase ignored the eclectic, historical and behaviorist approach of the old institutionalists and applied the greater formalism and of marginal analysis. In the process, however, Coase assumed away important issues that the first generation of institutionalists were trying to address and created some new ones, such as how equilibrium is attained in Coasean as opposed to neoclassical markets. The most important difference between the two is that a Coasean market requires the unanimous consent of all participants before a trade can be made-a condition imposed by Coase's own requirement of reciprocity, developed in The Problem of Social Cost (J Law Econ 3:1, 1960). The equilibrium problem is substantial but its significance has not been sufficiently developed. As a result, Coasean analysis of the business firm has made much more progress than has Cosean analysis of markets for legal entitlements. Further, the superiority of private governance over legislation, an important attribute of Coase's argument, loses much of its force as the number of participants in Coasean markets increases beyond two. Research on the management of commons resources has contributed greatly to our understanding of when private resource allocation decisions by larger groups of owners succeed and when they fail. While not all common resources markets are of the kind contemplated by Coase they share many relevant characteristics. Further, the economic literature on private governance arrangements for the commons has found it necessary to step beyond the strict marginalist methodologies of Coasean economics and look more broadly to the historical, biological and social motivations for human cooperation.","Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Hovenkamp, H (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",herbert-hovenkamp@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,116,6,8,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This refers to the attempts that are done by families and institutions for development of entrepreneurial capabilities among children, from early stage of their life to their graduation from universities and hiring in a job or establishment of their own business. However, most of teenagers and students are thinking about employment in large companies or governmental organizations. This is a sign of low effectiveness of entrepreneurial education and programs in universities and schools. One of the most important factors in creating entrepreneurial readiness in people is the environment that they are growing in. At the macro level, cultural and social factors can affect this environment. Thus, paying attention to social and cultural factors for development of entrepreneurial readiness in teenagers is important. So, high school officers, educational bodies and other stakeholders can benefit by listening to them for planning the educational programs better. Policy makers can also remove main barriers for entrepreneurship development among teenagers. In this paper we attempt to analyze the first findings of a survey-driven study about high school students at different educational majors in Iran. First, a theoretical and literature review of other studies will be presented. Second, a conceptual framework for the research will be outlined. Third the results of semi structured interviews with Iranian experts (entrepreneurship teachers and instructors, university faculties, entrepreneurs and governmental officers) will be analyzed and finally the main social and cultural factors that are most effective to teenager's entrepreneurial readiness and also how these factors are efficient will be addressed. Our findings, albeit derived from an early stage of our ongoing field research and more exploratory than normative at this point, indicate that at least in the Iranian environment, these social and cultural factors could provide a supportive environment for entrepreneurial readiness among teenagers and act as impediments to entrepreneurship growth.","[Abasian, Arezou; Alimiri, Mostafa] Univ Tehran, Entrepreneurship Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Salari, Amin] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; Islamic Azad University,"Abasian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Entrepreneurship Dept, Tehran, Iran.",A_Abasian@ent.ut.ac.ir; Malimiri@ent.ut.ac.ir; Salari@Sahfa.ir,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,8,12,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800002,0

In tandem, the critical and inexhaustible significance of the territorial context on knowledge exploration and exploitation, including interplaying institutional and organizational arrangements, are essential parts of theoretical and empirical interpretation. The present paper contributes to the academic literature through the exploration of science policies in two illustrative regional examples, Netherlands (Twente) and Sweden (Skane). Based on empirical and qualitative exploration, the paper explores major features of science policy and addresses questions regarding the multiple transformative socio-economic roles of knowledge institutions with a special emphasis on new emerging governance forms. What is argued in the paper concerns the role of universities and public research institutes to local development which might be multiple and include more than processes of licensing or patenting knowledge results.

Around 23 per cent of the 640 firms surveyed had product and/or process innovation, 24 per cent had other types of innovation. A total of 46 per cent had some type of innovation. Firms delivering directly to end-users were more likely to be innovative than those delivering to the processing or wholesale links of the value chain. Many of the innovative firms had no collaboration on innovation, and respondents generally claim that stimuli for innovation were primarily internal. We also demonstrate that the industry has a very well developed extended knowledge base, which is a vital source of information and knowledge for innovation.

The most common modelling technique used by practitioners for measuring and managing the bond price sensitivity is the Macaulay's duration normally expressed in the modified duration form, also known as weighted average maturity of the bond, or the bond price sensitivity to the interest rate changes. Taking into account the fact that the standard concept of the duration has its limitations as the accuracy for small yield changes, a nonparallel shift in the yield curve or option-free bond assumption, we derive and describe the effective duration and convexity models for determining the expected theoretical price of the bonds with embedded options enabling the bond redemption prior to the maturity. To demonstrate computation and effect of the embedded option in a bond contract we use fundamental characteristic of an option-free bond and two most common types of embedded options - call option and put options giving the issuer the right to call or prepay the debt obligation prior to the scheduled principal payment date (call option) or giving the investor the right to require the issuer to purchase the bond at a specified price (put option). To determine the theoretical price of the embedded option rights we use these two methods coupled with the modified Black model to cope with limitation of the traditional Macaulay's duration approach. The results show a significant impact of the embedded options on the effective duration and convexity of fixed income securities.","[Glova, Jozef; Sabol, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Glova, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva & Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia.",jozef.glova@tuke.sk; tomas.sabol@tuke.sk,"Sabol, Tomas/B-1566-2008; Glova, Jozef/Z-2482-2019","Glova, Jozef/0000-0001-5972-7771; Sabol, Tomas/0000-0001-7890-9837",,,,,7,10,10,0,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Malaysia is no exception as its trade weighted average tariff rate in 2008 is relatively low at 6.3 percent. Despite the reduction in tariff barrier, the incidence of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in the country's manufacturing sector is still prevalent especially in certain sub-sectors even though efforts at dismantling these barriers have long been initiated. Thus, the paper seeks to identify factors that influence the level of NTBs in the manufacturing sector.

Social Entrepreneurship and Social Enterprises are issues that present high academic interest, and are still in developing stage. This study seeks to outline the context of this important research field, and to explore the conceptualisation and the attitude of Northern Greek for-profit companies towards Social Entrepreneurship and Social enterprise practices. A literature review is presented covering themes relevant to Social Entrepreneurship and Social Enterprises, and provides the background to design the research, which combines quantitative and qualitative methodology in order to achieve the study's objectives. In the context of the quantitative approach, a web-based survey with the participation of 72 Northern Greek for-profit companies was carried out, and following descriptive data analysis, indicators of Social Entrepreneurship practices and concepts were examined. In the context of the qualitative approach, 10 interviews with key managers of Northern Greek for-profit companies were conducted in order to investigate attitudes towards the themes in question. The results suggest that Northern Greek for-profit companies seem to be socially oriented, and managers tend to welcome Social Entrepreneurship practices. There are misperceptions of the terms, and Social Enterprises seem to be perceived as non-profit organisations. Despite the fact that there were valuable and interesting findings, the conduct of the web-based survey limited the sample size, presenting a low response rate, and an in-depth statistical analysis of relationships and correlations was not executed.

It begins by conceptualizing large-scale patterns of media use in network terms, treating media outlets as nodes and the levels of audience duplication among them as links. Following that, it explains 2 common measures of audience duplication, Absolute Duplication and Primary Duplication, and offers a new measure, Deviation-from-Random Duplication. In doing so, techniques for converting duplication data into network data are discussed. This approach is then applied to analyze patterns of audience fragmentation, media publics, and audience polarization using data from Nielsen's TV/Internet Convergence Panel. The findings show the value of using a network approach, by contributing to an alternative understanding of these patterns. Economic and policy implications are discussed, as well as broader reflections on the use of network analysis in the study of audience behavior.","Villanova Univ, Dept Commun, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Ksiazek, TB (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Dept Commun, Garey Hall B2A,800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",thomas.ksiazek@villanova.edu,,,,,,,41,53,58,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

Utilising two of Williamson's four levels of institutions, it is shown that reallocating and securing property rights (rules of the game), is essential to allow rural communities to benefit from tourism activities on their land. Contingent to those rights and local communities' capacity and social capital, a typology of institutional arrangements (play of the game), is proposed that govern relationships between actors (local communities, the private sector and the State), in the tourism sector. Overall, this framework facilitates understanding of why and how actors craft specific governance structures in order to operate tourism activities, redistribute revenues and minimise transaction costs.","Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Po Wits, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Lapeyre, R (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Po Wits, South Africa.",renaudlapeyre@hotmail.com,,,,,,,48,21,25,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Methodology: The data are collected from the websites of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, according to the purpose and character of the research. The companies were chosen randomly from a database provided by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Cluj-Napoca. The websites in the sample were examined to explore the nature, extent and presentation style of information on Corporate Social Responsibility activities. Findings: The results of the research showed that the number of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises with Corporate Social Responsibility information on their websites is quite small. Small and Medium Sized Enterprises do not use the potential of their webs ties to their advantage, in terms of quantity and style. However, the research provides an overview of the various Corporate Social Responsibility activities and communication styles of these activities. The research used a sample from a database of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises provided by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Cluj-Napoca so that the results can be generalized, and these results are consistent with similar studies. Practical implications: The research enriches the existing literature, provides future research prospects, a good knowledge of basic principles for managers' better use of web resources and improves company's relations with their stakeholders. Online Corporate Social Responsibility activities that might be interesting for organizations and tips for improving websites for a better style and image of good corporate citizens are also discussed. Originality/Value: The research explores, in the Romanian context, the current situation of online Corporate Social Responsibility communication and shows that even the Small and Medium Sized Enterprises are increasingly concerned with communicating ethically and responsibly to the diversity of stakeholders through the web.","[Mirea, Mihaela-Ancuta] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,mihaela.mirea84@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,9,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,81,84,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000021,0

The search for information through the mass media or conversations with other people can increase the perception of being affected by the problem (Morton & Duck, 2001). An on-line survey was developed with a sample of 237 participants in order to discover the factors that explained their perception of personal risk when faced with the AH1N1 flu. Results showed that exposure to TV and interpersonal communication was strongly correlated with a perception of personal risk, especially among people with a strong media systems dependency (MSD). However, use of the Internet led to a reduction of risk perception, above all among subjects with low media dependence.","[Muniz, Carlos] Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Muniz, Carlos] Fac Ciencias Polit & Adm Publ, Residencial Las Torres M, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Muniz, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico",University of Salamanca; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon,"Muñiz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",carmuniz@hotmail.com,"Muñiz, Carlos/D-2415-2016","Muñiz, Carlos/0000-0002-9021-8198",,,,,24,11,11,1,14,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Business 'growth' is considered to be one of the most popular and widely known measures of any company's success ( Storey 1994). While advances have been made in the measurement of innovation at regional, national and European levels there is still ambiguity around the measurement of innovation at the firm level, recognition of firm level strategy and little attempt to relate grand theories in innovation strategy and growth to the SME context. This paper provides the starting point for a larger study which will reassess the relationship between innovation strategy and business growth in small business. Design/Methodology - The research approach is inductive. The author uses a literature review to explore relevant theory and to develop a provisional framework relating innovation strategy and business growth. The intention is to subsequently use the framework to empirically explore innovation and business growth in the high tech sector with a view to providing researchers with a mechanism of identifying high growth SMEs. The Originality and Value - The paper is original and has value in that it provides a fresh look at the literature in this area, providing a basis on which further empirical investigation can be undertaken with the SME sector. Paper type - The study forms the first stage of a PhD project. The author invites review of the provisional framework proposed.","[Nagaraju, Roopa; Philpott, Elly] Univ Bedfordshire, Business & Management Res Inst, Luton, Beds, England",University of Bedfordshire,,roopa.nagaraju@beds.ac.uk; elly.philpott@beds.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,18,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,984,996,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800117,0

After taking a closer look at the nature of environment-competitiveness win-win solutions and their practical intricacies, the opportunities and limitations of different types of competitive strategies as well as their relationship to the firm's technology and sustainability objectives will be examined. Then, within the existing economic context of Romanian industrial firms, I will explore whether and to what extent Romanian industrial firms' pursuit of competitive advantage can be matched with its sustainability objectives. The approach is both theoretical and empirical. First, the analytical framework of competitive sustainability strategy will be sketched. Then, using statistical data to reveal both economic and environmental performance of Romanian industrial firms, the main drivers and constraints on achieving environment-competitiveness synergy will be identified. The results indicate that predominance of competitive advantages based on low labour costs, high potential of increasing labour productivity, deficiencies of both environmental and industrial policies, and lack of awareness in business and policy environment as to the beneficial role of resource productivity increase constitute significant barriers to adopting competitive sustainability strategies. Fortunately, the low levels of eco-efficiency and eco-innovation in industry provide a large scope of unexploited win-win solutions. The full exploitation of the specialized EU funding programmes can serve this purpose. Finally, the most recommendable public policy responses for both overcoming these obstacles and exploiting the existing opportunities will be proposed. The article's output may serve as a frame of reference for Romanian policy-makers in designing proper measures for promoting business sustainability. Also, it can provide a theoretical support for business managers in understanding the meaning, scope and potential benefits of environmental-commercial synergies.","[Nita, I.

In reaction, the Mauritian sugar industry has undertaken a massive diversification within sugar: production of other sugar cane products and by-products, as well as diversification in vegetable production at an industrial level. The entry of large sugar cane producers from the corporate sector on the vegetable market has had a number of repercussions on the vegetable supply chain, one of which being the emergence of institutional entrepreneurs. A qualitative study of the vegetable supply chain was conducted among the different actors concerned. It revealed the following findings: new entrants in the vegetable supply chain have caused an institutional change. Institutional entrepreneurs have emerged and in turn established new institutional rules and standards of practice that have changed the institutional structure of the vegetable supply chain. This paper identifies at a first stage, two main factors favouring the emergence of institutional entrepreneurs in an organisational field. Firstly, a moderate degree of institutionalisation provides the adequate environment for actors to deliberately initiate changes through entrepreneurial processes. Secondly the multiplicity of institutional referents across organisational fields, in this case, the sugar cane and the fresh vegetable supply chains, provides the right environment for creative entrepreneurial action. At a second stage, this paper identifies the innovative managerial and marketing practices brought about in vegetable production and distribution by the institutional entrepreneurs, and the impact of these new practices on incumbent actors. This study uses a sociological neoinstitutional perspective and provides empirical evidence of the factors affecting actors' agency and more specifically the conditions in an organisational field that favour strategic behaviour among actors. This research also helps to shed some light on how changes in the institutional structure of a field can drive the innovation process. This paper can help in further research on innovation and institutional entrepreneurship.","[Ramasawmy, Brinda; Fort, Fatiha] Montpellier SUPAGRO, UMR MOISA, Montpellier, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,,ramasawmy.brinda@gmail.com; fort@supagro.inra.fr,"Ramasawmy, Brinda/AAP-6151-2021",,,,,,38,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1020,1028,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800121,0

Towards this, we also develop an integrative framework linking formal and informal institutions to entrepreneurial conditions. This research is among the first to use a three-way interaction in a cross-national study including both formal and informal institutions and both developed and developing nations. The study argues that it is important to understand the relationship between economic development and national entrepreneurial activity in terms of the mechanisms of interaction between a nation's formal and informal institutions. In addition, this framework will be valuable to theorists wishing to extend the opportunity theory of Shane and Venkataraman (2000) to cross national studies. To test the hypotheses, we analyse eight years of GEM expert study and World Bank data. An ANOVA analysis justifies the pooling of panel data. We use hierarchical regression analysis to determine the three- way interaction effects. Since World Bank new enterprise data is used, the study is limited to the formal economy i.e. legally registered companies, easily traceable to economic growth. The alignment of formal to informal institutions matters. When they are not in alignment, compensating mechanisms sets off a Kirznerian tendency towards equilibrium. A complementary mechanism does not have the same effect instead resulting in reduced entrepreneurial activity. High entrepreneurial activity through enterprise formation is not always necessary. Despite the debates around the importance of small enterprises (Birch, 1979) in increasing entrepreneurial activity, such contexts with complementary institutional mechanisms still attain high levels of economic development. There appears to be an ideal mix of new enterprise activity and existing corporate entrepreneurship accompanying economic development. Evident then is the neglect of corporate entrepreneurial activity or intrapreneurship in economic development discussions.","[Reddy, Colin] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Business Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,,creddy@uj.ac.za,"Hamann, Ralph/J-9341-2019; Reddy, Colin/N-7520-2014; urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Hamann, Ralph/0000-0002-4694-1987; Reddy, Colin/0000-0002-6657-1071;",,,,,79,0,0,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,742,752,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800089,0

This article, as a part of a bigger project, is focused on identifying and classifying entrepreneurial competencies and characteristics. Based on more than 60 (mostly) peer reviewed articles, 65 entrepreneurial competencies were identified. These competencies were then classified according to the one level model of Entrepreneurial Competencies. An analysis was conducted to examine correlations between this model and the five factor model of personality, considered to be one of the most widely used psychological models for classification of personalities.

In Experiment 2, the face-to-face interactions between the decision-maker and the advisor were videotaped and coded. Advisors provided more information to decision-makers for the taste forecast than for the intellective task.

The water cycle is complex, however the authors believe that the technology and knowledge currently available allow us to immediately tackle the amount of water used by industry to develop and manufacture products. The paper introduces the concept of water footprint and its main components. The total water footprint of a product breaks down into three components: the blue, green and gray water footprint. The blue water footprint is the volume of freshwater that evaporated from the global blue water resources (surface water and ground water) to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community. The green water footprint is the volume of water evaporated from the global green water resources (rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture). The gray water footprint is the volume of polluted water that associates with the production of all goods and services for the individual or community. The findings contribute to the development of water management strategies for industries. Ultimately, these strategies will allow industries to develop innovative solutions and to design products with low water footprint. This will also allow companies to reduce the risks associated with the use of water.","[Velay, Xavier] Bournemouth Univ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Popescu, Daniela; Topa, Vasile; Dobocan, Corina Adriana] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Bournemouth University; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,xvelay@bournemouth.ac.uk; Daniela.Popescu@muri.utcluj.ro; Vasile.Topa@et.utcluj.ro; corina.dobocan@muri.utcluj.ro,"Topa, Vasile/G-7179-2017; Adriana, Dobocan Corina/IXM-9992-2023; Topa, Vasile/AAL-1051-2020; Daniela, Popescu/G-4496-2016","Adriana, Dobocan Corina/0000-0002-8248-1420; Topa, Vasile/0000-0003-4400-8162;",Bournemouth University; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,Bournemouth University; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,The authors would like to thank both Bournemouth University and Technical University of Cluj Napoca for their support in this new area of research.,,9,0,0,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,515,518,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600111,0

Currently, a new approach entitled Entrepreneurial Behavior-Cognitive is researched by scholars who consider cognitive differences. Cognitive perspective refers to the activities such as thinking, knowing and processing information. Thereupon, Cognitive style refers to the possibility that different people may carry out these processes differently, but in a relatively consistent manner. Cognitive styles are two approaches that reflect the analytical and intuitive sides of an individual. Intuitive individuals are likely to discover opportunities by observing cues or signals through unfamiliar and unorganized information that is processed in a synthetic and holistic manner. Analytical individuals rely on linear, sequential processing of information that enables them to evaluate and plan for the new venture. Cognitive Style Index (CSI) is an applicable tool to know individuals with high potentials for success in entrepreneurship by understanding the orientation of their cognitive style. The aim of this paper is to study the cognitive style of entrepreneurs and its dimensions (n=90) and compare it with the non-entrepreneurs (n=89). In this research the CSI questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha=0.852) is used to assess the intuitive thinking style versus the analytical style. Based on the final result of this study, compared with the non entrepreneurs (CSI M = 39.6), entrepreneurs (CSI M = 30.5) are more advanced in their intuitive cognitive style. Statically, there was a significant difference. This could be a well defined explanation to why entrepreneurs just seem to be at the right place at the right time with the correct decisions, and provides a greater understanding of why entrepreneurs take a particular course of action such as finding and evaluating new opportunities and new venture creation processes.","[Zali, Mohammad Reza; Toroghi, Saeed Rezaei; Mirzaei, Maryam] Univ Tehran, Tehran 14174, Iran",University of Tehran,"Zali, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Tehran 14174, Iran.",mrzali@ut.ac.ir,"zali, mohammadreza/AAD-4452-2022",,,,,,55,0,0,0,17,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,882,890,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800106,0

Respondents prefer this information in a separate section of the annual report and on company websites. Individual shareholders want such disclosure to be prescribed by law and/or stock exchange rules. The most popular reason why they want environmental information disclosed is to hold companies accountable for their environmental stewardship.

If the methods used to measure the production of quality scientific knowledge are tilted towards one of the contested approaches, the resulting quality rankings of journals and departments are tilted as well. So if the objective is the open-minded pursuit of the production of scientific knowledge, then it is important to have measures of quality that treat the different contested approaches equally. Our article explores this issue by examining the impact that a quality-equality bibliometric measure can have on the quality rankings of doctoral economic programs in the United States.","[Lee, Frederic S.] UM Kansas City, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Grijalva, Therese C.; Nowell, Clifford] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Lee, FS (通讯作者)，UM Kansas City, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",leefs@umkc.edu; tgrijalva@weber.edu; cnowell@weber.edu,,"Grijalva, Therese/0000-0003-0618-3496",,,,,36,13,13,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This paper examines whether that pattern varies depending on whether the marriage is a first or higher-order one using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the years 1979 through 2001. The combination of a greater expected probability that a remarriage will end and the failure of household production to bring returns upon the end of a previous marriage may make women less likely to reduce their labor supply in second or higher marriages as compared to a first marriage. The results differ for the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply. With one exception, after controlling for background characteristics, the estimates imply that the probability of working is related to marriage in a similar manner regardless of whether the marriage is a first or a remarriage. In contrast, the estimates provide support for the possibility that decreases in hours of work upon marriage are smaller in second and higher marriages as compared to first marriages.","US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Aughinbaugh, A (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, 2 Massachusetts Ave NE,Room 4945, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",aughinbaugh.alison@bls.gov,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

While the most general version of the model is not amenable to analysis, familiar functional-form assumptions produce a tractable framework that generates a host of useful comparative-static results, along with a clear-cut efficiency evaluation.

We test this empirically using claims data from eight large firms. Propensity score methods are used to create matched samples for the two insurance regimes. We find that when coinsurance and copayments have the same expected out-of-pocket of $9, at least 34% of patients under copayments would fully refill their medication over 90 days, compared to only 24% under coinsurance.","[Dor, Avi] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Dor, Avi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Encinosa, William] Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Ctr Delivery Org & Markets, Rockville, MD 20850 USA",George Washington University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality,"Dor, A (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, 2021 K St NW,Suite 800, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",avidor@gwu.edu; wencinos@ahrq.gov,,,,,,,44,9,15,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

A general structural time-series modelling strategy is applied to estimate models for alternative types of Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures. From this, out-of-sample forecasts are generated from the various models. The underlying forecasts are subsequently adjusted to facilitate comparison. The Ashley, Granger and Schmalensee (1980) test is then performed to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the root mean square errors of the models. The results lend weight to the recent findings of Song (2005) that forecasting models using underlying rates are not systematically inferior to those based on the headline rate. In fact, strong evidence is found that underlying measures produce superior forecasts.

First, forms of human capital in the United States are becoming more oriented to labor tasks that call for cognitive-cultural skills. Second, cognitive-cultural skills are accumulating most intensively in large metropolitan areas. Third, physical or practical forms of human capital are increasingly being relegated to smaller metropolitan areas. That said, important residues of human capital, focused on physical or practical tasks, remain a durable element of the economies of large metropolitan areas.

The potential benefits from intensified auction competition could be enormous in the public procurement context. Entrant bidders are considered a key to enhance competition and break potential collusive arrangements among incumbent bidders. Asymmetric auction theory predicts that weak (fringe) bidders would bid more aggressively when they are faced with a strong (incumbent) opponent. Using data from official development projects, this paper shows that entrants actually submitted aggressive bids in the presence of incumbent(s) in the road sector and to a certain extent in the water sector. For electricity projects, the general competition effect is found to be particularly significant, but the entrant effect remains unclear. The results suggest that auctioneers should foster competition in public procurement, including fringe bidders, to contain public infrastructure investment costs.","[Iimi, Atsushi] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Estache, Antonio] Univ Libre Bruxelles, European Ctr Adv Res Econ & Stat, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Iimi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",aestache@ulb.ac.be; aiimi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,31,16,16,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

J,"Markovits, RS",,,,"Markovits, Richard S.",,,THE LIMITS TO SIMPLIFYING THE APPLICATION OF US ANTITRUST LAW,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRIVATE; POLICY; ENFORCEMENT; OLIGOPOLY; COLLUSION,"In 1984, then-Professor (now-Judge) Frank Easterbrook published an article recommending that U. S. courts use five filters to dismiss antitrust cases without considering the merits of the plaintiff's or State's claim in any detail. According to Easterbrook, the courts' use of these filters would serve the public interest more by preventing them from mistakenly finding lawful conduct illegal than it would disserve the public interest by enabling some perpetrators of illegal conduct to escape liability or conviction. Although Easterbrook did not emphasize this fact, if his filters were as inexpensive to apply as he assumed, their use would also serve the public interest by reducing the transaction costs generated by antitrust litigation. Easterbrook's proposals belong to a wider set of proposals made and/or adopted by economists, antitrust law professors, antitrust judges, and antitrust enforcement officials that are designed to serve the public interest (usually, more specifically, to increase economic efficiency) by simplifying the application of U. S. antitrust law. This article argues that no member of any of the eight sets of proposals of this kind that have been made and/or adopted can bear scrutiny. It argues first that all these proposals must be rejected because they are too inaccurate to be morally acceptable or legally valid-that is, because they ignore the fact that the U. S. antitrust laws promulgate cognizable specific-anticompetitive-intent or decreasing-competition tests of legality (do not authorize the courts to regulate the conduct the statutes cover in the public interest, much less in the way that would be most economically efficient) and the related fact that the moral-rights bearers for whom the United States is responsible have a moral and legal right to courts, and juries' doing their best in individual cases to discover the answer to the legal claim at issue that is correct as a matter of law. It argues second that, for a variety of reasons, the proposals in question would not serve the public interest or increase economic efficiency even if such moral-rights considerations could be ignored because they are too inaccurate and relatively too transaction-costly to be desirable, moral rights considerations aside.","Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Markovits, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Sch Law, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",rmarkovits@law.utexas.edu,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

But what is financial innovation? The dominant answers from mainstream finance and social studies of finance share variations on a rationalistic view whereby financial innovation is about improving markets or at least extending the sphere of rational calculability. Because improvisation is more important than the dominant perspectives can admit, this article proposes a new concept of financial innovation whose three main elements frame, conjuncture and bricolage are indicated by the title of this article. The importance of this problem shift is that it highlights the inherent fragility of this type of intermediary-led financial innovation where things will often miscarry and highlights the need for a more radical rethinking about policy responses to the financial crisis that began in 2007.","[Engelen, Ewald] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Froud, Julie] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Williams, Karel] Univ Manchester, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change CRESC, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Amsterdam; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Engelen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",julie.froud@mbs.ac.uk,"Erturk, Ismail/W-4693-2019","Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-577-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,81,79,90,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A key aspect of the proposed theory is that the probability of the availability of a discrete alternative may be manipulated by expending resources. Optimal choice behaviour is described by the interaction between the expenditure of resources on manipulability and the relative utility benefits gained from each of the alternatives. In this context, the theory proposes that the expected available capacity for an alternative has an explicit impact oil Consumer choice and should be used in demand estimation. Empirically, a two-limit seven (class) equation multivariate Tobit model of regional airline travel in Australia is estimated and confirms the importance of expected capacity constraints in explaining the demand for the different classes of air travel.

First, I examine the dynamics of economic growth across US metropolitan regions and investigate how they relate to regional specialization and the concentration of talent in the high-tech industry. In addition to evidence of significant high-tech clusters, I identify important complementarities with regard to the interaction between the three Ts of regional development (talent, technology and tolerance) and regional growth dynamics. Using firm-level data, the regional analysis is then complemented by exploring the location of new high-technology plant openings and their relationship with university research and development (R&D) and the creative class. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that both university R&D and the presence of creativity generate spillovers which are captured locally in the form of new high-tech establishments, after controlling for important location factors such as local cost, demand and agglomeration economies. While the marginal impacts of increased R&D funding on county probability for new firm formation is modest, the mix of creativity and diversity-as proxied by the Florida measure-appears to be a key driver in the locational choice of new high-tech firms. Separate estimates indicate that these findings hold up across the major high-tech industries in the USA.","Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Bieri, DS (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 123E Burruss Hall 0178, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",dsb@vt.edu,"Bieri, David/F-3669-2010","Bieri, David/0000-0002-4322-5950",,,,,65,14,16,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Experience and practice are based on previous, sensitive and rational knowledge about LA VEREDA, a park located on the waterfront of Maracaibo, the second-largest Venezuelan city and capital of the State of Zulia. The epistemological approach is based on social practices and a theoretical-critical position regarding action: relation of the body with space, culture and the space-time concept (Bourdieu, Hall and Lotman). The study tries to explain the social reality of the socio-aesthetic experience manifested in waterfronts (Bourdieu, Gadamer, Lyotard) through symbolic comprehension and subjectivity of the social and cultural world, all in hermeneutic language. Thus, the epistemological approach considers phenomenology as the philosophy of intuition, systematizes and generates a method that integrates and relates forms of building knowledge: analytical-synthetic, hermeneutic-symbolic, as well as the analysis of practice.

Slovenia has become a 'benchmark' for other post-communist economies in the region due to its successful transition process. Paper offers some insights into the characteristics of the corporate governance system in Slovenia in the post-communist period. It's focused on the relationship between governance and management. We made three consecutive research studies on the characteristics of corporate governance in Slovenia in the period 1998 to 2006 in order to determine the role of the various groups of stakeholders in Slovenian companies. The controlling owners are nowadays more active in setting the required rate of return on their equity investments as they were eight years ago.

Some have alleged that Marshall's change of heart is what led him to abandon the project of preparing the second volume of his Principles of Economics. In this paper I deny that it was Marshall's commitment to evolutionary biology that held back volume 2. Rather, it may have been his stubborn commitment to a particular variant of evolutionary biology (that is, Spencer's version of evolutionary biology) that blinded him to the way a more far reaching synthesis of Darwinian and equilibrium notions might have been accomplished. The application of the modern biological synthesis might have enriched some of Marshall's earlier equilibrium notions such as the representative firm. Il est bien connu que, dans ses vieux jours, Alfred Marshall devint moins amourache des methodes de raisonnement de l'equilibre en economique et preconisait a la place 1'etude de la biologie (evolutionniste). Certains ont allegue que c'est ce changement de noyau qui a conduit Marshall a abandonner son projet de preparation d'un second volume de ses Principes. Cet article denie que ce soit son engagement dans la biologie evolutionniste qui empecha le volume 2. Il se pourrait bien plutot que ce soit son engagement tetu dans une variante particuliere de la biologie evolutionniste (c'est-a-dire, la version de Spencer) qui lui ait bouche la voie d'une synthese de plus longue portee entre les notions de l'equilibre et de Darwin.

Our model sheds light on the equilibrium product-line pricing and quality schedules offered by firms, given that none, one, or both firms implement PPQ. The adoption of PPQ has three effects in our model: it enables firms to extract higher rents from loyal customers, intensifies price competition for nonloyal customers, and eliminates cannibalization from customer self-selection. Contrary to prior literature on one-to-one marketing and price discrimination, we show that even symmetric firms can avoid the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma problem when they engage in personalized pricing and quality customization. When both firms have PPQ, consumer surplus is nonmonotonic in valuations such that some low-valuation consumers get higher surplus than high-valuation consumers. The adoption of PPQ can reduce information asymmetry, and therefore sellers offer higher-quality products after the adoption of PPQ. Overall, we find that while the simultaneous adoption of PPQ generally improves total social welfare and firm profits, it decreases total consumer surplus.","[Ghose, Anindya] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Huang, Ke-Wei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Informat Syst, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Huang, Ke-Wei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117543, Singapore",New York University; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ghose, A (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",aghose@stern.nyu.edu; dishkw@nus.edu.sg,"Huang, Kewei/S-3939-2019","Huang, Ke-Wei/0000-0002-9932-6195",,,,,31,44,49,2,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

J,"Gorecki, PK",,,,"Gorecki, Paul K.",,,A Code of Practice for Grocery Goods Undertakings and an Ombudsman: How to Do a Lot of Harm by Trying to Do a Little Good,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in its August 2009 Consultation Paper, Code of Practice for Grocery Goods Undertakings, argues that a Code governing grocery supplier/retailer relations, enforced by an Ombudsman, should be introduced. The Code constrains the behaviour of the retailer with respect to certain practices that, for example, shift risk from the retailer to the supplier as well as those that result in unexpected costs to suppliers. The rationale for the Code appears to be that due to the devaluation of sterling, combined with the recession, retailers are able to put increased pressure on local suppliers for lower prices, which in turn squeezes suppliers' margins. The paper argues that the Consultation Paper does not present a sound rationale for the Code, in reality the Code is a form of protectionism occasioned by the inflow of lower priced imports. Local suppliers should adapt through developing better products and becoming more efficient, rather than seeking shelter from market forces. The impact of the Code will likely be to lead to: higher consumer prices lowering consumer welfare and thus inconsistent with the declared aim of the Code; increased costs of doing business with local suppliers thus leading to an incentive for retailers to use more imports; and, perhaps, a less competitive grocery sector. It is argued that the Consultation Paper should be withdrawn and reissued, but in a manner consistent with the government's better regulation agenda which is currently ignored. To the extent that the issue of concern is excessive buyer power of retailers then that should be addressed directly: by liberalising the Retail Planning Guidelines as the Competition Authority has been arguing for sometime; and/or sponsoring entry of new retailers; and/or amending competition law, if a problem exists and can be demonstrated to exist, but retain the competition test. The answer, based on the evidence presented in the Consultation Paper, is not the Code.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,3,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We show in a theoretical model that regardless of whether the procurement is characterized by private or by common values an increase in the potential number of bidders may lead to higher procurement costs. This raises potential policy questions of whether and how entry should be encouraged or limited in public procurement auctions. We use evidence from auctions of construction contracts to estimate the effect of an increase in the pool of potential bidders on entry and auction prices when entry and bidding decisions are made sequentially with no knowledge of the number or identity of the actual competitors.,"[De Silva, Dakshina G.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Geog, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Jeitschko, Thomas D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kosmopoulou, Georgia] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Michigan State University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"De Silva, DG (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Geog, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",dakshina.de-silva@ttu.edu; jeitschk@msu.edu; georgiak@ou.edu,"Jeitschko, Thomas/O-7318-2019; Jeitschko, Thomas/G-3290-2013","Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235; Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235; De Silva, Dakshina/0000-0001-8820-1955",,,,,24,10,13,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Current techniques for forecasting mortality in the USA involve the use of the Lee-Carter model, which is primarily used without regard to Cause. A method for forecasting morality is proposed which involves the use of neural networks. A comparative analysis is done between the Lee-Carter model, linear trend and the proposed method. The results confirm that the use of neural networks performs better than the Lee-Carter and linear trend model within 5% error. Furthermore, mortality rates and life expectancy were formulated for individuals with a specific cause based on prevalence data. The rates are broken down further into respective stages (cancer) based on the individual's diagnosis. Therefore, this approach allows life expectancy to be calculated based on an individual's state of health.

I raise two points on their paper, both concerning the role of sacrifice. First I maintain that, differently from other social preferences, guilt aversion (or warm glow) does not imply self-sacrifice. Secondly, I argue that aiming for mutual benefit does not prevent individuals from facing trade-offs between their own and their partners' Surplus, so the notion of sacrifice cannot be entirely eschewed. To the contrary, reciprocal 'sacrifices' enhance cooperative intentions and help create feelings of friendliness.","Univ Padua, Dept Econ Sci, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Gui, B (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ Sci, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",benedetto.gui@unipd.it,,,,,,,10,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

This can, and often does, involve competition between SEOs in limited local markets and in search of state grant income. For those that seek to transcend these limits, the tensions between the economic and the social can become acute, especially in those that seek to become self-consciously near-market social enterprises, with a growing focus upon their economic role and contribution and trading as the route to growth. This typically leads them into competition with firms in the mainstream capitalist economy, engendering tensions between the need to survive in competitive markets and the ethical and social motivations that informed their original formation. I then consider broader questions as to imaginaries about the social economy and of how the social economy is seen in the policy and academic literatures in terms of its socio-economic role. Finally, I offer some reflective comments as to the future for SEOs and the social economy and their contribution to social and economic life.","Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Hudson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",ray.hudson@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,52,59,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

To address this challenge we employ a demand model based on the Distance Metric (DM) approach of Pinkse et al. (Econometrica 70:1111-1153, 2002).

This does not mean, however, that divorce laws only affect the distribution of rents. Because the distribution of rents affects each spouse's incentives for noncontractible investments, divorce laws can affect the joint welfare of the couple. This article analyzes the effects of the consent divorce regime and the unilateral divorce regime on incentives for selfish and cooperative marital investments. Using these results, the article demonstrates how endogenous choice of marriage with noncontractible investments can explain some recent empirical results concerning the effects of the shift from consent divorce to unilateral divorce.

Yet it is obvious that people's preferences are not always self-interested and that false beliefs may lead people to prefer what is worse for them even when people are self-interested. So welfare is not preference satisfaction, and hence it appears that cost-benefit analysis and welfare economics in general rely on a mistaken theory of wellbeing. This essay explores the difficulties, criticizes standard defences of welfare economics, and then offers a new partial defence that maintains that welfare economics is independent of any philosophical theory of wellbeing. Welfare economics requires nothing more than an evidential connection between preference and welfare: in circumstances in which people are concerned with their own interests and reasonably good judges of what will serve their interests, their preferences will be reliable indicators of what is good for them.","[Hausman, Daniel M.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hausman, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA.",,,,,,,,60,50,55,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

In matching the autocorrelations, we demonstrate that the approximation works well, especially for larger d values. In computing autocorrelations over long, lags for larger d Value, using the exact formula one might encounter numerical problems. The Use of the ARFIMA(0, d, (d) over bar (1)) model provides a useful alternative to compute the autocorrelations as a really close approximation. In forecasting future aggregates, we demonstrate the close performance of using the ARFIMA(0, d, (d) over bar (1)) model and the exact aggregate structure. In practice, this provides a justification for the use of a low-order ARFIMA model in predicting future aggregates of long-memory process. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Man, K.

To contribute to this debate, this paper uses the co-integration and error correction framework of analysis and also conducts policy simulation experiments to investigate how monetary variables interact with aggregate supply, demand and prices in order to aid stabilisation policies. The results show that monetary variables and government finance are linked through government's net indebtedness to the banking system. The simulation results show that a 20 per cent monetary squeeze would reduce the inflation rate faster than if the reduction in money supply were 10 per cent. This reduction in money supply would also lead to a reduction in output, employment and government expenditure, which may hurt the domestic economy. The paper thus concludes that there is a trade-off between higher GDP growth and inflation in Nigeria.","Univ Calabar, Dept Econ, Calabar, Nigeria",University of Calabar,"Udah, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Calabar, Dept Econ, Calabar, Nigeria.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,UNIV PRETORIA,PRETORIA,"TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE ASSOC, FAC ECONOMIC & MANAGEMENT SCIENCES, GW-HSB 15-28 HUMANITIES BLDG, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Anecdotal evidence supports this revenue motive. We empirically test the revenue motive using a panel of annual data for North Carolina counties from 1990 to 2003. We find that significantly more tickets are issued in the year following a decline in revenue but that the issuance of traffic tickets does not decline in years following revenue increases. Elasticity estimates reveal that a 10 percent decrease in negative revenue growth results in a 6.4 percent increase in the growth rate of traffic tickets. Our results suggest that tickets are used as a revenue-generation tool rather than solely a means to increase public safety.,"[Garrett, Thomas A.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Wagner, Gary A.] Univ Arkansas, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock,"Garrett, TA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA.",,,,,,,,42,55,75,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Second, when foreign owners have at least 51% ownership versus where foreign ownership is less than 51% we observe dramatic differences in outsourcing levels. Also we find that for firms with controlling foreign ownership undertaking in-house activities, the motivation to keep their property rights as inviolate as possible when their capability contributions within the Indian economy are large and significant is intense. For firms considering locating in India a strategy of internalization of activities in India is central towards retaining their competitive advantage.","[Majumdar, Sumit K.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Datta, Deepak K.] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Majumdar, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",majumdar@utdallas.edu; ddatta@uta.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This understanding is based on the results of a qualitative analysis of a group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Gradual development of a group of 30 organisations has been monitored over the last fifteen years during their co-operation with the Technical University of Liberec. These organisations have hosted one-year student placements where students as part of their Bachelor degree course undertake a long term work experience enabling them to integrate the practical and theoretical aspects of their course. During this long period SMEs developed and passed through the different levels of changes that impact their size and style of management. The research focused on SME management's approach to ICT, its utilisation for competitive advantage and its relation to and defining of business and information strategy. Other aspects of the study looked at the effect of ICT on organisational performance, knowledge and skills of the employees, training and organisational culture. The analysed organisations were divided into five groups according to the level of their development during their business existence. Each group has its specific way of managing the organisation, its organisational structure, presence or absence of the corporate strategy, level of utilisation of ICT, internal and external integration ICT supporting processes in the organisation and way of utilisation of knowledge of the employees. The objective of this division is to emphasize changes of the management information needs and better understand their approach to ICT. The results indicate that successful and growing companies have gradually established business, information and knowledge strategies and use ICT as a strategic advantage.","Tech Univ Liberci, Hospodarska Fak, Katedra Informat, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Antlová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Hospodarska Fak, Katedra Informat, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",klara.antlova@tul.cz,"Antlova, Klara/O-6401-2016",,,,,,29,48,61,0,54,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Tax reforms executed in 1993, 1995 and 2004 triggered extensive changes of the Slovak tax system. Qualitative changes of value added tax (VAT) adjustments were part of these reforms and were reflected in three Acts on VAT, specifically Act No. 222211992 Coll, Act No. 28911995 Coll. and Act No. 22212004 Coll. Frequent revisions were taken not only to eliminate deficiencies in the Acts, but also due to political reasons that brought systemless points which complicated the execution of the Acts in practice. Increasing administrative difficulties for tax payers and systemless Act elements initiated tax payment avoidance, which influenced VAT revenues and incomes of state budget. The tax trend flew into tax reform in 2004 based on a decision of the Slovak government to move out from direct taxes and concentrate on indirect ones. From the fiscal point of view, this decision increased the importance of VAT. Before 2004, the incomes from VAT represented less than 50% of total tax incomes of public finance. After the tax reform in 2004, VAT creates more than 50% of total tax income and therefore has a crucial importance in the tax system. Due to this reason, VAT and its way of functioning receive an extensive attention. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the influence of changes in tax rates, in the system of excessive tax deduction and in setting of boundaries for tax registration, on the amount of VAT incomes and changes in the amount and structure of tax incomes of the budget of the Slovak Republic, based on analysis of legislative changes in the Slovak Acts on VAT.","Tech Univ Kosiciach, Fak Ekon, Katedra Financil, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Bánociová, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Fak Ekon, Katedra Financil, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",anna.banociova@tuke.sk,"Bánociová, Anna/AAA-2314-2020","Banociova, Anna/0000-0001-9351-6492",,,,,11,7,7,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It is focused on some of the Hellenic factors that were successfully used in antiquity to overcome conflicts and war and to achieve a harmoniously existing world. The factors that can be used as paradigmatic cases are the conceptions of divine kosmos and of polis; effective dialogue; the education of rulers and of citizens so as to be able to govern themselves and use their power in order to preserve civilization for posterity and to sustain their values, to oppose stasis and to embrace homonoia, to overcome conflicts and to preserve peace in more than two hundred city-states. In addition, I argue that the long and rich Hellenic experience is relevant to our epoch in the sense that it is universally known for its anti-polemic policy and its peace movements. Conceptions such as kosmos and organismic polis, the practice of laws and of homonoia, or friendship, can contribute to the solution of our local and world problems and the prevention of contemporary violence, terrorism, and wars. They can be used by future generations as a model of how to prevent the repetition of another holocaust, of any extermination of human beings by human beings (Dachau), or of any war tragedies (bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). They show, above all, how humanity can achieve a lasting world peace.","[Bargeliotes, Leonidas] Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy, GR-10679 Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,,,,,,,,28,0,1,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Scholars have approached this issue with modularity theory, suggesting a continuum of arrangements ranging from hierarchy to market. Hierarchy relies on fiat, while partially modular forms, those forms between hierarchy and market, require greater coordination, communication and relationships between firms than do fully modular (or market) forms. While modularity theory identifies this continuum, the associated empirical literature tends to dichotomize modularity: firms are either modular or they are not. Nor does the empirical literature examine the performance outcomes of modular arrangements within this continuum. By examining firms that vary between full integration and partial modularity with a continuous modularity measure, this paper empirically examines the performance outcomes associated with a range of modularity levels. We derive this measure from a peculiar inventory option available within the electronic manufacturing services (EMS) industry. Our data include observations on 260 firms over five years. We find that more firms rely on partially modular arrangements, the lower their performance. We suggest explanations for this result, and areas of future research meant to pursue it.","[Gentry, Richard J.] W Virginia Univ, Div Business Adm, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Elms, Heather] American Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Washington, DC 20016 USA",West Virginia University; American University,"Gentry, RJ (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Div Business Adm, POB 60-25, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",richard.gentry@mail.wvu.edu,"Gentry, Richard/G-3057-2010","Gentry, Richard/0000-0003-1157-7334",,,,,36,3,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Trust is a valuable asset both in the buyer-supplier (i.e. tangible) and knowledge (i.e. intangible) transactions. The analysis of academic literature shows that the more sophisticated and intangible the resource is subject to interaction, the more advanced level of trust is needed. The deterrence- and calculus-based trust may be sufficient for the short- to medium-term economic buyer-supplier transactions; however, the effective exchange of knowledge depends on the knowledge- or identification-based trust among partners. Nevertheless, even in the innovative partnerships the advanced forms of trust may not fully replace the traditional elements of deterrence- and calculus-based trust (e.g. fulfilling the contract obligations).","[Jucevicius, Giedrius] Kaunas Univ Technol, Business Strategy Inst, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,giedrius.jucevicius@ktu.lt,"Jucevicius, Giedrius/HPI-3903-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,KAUNAS,"K DONELAICIO 73, KAUNAS LT 3006, LITHUANIA",1822-7090,,,CHANGE SOC BUS ENV,,,2009,,,,,,,191,195,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTW62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288290300027,0

Second, our findings indicate that earnings and dividends have greater explanatory power for stock valuation. Earnings and dividends alone have about same explanatory power. Third, for all firms the combination of book value and dividends or book value and earnings has greater explanatory power for valuation. However, the combination of book value and dividends has virtually identical explanatory power as book value and earnings.","[Pourheydari, Omid] Univ Kerman Shahid Bahonar, Fac Management & Econ, Kerman, Iran",Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK),,omid@mail.uk.ac.ir; GH_soleimany@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,5,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,661,676,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500032,0

Due to the lack of relevant data file(s) on household incomes and housing expenditures, the authors developed a new method of the housing affordability indicators calculation. The method makes it possible to describe the trend of regional inequalities in housing affordability of owner-occupied housing and rental housing form 2000 to 2006 using the official regional wage statistics (RSCP - Regional Wage Statistics) as well as price and rent statistics (using the price and rent monitoring system of the Institute of Regional Information, Ltd). From 2000 to 2003 the inequalities between regions grew in significance, but since 2003 these regional inequalities in housing affordability have decreased. The second part of the paper focuses on the reasons of the specific development in regional inequalities concerning housing affordability in the Czech Republic. Using the statistical testing of hypotheses, the authors try find to what measure the trend of regional inequality in housing affordability reflected the trend of regional inequality in economic performance in general (as well as the trend of other regional specific factors affecting the demand of housing and the supply of housing). The following three hypotheses were tested: (1) regional differences in housing affordability are bigger than the regional differences in economic performance; (2) the value of housing affordability indicators depends on the values of the specific factor indicators; and (3) regional differences in housing affordability can be described by regional differences in values of the specific factors indicators.","[Sunega, Petr; Mikeszova, Martina; Lux, Martin] Sociol Ustav AV CR, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Sunega, P (通讯作者)，Sociol Ustav AV CR, Jilska 1, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",petr.sunega@soc.cas.cz; martina.mikeszova@soc.cas.cz; martin.lux@soc.cas.cz,"Sunega, Petr/B-9288-2014; Lux, Martin/B-8177-2014; Mikeszová, Martina/E-7369-2014","Sunega, Petr/0000-0001-9918-0731; Lux, Martin/0000-0003-4703-3443; Mikeszová, Martina/0000-0002-0996-5867",,,,,39,3,3,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The Box-Cox transformation of the time scale transforms a non-stationary G-Lambda model into a stationary model. This paper explores the time-varying behavior of the G-Lambda model. Simulation results indicate that it is possible to distinguish between the G-Lambda model and other better-known models such as the ARIMA, ARFIMA and STAR models. Applying the model to US unemployment data, the performance of the G-Lambda model varies as the start of the forecast periods changes. However, the results of the sign test and the Diebold-Mariano test indicate that the G-Lambda model has significantly better long-term forecasts than other models.

A capability building framework is built. In essential, capability building is a kind of knowledge cross-level activities within firm. Under the action. of evolution mechanism, new variation knowledge at individual level flows into organizational level by knowledge transferring, gatekeeper mechanism, knowledge operation, and structural embeddedness mechanism. The bottom-up model supports firm to form a new organizational knowledge aggregation by cross-level transferring among individual, group, and organizational level. And then, new capability uses feedback to affect organizational activities by top-down model. In order to make sure the effectiveness of the capability building, integration mechanism and institutionalization are needed to impel the cross-level transformation of knowledge.

The central issues are the key aspects of audit committee, namely independence, expertise and diligent including the issue of former senior auditor and audit alumni on audit committee and its effect on discretionary accruals. Based on OLS regression on cross-sectional data of 2007, the results suggest that audit committee with higher proportion of financial expertise (former senior auditor or former CFO) and more diligent audit committee are significant for the said purpose. As such, it is argued that audit committee with higher proportion of financial experts would lead to credible financial reporting. However, audit committee with former senior auditor and audit alumni are associated with larger discretionary accruals.

In just five years Mexico awarded 52 concessions totaling over 5300 km of toll roads, but as early as 1993 many of the concessions had to be renegotiated and in 1997 the government was forced to takeover 23 of them at an immediate financial cost of billions of dollars. This paper reconsiders the Mexican program and, with the benefit of hindsight, argues that it does not deserve its bad reputation. Although Mexico made some important mistakes in the design of the concessions, many of the highways turned out to be socially worthwhile investments.

After merger, partner firms decrease the price of the bundled system. In addition, when markets for individual components are sufficiently important, partner firms find it strategically advantageous to raise the prices of stand-alone products, thus making substitute 'mix-and-match' composite products less attractive to consumers. Even though these effects favor the profitability of mergers, merging is not always an equilibrium outcome. The reason is that outsiders respond by cutting their prices to retain their market share, and mergers can be unprofitable when competition is intense. From a welfare analysis, we observe that the number of mergers that are observed in equilibrium may be either excessive (when markets for individual components are important) or suboptimal (when markets for individual components are less important).","[Flores-Fillol, Ricardo] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain; [Flores-Fillol, Ricardo] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus 43204, Spain; [Moner-Colonques, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Dept Analisi Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Moner-Colonques, Rafael] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Flores-Fillol, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Avinguda Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",ricardo.flores@urv.cat; rafael.moner@uv.es,"Flores-Fillol, Ricardo/F-3815-2016; Moner-Colonques, Rafael/E-6302-2016","Flores-Fillol, Ricardo/0000-0002-3506-1634; Moner-Colonques, Rafael/0000-0002-4389-0870",,,,,29,7,8,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

One interesting feature of such forecasts is their calibration, or the match between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcome probabilities. Calibration has been evaluated in the past by grouping probability forecasts into discrete categories. We show here that we can do this without discrete groupings; the kernel estimators that we use produce efficiency gains and smooth estimated curves relating the predicted and actual probabilities. We use such estimates to evaluate the empirical evidence on the calibration error in a number of economic applications, including the prediction of recessions and inflation, using both forecasts made and stored in real time and pseudo-forecasts made using the data vintage available at the forecast date. The outcomes are evaluated using both first-release outcome measures and subsequent revised data. We find substantial evidence of incorrect calibration in professional forecasts of recessions and inflation from the SPF, as well as in real-time inflation forecasts from a variety of output gap models.

In a complete information framework, the joint use of the two instruments is puzzling as both whether a potential injurer has taken due care and whether he meets a specific causation standard depend only on his care level. We explain this puzzle with private information about injurers' avoidance costs, and we derive conditions under which the joint use of both instruments can induce self-selection of different cost types. With self-selection, low-cost firms take due care, whereas high-cost firms behave negligently, thereby aiming at escaping liability via the causation standard. Compared to the optimal single-instrument policy, we derive conditions under which such self-selection policies are strictly welfare-enhancing.

The foundation of the Guidelines' success has been its widespread adoption by federal courts, which have embraced its rigorous underlying economic logic and analytical approach to merger analysis under the Clayton Act. While some have suggested that the Guidelines' most recent iteration might jeopardize this record of judicial adoption by downplaying the role of market definition and updating its unilateral effects analysis, we believe that these updates are generally beneficial and include long-overdue shifts away from antiquated structural presumptions in favor of analyzing competitive effects directly where possible. However, this article explores a different reason to be concerned that the 2010 Guidelines may not enjoy widespread judicial adoption: the 2010 Guidelines asymmetrically update economic insights underlying merger analysis. While the 2010 Guidelines' updated economic thinking on market definition and unilateral effects will likely render the prima facie burden facing plaintiffs easier to satisfy in merger analysis moving forward, and thus have significant practical impact, the Guidelines do not correspondingly update efficiencies analysis, leaving it largely as it first appeared 13 years earlier. We discuss two well-qualified candidates for economic updates of efficiencies analysis under the Guidelines: (1) out-of-market efficiencies and (2) fixed-cost savings. We conclude with some thoughts about the implications of the asymmetric updates for judicial adoption of the 2010 Guidelines.","[Wright, Joshua D.] George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Dept Econ, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Stone, Judd E.] Alaska Supreme Court, Fairbanks, AK USA",George Mason University,"Wright, JD (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Dept Econ, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",jwrightg@gmu.edu,,"Wright, Joshua/0000-0002-9835-6579",,,,,27,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

It then analyzes the economics of cloud computing in terms of reducing costs, transforming capital expenditures into operating expenditures, aggregating demand, increasing reliability, and reducing latency. It then discusses the architectural implications of cloud computing for access networking (focusing on bandwidth, reliability, quality of service, and ubiquity) and data center interconnectivity (focusing on bandwidth, reliability, security and privacy, control over routing policies, standardization, and metering and payment).

They are frequently dominated by environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) that fight, boycott, lobby, and negotiate with other interest groups to privilege nonindustrial, particularly environmental, values of resources. This article proposes an environmental bargaining framework to analyze the many and varied forms of interactions and processes through which ENGOs seek to change existing practices and decision structures. Drawing on political economy and political ecology approaches, environmental bargaining recognizes the importance of multiple perspectives, strategies of actors, and the regional context. Conceptually, the article interprets environmental conflicts along two dimensions: the distribution of power between actors and forms of interaction ranging from confrontational to collaborative. Examples from British Columbia, Canada, and Tasmania, Australia, reveal the value of comparative perspectives and the importance of the regional context that determines behavior and relationships between actors. While confrontational action has brought considerable change to Tasmania's forests, the example from British Columbia suggests that collaborative forms of decision making that are based on a balance of power have more potential to protect environmental values and bring peace to the woods.","Univ Luxembourg, Lab Geog & Amenagement Terr, L-7102 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Affolderbach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Lab Geog & Amenagement Terr, BP 2, L-7102 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",julia.affolderbach@uni.lu,,"Affolderbach, Julia/0000-0002-9520-7033",,,,,70,30,35,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Although the rationality of these forecasts has often been rejected, earlier studies have relied on the assumption that positive and negative forecast errors of identical magnitudes are equally important to forecasters. Allowing for homogenous asymmetric loss, our evidence still strongly rejects forecast rationality. However, if we allow for variation in asymmetric loss functions across forecasters, not only do we find significant differences in preferences, but also we can often no longer reject forecast rationality.

The general multivariate model, which can be formulated as a seemingly unrelated regression model, includes the previously studied homogeneous multivariate Holt-Winters' model as a special case when all of the univariate series share a common structure. MCMC simulation techniques are required in order to approach the non-analytically tractable posterior distribution of the model parameters. The predictive distribution is then estimated using Monte Carlo integration.

The CME defines the average daily temperature underlying its contracts as the average of the maximum and minimum daily temperatures, yet all published work on temperature forecasting for pricing purposes has ignored this peculiar definition of the average and sought to model the average temperature directly. This paper is the first to look at the average temperature forecasting problem as an analysis of extreme values. The theory of extreme values guides model selection for temperature maxima and minima, and a forecast distribution for the CME's daily average temperature is found through convolution. While univariate time series AR-GARCH and regression models generally yield superior point forecasts of temperatures, our extreme-value-based model consistently outperforms these models in density forecasting, the most important risk management tool.

This is in spite of New Zealand's business and consumer confidence and expectations data capturing a substantial proportion of the predictive information in the international data.

The reliance on individual data raises several conceptual and empirical issues, the most fundamental of which is the large proportion of zero values in transit counts. To accommodate this feature of the data, we employ modeling procedures referred to as zero-inflated models (ZIMs), which order observations into two latent regimes defined by whether the individual never uses public transport. Our estimates reveal fuel prices to have a positive and substantial influence on transit ridership, though there is no evidence for a statistically significant impact of the fare.

A binary logit model reveals that the income elasticity for car ownership is 0.5944, meaning that car owners tend to treat cars as necessity for commuting purposes. The low income elasticity implies that the Singapore government can lower the annual vehicle population growth rate from currently 3% to a range of 1 to 2%, which is more sustainable in the long run. A discrete choice model between public transport and private transport indicates that the income elasticity for public transport and private transport is given by -0.257 and 1.385 respectively. The cost elasticity of the private transport and public transport is given by -0.888 and -0.020, respectively, implying that changes in usage costs have big influence on car owners on decision of driving to work and the public transport users remain to be captive users. The cross travel-time elasticity of private transport for public transport is 1.157, which implies that substantial reduction in the travel time by public transport will attract more car users to public transport. To achieve this, the government should expand the bus priority lanes during the peak times and encourage bus operators to offer express services. Finally, the implied value of travel time savings (VTTS) during peak hours for private transport is S$22.76, about 102% of the gross average wage rate of car owners, which is an important parameter for congestion pricing scheme.","[Li, Michael Z.

Both educational approaches, in their own way, aim to stimulate real and enduring entrepreneurial behaviour. One programme compels business start-up as an integral part of its approach, the other encourages it. Our approach here is not to condemn either, but rather to compare and contrast our cumulative experience of 10 years enterprise education and to consider what has worked, what has not worked and what we plan to do differently in the future Our approaches must be viewed from the perspective of our respective institutional backgrounds. Both Universities promote themselves as 'entrepreneurial' and these programmes are flagships of their entrepreneurialism, that being defined by Shattock (2009) as the capacity to turn a business idea into a success through blending creativity or innovation with sound business management; implicit in the concept is a readiness to take risks, a taste for independence and self realisation. While our institutions may implicitly subscribe to these ideals, one institution is constrained by what Clark (1998) describes as restrictive funding systems and the other, as Clark urges, is less dependent on the state. Whether, as a consequence, one is more entrepreneurial in its approach than the other is a matter for debate, again it depends upon your perspective. Imposed business start-up had the potential to provide students with 'real' business experience; not to do so, has the potential to become little more than a business studies degree that focuses on the SME sector. We argue that it is possible to do more than either of these stereotypes suggest, but this means focusing more on the development of an entrepreneurial mindset and less on business start-up as a fixed outcome. Whilst the two are not mutually exclusive, arriving at a happy medium (institutional contentment and entrepreneurial students) is a tricky balancing act. In sharing our experiences, we aim to inform the debate and we also hope to learn from others in order to continue to innovate in our approaches to teaching and enterprise development.","[Adams, Nigel] Univ Buckingham, Buckingham, England; [Lockyer, Joan] Coventry Univ, Inst Appl Enterpreneurship, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Buckingham; Coventry University,"Adams, N (通讯作者)，Univ Buckingham, Buckingham, England.",nigel.adams@buckingham.ac.uk; jlockyer@cad.coventry.ac.uk,"Lockyer, Joan/AAC-2215-2019",,,,,,2,2,2,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,24,32,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800004,0

Design/Methodology/Approach: Nowadays, various methods or technologies are used to evaluate the environmental impacts of the darns. In this paper, the control lists and matrix methods were used on a case study to highlight the reservoir and dam effects in the referred zone. Results/Acknowledgements: By using simple table methods the ecological impacts are not very well highlighted. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new technologies that allow the elaborate study of impacts. Implications: Researchers must focus their work to develop a concept that combines the benefits of the dams with the environment, without exposing it to greater risks.

This has neglected cases in which the interest is not in concealing information from competitors but from trading partners. We investigate trade-secret protection in such cases. Frequently, asymmetric information will lead to inefficient trade; at the same time, protecting private information might create incentives for socially desirable investments. We model this trade-off in a simple buyer-seller model and find that the optimal fine for violations of trade secrets is positive. In general, however, the welfare effects of increasing a fine are ambiguous. We discuss conditioning the legal protection on a minimum investment by the informed party to conceal the information and argue that this helps to apply trade-secret protection only when it increases welfare.

The choice of a location is of fundamental importance for a firm. Usually it is associated with investments and relocation therefore linked with sunk costs. Theory and empirical studies suggest that it is especially young and expanding firms that relocate. This hypothesis is tested using a large and comprehensive database. It is shown that relocated firms are in fact more prosperous than those that do not move. They expand and employ highly qualified personnel more often and are distinctly younger than the vast majority of firms that have not relocated. Typically firms relocate over a short distance, so the relations to suppliers, customers and employees are not strongly affected. The majority of movements are from the centre to the suburban fringe, where sites are less expensive. However, centrality is often important for newly founded firms. Cities are ideal seedbeds for firms to be founded, but as the firms grow older and wish to expand, an attractive hinterland becomes important.

In developing the concept of archetypes, Jung built on Freud's idea of the psychodynamic unconscious to suggest a deeper level of reality - the collective unconscious - containing primordial images and ideas, forming archetypal patterns. Like Plato's forms, archetypes are a blueprint for human apprehension. From them emerge images, universal symbols and myths which contain both positive and negative, (otherwise termed 'shadow') aspects. They may be impersonal, such as the archetype of death and rebirth, or personalised, such as the great mother, the wise man or the hero. Because of the ubiquity of organizations in the life of individuals in Western cultures, leaders in work organizations encourage their members to mirror the behaviours, attitudes and values of the employer through concrete rewards and symbols, and in this sense archetypes are powerful 'stakeholders of the organizational mind'. Jung also suggested that individuals or communities which lack understanding of psychodynamic processes risk becoming overwhelmed by archetypal patterns of behaviour. In other words, inability to understand the non-rational, psychodynamic aspects of organizational behaviour may give rise to exaggerated or bizarre responses. Such explanations are often missing from mainstream management texts. This paper examines the experiences of Scottish social entrepreneurs at a crucial period, where the 'Big Society' theme appears to be used both as an inducement and a threat to the survival of their enterprises. Through the lens of Jungian psychology the psychodynamic aspects of this situation are discussed. The paper considers the archetypal roles influencing the actions of social enterprise leaders as they attempt to guide their organizations through the associated psychic turbulence of cultural change.","[Brown, Mary] Robert Gordon Univ, Aberdeen Business Sch, Aberdeen AB9 1FR, Scotland",Robert Gordon University; University of Aberdeen,,m.brown@rgu.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,17,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,151,158,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800020,0

This paper aims at analyzing the correlations between the business cycles of the CEE countries, the correlations of the business cycles of the CEE countries with those of some developed countries of the EU, such as Germany, France, Italy, UK and at identifying the role of technological change on the economic fluctuations of the CEE countries. According to the theory of the optimum currency area, the policy of the European Central Bank will be efficient if the business cycles of the member states are strongly correlated. If the business cycles are not correlated, then the decisions of the European Central Bank are adequate only for those countries which are in the same stage of the business cycle. For the estimation of the business cycles of the studied countries we used the Gross domestic product variable and, to take into consideration technological changes, we analyzed research and development expenses. The stationarity of these variables was tested by means of the ADF and Philips Perron tests. For the extraction of the cyclical component we used the Hodrick-Prescott filter while the Granger causality test was employed for determining the influence of technological changes. The business cycles of the CEE countries are synchronized. Most business cycles of the CEE countries are strongly correlated with the business cycles of Germany, Italy and France. Technological changes have a predictive power only for some countries belonging to the CEE. The existence of correlations among the business cycles of the CEE countries certifies the fact that these countries simultaneously shifted towards major economic changes after 1990, enabling them to be members of the European Union. The significant correlations with the most powerful EU countries from an economic standpoint also justify the effort in the attempt to adhere to the European Economic and Monetary Union. The obtained results also show that the high values of the correlations of the business cycles are determined by the fast transmission of technological changes among them.","[Chirila, Viorica; Chirila, Ciprian] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,chviorica@yahoo.com; chcipis@yahoo.com,"Chirilă, Viorica/K-3050-2019; Chirila, Ciprian/HZM-3093-2023","Chirila, Ciprian/0000-0002-8489-8465",,,,,13,1,1,0,13,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,361,364,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900091,0

These are assessed not only in terms of gains in economic efficiency, but also in changes in travel demand and consumer surplus. The estimated partial equilibrium price is higher in all three pricing regimes when compared to the current price. As a result, consumer surplus falls in all three cases. The price increase is much larger with average cost pricing compared to marginal cost pricing or two-part tariffs, and hence a larger fall in demand and consumer surplus occurs due to average cost pricing. While there is a gain in economic efficiency from marginal cost pricing and two-part tariffs, this improvement comes at the expense of reduced public bus transit demand and consumer surplus, given the price inelastic public bus transit demand estimated for India. Given the mobility needs and the developmental concerns of a growing economy such as India, the challenge for policy makers is to balance the gains in economic efficiency in the public bus transit sector against other social, political, and developmental goals.

The desired quality is different from the perceived quality because it does not represent the daily experiences of the users, but rather what they desire, hope for or expect from their public transport system. This is why it is important to study the desired quality, knowledge of which gives local authorities the background information for personalised marketing policies based on the user's requirements rather than their daily perceptions. The methodology goes through several stages, such as the use of focus groups to choose the most important variables for the users, the design and use of unlabelled stated preferences surveys and the calibration of discrete choice models. All of these help determine the weight of the most relevant variables. The analysis is carried out with different categories of users and potential users (those people not currently using public transport). Waiting time, cleanliness and comfort are shown to be the public transport variables that users most valued, but the degree to which they are valued varies according to the category of user. Variables such as driver kindness, bus occupancy and journey time are generally given less weight. The first two vary little by user category, but some variability appears for journey time. For potential users the more important variables when defining expected quality from public transport are waiting time, journey time and above all, level of occupancy. They consider the other variables to be of little importance when defining an efficient public transport service. In order to improve service quality and attract more passengers to public transport in general, the application of this methodology provides the authorities and operating companies with useful information to plan personalised marketing policies specifically directed at different categories of users and potential users of public transport.

This has been caused by an inadequate planning and has negative consequences on both customer relationships and organizational economic performance. Given this reality, academics propose a sequential product development plan based on the following essential steps: identifying opportunities and generating ideas, selection of ideas with the highest chances of success, development of new product concept materialized in the form of a prototype, technical testing and acceptance testing, making the final changes to the product, establishing brand name, price level and other intangible elements of the product, legal protection of the product, placing the product into production and effectively lunching the product though a tactical marketing program.

Indicators of internationalization are considered with respect to each country as aggregate, to its technology-intensive industries only, and in relation to the share of its firms reporting international activities. On the basis of the empirical results, and the theoretical arguments presented, the paper suggests that underpinning the association is a virtuous (or vicious) circle: innovative firms are more successful in competing internationally and the exposure to alternative business and innovation contexts leads to innovation.","[Frenz, Marion] Univ London, Dept Management, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Filippetti, Andrea] Italian Natl Res Council, Rome, Italy; [Ietto-Gillies, Grazia] London S Bank Univ, Fac Business, London, England",University of London; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); London South Bank University,"Frenz, M (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",m.frenz@bbk.ac.uk,"xue, zhe/C-2203-2012","FILIPPETTI, ANDREA/0000-0002-1182-852X",,,,,47,41,45,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Mobile advertising is a new way of marketing communications in developing countries. Nevertheless, low acceptance rate will prevent the success of mobile advertising campaigns. As a result, it is crucial to understand what factors can affect mobile advertising effectiveness especially for Iranian users as they send 80 million SMS per day [1]. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether social norms along with perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) play important roles in predicting consumers' mobile advertising adoption. This study employed an online questionnaire survey method to collect empirical data. Descriptive statistics and a simple linear regression were calculated to examine the research hypotheses. Perceived usefulness of mobile advertising was found to predict consumers' attitude towards mobile advertising, while perceived ease of use of mobile advertising did not. Social norms should be considered as interventions in decision-making for mobile users, as social norms have been found to be effective in changing the behavior of students. Findings of this study help mobile advertisers and marketers understand if and how social norms can be tailored into mobile advertising campaigns to ensure higher level of adoption and acceptance.","[Hosseini, Mirza Hassan; Noroozi, Ali] Payam E Noor Univ, Tehran, Iran; [Ghazizadeh, Mostafa; Goharpad, Mahdi] Shahed Univ, Tehran, Iran; [Mobarekeh, AmirHossein Norouzi] Isfahan Social Secur Org, Branch 2, Esfahan, Iran",Shahed University,"Hosseini, MH (通讯作者)，Payam E Noor Univ, Tehran, Iran.",a.noroozi@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,5,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,261,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400056,0

One approach to modeling heteroscedasticity assumes a prior knowledge or specific model for the variability of random regression errors. Another (and more general) approach does not assume a specific form of heteroscedasticity.

Classification criteria for spas and onsen are very similar. a certain (but not identical) legal form exists of these spas. Specifics of spas in the Czech Republic and traditional spa in Japan show a strong linking to the aspects preferred within promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR). A survey that was made was focused on i) identifying way of the perception of various aspects of CSR in the spa / onsen, ii) identifying way of the perception of various aspects of CSR by the public authority (government) in the spa resort, iii) comparing the level of conformity of both types of groups in the Czech Republic, and iv) comparing the results of the survey of Czech spas, Czech spa resorts and Japanese onsen in order to identify conformity and differences in the groups. Results show that there are differences in the level of overall perception of aspects of CSR in the Czech Republic and in Japan, differences from the point of view of ordinal perception of various areas and from the point of understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in appraisal of chosen detailed factors.

In a developing economy, the change transfigures from a variable to a constant. The consulting sphere is emerging and growing hand-to-hand with the client firms. As client firms mature there are growing opportunities for consulting, which the firms have to recognize and capitalize upon. However, under the pressure of daily business, small firms are managed in a very rudimentary way. Based on interconnection between practice and theory, and a significant experience in ownership of small scale Moldovan firm and senior management of multinational consulting firm, the authors propose a set of priority strategic actions for small consulting firms to enable their growth. Focused strategies, building corporate values, innovations in business processes, pro-active marketing and balance between tangible and non-tangible services to attract clients, and most importantly motivating and managing the human capital that is the main asset of a consulting firm, are the key ingredients for a successful small scale consulting practice.",,,,lbugaian@hotmail.com; doinitanistor@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,6,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,481,483,,,,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000121,0

By estimating a separate set of production-related coefficients for each individual sector, the analysis permits economies/diseconomies of scale to differ across sectors. More important, the analysis allows these scale effects to vary over time, which seems critical in the context of a transition economy, as the Czech government was tightening air protection polices by imposing more stringent emission limits and escalating emission charge rates. To assess whether these tighter policies expanded economies of scale, the analysis controls for heterogeneity across individual firms by examining intra-firm variation in emissions and production.","[Lizal, Lubomir] CERGE EI, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; University of Kansas,"Lizal, L (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, POB 882,Politickych Veznu 7, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",Lubomir.Lizal@cerge-ei.cz; Earnhart@ku.edu,"Lízal, Lubomír M/HZH-4834-2023","Lízal, Lubomír M/0009-0009-0182-454X",,,,,37,2,2,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Persons who have been unemployed for longer than one year at present represent more than 50% of the total number of unemployed in the EU countries. For comparison it is often stated, for example, that in Japan long-term unemployment is around 15%. Apart from the economic impacts, long-term unemployment also has a number of other social impacts. These include loss of work habits, loss of contact with normal social life, but also psychological problems, laziness, etc. One of the problems in relation to long-term unemployment is considered to be the generosity of social benefits.

Prior work: The reflection about the teaching and learning process in dentistry should not focus only on the information acquired during the courses, but also on the practice process, including the last new dental technology, like: statistical soft used in dental office, computer technology for assessing the risk for oral diseases, and oral kit for dental bacteria. Assessment of young and senior dental students' satisfaction with this new school curricula can lead to the identification of the problems in dental schools. Methodology: The convenience sample of 135 subjects included students attending the Faculty of Dental Medicine Iasi. The questionnaire assessed students' perceptions of didactic classes during the undergraduate course, the interaction between clinical and practical content, and the new technological's process during the practical courses. The questions also assessed how prepared the student felt with respect to their future professional practice, and if this kind of curricula can improved the work in private or public office.Results:83% of the senior students preferred to work in a private dental office, versus 45% of the younger ones; Chi-square test showed significant differences (p=0.01). The following answers were found in what concerns the curricula content: 65% of the students considered that there was a normal interaction between didactic and clinic process, 31% of them suggested it would be necessary to have more practice lessons, and 74% appreciated that is a very important for the future work to use in dental practice new technological methods. Implications: Student's perception of their education received little attention from those providing dental school education. The results of this study helped the university teaching staff to identify areas of strengths and weakness of students' attitudes toward their dental education. Both young and senior students identified similar areas in which their dental education is viewed as favorable, while different areas were identified as weaknesses. Originality value: In order to develop modern design curricula in dental schools, it is necessary to improve the communication with students about their preferences, expectations, and preparations for this job. From this point of view, we demonstrate that the originality of this study consists of an open-mind and extensive dialogue about the future directions of dental education and management, including modern technology.","[Murariu, Alice Mirela; Hanganu, Carmen Stela] Univ Med & Pharm Gr T Popa Iasi, Fac Med Dent, Dept Community Dent, Iasi, Romania",Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,,murariu_alice@yahoo.com; carmenhanganu1957@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,393,396,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000099,0

There is a great body of literature on the theory of innovation, how people collaborate and the role, structure and types of innovation ecosystems that occur. While many companies consider themselves innovative, most lack a common lexicon for understanding how their investments in innovation translate into business value, De Cusatis, IBM (2010). The same may be said of educational providers, who might 'advocate' creativity within the content of educational programmes whilst providing a different reality at a strategic and operational level. Taking empirical examples of entrepreneurship education at all levels in Ireland, this paper aims to explore the way institutional practices can work against the espoused desire for better approaches to fostering and implementing creativity through the delivery of programmes. Bureaucracy, lack of funding, use of traditional and proven (albeit dated) practices of course development, poor planning, lack of consultation, fear of stepping outside the comfort zone and failure to 'think outside the box' have stunted the growth of entrepreneurial approaches to education. It is possible to view these negative practices as immovable concrete barriers and accept them as a 'fait accompli'. On the other hand it is possible to regard them as high level hurdles which can be conquered through a creative and innovative approach. Creativity and innovation underpins real time entrepreneurship and hence entrepreneurship educators need to be creative and innovative in its delivery albeit in the academic environment. The structure of this paper is as follows: the next section presents the empirical context of entrepreneurship education in Ireland, followed by an overview of our conceptual thinking. The paper then discusses the methodology applied in this research to date. The initial findings of the perceived blocks towards entrepreneurship education across three different levels of education are then presented.

In Malaysia, innovation takes center stage in the New Economic Model that has been recently announced. In fact, many countries in the region and around the world now aspire to drive growth through innovation. Due to its importance, it inspires us to study on how an innovation capital affect to firm's performance. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of innovation capital in Malaysian Public Companies. The study adopts a quantitative approach whereby the data of specific innovation drivers were retrieved from the annual reports of Malaysian Public Companies. The study will also investigate empirically the relation between the innovation capital and its impact on firm performance of Malaysian Public Companies. The study evaluates whether firms with high innovation intensities perform better than firms with low intensities. Due to the mix results in previous studies, it encourages the researchers to conduct such study and conclude these relationships. The results will extend the understanding of the role of innovation capital in enhancing the performance of companies in the developing countries. Therefore, the findings from this study may serve as a useful input for scholars and managers to better understand the implication of innovation capital to the firm performance.

In this paper we explore how some of the second-order processes discovered by Kalman have their analogues in Bayesian state space models. Many of the analogues in the lierature need to be calculated using numerical methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo so they retain, or even enhance, the descriptive power of the Kalman filter, but at the cost of reduced transparency. However, if the analogues are drawn properly, elegant recurrence relationships like those of the Kalman filter can still be developed that apply, at least, for one-step-ahead forecast distributions. In this paper we explore the variety of ways such models have been built, in particular with respect to graphical time series models.

Long-run and ECM equations were derived from the estimated coefficients. Empirical data included monthly observations from 1990 to late 2006. Stationarity of the residuals was explored using Augmented Dickey-Fuller statistics. Results suggest that demand and supply elasticities in both short and long-run are relatively small compared with past studies. The Canadian softwood lumber supply to the U.S. is more price elastic than the domestic softwood lumber supply. U.S. import tariffs have had limited impact on the amount of softwood lumber imported from Canada. Technological progress and end-of-year seasonal effects on softwood lumber demand and supply were significant over this period. (C) 2010 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea Sweden.

The increased market competition and stakeholder pressure determines companies to start engaging in CSR activities. In marketing field, CSR is becoming a very popular instrument used by companies in shaping their strategy. The debate about CSR started in Romania after year 2000, but still we can say that the level of CSR development is embryonic. Few of Romanian companies are engaging in socially and environmentally responsible business practices, most of them being multinational ones.

However, not long ago critics of industrial policy were convincing that the best industrial policy is competition policy only. Indeed nowadays proponents of industrial policy agree on necessity to maintain competitiveness in markets. Nonetheless, they justify interventions of public institutions in particular cases of security, defence, and other public interest matters. The discussion runs on and new theories have emerged complementing arguments with new ideas and raising more questions than answers. At the beginning, this paper focuses on the concept of national champions revealing not only traditional understanding of this category, but providing with more types of them too. They may be quite different at their individual life stages. Of course, national governments desire to host large and strong high competitive companies at the frontier of innovations and holding strong positions in foreign markets. Hidden champions may be considered as specific type of national champions because of their specific business strategy. Further, the paper explores literature, which is dedicated to competition topic. The paper reveals that there are 8.6% (in total) of scientific works on the topic of national champions where the attention is given to their activity and to the issues of their national states. The study also demonstrates evidence that there is a lack of scientific works on the topic of national champions which are adequate to the challenges of small countries. The authors of the paper have also identified relationship between the number of scientific works that are dedicated to policies of national states related to national champions and the number of national champions in particular states. At the end of the paper the arguments in favour of and against industrial policy are disclosed as well as the new pragmatic approach.","[Stanikunas, Rimantas Antanas; Burinskas, Arunas] Vilnius Univ, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Econ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Stanikunas, RA (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Bldg 2,Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rims@konkuren.lt; burinskas.arunas@gmail.com,"Burinskas, Arunas/JXN-6349-2024","Burinskas, Arunas/0000-0001-6053-9495",,,,,31,0,0,5,18,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Excessive reporting is investigated by undertaking the first formal analysis of money laundering enforcement.

Banks face fines should they fail to report money laundering. However, excessive fines force banks to report transactions which are less suspicious. The empirical evidence is shown to be consistent with the model's predictions.

The number of social media users has continued to increase ever since its inception, and, at present, more than a billion people from all over the world are connected and considered to be networked through this media. Although there has been some research conducted to understand the phenomena of social media flocking, there is relatively little and inadequate theory-driven empirical research available to explain the application of social media and consumer tendency to use social media. The existing model of consumer media usage is observed to be less appropriate in capturing the depth of consumer social media needs because, unlike other media, it is supported by computer-mediated communication technology as its basic foundation. In addition, consumers adopt innovation in social media because of its perceived helpfulness in satisfying the consumer's segment of needs that arise from two basic points of view: one being consumer social roles and the other being consumer personal disposition. As social media is highly interactive in nature and most likely user-controlled, it remains questionable whether the existing consumer media needs will have the same significant impact on social media as the previous media. Therefore, based on the understanding of the Tri-component Attitude Model and drawing upon Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT) and Diffusion and Innovation Theory (DIT) this paper seeks to explain the adoption of this new online media in light of consumer perceived social media needs and the characteristics of social media technology. A conceptual framework for segmenting the behavioural response of the consumer to social media adoption is proposed based on the affective, cognitive and conative state of attitude formation. With the help of this framework the understanding of researchers and practitioners concerning consumer predictive needs and their relationship to the speed of consumer adoption behaviour in the social media will be better understood. It will also provide a deeper and more complete understanding in designing future targeting strategies and enhancing customer relationship management (CRM) with existing and potential consumers through the social media platform.","[Zolkepli, Izzal Asnira] Univ Malaya, Grad Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Kamarulzaman, Yusniza] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Mkt, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Zolkepli, IA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Grad Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",izzalasnira@gmail.com; yusniza@um.edu.my,"Zolkepli, Izzal Asnira/B-3950-2018; KAMARULZAMAN, YUSNIZA/C-1101-2010","Zolkepli, Izzal Asnira/0000-0002-0103-0821; KAMARULZAMAN, YUSNIZA/0000-0003-0786-4568",,,,,58,0,0,0,20,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1048,1055,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800124,0

Even in jurisdictions that have laws against excessive pricing, there has been little case law on the issue. A recent dispute over the pricing of flat steel in South Africa provides helpful guidance on the correct approach to excessive pricing cases. The Competition Tribunal took a structural approach and deduced the existence of excessive pricing on the basis of super-dominance and market segmentation. The Competition Appeal Court overturned this decision and clearly stated that (1) an empirical exercise comparing prices with cost benchmarks is required in assessing these cases, and (2) excessive prices need to be judged against the long-run average costs of an efficient firm. A purely structural approach was not deemed adequate. In this article, we describe the case and explain why the judgment by the Competition Appeal Court is sound from an economic perspective and why it sets an important precedent in this area of competition law.","[Calcagno, Claudio] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Walker, Mike] Charles River Associates Inc, London, England",European University Institute; Charles River Associates,"Calcagno, C (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",claudio.calcagno@eui.eu; mwalker@crai.com,,,,,,,10,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We contrast individual-based liability determination (IBLD), wherein a clear description of the mechanism by which a defendant's actions translate into a plaintiff's harm is available, with population-based liability determination (PBLD), wherein cases rely on the prevalence of harm in the population to persuade a judge or jury to draw an inference of causation or fault. PBLD creates a rational optimism effect on the plaintiff's part that is inherent in many mass tort settings. This effect creates incentives for higher settlement demands and results in greater interim expected payoffs for plaintiffs and, thus, an increased propensity to file suit. Consequently, defendants in PBLD cases face increased ex ante expected costs compared with the IBLD regime, thereby increasing incentives to take care.","[Daughety, Andrew F.; Reinganum, Jennifer F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Daughety, Andrew F.; Reinganum, Jennifer F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Nashville, TN 37240 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University,"Daughety, AF (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",andrew.f.daughety@vanderbilt.edu; jennifer.f.reinganum@vanderbilt.edu,"Reinganum, Jennifer F/A-7801-2009",,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0814312] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,26,5,6,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In particular it looks at how perception of quality varies according to the available information. The experiment compares an overall evaluation of service quality before and after making passengers reflect on the importance of certain fundamental system variables which they may not have previously considered. Focus groups were used to individualise the most relevant variables. A quality survey was carried out both on-board buses and at bus stops and the overall service quality was related to the aforementioned variables using ordered probit models. The perception of quality is shown to change with the category of user and that there tends to be more criticism towards variations in overall quality until the users are stimulated into thinking more deeply about other influential variables. The application of this methodology may provide operating companies with valuable information for planning marketing policies aimed at different categories of user, in order to improve the service quality and attract more passengers to using public transport.

We characterize the optimal consumption of car kilometers by a representative car user and find that a shift from ownership towards usage taxes is not necessarily welfare-improving: while a revenue-neutral shift makes the representative car user worse off; a utility-neutral shift leads to a significant loss of revenue to the government.

One feature of the built environment that has gained increasing attention is the role of access to chain grocers and their impact on body mass index (BMI). The assessment of the impacts of spatial access to chain grocers on BMI is complicated by two empirical regularities in the data. There is evidence that health outcomes such as BMI are clustered in space and that there is spatial dependence across individuals. In this article, we use an econometric model that takes into account the spatial dependence, and we allow the effect of access to differ for a person depending on whether he or she lives in a low-income community or peer group. We categorize this community using the characteristics of the people who immediately surround the individual rather than using census tracts. Using georeferenced survey data on adults in Marion County, Indiana, we find that the effect of improvements in chain grocer access on BMI varies depending on community characteristics.","[Chen, Susan] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Florax, Raymond J.

To address this question, two common property/collective goods organizations for water management-located in the Arkansas River Basin of Colorado-were compared. The method was to assess attributes of each organization against those of conceptual benchmarks that reflect a tradition of common property resource and collective goods organizational research. The organizations were the Arkansas River Water Bank Pilot Program and the Lower Arkansas Valley Water Management Association. The Arkansas River Water Bank Pilot Program lacked the characteristics that theorists advancing the conceptual benchmarks have hypothesized as important to success. The pilot program also failed to generate local interest. The program was decommissioned in 2005 after the pilot trial period concluded. The Lower Arkansas Water Management Association possessed the attributes. It was considered a success as defined by member support for the organization and the capacity of that organization to re-time flows on the Arkansas River. This program has been operating a water market in the lower Arkansas River Basin for over 30 years and continues to successfully move groundwater and surface water around the landscape. Implications for policy and theory are addressed.","[Lepper, Troy; Freeman, David] Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Lepper, T (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, B258 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",troylepper@yahoo.com; David.Freeman@colostate.edu,,,,,,,33,2,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical rationale for the damped trend method based on Brown's original thinking about the form of underlying models for exponential smoothing. We develop a random coefficient state space model for which damped trend smoothing provides an optimal approach, and within which the damping parameter can be interpreted directly as a measure of the persistence of the linear trend.

This article proposes and tests an institutional explanation for this effect. We argue that certain budgetary rules, by limiting the ability of subnational governments to respond to voter demands for increased spending, may systematically force lawmakers to under-provide public goods. When this occurs, governments are likely to treat grant revenue as a supplement to total expenditures and not return this money to voters in the form of a tax cut as suggested by existing theory. To evaluate our hypothesis, we use data on the Community Development Block Grant program and municipal tax and expenditure limitations. Results show that restrictive fiscal institutions significantly increase the stimulative power of federal grant revenue.

Using a data set of state high court opinions, we construct measures for three aspects of judicial performance: effort, skill, and independence. The measures permit a test of the relationship between performance and the four primary methods of state high court judge selection: partisan election, non-partisan election, merit plan, and appointment. Appointed judges write higher quality opinions than elected judges do, but elected judges write more opinions, and the evidence suggests that the large quantity difference makes up for the small quality difference. In addition, elected judges are not less independent than appointed judges.

Several empirical experiments are undertaken to demonstrate the features of the adapted random forest procedure and confirm its effectiveness as a forecasting model.

Despite the pivotal role of clusters in regional development and national competitiveness, there are only a few studies on how new East Asian high-tech clusters have emerged and evolved and how these clusters are similar to and different from other clusters. Based on a comparative analysis of new TFT-LCD clusters between Samsung in Asan-Tangjung, South Korea, and Chimei in Tainan, Taiwan, we examine dynamic development processes and investigate how these rural areas have changed into high-tech clusters in only a decade's time. Specifically, this paper explores the preconditions and initiation characteristics of TFT-LCD clusters. It also compares some similarities and differences between two East Asian TFT-LCD clusters and investigates the uniqueness of other global clusters. Therefore, this paper enhances our understanding of the dynamics of industrial clusters, adds a comparative perspective on cluster analysis, and suggests policy implications from the case study of cluster formation in South Korea and Taiwan.","[Yun, Jin-Hyo Joseph] Jinju Natl Univ, Grad Sch Entrepreneurship, Jinju 660758, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea; [Park, Sangmoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Chunchon 200701, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Lim, Dong-Wook] Chungju Natl Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Chungju City 380702, Chungchungbuk D, South Korea; [Hahm, Sung Deuk] Korea Univ, Coll Polit Sci & Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Korea University,"Yun, JHJ (通讯作者)，Jinju Natl Univ, Grad Sch Entrepreneurship, 150 Chilamdong, Jinju 660758, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea.",jhyun@jinju.ac.kr; venture@kangwon.ac.kr; ydw@cjnu.ac.kr; hahm33@hotmail.com,"Yun, JinHyo Joseph/AAL-3521-2020","Yun, JinHyo Joseph/0000-0003-2690-3550",,,,,41,6,7,0,17,KOREAN SOC INNOVATION MANAGEMENT & ECON-KOSIME,DONGJAK-GU,"26TH FL SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION CTR SHINDAEBANG-DONG, 395-70, DONGJAK-GU, SEOUL 156-714, SOUTH KOREA",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Using burglary as a proxy variable for looting, we discovered that the burglary rates in the month before and the month after Katrina were significantly higher than those before and after the other two hurricanes. We then investigated the socioeconomic conditions in the city in an effort to explain these numbers. Population loss and high unemployment rates, coupled with a decline in high-paying manufacturing jobs and an increase in low-wage food and hotel service jobs generated severe economic inequality in the city that exacerbated the situation created by Katrina. Our current analysis of the impact of public school desegregation and the oil bust suggests that both events contributed to population loss and the increase in low-wage jobs prior to the storm. We believe that this type of research can assist in the recovery of New Orleans by providing an understanding of the city's pre-Katrina social and economic conditions and make clearer which post-Katrina changes are desirable.","[Harper, Dee Wood, Jr.] Loyola Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Frailing, Kelly] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",Loyola University New Orleans; University of Cambridge,"Frailing, K (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Box 303, Cambridge CB2 1ST, England.",kf277@cam.ac.uk; harper@loyno.edu,,,,,,,31,8,9,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This consists of a new adaptive importance sampling method for the Quick Evaluation of Risk using Mixture of t approximations (QERMit). As a first step, the optimal importance density is approximated, after which multi-step 'high loss' scenarios are efficiently generated. Numerical standard errors are compared in simple illustrations and in an empirical GARCH model with Student-t errors for daily S&P 500 returns. The results indicate that the proposed QERMit approach outperforms alternative approaches, in the sense that it produces more accurate VaR and ES estimates given the same amount of computing time, or, equivalently, that it requires less computing time for the same numerical accuracy.

Returns to education vary significantly by source-country, e.g., high for immigrants from Kuwait, low for Yemeni immigrants. Returns are related to economic development in the source-country and to pupil/teacher ratios.

Some Experimental Evidence,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROPERTY-RIGHTS; HOLDUP,"Production requiring licensing groups of complementary patents implements a coordination game among patent holders, who can price patents by choosing among combinations of fixed and royalty fees. Summed across patents, these fees become the total producer cost of the package of patents. Royalties, because they function as excise taxes, add to marginal costs, resulting in higher prices and reduced quantities of the downstream product and lower payoffs to the patent holders. Using fixed fees eliminates this inefficiency but yields a more complex coordination game in which there are multiple equilibria, which are very fragile in that small mistakes can lead the downstream firm to not license the technology, resulting in inefficient outcomes. We report on a laboratory market investigation of the efficiency effects of coordinated pricing of patents in a patent pool. We find that pool-like pricing agreements can yield fewer coordination failures in the pricing of complementary patents.","[Santore, Rudy] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [McKee, Michael] Appalachian State Univ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Bjornstad, David] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Santore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",,,,,,,,28,7,9,0,28,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Second, the net expected gains of a political ruler from granting binary choice to the reviewing judiciary rather than open choice. Third, the equilibrium degree of policy review power granted to the judiciary.

Our paper contributes to an understanding of regional determinants of female labour supply by looking at Austria's 121 political districts. As predicted by theory, the aggregate wage level has a positive impact on female LFPRs. We also find that a decrease in the gender wage gap increases the female participation ratio. Population density is positively associated with the female participation rate. This indicates that densely populated areas provide a larger and better array of employment opportunities for female workers Furthermore, child-care provision for young children is significant and positive. Our model, based on a reduced-form equation, is tested for robustness using various specifications and extended with a spatial econometrics approach. We find that estimated relationships between traditional regional labour supply determinants are sensitive to the inclusion of spatial effects.

In the heady and chaotic period since the end of Suharto's regime in the late 1990s, there has been an explosion of programmes aimed at early childhood in response to transnational initiatives that suggest a new global child. Local women as wives and mothers are once again involved in the delivery of these programmes. Based on fieldwork in Yogyakarta, Java, this article considers stabilities and changes in non-governmental governance of families in Indonesia in the context of the democratization. New early childhood programmes illustrate forms of transnational governance, including corporate day care and international regimes of expertise on children. Yet, the re-purposing of New Order forms of governmentality now in neo-liberal forms suggests great continuity in forms of rule through the family in Indonesia, even in the era of democratic reform.","Univ Lethbridge, Dept Anthropol, Lethbridge, AB T1J 2Z3, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Newberry, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Anthropol, 4401 Univ Dr, Lethbridge, AB T1J 2Z3, Canada.",jan.newberry@uleth.ca,,,,,,,54,28,30,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Drawing upon long-standing concerns about the relatively marginal location of finance in economic geography, we emphasize the integral role of finance in connecting the entangled geographies of the economic to the social, the cultural, and the political. In the wake of various turns in the discipline, we develop this integrationist approach to finance in ways that retain political economies of states, markets, and social power in our interpretations of geographically uneven development. In this article, we discuss the plural nature of emergent work on financialization and develop three analytical themes to shape our discussion of financialization. Next, we elaborate our analytical approach by warning against functional, political, and spatial disconnections traced in the literature on the geographies of money. We then explore how financialization is broadening and deepening the array of agents, relations, and sites that require consideration in economic geography and is generating tensions between territorial and relational spatialities of geographic differentiation. Finally, we address the relative dearth of empirical work by examining the financialization of brands that have shaped the evolution of the brewing business and the development of new derivative instruments to hedge against weather risks. We conclude by arguing that our analysis of financialization demonstrates how finance occupies an integral position within economic geographies and reveals some of the sociospatial relations, constructions, and reach of existing and new actors, relations, and sites in shaping the uneven development of financialized contemporary capitalism.","[Pike, Andy; Pollard, Jane] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Pike, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",andy.pike@ncl.ac.uk; j.s.pollard@ncl.ac.uk,"Pollard, Jane S/B-4966-2014","Pike, Andy/0000-0001-7651-2983; Pollard, Jane/0000-0002-3659-7473",,,,,106,299,340,3,194,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Does more self-employment automatically lead to the development of entrepreneurship? What conditions need to be met that more self-employment means also more entrepreneurship? We address the above dilemma by studying entrepreneurship in Kosovo. Kosovo is particularly suitable for such analysis because of undeveloped infrastructure, weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework, poorly developed financial system and high unemployment rates. As a result, Kosovo is lacking in economic momentum, particularly the joint dynamic activity of firms in different industries. This is reflected in very limited occupational choice. The main contribution of the paper is that in case of very limited occupational choice, a decision for self-employment does not lead necessarily to the development of entrepreneurship. As such, self-employment in less developed transitional countries can less likely serve as a base for the development of entrepreneurship. Therefore it is apparent that the role of government is to foster the introduction of more occupational choices by providing the opportunity (support) to gain employment in large, medium or growing small companies.","[Prasnikar, Janez; Koman, Matjaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Prasnikar, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",janez.prasnikar@ef.uni-lj.si; matjaz.koman@ef.uni-lj.si; gazmendqorraj@yahoo.com,,,,,,,28,3,4,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.
