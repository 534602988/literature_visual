Stat., 2003]. We claim that the tests used by Yilmaz are not the most convenient to test the martingale hypothesis (or the equivalent martingale difference of the returns); hence, we compute a recently proposed test by Kuan and Lee [Stud. in Nonlin. Dyn. and Econ., 2004] and compare our results to Yilmaz's. Striking differences arise, which can give a clue about the type of data generating process governing the evolution of exchange rates in each sub-period.","[Belaire-Franch, Jorge; Contreras, Dulce] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Belaire-Franch, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Our formalization gives a new perspective on his political theory. Moreover, we obtain quantitative results on political deliberation under Rawlsian rules. Finally, we elaborate two arguments in favor of Rawlsian deliberation: first, deliberation is epistemically valuable when, all other things being equal, it tends to favor the better view, because in this case, deliberators settle on the better view with high probability. Second, results suggest that when citizens deliberate within the limits of Rawlsian public reason, they can reach unanimity faster than when they deliberate outside these limits.","Ecole Normale Super, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Benhenda, M (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, F-75005 Paris, France.",mostaphabenhenda@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,1,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2011,36.0,1,,,,,121.0,178,,10.1007/s00355-010-0469-2,0.0,,,58,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,695JA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285365200008,0

Each construct was engineered under control of a double CaMV 35S promoter and the AMV enchancer sequence in the binary plasmid pBI121. Constructs were transferred into A. tumefaciens strain AGL0 and used to transform banana ECS. Plantlets that survived antibiotic selection were acclimated to greenhouse conditions and challenged with viruliferous banana aphids (Pentalonia nigronervosa). Ten adult or late instar aphids were allowed to feed for 2-4 weeks on test plants. All test plants were kept in the greenhouse and monitored for symptom expression for a period of 6 months. Control plants transformed with empty vector pBI121 only were included in all tests. A total of 270 test plants and 63 control plants were screened for BBTV resistance using this approach. One of 32 test plants transformed with the M1 (mutant Rep gene) construct, 5 of 74 test plants transformed with the AS1 (antisense Rep gene) construct, 5 of 38 test plants transformed with the PR1 (partial Rep gene) construct, and 10 of 126 test plants transformed with the R/PR1 (full-length Rep gene fused to antisepses partial Rep gene) construct were found to be resistant to BBTV challenge and showed no bunchy top symptoms. All of the control plants became infected with BBTV under these experimental conditions. Plants that survived BBTV challenge were analysed by quantitative PCR (per) and Southern hybridisations to determine the number of transgenes that were present in their genomes. Results from these analyses indicated that the resistant plants contained from 2 to more than 9 copies of the NPTII (kanamycin resistance) transgene carried on the pBI121 plasmid.","[Borth, W.; Perez, E.; Cheah, K.; Chen, Y.; Xie, W.

Evidence from the United States Colored Troops during the Civil War,ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Antebellum Puzzle; United States; Colored troops; Heights; Civil War,PHYSICAL STATURE; SHRINKING; HEIGHT,"The Antebellum Puzzle has been the subject of comment since the 1980s. It involves the paradox that, although the American economy was experiencing rapid economic growth in the several decades prior to the Civil War (1861-1865), the stature of native-born white males had been declining for the birth cohorts from the late 1820s. This was also true for free blacks (Komlos, 1992), but was apparently not true for slaves. This paper uses a sample of 8592 adult back males who were recruits to the United States Colored Troops during the Civil War. They were recruited significantly among ex-slaves. Recruits from the birth cohorts of 1838-1842 were then linked to characteristics of their counties of birth from the 1840 and 1850 U.S. Censuses. Unlike slaves in the coastal manifests, these African American recruits showed evidence of a decline in heights from the birth cohorts of the 1820s onwards. Unlike the native-white recruits, however, the characteristics of their counties of birth had relatively less power in explaining differences in heights. There was some support for the mortality hypothesis, but the nutrition hypothesis needs to be interpreted in light of the fact that slave owners has a strong interest in monitoring and controlling the diet of their slaves.

We first document the evolution of macroeconomic interdependence for emerging East Asian economies through changing trade and financial linkages at both the regional and global levels. Then, by employing a panel vector autoregression (VAR) model, we estimate the degree of real economic interdependence before and after the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. Empirical findings show that real economic interdependence increased significantly in the post-crisis period, suggesting 'recoupling', rather than decoupling, in recent years. Output shocks from major industrial countries have a significant positive effect on emerging East Asian economies. More interestingly, the reverse is also true. Output shocks from emerging East Asia (and China) have a significant positive effect on output in major industrial countries. The result suggests that macroeconomic interdependence between emerging East Asia and industrial countries have become 'bi-directional', defying the traditional notion of the 'North-South relationship' as one of 'uni-directional' dependence.","[Kim, Soyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Lee, Jong-Wha; Park, Cyn-Young] Asian Dev Bank, Off Reg Econ Integrat, Manila, Philippines",Seoul National University (SNU); Asian Development Bank,"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016; Park, Cyn-Young/E-7489-2015","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961; Kim, Soyoung/0000-0003-3612-1691; Park, Cyn-Young/0000-0002-9634-219X",,,,,31,45,48,0,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2011,34.0,1,,,,,23.0,53,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01280.x,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,708YX,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286401300002,0

Two well-known hypotheses are reexamined: the leverage effect and the volatility feedback effect hypotheses. An analysis of the five-minute data of the S&P500 index reveals two distinct characteristics of the high frequency data. First, the sign of the relationship between the smallest wavelet scale components for return and volatility appears to be different from those between other scale components. Second, it was found that long memory exists in the daily realized volatility. These characteristics are incorporated in the test for the return-volatility relationship of the S&P500 index. In the study of the impact of changes in volatility on returns, we find that the leverage effect does not appear in intraday data, in contrast to the results for daily data. The difference can be attributed to the different relationships between scale components. By applying wavelet multiresolution analysis, it becomes clear that the leverage effect holds true between return and volatility components with scales equal to or larger than twenty minutes. However, these relationships are obscured in a five-minute data analysis because the smallest scale component accounts for a dominant portion of the variation of return. In testing the volatility feedback hypothesis, a modified model was used to incorporate apparent long memory in the daily realized volatility. This makes both sides of the test model balanced in integration order. No evidence of a volatility feedback effect was found under these stipulations. The results of this study reinforce the horizon dependency of the relationships. Hence, investors should be mindful of the different risk-return relationships for each horizon of interest. Additionally, the results show that the introduction of the long memory property to the proposed model is critical in the testing of risk-return relationships.","[Lee, Jihyun] Korea Dev Bank, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Tong S.; Lee, Hoe Kyung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Taejon, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Korea Dev Bank, Seoul, South Korea.",jihyunlee@kdb.co.kr; tskim@business.kaist.ac.kr; hklee@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Tong Suk/C-1598-2011; Lee, Hoe Kyung/C-1934-2011",,,,,,42,8,8,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We use manufacturing establishment level data and exploit the intersectoral variation in the effective rates of assistance (ERA) to see how businesses adjusted to trade liberalisation during the period. We find the documented productivity gains to be mostly accounted for by the reduction in x-inefficiency through employment shedding in industries experiencing a high degree of trade liberalisation. We find little evidence that the exit of inefficient establishments in highly liberalised industries contributes to productivity gains. In fact, we find that the more productive establishments are more likely to exit, perhaps reflecting product switching by these businesses to make more profitable use of inputs. Similarly, there does not appear to be a strong relationship between the extent of trade liberalisation and output adjustments. However, we do find indicative evidence of an overall productivity-enhancing effect through economies of scale. These findings suggest that, at least for the case of Australia, the ease of making employment adjustments can be crucial for policies such as trade liberalisation to have the desired effect. In addition, trade liberalisation may provide incentives for domestic producers to seek more profitable use of their inputs and to move further downward along their cost curves. We think further studies assessing the productivity gains from product switching and economies of scale effects in both liberalised and non-liberalised industries and focusing on the interplay between labour market policy and firm adjustments would be valuable.","[Palangkaraya, Alfons; Yong, Jongsay] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Palangkaraya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"; Palangkaraya, Alfons/H-8741-2015","Yong, Jongsay/0000-0001-6866-1954; Palangkaraya, Alfons/0000-0002-4167-5050",,,,,41,3,3,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2011,34.0,1,,,,,1.0,22,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01274.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,708YX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286401300001,0

Islamic finance and the global financial order,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Islamic finance; financial regulation; Sharia compliance; legitimacy; global finance,BANKING,"Islamic finance is a fast growing segment of international financial markets. Deriving its core principles from the Quran and the Sharia, the objective of Islamic finance is to install a more equitable financial and economic order that at the same time is transaction-friendly. Thus, Islam could be seen as a foundation for the inclusion of the ethical and moral dimensions of economics and markets. This coincides with rising demand for Islamic financial products. Indeed, recent years have witnessed increasing efforts to develop and to institutionalise Islamic capital markets and above all, to make Islamic finance acceptable (and thus investable) to the mainstream. In this article, I use the question of legitimacy to explore whether Islamic finance offers an alternative to the existing international financial order. To this end, I take a closer look at the knowledge base from which Islamic financial products are constructed and assessed as well as the emerging international regulatory framework for Islamic financial markets. I conclude that efforts to expand the social constituency of Islamic finance to the transnational sphere of global finance are overly focused on its epistemic legitimation as normal financial activity. As a consequence, the currently emerging power, knowledge and governance structures for Islamic finance tend to emulate, and therefore largely reproduce, the existing global financial order.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Rethel, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,"Rethel, Lena/G-9574-2011","Rethel, Lena/0000-0002-7396-2054",,,,,50,51,56,2,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

After assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a number of these different existing approaches in the comparative literature, it argues that the eruption of civil war in Tajikistan and its absence in Uzbekistan can be explained by adapting ideas from bargaining theories of war that have been developed in the literature on international relations. It argues that it is important to study the adversaries' perceptions of power in relation to the actions that led to the civil war and how the perceptions of the distribution of power are influenced by structural, process and network-related variables. Consistent with bargaining theories of war, a disparity between the distribution of power and distribution of benefits seems an important factor in the eruption of civil war in Tajikistan.","Marmara Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University,"Tunçer-Kilavuz, I (通讯作者)，Marmara Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.",idiltuncer@marmara.edu.tr,,,,,,,70,16,20,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2011,63.0,2,,,,,263.0,290,,10.1080/09668136.2011.547698,0.0,,,28,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,734XF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288374700004,0

The results show that German temporarily employed entrants suffer from higher initial wage penalties and risks of temporary employment cycles but that all differences compared to entrants with permanent contracts diminish after five years. The integration scenario works more effectively in the UK, where disadvantages are less pronounced and employment losses are primarily related to further education. Moreover, these tendencies vary by education groups and gender. Disadvantages of initial temporary employment are weaker for women in Germany, while gender differences in the UK apparently have less impact. Across borders, temporary contracts are associated with greater initial but vanishing wage penalties and temporary employment cycles for tertiary graduates.","Univ Mannheim, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Gebel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, A5,6, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",mgebel@mail.uni-mannheim.de,"Gebel, Michael/JAZ-0674-2023; Gebel, Michael/L-1148-2015; Gebel, Michael/JPA-5999-2023","Gebel, Michael/0000-0002-8557-7508; Gebel, Michael/0000-0002-8557-7508; Gebel, Michael/0000-0002-8557-7508",,,,,33,85,88,0,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Indeed the disparaging term 'McJob' has come to describe low-skill, low-pay, dead-end, routine service industry employment in general. In contrast, there is employer-oriented literature that portrays fast-food jobs more positively and even presents them as beneficial for the workforce. This study analyses survey data from a sample of Australian McDonald's outlets to determine employee and employer experiences and attitudes towards these so-called McJobs. Findings indicate that employees view their jobs as consisting of repeatedly doing a limited range of non-complex tasks whereas managers perceive aspects of the job more positively. Evidence is presented that fast-food jobs offer human resource advantages, potential career opportunities and, for some, desirable forms of work organisation. These findings suggest that the current, dominant portrayal of McJobs is inaccurate, with the reality more nuanced.","Univ Laval, Dept Relat Ind, Fac Social Sci, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Gould, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Relat Ind, Fac Social Sci, Pavillon J-A De Seve 1025 Ave Sci Humaines,Local, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Anthony.Gould@rlt.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,25,19,22,2,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

After a given initial wage claim, the rules of the system force the firm either to accept it or to make a counteroffer prior to a fixed and short deadline. In this context, signaling models predict that the wage claim should try to screen the firm's level of profitability, while the (most likely forced) offer is expected to reveal little information. Both hypotheses are tested and neither one is rejected. The analysis of the fraction of the disputed wages the workers get after initial disagreement, as well as the length of the negotiation period, provide further evidence in favor of signaling models, since we find they are related to both observed and private information. Moreover, conditional on covariates, for a number of sectors, we cannot reject that the parties split the difference between both initial offers.

Given that the city state has been recognized as one of the most open economies in the world, this study explores the causality relationships between tourism and openness to trade, using aggregated variables total visitor arrivals and data on trade components (merchandise and services) and their respective disaggregated data by country for each of Singapore's top five trading partners Malaysia, China, the USA, Japan and South Korea. The study shows bidirectional causality between international visitor arrivals in Singapore and openness to merchandise trade. However, the causality pattern varies among Singapore's major trading partners if country-level data are used. The overall findings imply that further trade liberalization with Singapore's major trading partners may not necessarily encourage visitor arrivals from those countries, but can be seen as an important catalyst for the growth and development of the tourism sector. Conversely, an increase in tourism activities could also encourage the host country to open itself to more international trade. Furthermore, it is imperative to liberalize the service sector in Singapore to facilitate greater openness in merchandise trade, given that a large proportion of services constitutes the goods trade.","[Wong, Koi Nyen; Tang, Tuck Cheong] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Wong, KN (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Sunway Campus, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",tang.tuck.cheong@buseco.monash.edu.my,"Tang, Tuck Cheong/H-6636-2014; Wong, Koi Nyen/C-5711-2014","Tang, Tuck Cheong/0000-0001-7978-0684; Wong, Koi Nyen/0000-0001-9767-712X",,,,,30,18,20,6,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, we instrument neighborhood type by spouse's workplace and gender of the children in the household. Second, we use the methodology proposed by Altonji et al. (2005), which in our case consists of hypothesizing about the correlation between the unobservables that determine unemployment and the unobservables that influence selection into neighborhood types. Our results show that the effect of neighborhood deprivation is not significantly different from zero in the bivariate probit with exclusion restrictions. We show also that correlation among the unobservables as low as 6% of the correlation of observables is sufficient to explain the positive neighborhood effect observed when endogeneity is not taken into account.

Slowing growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) will be necessary for reducing transportation GHG emissions, even with major breakthroughs in vehicle technologies and low-carbon fuels (Winkelman et al., 2009). The Center for Clean Air Policy (CCAP) supports market-based policy approaches that minimize costs and maximize benefits. Our research indicates that significant GHG reductions can be achieved through smart growth and travel efficiency measures that increase accessibility, improve travel choices and make optimum use of existing infrastructure. Moreover, we find such measures can deliver compelling economic benefits, including avoided infrastructure costs, leveraged private investment, increased local tax revenues and consumer vehicle ownership and operating cost savings (Winkelman et al., 2009). As a society, what we build - where and how - has a tremendous impact on our carbon footprint, from building design to transportation infrastructure and land-use patterns. The empirical and modeling evidence is clear - people drive less in locations with efficient land use patterns, high quality travel choices and reinforcing policies and incentives (Ewing et al., 2008). It is also clear that there is growing and unmet market demand for walkable communities, reinforced by demographic shifts and higher fuel prices (Leinberger, 2006; Nelson, 2007). Transportation policy in the United States must rise to meet this demand for more travel choices and more livable communities. The academic, ideological and political debates about the level of GHG reductions and penetration rates that can or should be achieved via smart growth and pricing on the one hand, or measures such as 'eco-driving' and signal optimization on the other, have served their purpose: we know which policies are 'directionally correct' - policies that reduce GHG emissions even though we may not know the scope of those reductions. Now is the time to implement directionally correct policies, assess what works best where, and refine policy based on the results. It is a framework that CCAP calls Do. Measure. Learn. The Federal government is poised to spend 5500 billion on transportation (Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 2009). CCAP encourages Congress to Ask the Climate Question - will our transportation investments help reduce GHG emissions or exacerbate the problem? Will they help increase our resilience to climate change impacts or increase our vulnerability? And, while we're at it, will our investment foster energy security, livable communities and a vibrant economy? Federal transportation and climate policies should empower communities to implement locally-determined travel efficiency solutions by providing appropriate funding, tools and technical support.

By granting the monetary value of in-kind services in cash, personal budgets are considered to enable customized home care arrangements, thereby avoiding costly nursing home care and thus saving LTCI spending. However, personal budgets also compete with the already existing and less generous cash option of the LTC. Any transition from the receipt of cash benefits to personal budgets thus challenges the view of personal budgets as a cost savings device, unless personal budgets sufficiently reduce the use of costly nursing home care to balance these extra costs. This paper therefore contrasts the short-term costs of implementing personal budgets with potential cost savings if personal budgets enhance the stability of home care and avoid costly nursing home care. For this purpose, the paper investigates the effects of personal budgets on the duration of home care until moving to a nursing home as well as the perceived stability of home care. Despite a positive effect of personal budgets on the stability of home care, LTCI spending is likely to increase in the short to medium run. In the long run, however, the expected transition to decreasing numbers of cash recipients favors the introduction of personal budgets.","[Arntz, Melanie] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, D-168161 Mannheim, Germany; [Arntz, Melanie] Univ Heidelberg, D-6900 Heidelberg, Germany; [Thomsen, Stephan L.] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Lab Econ, Dept Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Thomsen, Stephan L.] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Otto von Guericke University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Arntz, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, L7, D-168161 Mannheim, Germany.",arntz@zew.de; stephan.thomsen@ovgu.de,"Thomsen, Stephan/AAF-3588-2019","Thomsen, Stephan/0000-0002-9677-9199",,,,,37,1,1,0,9,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Economic growth and living standards in the sixteenth-century Low Countries: the case of 's-Hertogenbosch (1500-1560),EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GREAT DIVERGENCE; EUROPE; ENGLAND; WAGES,"Economic historians are increasingly aware of the divergence between the development of real wages and GDP per capita in pre-industrial Europe, even in affluent urbanized societies with high wage levels such as the sixteenth-century Low Countries. This article offers an empirical answer to this alleged paradox by merging living standards and real wages with income distributions in a case study of sixteenth-century 's-Hertogenbosch. It provides evidence for an optimistic reading of the living standards of this era despite the modest performance of the urban economy and a strong decline in real wages. The rich sources of 's-Hertogenbosch were instrumental in reaching this conclusion, as they offer proof that the drop in wage labourers' purchasing power was paralleled by a marked decline in social position. As such, their income experience turns out to be surprisingly atypical, and does little to capture the strong resilience of the majority of the urban populace in the face of the early price revolution.","[Blonde, Bruno] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Flanders, Belgium; Res Fdn, Flanders, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Blondé, B (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Flanders, Belgium.",Bruno.Blonde@ua.ac.be; Jord.Hanus@ua.ac.be,"Hanus, Jord/N-3806-2019","Hanus, Jord/0000-0002-0905-9864; Blonde, Bruno/0000-0002-2118-799X",,,,,68,12,12,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We first introduce a model of trade that combines a noncompetitive wage-setting mechanism due to unions with a factor abundance hypothesis. The predictions of the model are then econometrically investigated using Argentine data. Instead of achieving identification by comparing industrial wages before and after one episode of trade liberalization, our strategy exploits the recent historical record of policy changes adopted by Argentina: from significant protection in the early 1970s, to the first episode of liberalization during the late 1970s, then back to a slowdown of reforms during the 1980s, and finally to the second episode of liberalization in the 1990s. These swings in trade policy represent broken trends in trade reforms that we can compare with observed trends in wages and wage inequality. We use unusual historical data sets of trends in tariffs, wages, and wage inequality to examine the structure of wages in Argentina and explore how it is affected by tariff reforms. We find that trade liberalization, ceteris paribus, reduces wages; industry tariffs reduce the industry skill premium; and conditional on the structure of tariffs at the industry level, the average tariff in the economy is positively associated with the aggregate skill premium. These findings suggest that the observed trends in wage inequality in Latin America can be reconciled with the Stolper-Samuelson predictions in a model with unions.","[Galiani, Sebastian] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Galiani, S (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,,36,18,21,1,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Despite its importance, the literature on the economic effects of transit service contracting has been limited to only a few studies since the mid-1990s, and is inconclusive due to problems with the nature and methodology of the past studies. This paper examines how the cost efficiency of providing fixed-route bus transit service varies by the degree of contracting. I make several improvements to previous studies and conduct a regression analysis that: (1) addresses the endogeneity problem between the contracting decision and cost efficiency, (2) differentiates between agencies that contract out only a portion of service from those that contract out all service, (3) takes into account the moderating effects of several factors on the effect of contracting on cost efficiency, and (4) uses a relatively larger set of cross-sectional time-series data constructed from the National Transit Database from 1992 to 2000. The analysis results show that the combined effects of contracting lower operating costs by $4.09 and $2.89 per vehicle hour for partial and full-contracting agencies, respectively, in the average case. These average cost savings translate into 7.8% and 5.5%, using the average operating cost per vehicle hour of $53.06. However, this improvement is not universal, because the effects of contracting on cost efficiency vary by factors such as peak-to-base ratio, agency size, the wage gap between bus operators in the public and private sectors, and agency type.

This paper offers a sectoral analysis of these trends. Comparative India/UK labour productivity in agriculture has declined continuously, and agriculture still accounts for around two-thirds of employment in India. Agriculture thus played a key role in India's falling behind and has subsequently slowed down the process of catching up. Although there have been substantial fluctuations in comparative India/UK labour productivity in industry, this sector has exhibited no long run trend. The only sector to exhibit an upward trend in comparative India/UK labour productivity is services. India's recent emergence as a dynamic service-led economy thus appears to have long historical roots. Although India has been characterised by relatively low levels of physical and human capital formation overall, its education provision has historically been unusually skewed towards secondary and tertiary levels. This has provided a limited supply of high productivity workers who have been employed predominantly in services. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

More specifically, incentives have been granted to young people in the European countryside in order for them to remain in rural areas and improve their income. The aim of the aid Programmes for young farmers is, on the one hand, to renew the age composition of the rural population and, on the other, to improve the structure of their farms. In this way, the issue of the ageing rural population is addressed, while simultaneously exploiting the new labour resources for agriculture, thus providing an impetus for the improvement of its entrepreneurial and competitive profile. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the aid Programmes for Young Farmers and, more specifically, the First Measure of the Third Axis of the Operational Programme Rural Development Regeneration of the Countryside 2000-2006, based on improvements to the level of viability. The methodology used in this case is the Categorical Regression. At first, improvements to the viability level of a sample of farms that were included in the Regional Operational Programmes of the Region of Central Macedonia are checked. On a second level, an analysis evaluation is made on how the effect of the basic socio-economic parameters may have changed, in formulating the final economic viability level of the farms, after the completion of their Investment Plans (future status). The results show that the orientation of the farms, after the implementation of the financing Programme, is towards exploiting the comparative advantages of the various regions by making use of suitable crops.","[Aggelopoulos, Stamatis] Alexander Technol Inst Thessaloniki, Dept Farm Management, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Arabatzis, Garyfallos] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Forestry & Management Environm & Nat Resourc, Komotini, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Aggelopoulos, S (通讯作者)，Alexander Technol Inst Thessaloniki, Dept Farm Management, Thessaloniki, Greece.",,,,,,,,37,20,21,0,13,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2010,9.0,2,,,,,50.0,55,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,636RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280755800008,0

The first one is the interrelation between Arrow's (Social choice and individual values, Wiley, New York, 1951) social choice model and the mathematical theory of democracy discussed by Tangian (Aggregation and representation of preferences, Springer, Berlin, 1991; Soc Choice Welf 11(1):1-82, 1994), with the conclusion that Arrow's dictators are less harmful than commonly supposed. The second finding is Quesada's (Public Choice 130:395-400, 2007) estimate of their power as that of two voters, implying that Arrow's dictators are not more powerful than a chairperson with an additional vote. The third is the model of Athenian democracy (Tangian, Soc Choice Welf 31:537-572, 2008), where indicators of popularity and universality are applied to representatives and representative bodies. In this article, these indicators are used to computationally evaluate the representativeness/non-representativeness of Arrow's dictators. In particular, it is shown that there always exist Arrow's dictators who on the average share opinions of a majority, being rather representatives. The same holds for dictators selected by lot, which conforms to the practice of selecting magistrates and presidents by lot in ancient democracies and medieval Italian republics. Computational formulas are derived for finding the optimal dictator-representatives.","WSI Hans Bockler Stiftung, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Tangian, A (通讯作者)，WSI Hans Bockler Stiftung, Hans Bockler Str 39, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany.",andranik-tangian@boeckler.de,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2010,35.0,1,,,,,129.0,161,,10.1007/s00355-009-0433-1,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,597WY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277794300008,0

Commitment provides a motive to reduce consumption when possible future losses are too small to warrant adjustment but not when losses are large enough that adjustment would be worthwhile. This implies conditions under which mean-preserving increases in risk can increase housing consumption. Our empirical evidence exploits the interaction of these conditions with a novel proxy for unemployment risk: couples sharing an occupation.

Three sectors are included: a theme park, hotel and accommodation providers and tour operators. The different sectors are coordinated with each other, while enterprises within each compete in order to optimize their own objectives. This research studies the impacts of competitive and cooperative relationships between the enterprises on the dynamics of the TSC under quantity competition. Simultaneous non-cooperative games are Used to model the competitive quantity decisions between enterprises in the same sector. A sequential game is established between the three sectors to coordinate tourist numbers. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the dynamics of the supply chain in terms of several operating parameters, such as operating costs, sector size and product differentiation. Among the key findings are that member enterprises in one sector can benefit from intensified competition in a complementary sector in the same layer and that the upstream enterprises in the tourism supply chain prefer package holiday product differentiation strategies.","[Huang, George Q.; Chen, Wanli] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wanli] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Song, Haiyan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xinyan] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Profess Educ & Execut Dev, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Hong Kong,"Huang, GQ (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",gqhuang@hku.hk; hmsong@poly.edu.hk,"Song, Haiyan/ABE-6463-2020; Huang, George Q/O-9005-2018; Song, Haiyan/AAD-3283-2022; Huang, George Guo Quan/C-1880-2009","Song, Haiyan/0000-0001-6158-1222;",,,,,27,18,18,1,37,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The educational system has often been highlighted as the main source of over-education, whereas the role of the labour market has been neglected. Using European Community Household Panel data on three countries with similar systems of education but different levels of temporary employment, the association between job security and over-education is explored here. The results show that in quite segmented labour markets, where a permanent contract is an especially valuable asset, human capital might be traded off for job security. Over-education thus becomes paradoxically likelier among permanent workers than among temporary ones.","Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Ortiz, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",luis.ortiz@upf.edu,"Ortiz-Gervasi, Luis/G-1480-2014","Ortiz-Gervasi, Luis/0000-0002-4793-6901",,,,,48,49,55,1,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Conversely, social movement scholars usually consider power embedded in disruption, organisational networks, resources, or political opportunities. Although many labour scholars promote 'social movement unionism' to reverse labour's decline, they have largely failed to adopt a thoroughgoing social movement perspective. A sign of this is that union density remains the sacrosanct indicator of organised labour's success and power. I argue that this density bias has significant analytical implications, leading observers to overlook non-market sources of movement power, to reduce a heterogeneous movement to a single organisational form, and to oversimplify the complex processes of movement organizing. I contend that treating labour explicitly as a social movement rather than implicitly as an agent in a market will open new lines of inquiry that may strengthen analyses of labour's prospects for renewal.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Sullivan, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Campus Box 4660, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",sullivan@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,58,28,29,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We examine the location choices of 2,884 firms investing in China between 1993 and 1996 to offer two main contributions. First, we find that the location of labor-intensive activities is highly elastic to provincial wage differences. Generally, investors' wage sensitivity declines as the skill intensity of the industry increases. Second, we find that unobserved location-specific attributes exert a downward bias on estimated wage sensitivity. Using a control function approach, we estimate a downward bias of 50% to 90% in wage coefficients estimated with standard techniques.","[Liu, Xuepeng] Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA; [Lovely, Mary E.; Ondrich, Jan] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University; Syracuse University,"Liu, XP (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",,,,,,,,39,34,40,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Measures derived using the generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) overperform other measures over the monetary policy horizon and are leading indicators of headline inflation. Trimmed means, although weaker than GDFM indicators, have good forecasting performance, while indicators by permanent exclusion underperform but provide useful information about short-term dynamics. The forecasting performance of theoretically-founded models that relate monetary aggregates, the output gap, and inflation improves with the time horizon but generally falls short of that of the GDFM.

Confronting climate risk in agriculture, different farming bodies have shown different farm and off-farm/non-farm adaptations in pre-risk, during risk and post-risk, which has reduced their short-term vulnerability.

Nevertheless, existing measures have been criticized, especially because of their dependence on the unrealistic assumption that different coalitions have equal probabilities. In this paper we show that the classical problem of measuring voting power can be naturally embedded in information theory. This perspective on voting power allows us to extend measures of voting power to cases in which there are dependencies among voters. In doing so, we distinguish between two different notions of a given voter's power-'control' and 'informativeness'aEurocorresponding, respectively, to the average uncertainty regarding the outcome of a vote that remains when all others have voted and the average uncertainty that is eliminated when only the given voter has voted. This distinction settles a number of well-known paradoxes and enables the study of voting power on the basis of actual political behavior at all levels.","[Diskin, Abraham; Koppel, Moshe] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Koppel, Moshe] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Bar Ilan University,"Diskin, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",abraham.diskin@huji.ac.il,,,,,,,54,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2010,34.0,1,,,,,105.0,119,,10.1007/s00355-009-0390-8,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,549JA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274043000005,0

This article considers the extent to which rights based approaches to migrant worker rights endorsed by both International Organisations and regional and local (Malaysian) nongovernmental organisations are sufficient in tackling the problems and issues faced by female migrants employed as domestic workers. The first part of the article critically engages with the dominant 'rights based approach to migration' endorsed, in particular, by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) suggesting that this approach fails to make a substantive commitment to gender justice, not least, because of the way in which domestic work remains a largely invisible and frequently unrecognised form of employment. The second part of the article draws upon data collected from key activist organizations engaged in struggles on behalf of migrant domestic workers in Malaysia. This discussion is situated within the broader context of debates over the role of economic rights within feminist understandings and critiques of human rights and 'rights based approaches'. Noting the dominance of the issue of violence against women (VAW) within feminist human rights discourse, I argue that whilst the VAW framework is a useful tool for understanding how and why women migrants may be vulnerable to abuse, it is perhaps not enough and there is a need to think more critically about how questions of women's economic status and 'rights' feature in discussions of the gendered and racialised nature of (care) work in the global economy.","Griffith Univ, Griffith Asia Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Elias, J (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Asia Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Elias, Juanita/AAY-2983-2020","Elias, Juanita/0000-0001-5184-4105",,,,,61,20,29,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

REVISITING THE HAYEK-SAMUELSON EXCHANGE OVER HAYEK'S ALLEGED 'INEVITABILITY' THESIS,HISTORY OF ECONOMIC IDEAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Much controversy exists over whether F. A. Hayek posited an inevitability thesis interventionist policy would supposedly mutate into full-blown command planning - in The Road to Serfdom. This paper argues that much of the confusion over Hayek's alleged inevitability thesis is generated by the particular tenor that different scholars impute to Hayek's frequent use of inevitability and similar phraseology. Drawing upon Hayek's early 1980's exchange with Paul Samuelson over Hayek's inevitability thesis, we provide evidence that suggests Hayek and Samuelson both understood Hayek to be positing a particular variant of the inevitability thesis: the thesis that dogged persistence with interventionist policy would ultimately lead to command planning.","[Farrant, Andrew; McPhail, Edward] Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA",Dickinson College,"Farrant, A (通讯作者)，Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",farrant@dickinson.edu; mcphail@dickinson.edu,,,,,,,32,1,1,1,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

It focuses on changing relations of social reproduction in two tourism communities in Central America - Placencia in Belize and Monteverde and Costa Rica. In contrast to the majority of literature on social reproduction, the starting point for this analysis is not the reprivatisation of social reproduction but rather an exploration of how actors in tourism communities in Central America negotiate the tensions between capitalist development and social reproduction in a context of minimal state provision. Drawing on extensive field research in these communities, I identify a gap in social reproduction generated by women's intensive and anti-social working conditions in the tourism industry combined with enduring attitudes that social reproduction remains the responsibility of women. The paper explores the responses to this gap, setting out two clear trends - the 'contracting out' of social reproduction and the construction of policies which aim to minimise the impact of tourism development on social reproduction. I argue that both of these responses represent privatised solutions to the social reproduction dilemma and urge continued support for progressive policy responses.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ferguson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/F034288/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F034288/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,35,37,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Estimates of the prevalence of stunting and underweight for children under age 5 in Cambodia from 17 Demographic and Health Survey strata are disaggregated into 1,594 communes by combining the Demographic and Health Survey data. The estimates are consistent with the survey-only estimates at the aggregate and primary sampling unit levels. The accuracy of the commune-level estimates is comparable to the survey-only estimates at the stratum level. The results are robust, and the estimates are useful for policy analysis and formulation.

Bentham examined the problems of constitutional choice with an economic method, answering the fundamental questions of the efficiency of decisional mechanisms and of the correspondence between the interests of the representatives and that of the represented. The paper studies two problems in particular: that of the optimal degree of representation, and that of the role of bribery in elections. The optimal dimension of parliaments is established as a function of the probability that decisions are taken and that these decisions are useful. Anti-bribery laws are criticised with the radical argument that being willing to pay signals a strong commitment to political activity. The paper argues both that Bentham's place in the early history of collective choice should be restated, and that no retrospective reading is necessary to this end, since Bentham's economic approach is entirely embedded in his utilitarian philosophy.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Guidi, MEL (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",mel.guidi@ec.unipi.it,,"Guidi, Marco Enrico Luigi/0000-0002-6214-3723",,,,,51,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

However, the changes the MDGs brought about have been mixed at best. Though there are some notable successes, the MDGs have failed to bring about a substantial shift towards tackling global poverty and have had only a weak impact on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Several reasons are put forward for this failure: the continuing lack of political concern with poverty; the lack of a social movement behind the MDGs; and the lack of a well formed epistemic community for the MDGs to tie into. However, this paper argues that it would be wrong to dismiss the MDGs as a complete failure. The MDG project should instead be seen in a long term context as having played a role in changing international values and contributed to the emergence of an international norm that sees poverty in an affluent world as being morally unacceptable.","[Hulme, David; Scott, James] Univ Manchester, Brooks World Poverty Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Hulme, David] Univ Manchester, Chron Poverty Res Ctr, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Hulme, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Brooks World Poverty Inst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",david.hulme@manchester.ac.uk; james.scott@manchester.ac.uk,,"Scott, James/0000-0003-3296-0375; Hulme, David/0000-0002-4111-1589",,,,,33,15,15,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In his notes, as far as the theory of value is concerned, Sraffa states that the delicate point is the analysis of the relation between the wage rate and the rate of profit when wages partecipate in the distribution of surplus. Sraffa establishes a bridge among the 'macro' conception of a given surplus to be divided between the different social classes and the 'micro' analysis of the prices of the different commodities by equalizing the value of the net product to the labour employed in its production. From this perspective Sraffa's analysis can be linked to the 'New Interpretation' approach to the transformation of values into prices of production.","Univ Macerata, Dept Econ Financial Inst, Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"Perri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dept Econ Financial Inst, Macerata, Italy.",perri@unimc.it,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

To identify the efficiency of the crop insurance, we use the nonparametric density function model and estimate the probability of yield loss rate at 3 proposed levels for grain crop, wheat, corn, rice and cotton respectively from 13 provinces in the Major Grain-Producing Area. Besides, we point out some unfavorable factors for crop insurance management based on the Second National Agricultural Census data (2006). Our finding is: the coverage level is on average no larger than 50% of the per hectare crop production value while the probability of yield loss for each crop approaches to zero if the proposed yield loss rate is larger than 40%, so the yield damage compensations are not necessary unless the huge catastrophes occur with the yield loss rate over 50%. Farmers could buy crop insurance to avoid big crop failure other than to maximize their returns. Therefore, the current crop insurance coverage level under normal years could not create an effective inducement for farmers to purchase insurance contracts. To expand crop insurance participation, we consider that it is necessary to carry out positive and conditional forced insurance, provide a larger portion of premium subsidy to the Major Grain-Producing Area by central government and improve the basic agricultural production conditions.

Matched employer-employee data from a sample of hotels and restaurants in Andalusia are used to this end. The data source includes information on 181 hotels and 121 restaurants. Impacts on the wage gap are obtained for two empirical specifications. In the first, equal returns of observable variables are assumed for men and women and, in the second, returns are assumed to be different for each gender. The authors find that industrial and vertical segregation - and to a lesser extent establishment segregation - increase the wage differential. However, horizontal and category segregation help to diminish this, although the impact of the latter is not very substantial. Regarding occupational segregation, women predominate in worst-paid jobs, but their wages drop less than men's earnings.

In this article, we develop a new measure of area affordability that characterizes the supply of housing that is affordable to different households in different locations of a metropolitan region. Key to our approach is the explicit recognition that the price/rent of a dwelling is affected by its location. Hence, we develop an affordability methodology that accounts for job accessibility, school quality and safety. This allows us to produce a menu of town-level indexes of adjusted housing affordability. The adjustments are based on obtaining implicit prices of these amenities from a hedonic price equation. We thus use data from a wide variety of sources to rank 141 towns in the greater Boston metropolitan area based on their adjusted affordability. Taking households earning 80% of area median income as an example, we find that consideration of town-level amenities leads to major changes relative to a typical assessment of affordability.","[Fisher, Lynn M.] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Ctr Real Estate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zabel, Jeffrey] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tufts University,"Fisher, LM (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Ctr Real Estate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lfisher@mit.edu; pollak@mit.edu; jeff.zabel@tufts.edu,,,,,,,21,65,68,5,39,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2009,37.0,4,,,,,705.0,746,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00261.x,0.0,,,42,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,542UU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273524800006,0

For international demand, another annual panel is used, comprising data on 24 countries of origin of tourists for the same period. The estimated elasticities suggest that both domestic and foreign tourism in Galicia are very sensitive to income in the origin markets and to prices. Other findings are the dependence of domestic tourism on its own past and the sensitivity of tourism to the celebration of the Holy Year.

The analysis reveals significant asymmetries with regard to tax effects: vertically integrated investments are more sensitive to host-country taxation than horizontal FDI; larger tax rate elasticities are estimated if business activities are considered highly mobile; and in accordance with profit-shifting considerations, subsidiaries of more internationalised companies are less tax responsive to host-country taxation.",,,,,"Overesch, Michael/AAZ-6573-2021","Overesch, Michael/0000-0002-1531-0357",,,,,35,22,25,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2009,32.0,12,,,,,1657.0,1684,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01174.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,530KP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272590300001,0

We provide a general analysis in a regional model of the class of bifurcations that have crossing equilibrium loci. including the tomahawk bifurcation, by examining arbitrary smooth parameter paths in a higher dimensional parameter space.

However, most exercises are restricted to comparing regions within a particular continental bloc or nation. This article introduces the World Knowledge Competitiveness Index (WKCI), which is one of the very few benchmarking exercises established to compare regions across continents. The article discusses the formulation of the WKCI and analyzes the results of the most recent editions. The results suggest that there are significant variations in the knowledge-based regional economic development models at work across the globe. Further analysis also indicates that Silicon Valley, as the highest ranked WKCI region, holds a unique economic position among the globe's leading regions. However, significant changes in the sources of regional competitiveness are evolving as a result of the emergence of new regional hot spots in Asia. It is concluded that benchmarking is imperative to the learning process of regional policy making.","[Huggins, Robert] Univ Wales Inst, Cardiff Sch Management, Ctr Int Competitiveness, Cardiff CF23 9XR, S Glam, Wales; [Izushi, Hiro] Aston Univ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Cardiff Metropolitan University; Aston University,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wales Inst, Cardiff Sch Management, Ctr Int Competitiveness, Colchester Ave, Cardiff CF23 9XR, S Glam, Wales.",rhuggins@uwic.ac.uk,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022","Izushi, Hiro/0000-0002-4090-4181",,,,,89,15,15,1,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The model combines use of conventional cost-benefit analysis to produce aggregated single point estimates, with quantitative risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation to produce interval results. The embedded uncertainties within traditional CBA such as ex-ante based investment costs and travel time savings are of particular concern. The paper investigates these two impacts in terms of the Optimism Bias principle which is used to take account of the underestimation of construction costs and the overestimation of travel time savings. The CBA-DK methodological approach has been used to apply suitable probability distribution functions on the uncertain parameters, thus resulting in feasibility risk assessment moving from point to interval results. The proposed assessment model makes use of both deterministic and stochastic based information. Decision support as illustrated in this paper aims to provide assistance in the development and ultimately the choice of action, while accounting for the uncertainties surrounding transport appraisal schemes. The modelling framework is illustrated by the use of a case study appraising airport and runway alternatives in the capital of Greenland - Nuuk. The case study has been conducted in cooperation with the Home Rule Authorities of Greenland. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As one of the key variables affecting the choice of residential tourists is the environmental quality of the area, this paper focuses on testing for the existence of an inverse correlation between the loss of coastal water transparency, viewed as a measure of environmental quality, and beach aesthetics in Santa Ponca Bay, a Mallorcan coastal area containing two urban beach zones of intensive recreational use, where the proportion of second-home residents is high. The results show that the willingness to pay for improvements in water transparency diminishes in a non-linear way when transparency deteriorates, resulting in no statistically significant differences between first- and second-home residents.","[Torres, Catalina M.; Riera, Antoni] Univ Illes Balears, Ctr Recerca Econ, UIB SA NOSTRA, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Torres, Catalina M.; Riera, Antoni; Garcia, Dolores] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Torres, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Ctr Recerca Econ, UIB SA NOSTRA, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Spain.",cati.torres@uib.es; antoni.riera@ulb.es; dolores.garcia@uib.es,"Riera, Antoni/C-4385-2008; TORRES, CATI/K-9870-2014","TORRES, CATI/0000-0001-6013-0518",,,,,33,10,10,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

With data from 1971 on the evidence is mixed when applying descriptive methods or formal unit root tests. When allowing for fractional integration, however, we find similar results to the literature in that shocks to US data seem to be transitory while having permanent effects on German unemployment. This difference in hysteresis, however, depends on the sample. Using recursive and rolling techniques we observe that shocks in US subsamples until the mid-nineties are clearly more transitory than in more recent subsamples. We conclude that hysteresis has turned into a dominating feature also on US labour market more recently.","[Hassler, Uwe] Univ Frankfurt, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hassler, Uwe] Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch, Mannheim, Germany; [Wolters, Juergen] Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Free University of Berlin,"Hassler, U (通讯作者)，Univ Frankfurt, Postfach 49,Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",hassler@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; wolters@wiwiss.fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,36,2,3,1,4,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This is a particularly tough case for the growing Europeanization literature. Prior research has called attention to several factors that promote Europeanization, including the presence of a pro-reform domestic coalition, the clarity and consistency of the EU's own legislative targets, a state's own prior involvement in the setting of European standards, a strong consensus among EU member states backing the European position, and strong non-European support for EU initiatives. According to these propositions, Romanian child protection seemed to provide a worst case scenario for Europeanization, as initially none of these conditions held. And yet the paper shows that substantial Europeanization occurred anyway. We argue that the EU experienced a very slow start with Romania but that it cultivated an opposition that responded to EU initiatives when that opposition took power. Moreover, the EU found three workarounds to the obstacles just noted: it asserted legislative targets it did not possess itself, invented new policy tools, and drew protection for its most controversial policy from another international organization, the ECHR. Our central theoretical claim is that external pressure requires internal accommodation in order to have lasting effects. The claim has important implications for the diffusion and conditionality debates.","[Jacoby, Wade] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Provo, UT 84604 USA; [Lataianu, Gabriel; Lataianu, Camelia Manuela] Estrella Mt Community Coll, Avondale, AZ 85392 USA",Brigham Young University,"Jacoby, W (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 745 SWKT, Provo, UT 84604 USA.",wade.jacoby@byu.edu; gabriel.lataianu@estrellamountain.edu; camelia.lataianu@estrellamountain.edu,,,,,,,80,9,10,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The research approach incorporates a hedonic method to quantify nearby property value effects at more than 100 brownfield projects, and stakeholder interviews are used to assess perceived impacts to real estate conditions. The results reveal that the spillover effect in terms of raising surrounding property values is significant in both quantity and geographic scope, as redevelopment led to a net increase of 11.4% in nearby housing prices in Milwaukee and 2.7% in Minneapolis. It also reveals that project size, value, and the amount of public funding have minor impacts on this effect; factors such as proximity to major roads, distance from rail, and higher incomes have greater positive impacts.","[De Sousa, Christopher A.; Wu, Changshan] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"De Sousa, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",,"; Wu, Changshan/F-2774-2011","De Sousa, Christopher/0000-0003-4433-1875; Wu, Changshan/0000-0002-0207-9299",,,,,48,72,98,0,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Both a bivariate frequency-wise causality measure and its higher-dimensional extension are applied. The main findings are that short-run causality exists between the oil price and variables such as short-term interest rates and the German share price index, while long-run causality is found between the oil price and long-term interest rates. Moreover, the oil price predicts the consumer price index at a high number of different frequencies, while no significant causality is found to run from the oil price to industrial production and the unemployment rate.","Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Gronwald, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",gronwald@econ.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,39,26,27,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Both imports and exports appear to be highly concentrated among few firms and seem to have become more so over time. Focusing on manufacturing, we find that facts previously reported in the literature as applying only to exports actually apply to imports too. We note that the number of trading firms diminishes as the number of export destinations or import origins increases. The same is true if we consider the number of products traded. Our results generally point to a process of self-selection in both export and import markets. Also, the productivity advantage of exporters reported in the literature may be overstated because imports were not considered. We find that firms that both import and export are the most productive, followed, in descending order, by importers only, exporters only and non-traders. Our results also show the existence of fixed costs of imports, which appear to be of similar magnitude as those of exports.","[Muuls, Mirabelle] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Muûls, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England.",,,"Muuls, Mirabelle/0000-0002-7888-3179",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-107-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,51,128,140,0,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2009,32.0,5,,,,,692.0,734,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01172.x,0.0,,,43,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,440QD,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265713900002,0

In order to capture the feedback effects of such a complex set of policies, we employ a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the Fijian economy to investigate (i) the impact of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA), (ii) the impact of PICTA, the Pacific Agreement for Closer Economic Relations (PACER), and the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), (iii) the impact of full tariff liberalisation (i.e. tariff removal only), and (iv) the impact of full trade liberalisation, with removal of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. While PICTA consistently provides the least benefits across a range of macroeconomic indicators including real output, welfare, trade volumes and employment, full trade liberalisation involving the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers provides the greatest benefits compared to the other scenarios in terms of real output. However, the latter scenario is outperformed by PICTA, PACER, the EPAs and full tariff liberalisation in terms of welfare effects, trade volumes and employment.

We employ a spatial model with price competition. The public firm is owned by the local government of the left half of the linear city called Region 1, and maximizes its welfare. We demonstrate that our two-stage game comprising location choice and price competition has two types of equilibria. In one equilibrium (E-1), the local public firm locates in Region 1, and the private firm locates outside the region. In the other equilibrium (E-2), both firms are located in Region 1. We find that although the two firms are closely located in E-2, E-2 payoff-dominates E-1. Moreover, E-2 is robust in the sense that the sequential choice of location adopts this equilibrium, regardless of whether the public firm is a leader or a follower. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This raises issues in the formulation and interpretation of econometric tourism demand models. It is argued that a simple lagged demand term is not sufficient to account for the dynamics of tourism demand. Many alternative specifications of the dynamic elements and form have been used in tourism demand modelling. This paper helps to resolve the issue of how the dynamics should be specified. It does this by a thorough review of the dynamic elements relevant to tourism demand and by demonstrating that the specification does make a difference in practice. Consideration of different formulations of the dynamics of tourism demand, drawing on theory and specific characteristics of tourism, leads to the recommendation of an ARIMA with explanatory variables model form.","RMIT Univ, Grad Sch Business, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Morley, CL (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Grad Sch Business, GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",clive.morley@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,34,32,33,2,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The objective of the analysis is to study the relevance of the social dimension as a source of explanation of social activity-travel generation behavior between an individual and each relevant person of their social life. The paper uses a disaggregated Perspective of personal networks, explicitly incorporating the characteristics of each network member as well as the characteristics of the overall social structure. Using an ordinal multilevel specification that accounts for the social network in which individuals are embedded, four dimensions are studied: personal characteristics, with whom activities are performed, social network composition and Structure, and ICT (information and communication technology) interaction. The results show that a proper and complete understanding of social activity generation requires going beyond the individualistic paradigm, explicitly incorporating the role of the social dimension in the study of this decision-making Process.

Notwithstanding resistance, the state moves towards market-driven reforms wherein external funds are privileged over internal resources, the reasons for which are probed within the context of social structures of accumulation and emergent power relations. It is argued that with the diversion of resources towards debt servicing and compliance with policy conditionalities, the collaboration with the ADB is likely to undermine social democracy. What ensues is a double collapse: a collapse of the Kerala Model of social development and the demise of an iconized Left.

In 2008, they accounted for 4 % of the country's total exports. However, over the last years, new producing/exporting countries have emerged which can compete with Tunisia and enter the olive oil market due to their fast-paced growth. Therefore, it is necessary to make a comparison between Tunisia and its new competitors which pose a threat today to its position in the international market. The main goal of this work is to assess the current state of Tunisian olive oil exports in the international context in order to design some appropriate strategies to take up the challenge of competition. The method applied is based on a shift share approach to analyse two time periods, 1997-2001 and 2002-2006. The empirical results show that Tunisia is still increasing its market share and maintaining its leading position in the American and Canadian market compared with the new competitors i.e. Syria, Argentina, Australia and Chile. In the European Union market, Tunisia always remains the first supplier but with a decreasing market share during the last years which is countered by the increasing Syrian market share.","[Mokrani, Aicha] Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia; [Sai, Mohamed Bechir] Inst Olivier, Tunis, Tunisia; [Dhehibi, Boubaker] Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage; Institut de l'Olivier; Universite de Carthage,"Mokrani, A (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,"Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669",,,,,9,2,2,0,12,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2011,10.0,4,,,,,13.0,18,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,892GR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300275200002,0

This paper evaluates a policy approach known as personal tradable carbon permits to reduce carbon emissions from personal vehicles. The policy is a downstream tradable permit where individuals are allocated carbon emission caps. The policy is qualitatively evaluated in the context of carbon taxes and some upstream tradable permit options. The biggest disadvantage of such a policy is the initial set up costs. Personal tradable permits, however, are more effective than carbon taxes and are also capable of stabilizing the gasoline prices faced by the consumers when the underlying oil prices fluctuate. Since equity effects are often a concern to policy makers, the effect of such personal carbon permits on the distribution of burden is quantified in a partial equilibrium framework for the US population. Different permit allocation strategies are investigated in this regard. Using US consumer expenditure survey data, and incorporating a differentiated price response for different households, we find that all three allocation strategies considered are progressive: a per adult based allocation is the most progressive, a per vehicle allocation nearer to proportional, and a per capita allocation in between the two. Personal tradable permits therefore take care of equity concerns directly through the design of the policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The method produces conceptual plans for geometric idealizations of a particular city that are later adapted to the real conditions. These conceptual plans are generalizations of the hybrid network concept proposed in Daganzo (2010). The best plan for a specific application is chosen via optimization. The objective function is composed of analytic formulae for a concept's agency cost and user level of service. These formulae include as parameters key demand-side attributes of the city, assumed to be rectangular, and supply-side attributes of the transit technology. They also include as decision variables the system's line and stop spacings, the degree to which it focuses passenger trips on the city center, and the service headway. These decision variables are sufficient to define an idealized geometric layout of the system and an operating plan. This layout-operating plan is then used as a design target when developing the real, detailed master plan. Ultimately, the latter is simulated to obtain more accurate cost and level of service estimates. This process has been applied to design a high performance bus (HPB) network for Barcelona (Spain). The idealized solution for Barcelona includes 182 km of one-way infrastructure, uses 250 vehicles and costs 42,489 (sic)/h to build and run. These figures only amount to about one third of the agency resources and cost currently used to provide bus service. A detailed design that resembles,this target and conforms to the peculiarities of the city is also presented and simulated. The agency cost and user level of service metrics of the simulated system differ from those of the idealized model by less than 10%. Although the designed and simulated HPB systems provide sub-optimal spatial coverage because Barcelona lacks suitable streets, the level of service is good. Simulations suggest that if the proposed system was implemented side-by-side with the current one, it would capture most of the demand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers the global premium associated to homeownership. On the one hand, homeownership is associated to private benefits of being an owner. On the other hand, overinvestment in housing is harmful to diversification and distorts portfolio management. This trade-off, similar to the one associated to corporate private benefits of control, is the cornerstone of our theoretical model based on the expected utility maximization. The originality of the model comes from its simplicity. Furthermore, the empirical implementation of the model, using price and rent data normalized by square-meter, exhibits a homeownership premium for houses in the Brussels Region reaching at least 9% of the housing price. The findings are robust to several methodological refinements. In particular, they confirm the link between liquidity constraints and house prices documented in the literature. However, the premium may largely vary from one place to another, according to tax laws, cultural habits and social status associated to tenure.","[Sekkat, Khalid; Szafarz, Ariane] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management SBS EM, Ctr Emile Bernheim, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Sekkat, K (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management SBS EM, Ctr Emile Bernheim, Brussels, Belgium.",ksekkat@ulb.ac.be,,"Szafarz, Ariane/0000-0002-5286-421X",,,,,36,5,5,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Unlike previous studies, we examine fund holdings and trades of REITs to answer this question. This approach allows us to explicitly account for portfolio rebalancing that alters REIT-characteristic weights of fund portfolios. Results show that fund managers, after controlling for property type, size and momentum, generated significant positive alpha with their securities-selection ability. To understand the sources of such ability, we examine whether fund managers who followed certain trading strategies outperformed relative to other managers. The potential trading strategies are based on public information related to geographic concentration, net-asset-value-to-price ratios, income and appreciation styles and leverage of the underlying REITs. Comparative and regression analyses show that none of the strategies fully explains why fund managers were able to select REITs that outperformed. We surmise that the outperformance mainly derives from the endemic abilities of managers to uniquely process REIT-specific information and generate private valuation beliefs that lead to profitable investment decisions.","[Cici, Gjergji; Gibson, Scott] Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Corgel, Jack] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",William & Mary; Cornell University,"Cici, G (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",Gjergji.Cici@mason.wm.edu; jc81@cornell.edu; scott.gibson@mason.wm.edu,,,,,,,20,23,26,2,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2011,39.0,3,,,,,455.0,486,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00304.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,807NK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293905500003,0

The problem implied by such decisiveness, namely, the universal disregard of the preferences of the minority, can be ameliorated by applying unbiased scoring rules such as the classical Borda rule, but such amelioration has a price; it implies erosion in the implementation of the widely accepted majority principle. Furthermore, the problems of majority decisiveness and of the erosion in the majority principle are not necessarily severe when one takes into account the likelihood of their occurrence. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the severity of the two problems, comparing simple-majoritarian voting rules that allow the decisiveness of the smallest majority larger than 1/2 and the classical Borda method of counts. Our analysis culminates in the derivation of the conditions that determine, in terms of the number of alternatives k, the number of voters n, and the relative (subjective) weight assigned to the severity of the two problems, which of these rules is superior in light of the dual majoritarian approach.","[Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Baharad, Eyal] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",Bar Ilan University; University of Haifa,"Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",baharad@econ.haifa.ac.il; nitzans@mail.biu.ac.il,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2011,71.0,2,,,,,151.0,162,,10.1007/s11238-009-9157-z,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,791HN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292655900001,0

A 13 week field study was organized in The Netherlands with the purpose of longitudinally investigating the impacts of rewards on commuter behavior. Different levels and types of rewards were applied and behavior was tracked with state-of-the art detection equipment. Based on the collected data, which included also pre and post-test measurements, a mixed discrete choice model was estimated. The results suggest that rewards can be effective tools in changing commuting behavior. Specifically rewards reduce the shares of rush-hour driving, shift driving to off-peak times and increase the shares of public transport, cycling and working from home. Mediating factors include socio-demographic characteristics, scheduling constraints and work time flexibility, habitual behavior, attitudes to commuting alternatives, the availability of travel information and even the weather. The success of this study has encouraged adoption of rewards, as additional policy tools, to alleviate congestion, especially during temporary road closures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Special focus is placed on how different equilibrium fares are linked to trip length. Higher operator costs and higher demand from the authorities regarding the quality of transport supply result in steeper relationships (larger rate of change) between all fares and travel distance. Also, a higher degree of substitutability between the services will in most cases make these relationships steeper. The competitive situation has less influence on fares, both absolutely and relatively, the longer routes the operators compete on. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The identification assumption is that the typically smaller firms facing financing constraints, are disproportionally affected by the stance of monetary policy. I argue that when credit constrains are widespread, as may be the case in Emerging Markets, flight to quality should not be expected during monetary contractions. Indeed, in my model, among constrained firms, those with tighter financing constraints are less responsive to monetary conditions.

Electoral targeting of grants to LAs by the incumbent national government provides an exogenous source of variation in grants that we exploit to identify their causal effect on house prices. Our results indicate substantial or even full capitalization. We also find that house prices respond more strongly in locations in which new construction is constrained by physical barriers. Our results imply that (i) during our sample period grants were largely used in a way that is valued by the marginal homebuyer and (ii) increases in grants to an LA may mainly benefit the typically better off property owners (homeowners and absentee landlords) in that LA.

Poverty exit and re-entry rates are estimated, and the resulting distribution of time spent in poverty is calculated, both in single and in multiple-spell frameworks. Poverty persistence predictions are also produced for various subgroups of the populations. In order to do so, I estimate a multiple-spell model of transitions in and out of poverty, controlling for observed and correlated unobserved individual heterogeneity and for a potential initial condition problem. Components-of-variance models are also used to predict the number of years in poverty for the targeted groups. The two alternative modeling approaches are shown to produce a consistent picture of poverty persistence.","[Devicienti, Francesco] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Finanziarie G Prato, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Devicienti, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, Lab Revelli, I-10024 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Devicienti, F (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Finanziarie G Prato, Corso Unione Soviet 218Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",devicienti@econ.unito.it,"Devicienti, Francesco/HTP-9783-2023",,,,,,40,23,26,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The authors report key descriptive statistics about the companies and their founders. About 16% of the companies in the sample, for instance, number at least one immigrant entrepreneur among their founding teams, while about 77% of the immigrant entrepreneurs are U. S. citizens. Three multivariate analyses are carried out that compare high-impact, high-tech firms that count at least one immigrant in their founding teams with those that were founded by native-born entrepreneurs. It is found that the two groups of firms are similar with respect to economic and technological performance. Immigrant-founded firms are more likely to report that they have a strategic relationship with a foreign firm. The authors conclude by briefly considering the potential implications of their findings for immigration and economic development policy.","[Hart, David M.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Sci & Technol, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Hart, DM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Sci & Technol, 3401 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",dhart@gmu.edu,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013",,,,,,59,102,121,1,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

An often-used approach in estimating factor demand systems is to (implicitly or explicitly) assume that there is a (independent) cointegrating relationship for each of the n - 1 independent cost shares. However, due to technological changes, there might not be as many cointegrating relationships as there are (independent) cost shares. This article presents a flexible demand system that allows for both factor neutral technological changes as well as technological changes that affect the relative use of the different factors. The empirical tests indicate that there are fewer cointegrating relationships than usually implied using conventional estimation approaches. This result is consistent with technological changes that affect the relative use of the different input factors. I argue that, since such unexplained technological changes are likely to affect input factor decisions, a demand system that allows for such changes should be preferred.","Stat Norway, Res Dept, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Hungnes, H (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, POB 8131, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway.",hhu@ssb.no,"Hungnes, Håvard/JWP-1382-2024","Hungnes, Håvard/0000-0003-1588-0154",,,,,16,6,6,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The regression analysis covers bilateral imports in services consisting of 20,986 country-pairs in total over six years (2000-05). Our results indicate that sector-specific trade-creating effects of services RTAs are significantly positive without incurring trade-diverting effects, excluding transportation services. Moreover, we find that there is a significant cumulative effect of services RTAs, excluding communication services and a complementary relationship between goods and services imports. In addition, the trade-creating effect of services RTAs is stronger between developed members compared with between developed and developing countries.","[Park, Innwon] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Soonchan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Int Trade, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea",Korea University; Kongju National University,"Park, I (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Park, Innwon/I-6310-2019","Park, Innwon/0000-0001-8567-7907; Park, Soonchan/0000-0001-8389-852X",,,,,30,15,16,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2011,34.0,5,,,,,725.0,740,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01350.x,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,769RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291034800004,0

Even though the activity is encompassed by the shipping transport sector and is supervised by the Ministry of Merchant Marine, its product appears to be offered exclusively to tourists. The magnitude of the economic contribution of coastal leisure shipping to the Greek economy is assessed through the implementation of the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA). Although the contribution of coastal leisure shipping to the national economy is not very substantial, it is significant to the local economies of the insular and coastal regions. The tourist 'day ships' constitute a dependable means of connecting the small islands with the larger islands and the ports of continental Greece. The role of the daily sea tours for the inhabitants of small islands is purely that of a means of transportation, since for most of them the tourist boats are an alternative, or sometimes the only means of connection with the rest of the world.","[Diakomihalis, Mihail N.] Epirus TEI, Preveza 48100, Greece; [Lagos, Dimitrs G.] Univ Aegean, Michalon 8, Chios, Greece",University of Aegean,"Diakomihalis, MN (通讯作者)，Epirus TEI, Laskaratou 6, Preveza 48100, Greece.",diakom@teiep.gr; d.lagos@aegean.gr,"Diakomihalis, Mihail/ABG-4642-2020",,,,,,16,8,8,0,16,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, the geographical distribution of physician brain drain was documented for the period 1991-2004. Second, random and fixed effects models were employed to investigate the effects of physicians in the home countries and abroad on child mortality and vaccination rates. Third, models were estimated to investigate migration-induced incentives in the medical sector that would increase the number of physicians. The results showed positive effects of migration prospects on medical training though the magnitude was too small for generating a net brain gain. Also, infant and child mortality rates were negatively associated with the number of physicians per capita after adult literacy rates exceeded 60%. The results for DPT and measles vaccinations underscored the importance of literacy rates and physicians per capita for higher vaccination rates. From the standpoint of Millennium Development Goals, reducing medical brain drain is likely to have only small benefits for child mortality and vaccination rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The more extensive the avenues of influence, the stronger this guilt by association. The rationale is two-fold. First, a state that possesses institutionalized influence (e. g., a veto) within an intergovernmental organization faces substantial difficulties in credibly committing to non-interference with organizational activities. Second, even if a state somehow could commit to abstention from overt interference, it may exert covert ideational influence if it already has embedded its values into an IGO. Elites and laypeople alike recognize the avenues of influence that fuel guilt-by-association. With statistical analyses of public opinion data from 35,397 people in 23 countries, I provide the first systematic evidence that guilt-by-association exists: for the United States, Russia, Japan, and Pakistan, vis-a-vis the United Nations, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. The evidence is robust to numerous alternative specifications. The findings contribute to international relations scholarship by enhancing our understanding of threats to IGO legitimacy and by providing concrete evidence for a mechanism by which antipathy toward powerful states matters in the international realm.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Johnson, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tana@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,60,59,66,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Henry Thornton had already advocated monetary policy in 1802 in his monumental Paper Credit. However, it was not until the publication of Walter Bagehot's Lombard Street in 1873 that a theory of monetary policy was reintroduced into mainstream thinking, and even then it was in a restricted, defensive form. The profession had to wait another 25 years for a full-fledged theory justifying active monetary policy of the kind that Thornton provided, this time in Knut Wicksell's Interest and Prices (1898). This paper offers a brief survey of the slow rise of a theory of monetary policy in the nineteenth century. The paper then elaborates on Wicksell's innovative thinking on monetary policy, with a focus on Wicksell's influence on the work of Keynes. Keynes' early contributions to monetary theory and policy were embedded in the Cambridge monetary tradition and adopted monetary policy as an effective tool in fighting business cycles. In A Treatise on Money in 1930, Keynes presented a comprehensive analysis of that approach; he was well aware of his debt to Wicksell. The changes in Keynes' views that led to the General Theory 6 years later modified his attitude to monetary policy and to Wicksell as well. The paper re-evaluates both the changes in Keynes' thinking on monetary policy between 1930 and 1936 and how these changes are reflected in Keynes' changing attitude to Wicksell.","[Arnon, Arie] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Econ & Soc Program, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,,arnona@bgu.ac.il,"Arnon, Arie/F-1115-2012",,,,,,36,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-14408-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,207.0,229,,10.1007/978-3-642-14409-7_10,0.0,,,23,Economics; History Of Social Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BVA34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290894000018,0

We find: First, replacing coal generators with natural gas generators is the most economical way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent. Second, replacing existing coal generation capacity with modern coal generation plants can only reduce total carbon dioxide by 5 percent. Third, the distribution of the efficiency of coal generators in the United States restricts the range over which carbon dioxide prices effectively manage the displacement of coal by gas. Fourth, the narrow range for the price of carbon dioxide creates the possibility that a market in carbon dioxide permits will result in high volatility in the market for electricity. Fifth, the carbon prices implied by the transition from coal to gas will have very little impact on transportation fuels.","[Brito, Dagobert L.] Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Rice University,"Brito, DL (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",brito@rice.edu,"Curl, Robert/R-7252-2019",,,,,,29,1,1,2,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,4,,,,,1.0,26,,10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol32-No4-1,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,824GI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295190000001,0

Bioversity, managing the world's largest Musa germplasm collection at the International Transit Centre (ITC), is playing a major role in the global conservation effort of Musa, and in the exchange and use of germplasm. Efficient characterisation is a prerequisite, not only to facilitate the use of germplasm diversity but also to prioritise resources towards accessions of interest and not yet conserved. The Musa Taxonomy Advisory Group (TAG) identified the lack of a comprehensive procedure to classify an accession up to subgroup and subspecies level as a bottleneck for efficient Musa conservation and utilisation. The field verification and characterisation of 720 ITC accessions as well as the creation of a set of 'reference accessions' representing major Musa subgroups will provide morphotaxonomic data and allow to: i) improve and standardise a procedure for characterisation using molecular techniques, morphological descriptors and sets of photographs, ii) test the robustness of descriptors across different environments, iii) develop tools to allocate an accession to a subgroup or a subspecies (scoring system, identification keys), and iv) provide a manageable and representative set of accessions for research, classification and training.

We show that this asymmetry arises theoretically when the economy is not in the neighbourhood of the steady state. Breaks are modelled through a Fourier function fitted to the deterministic part of a time series, and asymmetries are modelled as a smooth transition function that matches the theory predictions. The tests are shown to have good finite sample properties. The results support the existence of convergence towards a mean that displays a break around the 1920s crisis and WWII. These breaks are associated to different patterns of post-WWII growth performance. Asymmetric mean reversion also appears to be an important feature driving convergence for most countries in the sample.

Using original data from a longitudinal survey covering the period of 1995-2006, this article analyses the impact of transformation in the defence industry on labour and labour-management relations. We find that by the mid-2000s defence enterprises were largely able to stop job losses, eliminate wage arrears and restore wages to the level prevailing in the civilian economy. The study confirms that compared to other sectors of the Russian economy, defence enterprises continue to carry a strong legacy of the Soviet system. The dominant role of state ownership and government orders, along with the relative geographical isolation of defence enterprises and obvious factors of secrecy and security, made labour at these enterprises less willing to challenge management or owners by strikes and open protests. On the other hand, workers of defence enterprises can count on a more paternalistic attitude from managers and relatively more generous welfare benefits.","[Kosals, Leonid] Higher Sch Econ, Fac Sociol, Moscow, Russia; [Izyumov, Alexei] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); University of Louisville,"Kosals, L (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Fac Sociol, Room 532,3 Kochnovskiy Proezd, Moscow, Russia.",leon.kosals@gmail.com; Alexei@louisville.edu,"IZYUMOV, ALEXEI/AAL-6340-2021; Kosals, Leonid/B-1954-2014","IZYUMOV, ALEXEI/0000-0002-1750-2790;",,,,,87,6,8,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2011,63.0,5,,,,,733.0,756,,10.1080/09668136.2011.576016,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,781ZK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291976400001,0

It is thought that the above mentioned main factors are: students' learning need, object of attention, relevant contents of learning, confidence in learning and emotional satisfaction. Students' learning need brings about their attention toward certain object; following this, relevance of learning contents leads to students' learning actions; then they have confidence in learning and finally they feel satisfied emotionally. This is a completely related motive system. The former result is the precondition of the coming action. This kind of coherence is a cycle and a development, occurring in the whole learning process. Therefore, some suggestions are given. In school PE teaching, raise appropriate requirements, set up developmental goals and enrich textbook contents. Meanwhile, teachers should adopt various teaching methods, in order to meet students' need as much as possible and let them enjoy sport.

Mainly, we adopt a sectoral approach and weight oil prices by sectoral energy intensities. Further, inspired by Alfred Marshall's treatment of time, we also put forward a new approach to model short-term interactions between economic variables that relies on an error-correcting mechanism depending on cumulative errors. Applied to the U.S. economy, our model enables us to estimate stable relationships between oil prices and sectoral economic indicators. Further, it explains both the long-run weakening of the relationship between oil prices and aggregate economic activity and its short-run instability. We show that the oil price-macroeconomy relationship is fading but the oil price-microeconomy relationship is alive and well.","[Lescaroux, Francois] GDF SUEZ, Strategy & Sustainable Dev Div, F-75391 Paris, France; [Lescaroux, Francois] IFP Energies Nouvelles, Econ Studies Div, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France",GDF Suez; IFP Energies Nouvelles,"Lescaroux, F (通讯作者)，GDF SUEZ, Strategy & Sustainable Dev Div, 22 Rue Docteur Lancereaux, F-75391 Paris, France.",francois.lescaroux@gdfsuez.com,"DEV, Direction Economie/C-1705-2013",,,,,,45,4,5,0,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,1,,,,,25.0,47,,,,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,698AJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285563600002,0

Yet important modifications were introduced in 2006 with the recognition of an alternative policy path, 'flexicurity.' While the latter accepted neoliberal macroeconomic 'fundamentals,' it broke with neoliberalism to the extent that it recognized a positive role for labour market regulations and social policies in promoting security and social inclusion. The paper analyses the politics associated with this shift, using the concept of 'organisational discourse' to get at the dynamic (and contested) nature of the OECD's ideational lens. While the OECD came under pressure from some of its member states to alter its 'one size fits all' strategy, the Economics Department, whose version of the discourse initially dominated, was also challenged from within by the Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs (DELSA), which developed its own alternative discourse.","[Mahon, Rianne] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Mahon, Rianne] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",University of Waterloo; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Mahon, R (通讯作者)，Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,37,17,17,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F-1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F-1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F-1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.","[Rekha, A.; Ambika, D.

This has been particularly true of agricultural trade reforms due to the importance of grains in the diets of the poor, presence of relatively higher protection in agriculture, as well as heavy concentration of global poverty in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of income. Yet some in this debate have argued that, given the extreme volatility in agricultural commodity markets, the additional price and therefore poverty impacts due to trade liberalization might well be indiscernible. This paper formally tests the invisibility hypothesis using the method of stochastic simulation in a trade-poverty modeling framework. The hypothesis test is based on the comparison of two samples of price and poverty distributions. The first originates solely from the inherent variability in global staple grains markets, while the second combines the effects of inherent market variability with those of trade reform in these same markets. Results, at the national and stratum level indicate that the short-run poverty impacts of full trade liberalization in staple grains trade worldwide, are distinguishable in only four of the fifteen countries, suggesting that impacts of more modest agricultural trade reforms are indeed likely to be invisible in short run. Countries that show statistically significant short run impacts are the ones characterized by high staple grains tariffs and/or a moderate degree of grain markets variability. Within each country, results are heterogeneous. In two thirds of the sample countries, agriculturally self-employed poor experience statistically significant poverty impacts from trade liberalization. However, this figure is under a third for all the other strata.","[Verma, Monika] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Valenzuela, Ernesto] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Int Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Adelaide,"Verma, M (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",verma3@purdue.edu; hertel@purdue.edu; ernesto.valenzuela@adelaide.edu.au,,"Valenzuela, Ernesto/0000-0002-9621-7524; van den Bos-Verma, Monika/0000-0001-9393-6171",,,,,29,6,6,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The measures quantify the extent to which a voter can be part of a group that can jointly make a difference as to whether a bill passes or not. It is argued that the series of these measures allow for a more appropriate assessment of voting power, particularly of a posteriori voting power in case the votes are stochastically dependent.

J,"Dong, Y; Whalley, J",,,,"Dong, Yan; Whalley, John",,,"Carbon, Trade Policy and Carbon Free Trade Areas",WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper discusses both the potential contribution that trade policy initiatives can make towards the achievement of significant global carbon emissions reduction and the potential impacts of proposals now circulating for carbon reduction motivated geographical trade arrangements, including carbon-free trade areas. We first suggest that trade policy is likely to be a relatively minor consideration in climate change containment. The dominant influence on carbon emissions globally for the next several decades will be growth more than trade and its composition, and in turn, the size of trade seemingly matters more than its composition given differences in emission intensity between tradables and non-tradables. We then note that differences in emissions intensity across countries are larger than across products or sectors and so issues of country discrimination in trade policy (and violations of MFN) arise. We next discuss both unilateral and regional carbon motivated trade policy arrangements, including three potential variants of carbon emission reduction based free trade area arrangements. One is regional trade agreements with varying types of trade preferences towards low carbon-intensive products, low carbon new technologies and inputs to low carbon processes. A second is the use of joint border measures against third parties to counteract anti-competitive effects from groups of countries taking on deeper emission reduction commitments. A third is third-country trade barriers along with free trade or other regional trade agreements as penalty mechanisms to pressure other countries to join emission-reducing environmental agreements. We differentiate among the objectives, forms and possible impacts of each variant. We also speculate as to how the world trading system may evolve in the next few decades as trade policy potentially becomes increasingly dominated by environmental concerns. We suggest that the future evolution of the trading system will likely be with environmentally motivated arrangements acting as an overlay on prevailing trade and financial arrangements in the WTO and IMF, and eventually movement to linked global trade and environmental policy bargaining.","[Dong, Yan] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] China Agr Univ, CIGI, Univ Western Ontario, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; China Agricultural University,"Dong, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,25,16,17,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2010,33.0,9,,,,,1073.0,1094,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01272.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,648BR,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281665900002,0

The results show that value industrial property investment outperformed growth industrial property investment in all the holding periods under consideration. Furthermore the industrial property investments exhibit return reversal. This implies that the superiority of the contrarian strategy is sustainable. The results of stochastic dominance tests validate the relative superiority of value over growth industrial property investment.

Empirically, firms are quite heterogeneous with regard to fixed costs: the composition of assets (tangible versus intangible; machinery versus buildings; etc.) and the financing of investments. Then, even uniform changes in profit tax instruments cause heterogeneous responses of firm-level effective tax rates and, hence, after-tax profits. We argue that, with similar profit margins, firms would then require pre-tax profits to differ as well. Governments change statutory profit tax rates and, by virtue of firms' heterogeneity, they cause stark selection effects which are mainly related to heterogeneous fixed rather than variable costs. We compute costs of capital for a large sample of firms to illustrate how homogeneous changes in tax instruments hit firms differently. Using Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS database, we illustrate that the effects of changes in statutory instruments have relatively large systematic variance components across industries within countries and also relatively large ones of firms within industries and countries.","[Egger, Peter] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Loretz, Simon] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Oxford,"Egger, P (通讯作者)，ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Loretz, Simon/AAE-5830-2020","Loretz, Simon/0000-0002-7117-1531; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,17,7,7,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2010,33.0,8,,,,,1023.0,1041,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01311.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,632WQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280460500005,0

This paper focuses on a particular country: Poland. The main purpose is to investigate, empirically, whether the post-transition fiscal policy is consistent with the intertemporal budget constraint, used as a formal theoretical framework. To test debt stabilization, the empirical analysis is made in two steps: first, we use a Bayesian methodology to conduct inference about the cointegrating relationship between budget revenues and (inclusive of interest) expenditures and to select the cointegrating rank. Second, we apply Bayesian inference to the estimation of the cointegrating vector and of the adjustment parameters. With a single cointegrating relation, we make use of some known results concerning the posterior density of the cointegrating vector, which belongs to the poly-t densities class. In this way, we experiment the usefulness of Bayesian inference in precisely assessing the magnitude of the cointegrating vector. Moreover, we show to what extent the likelihood of the data is important in revising the available prior information, relying on numerical integration techniques.","[Silvestrini, Andrea] Bank Italy Econ Res & Int Relat, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Silvestrini, Andrea] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Silvestrini, Andrea] Catholic Univ Louvain, Bank Italy Econ Res & Int Relat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Silvestrini, A (通讯作者)，Bank Italy Econ Res & Int Relat, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",andrea.silvestrini@bancaditalia.it,"Silvestrini, Andrea/B-3410-2009",,,,,,48,3,3,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The axiom system is basically similar to the n-component (n = 3) additive conjoint structure, but the independence axiom is weakened in the system. That is, the axiom exclusively requires the independence of the order for each of single factors from fixed levels of the other factors. The introduction of a concatenation operation on each factor Ai makes it possible to yield a special type of restricted solvability, i.e., additive solvability and the usual cancellation on Pi(n)(i=1) A(i). In addition, the assumption of continuity and completeness for A(i) implies a stronger type of solvability on A(i). The additive solvability, cancellation, and stronger solvability axioms allow the weakened independence to be effective enough in constructing the additive representation.","Kanazawa Inst Technol, Res Lab Affect Design Engn, Haku San, Ishikawa 9240838, Japan",Kanazawa Institute of Technology,"Matsushita, Y (通讯作者)，Kanazawa Inst Technol, Res Lab Affect Design Engn, 3-1 Yatsukaho, Haku San, Ishikawa 9240838, Japan.",yutaka@neptune.kanazawa-it.ac.jp,"Matsushita, Yutaka/AAI-3136-2020",,,,,,14,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2010,69.0,1,,,,,1.0,16,,10.1007/s11238-008-9116-0,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,610OT,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278743400001,0

Fisher's rationale suggests that national or state level eugenic policies that sterilized the so-called biological and genetically unfit could have been racist in both design and effect by disproportionately targeting black Americans. We empirically explore this with data on eugenic sterilizations in the State of North Carolina between 1958 and 1968. Count data parameter estimates from a cross-county population allocation model of sterilization reveal that the probability of non-institutional and total sterilizations increased with a county's black population share an effect not found for any other racial group in the population.

However, in the absence of detailed driving data that would help improve the identification of cause and effect relationships with individual vehicle crashes, most researchers have addressed this problem by framing it in terms of understanding the factors that affect the frequency of crashes - the number of crashes occurring in some geographical space (usually a roadway segment or intersection) over some specified time period. This paper provides a detailed review of the key issues associated with crash-frequency data as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the various methodological approaches that researchers have used to address these problems. While the steady march of methodological innovation (including recent applications of random parameter and finite mixture models) has substantially improved our understanding of the factors that affect crash-frequencies, it is the prospect of combining evolving methodologies with far more detailed vehicle crash data that holds the greatest promise for the future.

Creating an attractive destination able to compete with others that are better positioned and consolidated requires cooperative behaviour among the various agents involved. This behaviour will facilitate both external and internal competition, which in turn will assure better product quality, continuous product renewal, a strong offer of unique experiences and the efficient use of endogenous resources. In this paper, the authors discuss the results of a survey of restaurant owners and of interviews conducted with the main institutional agents concerned with tourism promotion and the economic development of the Minho-Lima region. Such an approach, the authors argue, can be valuable in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the area in question with regard to future tourism development. The authors work from the premise that the commitment of tourism agents constitutes a precondition for the success of the strategy to be defined.

This paper presents new research advances on individual tourist behaviour and motives, with particular reference to the role of e-services in cultural heritage tourism. An innovative tool adopted here is (spatial) microsimulation modelling (MSM). This method is used to offer a micro-based picture of the motives and behaviour of the total tourist and resident population concerned, including their preferences and personal characteristics. MSM is a novel but hitherto little used scientific tool in the behavioural analysis of cultural heritage tourism, mainly because of the lack of detailed and consistent (spatial) information on tourist flows and their characteristics at an urban scale. MSM is a powerful tool: one of its advantages is its ability to link existing databases and information, so as to provide new behavioural insights at the meso-level of research. To trace the motives, preferences and spatial behaviour of tourists empirically, advanced micro-based research techniques are needed. In this empirical application to tourist flows in the city of Amsterdam, the authors use factor analysis and ordered logit models as the foundation stones for the design of MSM. The empirical model is then applied to the use of e-services by tourists in Amsterdam who wish to enjoy the cultural heritage of the city.","[van Leeuwen, Eveline; Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Leeuwen, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",pnijkamp@feweb.vu.nl,,"Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Van Leeuwen, Eveline/0000-0002-3262-7030",,,,,42,10,11,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Economic theory generally posits that leisure is a normal good, yet it is difficult to obtain reliable empirical estimates of the wealth effect because wealth is correlated with numerous unobservable characteristics that affect labor supply. We use inheritance receipt as a wealth shock and find that it is associated with a significant increase in the probability of retirement, especially when the inheritance is unexpected.

The results point to the coexistence of two basic forces behind changes in regional economic inequality: industrial specialization and labor productivity differentials. The initial expansion of industrialization, in a context of growing economic integration of regions, promoted the spatial concentration of manufacturing in certain regions, which also benefited from the greatest advances in terms of labor productivity. Since 1900, the diffusion of manufacturing production to a greater number of locations has generated the emulation of production structures and a process of catching-up in labor productivity and wages.

In particular, we find that importing is associated with substantial firm heterogeneity. First, we document that trade is more concentrated than employment and sales, and show that importing is even more concentrated than exporting both within sectors and along the sector- and country-extensive margins. Second, while supporting the fact that firms involved in both are the best performers, we also find that firms involved only in importing activities perform better than those involved only in exporting. Our evidence suggests there is a strong self-selection effect in the case of importers and the performance premia of internationalised firms correlate relatively more with the degree of geographical and sectoral diversification of imports.","[Castellani, Davide] Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Serti, Francesco] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain; [Tomasi, Chiara] Univ Urbino, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",University of Perugia; Universitat d'Alacant; University of Urbino,"Castellani, D (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",,"Castellani, Davide/A-9065-2010; Castellani, Davide/AAN-9912-2020; Serti, Francesco/K-8261-2014","Castellani, Davide/0000-0002-1823-242X; Castellani, Davide/0000-0002-1823-242X; Tomasi, Chiara/0000-0002-1962-7351; Serti, Francesco/0000-0002-8057-5298",,,,,45,134,146,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2010,33.0,3,,,,,424.0,457,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01262.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,573CA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275884800006,0

Innovation may play a more important role in the decision to start exporting, and successful exporting may drive process innovation. This suggests that the causality between innovation and exporting may run in both directions. Using detailed microdata from innovation surveys, industrial production surveys, and trade information for Slovenian firms in 1996-2002, we investigate the bidirectional causal relationship between firm innovation and export activity. We find no evidence for the hypothesis that either product or process innovations increase the probability of becoming a first-time exporter, but we do find evidence in both the innovation survey and the industrial production survey that exporting leads to productivity improvements. These, however, are likely to be related to process rather than product innovations, and are observed only in a sample of medium and large first-time exporters. This finding makes a case in favour of the learning-by-exporting hypothesis by demonstrating that these learning effects from exporting occur through the mechanism of process innovation enhancing firm technical efficiency.","[Damijan, Joze P.; Kostevc, Crt; Polanec, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium",University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven,"Damijan, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,48,179,193,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2010,33.0,3,,,,,374.0,398,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01260.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,573CA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275884800004,0

The failure is explained by two factors. Coordination and contracting were costly when the private partners had variable capacities and interests.

The article reviews evidence on the scope and nature of the climate change challenge; reviews how these impacts manifest themselves in insecurity at diverse scales; and examines evidence on the political economy of adaptation responses to these impacts. I argue that climate security has been framed in public and policy debate over climate change such that climate change impacts are a threat to nation states in terms of their interests, their economies and their borders. This framing crowds out, subverts and constrains framing in terms of human-well being. I suggest that human security provides a broader and more encompassing notion of climate security than that focussed on security of states. Here, climate security focuses on the idea of freedom from harm and fear of individuals and communities and the capability to adapt to any imposed harm. From that human security perspective, the central analytical issues become those of vulnerability, adaptation and justice.","[Adger, W.

The panel results indicate that total energy demand is income inelastic and price inelastic, whereas electricity demand is income elastic and price inelastic. Based on the results of the panel causality test, there are reciprocal causal relationships among real income, real energy price, and total energy consumption. Furthermore, a uni-directional causality runs from income and electricity price to electricity consumption. The results for the panel as a whole suggest that the demand for total energy and electricity in the OECD countries is driven largely by strong economic growth, while consumers are largely insensitive to price changes.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Lee, Jun-De] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Chung Hsing University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347","National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC95-2415-H-005-002, NSC 95-2623-7-005-006-Et]","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The first author is grateful to the National Science Council of Taiwan for financial support through grant NSC95-2415-H-005-002 and NSC 95-2623-7-005-006-Et.,,83,68,77,1,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,1,,,,,1.0,23,,,,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,542ST,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273516200001,0

This paper evaluates interactive effects between family socioeconomic status (SES) and height oil child obesity in the United States. Using the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), the results of this paper confirm previous findings that taller children exhibit greater propensity towards obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI) and that obesity is inversely related to family SES as measured by poverty status. The analysis adds to the existing literature by showing that the magnitude of the SES-obesity association is larger in taller children. Age and sex patterns are evaluated that suggest the SES-height interaction persists through childhood and adolescence in males but is only evident in females during adolescence. Interaction effects are also shown to be most evident in white males and Hispanic females. Policy implications are discussed and directions for future work are suggested. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, a model of state dependence is developed that explicitly allows for possible feedback effects from past poverty to future employment and household composition Outcomes. Empirical results based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) suggest that there are indeed such feedback effects and that failure to take them into account may lead to biased estimates of the state dependence effect.

Given this belief and the high carrying cost maintained by real estate developers, potential buyers opt to either exercise immediately or defer the purchase. We simulate the model within a real option framework by which we show that the optimal time to wait before exercising a purchase is positively related to the price level; hence, a negative (positive) correlation between transaction volume and price level (yield) emerges. Observing data on housing prices and new construction sales in Israel for the years 1998-2007, we apply an adaptive expectation regression model to test consumers' belief in both mean reversion and momentum price patterns. The empirical evidence shows that while consumers' demand pattern is simultaneously consistent with the belief in both momentum and mean reversion processes, the effect of the latter generally dominates. Moreover, while the data does not allow for testing the volume and price-level correlation, it does provide support to the positive volume-price yield correlation.","[Arbel, Yuval; Ben-Shahar, Danny] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, IL-32000 Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Sulganik, Eyal] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Arison Sch Business, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Reichman University,"Ben-Shahar, D (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, IL-32000 Technion, Haifa, Israel.",arbely18@technion.ac.il; dannyb@technion.ac.il; sulganik@idc.ac.il,,"Arbel, Yuval/0000-0003-4365-6280",,,,,70,8,8,0,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Real estate may thus become more desirable if its returns are negatively serially correlated. While it could be important for long-horizon investors, time diversification has been mostly investigated in asset menus without real estate and focusing on in-sample experiments. This article evaluates, ex post, the out-of-sample gains from diversification when equity real estate investment trusts (REITs) belong to the investment opportunity set. We find that diversification into REITs increases both the Sharpe ratio and the certainty equivalent of wealth for all investment horizons and for both classical and Bayesian (who account for parameter uncertainty) investors. The increases in Sharpe ratios are often statistically significant. However, the out-of-sample average Sharpe ratio and realized expected utility of long-horizon portfolios are frequently lower than that of a one-period portfolio, which casts doubt on the value of time diversification.","[Fugazza, Carolina] Univ Turin, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy; [Fugazza, Carolina] CeRPCCA, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy; [Guidolin, Massimo] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Guidolin, Massimo] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Nicodano, Giovanna] CeRP CCA, Netspar, Italy; [Nicodano, Giovanna] Univ Turin, I-10134 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Manchester; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Turin,"Fugazza, C (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy.",fugazza@cerp.unito.it; Massimo.Guidolin@stls.frb.org; Giovanna.Nicodano@unito.it,,"NICODANO, Giovanna/0000-0003-2098-2331; FUGAZZA, Carolina/0000-0003-0900-983X",,,,,46,20,21,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2009,37.0,3,,,,,341.0,381,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00245.x,0.0,,,41,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,489AO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269392000001,0

We construct an index of urbanicity from longitudinal data on community characteristics from the China Health and Nutrition Survey and compute, for the first time, a rank-based measure of inequality in disease risk factors by degree of urbanicity. Prevalence rates of overweight and hypertension almost doubled between 1991 and 2004 and these disease risk factors became less concentrated in more urbanized areas. Decomposition analysis reveals that one-half of the Urbanicity-related inequality in overweight is directly attributable to community level characteristics, while for hypertension the contribution of such characteristics increased from 20% in 1991 to 62% in 2004. At the individual level, lower engagement in physical activity and farming explain more than half of the urban concentration of overweight and a rising share (28%) of the greater prevalence of hypertension in more urbanized areas.

This leads to employment adjustments. In the literature we find only very few contributions investigating the issue whether internal adjustments are linked and which relationships exist with external adjustments. Arc they of a complementary or substitutive nature? Furthermore, it is of interest to find out, whether we can observe an obvious trend and whether the adjustments are driven by cyclical movements. For this study we have an extensive data set of a large German manufacturing company, which supplies innovative products for the domestic and international market, provided on a monthly base from January 1999 to December 2005. The empirical analysis starts with descriptive statistics. We find that the employment adjustment cycle coincides only to a certain degree with the macroeconomic cycle. Internal and external adjustments are more characterized by complementarity than by substitution. Over the observed period we cannot detect analogous wage adjustments. It is noticeable that in 2003 compared with the years before the number of employees is substantially reduced. The econometric investigation is based oil a two-stage approach. We start with a bivariate probit estimation in order to extract the relationship between the probability of overtime and of promotion. Unobserved variables have opposite effects on the former and the latter adjustment instrument. Furthermore, we detect a negative trend of internal employment adjustments. Cyclical effects are ambiguous. The next step, the determination of external adjustments with respect to overtime and promotion adjustments, is split into two estimates. On the one hand we do not distinguish between the type of external employment adjustment and on the other hand we use this information separating between quits, layoffs, workers with a cancellation agreement and with a transition into a transfer organisation. The first approach demonstrates that a promotion reduces the probability to leave the firm while overtime is positively associated with an external job change. This pattern holds generally speaking in the second, more detailed estimates. Quits are the exception. In this case we observe opposite effects. Finally, we cannot detect any influences of promotions on cancellation agreements.","[Gerlach, Knut] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Wirtschaftswissensch Liche Fak, Inst Arbeitsokon, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Huebler, Olaf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Wirtschaftswissensch Liche Fak, Inst Empir Wirtschaftsforsch, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Leibniz University Hannover,"Gerlach, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Wirtschaftswissensch Liche Fak, Inst Arbeitsokon, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",gerlach@aoek.uni-hannover.de; huebler@ewifo.uni-hannover.de,,"Hubler, Olaf/0000-0003-4872-6954",,,,,22,2,3,0,4,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The results provide empirical evidence that postseason restructurings in 1969 and 1995 enhanced the PU significantly and had positive effects on fan demand for MLB.

To this end, it estimates a simple monetary DSGE model with private-sector learning, but which also includes more structural sources of inertia, such as habit formation in consumption and inflation indexation. Economic agents are assumed to form near-rational expectations and to learn the model parameters over time. Likelihood-based Bayesian methods are used to estimate the agents' beliefs jointly within the system and to provide evidence on the fit of alternative learning rules. The results show that European macroeconomic inertia has only moderately changed over the sample. The evidence is consistent with a small gain coefficient and low degrees of habits and indexation, although some uncertainty remains after the estimation.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Milani, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,,,,,,,37,5,6,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The main finding is that, despite a relative wage erosion detected in the contract data, banking workers were able to enjoy an increasing wage premium in the period 1985-2000, probably reflecting the increasing profitability of the industry and the rise in labour productivity. The evidence also shows that some specific groups benefited relatively more than others: the least skilled and educated workforce and male workers gained more from the regulatory reforms. However, this unequal sharing of the wage premium did not raise wage inequality across ownership groups in the industry.","Univ Minho & NIPE, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Monteiro, NP (通讯作者)，Univ Minho & NIPE, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",N.Monteiro@eeg.uminho.pt,"Monteiro, Natalia/B-5868-2009","Monteiro, Natalia/0000-0002-4821-7685",,,,,45,1,3,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our result relies on a valuation-based volume-characterization theorem due to Klain and Rota (Introduction to Geometric Probability, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1997) and helps to highlight some quite unusual conditions under which the volume-ranking can be justified as a freedom-ranking of opportunity sets.

Intending to make money essential, random-matching models introduced decentralisation by considering pair-wise transactions. Nevertheless, in both cases top-level equilibrium constrains agents' behaviour. Instead, here we use a bottom-up approach. In a competitive market, decentralised autonomous agents meet and exchange a commodity for money. Their decisions use minimal information. They are triggered by simple rules founded on a satisficing procedure and on a random decision process that simulates bounded rationality. The conclusions are, first, that non-monetary costs are essential to avoid collapse of the economy. Second, mainly price setters who are adequately satisfied achieve equilibrium protecting themselves by evolving advantages to avoid competition that is too tough. Third, and the most important conclusion is that money ceases to be neutral as soon as competition arises between individual firms.","Ecole Cent Paris, ERASME, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Galand, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Cent Paris, ERASME, Paris, France.",galand@ecp.fr,,,,,,,36,1,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

These models place strong restrictions on how brand share and purchase incidence price elasticities are related. In this paper, we propose a new model of brand choice, the price consideration (PC) model, that allows more flexibility in this relationship. In the PC model, consumers do not observe prices in each period. Every week, a consumer decides whether to consider a category. Only then does he/she look at prices and decide whether and what to buy. Using scanner data, we show the PC model fits much better than MNL or NMNL. Simulations reveal the reason: the PC model provides a vastly superior fit to inter-purchase spells.

However, there is little empirical evidence to explicitly illustrate how housing price dynamics measured by both past price changes and price volatility at housing unit level affect housing turnovers. Using a unique housing transaction database from Singapore condominium market, this paper reveals an interesting housing turnover pattern in response to past housing price dynamics. The results illustrate that the rise and fall of a dwelling's price can significantly affect housing turnovers in the same direction. Higher volatility reduces housing turnovers. The effects are stronger in the domain of losses and are weakening as the cumulative housing equity rises, implying that a seller withholds the sale in the downswing of a real estate cycle in the hope that the market will rebound. The findings offer some additional micro empirical evidence to the interactions between housing price and transaction volume and imply upwardly biased repeat sales indexes.","[Tu, Yong; Ong, Seow Eng; Han, Ying Hua] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Sch Design & Environm, Singapore 119260, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Tu, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Sch Design & Environm, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",rsttuy@nus.edu.sg,"Ong, Seow Eng/ABB-9098-2020; Tu, Yong/H-8035-2013","Tu, Yong/0000-0002-4581-3676",,,,,48,11,11,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Two types of households are considered. One household acquires human capital or skills through education while the other household remains low-skilled. Sustained growth is the result of human capital accumulation which is a function of the existing human capital employed in the educational sector and of public spending for teaching materials. Both households are affected by unemployment and, if so, receive unemployment benefits. The government levies an income tax and uses its revenues to pay unemployment benefits, to finance transfers to the low-skilled household and to finance human capital accumulation.

Evidence from regression-adjusted difference-in-differences estimates, estimated by piecewise constant exponential duration models, indicates that 9/11 did not cause a severe decline in job prospects for individuals with a nationality from a predominantly Muslim country. This result is robust when looking at Turks, individuals with a nationality from an Arab country and individuals from Non-Arab, but predominantly Muslim countries relative to a number of control groups.

However, similar functions for aircraft operating in unmanaged airspace have received comparatively little analysis despite the fact that these functions are stressed to a greater physical degree, and perhaps more frequently, than in managed airspace. The mid-air collision hazard and its associated risk are re-examined from both an historical and a systematic engineering modelling viewpoint. Historic measures of this transport risk in managed airspace have been based on fatalities normalized by flight hours or flight movements. However some of these data may not be available in unmanaged airspace. Another approach to measurement directs attention to populations at risk where several measures are now well known: collective risk, individual risk and the frequency of occurrence of the hazards that give rise to such risk. A decision support methodology is presented that relates both transport and population-based approaches. A cohesive and consistent set of aspired goals for various stakeholder groups can be set taking into account the different stakeholder needs. A case study is drawn from historic mid-air collision data to illustrate the process. A consistent basis for national-level policy decisions harmonised with proactive engineering design requirements is achieved. The strengths, limitations and implications of this approach for engineering design purposes are discussed. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the possibility for a similar paradox to occur under alternative specifications of the collective preference relation. The generalized Ostrogorski paradox occurs when the issue-wise majority rule leads to an outcome which is not maximal according to some binary relation phi defined over pairs of alternatives. We focus on three possible definitions of phi, whose sets of maximal elements are respectively the Uncovered Set, the Top-Cycle, and the Pareto Set. We prove that a generalized paradox may prevail for the Uncovered Set. Moreover, it may be avoided for the same issue-wise majority margins as for the Ostrogorski paradox. However, the issue-wise majority rule always selects a Pareto-optimal alternative in the Top-Cycle.","[Laine, Jean] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34387 Istanbul, Turkey; [Laine, Jean] Univ Caen, CREM, F-14032 Caen, France; [Laffond, Gilbert] CREST ENSAI, F-35170 Bruz, France; [Laffond, Gilbert] Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Lab Econometrie, F-75003 Paris, France",Istanbul Bilgi University; Universite de Caen Normandie; Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI); heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM),"Lainé, J (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Dept Econ, Kustepe Campus,Inonu Cad 28, TR-34387 Istanbul, Turkey.",laffond@cnam.fr; jean_laine@hotmail.fr,,"LAINE, Jean/0000-0002-7305-7556",,,,,39,13,13,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2009,32.0,2,,,,,317.0,333,,10.1007/s00355-008-0325-9,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,393ZH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262414500009,0

Using appropriate instruments for the dollarization ratio, the study overcomes the simultaneous equation problem and correctly estimates a negative coefficient for the dollarization ratio in the interest rate equation. It confirms the theoretical prediction that a strategy of dedollarizing the economy will raise the equilibrium domestic real interest rate if the strategy fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks.

Security regionalism has had greater success than economic regionalism, even though economic initiatives would bring great benefits to the economy and population. I propose a connection between patrimonialism and regionalism. Central Asia's patrimonial leaders are driven by survival and personal enrichment, and are beholden to informal vested interests. Since economic regionalism involves liberalisation that adversely affects these actors, the result is 'virtual' economic regionalism at best. In the case of security regionalism, some regional organisations progress because they bolster patrimonial regimes, with negative consequences for democracy.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Collins, K (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, 1331 Social Sci Bldg,256 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",Colli433@umn.edu,,,,,,,114,86,91,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,2,,,,,249.0,281,PII 908745400,10.1080/09668130802630854,0.0,,,33,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,410IF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263570000003,0

Contrary to this conclusion, I argue that economic nationalism is not inconsistent with globalization. States are not only active participants in globalization but they continue to strategically express nationalism in new global settings by supporting national firms and citizens overseas. By redefining economic nationalism from protectionism to the leveraging of national resources to secure economic benefits from the world economy, this paper provides an alternative view of economic nationalism. This paper analyzes economic nationalism as a dynamic concept. Empirically, it takes up three Indian industries (steel, auto, software) since 1950 to understand how nationalism was practiced and how it has changed under globalization. The paper establishes India's pursuit of economic nationalism under globalization through its support of Indian businesses and citizens abroad. Though the coherence of nationalism may be weak, it can still be expressed in looser forms of national 'presence' abroad.","Copenhagen Business Sch, Asia Res Ctr, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"D'Costa, AP (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Asia Res Ctr, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,,,,,,,76,21,22,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

He also put forward some ideas-the role of needs in the determination of market prices, a process of gravitation towards equilibrium, a quid pro quo theory of taxation-which attracted Turgot's attention. Had it not been neglected, Graslin's approach could well have formed a possible foundation for Classical economics-broadly defined as proposing a system of equilibrium 'natural' prices based on the conditions of production, with market prices oscillating around them. In the present article I first explore Graslin's basic motivation. I then deal with his 'three stages' theory of society, which lies at the core of his analytical argument. Then follows an analysis of his principle ideas in respect of needs, wealth and value, of production equilibrium and prices, and finally of public economics.","Univ Pantheon Assas, ERMES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Faccarello, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, ERMES, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",gilbert.faccarello@u-paris2.fr,,,,,,,39,6,6,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

One of the cheaper and more important sources of natural gas supply is accounted for by reserve appreciation, i.e., reserve growth, in known fields. Based on an extensively applied methodology developed by Arrington (1960), the increase in proved ultimate recovery is presumed to increase at a diminishing rate with the age of the field. In this paper, a single equation model of natural gas reserve growth in the Gulf of Mexico is developed and estimated. The results strongly suggest that the annual growth rate in the reserves of afield is significantly affected by initial discovery size, price, water depth, and unobserved field-specific effects. Hence, estimating oil and gas reserve growth using an Arrington based approach may underestimate the response of reserve growth to changes in economic fundamentals.","[Forbes, Kevin F.] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Econ & Business, Ctr Study Energy & Environm Stewardship, Washington, DC 20064 USA",Catholic University of America,"Forbes, KF (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Econ & Business, Ctr Study Energy & Environm Stewardship, Washington, DC 20064 USA.",Forbes@CUA.edu,"Forbes, Kevin F/A-7825-2009","Forbes, Kevin/0000-0002-9521-6845",,,,,26,2,2,0,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,,,,,,,201.0,213,,,,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,514JQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271390900014,0

This male dominated industry employs limited numbers of women with fewer numbers of women in management. The study analyses data from a unique set of equal opportunity progress reports from all organisations in the transport industry that are required to provide public reports under Australian legislation. The findings indicate a correlation between some approaches to equal opportunity and increased numbers of women in some areas. The study is equally remarkable for what it does not find. Despite widespread equal opportunity implementation across a broad number of employment measures there are limited measures that predict increases in the numbers of women in management or in non-traditional roles. This Study differs from others in that it identifies issues specific to one industry and links organisational approach to equal opportunity with the employment status of both women and men.

By contrast, recent empirical evidence suggests that, similar to pegs, floating regimes are affected by transmissions of nominal quantities such as inflation or nominal interest rates from abroad. For the case of a four dimensional subsystem of the G7, we highlight the strength of international comovements in liquidity adjusted breakeven inflation interpreted as a measure of future inflation prospects. Results indicate that economies with geographical proximity and strong trade linkages (e.g. Canada and the U.S., the UK and EMU) share highest realized correlations of nonstationary breakeven rates. Moreover, these linkages appear strengthened if corresponding exchange rates are relatively stable or if the respective large economy is in a state of relatively uncertain inflation expectations.","[Herwartz, Helmut; Roestel, Jan] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Herwartz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",herwartz@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de; jr@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The study begins by demonstrating that workers in less-developed countries are significantly underpaid relative to their labor productivity, and that this outcome causes the monetary values of goods exported from these countries to underestimate the actual amount of labor inputs embodied within them. From this observation, it is hypothesized that North-South trade, unlike North-North trade, should increase per-capita incomes in affluent countries, while also reducing employment in their manufacturing sectors. Using a simultaneous equations model, the study compares this theoretical expectation to the actual experiences of 18 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries between 1970 and 2003. The results are generally consistent with expectations. The study concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Kollmeyer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Aberdeen, Scotland.",,,,,,,,45,7,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

RRP generates a proximity matrix which might be useful in econometric applications like average treatment effect estimation. RRP is a Monte Carlo method that randomly generates non-empty recursive partitions of the data and evaluates the proximity between two observations as the empirical frequency they fall in a same cell of these random partitions over all Monte Carlo replications. From the proximity matrix it is possible to derive both graphical and analytical tools to evaluate the extent of the common support between data sets. The RRP method is honest in that it does not match observations at any cost: if data sets are separated, the method clearly states it. The match obtained with RRP is invariant under monotonic transformation of the data. Average treatment effect estimators derived from the proximity matrix seem to be competitive compared to more commonly used estimators. RRP method does not require a particular structure of the data and for this reason it call be applied when distances like Mahalanobis or Euclidean are not suitable, in the presence of missing data or when the estimated propensity score is too sensitive to model specifications.

This paper estimates six DSGE models in order to determine, which model provides better data fit. One model is the most general one and others are its nested submodels. These are models of closed economy and include price and wage rigidities modelled in Calvo style. Three models include simple CRRA period utility function and other three models contain CRRA period utility function with habit formation in consumption. Two models assume traditional Calvo price setting mechanism, in which non-optimizing agents leave their price unchanged. Other two models assume partial price indexation in Calvo price setting mechanism, in which a part of non-optimizing agents adjust their prices according to past inflation. Last two models assume full price indexation in Calvo price setting mechanism, in which all non-optimizing agents adjust their prices according to past inflation. The models were estimated on data of US economy. All models were estimated using Bayesian techniques, particularly Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (using Dynare toolbox for Matlab). The data fit measure is posterior odds ratio calculated from marginal likelihood, acquired from Bayesian estimation. Results suggest that including habit formation improves significantly the data fit of the models, whereas including price indexation does not.","[Slanicay, Martin; Vasicek, Osvald] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,slanicay@mail.muni.cz; osvald@econ.muni.cz,"Vašíček, Osvald/AAR-5742-2021","Vašíček, Osvald/0000-0003-3805-4939",,,,,2,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,301.0,305,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900055,0

So, we integrate resources/capability theory and organization learning theory to develop a model of relationship among resources management, organization learning and innovative performance. We put forward to that strategic resources management will influence whether firm engage in exploitative or exploratory learning. The two types of organization learning will influence the performances of innovation.

Little research has been done on disadvantaged groups who were often restricted from participation in social networks that provide information necessary for invention and innovation. Unique new data on African American inventors and patentees between 1843 and 1930 permit an empirical investigation of the relation between social capital and economic outcomes. I find that African Americans used both traditional, i.e., occupation-based, and nontraditional, i.e., civic, networks to maximize inventive output and that laws constraining social-capital formation are most negatively correlated with economically important inventive activity.

In contrast to extant literature for other countries, a trivariate vector autoregression for short-run sentiment, medium-run sentiment, and stock index returns allows to reject exogeneity of returns. Depending on the chosen VAR specification, returns are found to either follow a feedback process caused by medium-run sentiment, or returns form a simultaneous systems together with the two sentiment measures. An out-of-sample forecasting experiment on the base of estimated subset VAR models shows significant exploitable linear structure. However, trading experiments do not yield convincing evidence of significant economic gains from the VAR forecasts, and it appears that predictability of returns from sentiment decreases during the recent market gyrations.","[Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshausen Str 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",lux@bwl.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,18,44,47,2,25,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Twenty-year-old men were liable to serve if their date of birth was drawn out. The randomness of the ballot was seen as an equitable method of selection for a system of labour coercion that was potentially life-threatening. We investigate the various stages of conscription of these 'national servicemen' for army service in Vietnam from 1965 to 1972 and evaluate the extent to which the processes provided for fair and equitable selection.

The framework is extended from Smit's and Trigeorgis' option portfolio framework to incorporate network synergies. The adaptive planning framework is defined and tested on a case study with time series origin-destination demand data. Historically, OD time series data is costly to obtain, and there has not been much need for it because most transportation models use a single time-invariant estimate based on deterministic forecasting of demand. Despite the high cost and institutional barriers of obtaining abundant OD time series data, we illustrate how having higher fidelity data along with an adaptive planning framework can result in a number of improved management strategies.

Industry-leading companies such as McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks and Wendy's appear to be, through their websites, leading communicators of green practices.

This issue is frequently addressed through specification of regression models for health care use (y-often measured by number of doctor visits) including, among other covariates, a measure of self-assessed health (sah). However, the exogeneity of sah within those models has been questioned, due to the possible presence of unobservables influencing both y and sah, and because individuals' health assessments may depend on the quantity of medical care received. This article addresses the possible simultaneity of (sah, y) by adopting a full information approach, through specification of the bivariate probability function (p.f.) of these discrete variables, conditional on a set of exogenous covariates (x). The approach is implemented with copula functions, which afford separate consideration of each variable margin and their dependence structure. The specification of the joint p.f. of (sah, y) enables estimation of several quantities of potential economic interest, namely features of the conditional p.f. of y given sah and x. The adopted models are estimated through maximum likelihood, with cross-sectional data from the Portuguese National Health Survey of 1998-1999. Estimates of the margins' parameters do not vary much among different copula models, while, in accordance with theoretical expectations, the dependence parameter is estimated to be negative across the various joint models.","[Murteira, Jose M.

Mariotti (Review of Economic Studies, 66, 733-741, 1999) characterized the Nash bargaining solution using Nash's (Econometrica, 18, 155-162, 1950) scale invariance (SI) axiom and SSP. In this article, we introduce equity dominance (E-dominance). Using the intersection of SS-dominance and E-dominance requirements, we obtain a weaker version of SSP (WSSP). In addition, we consider alpha - SSP, where alpha measures the degree of minimum acceptable inequity aversion; alpha - SSP is weaker than weak Pareto optimality (WPO) when alpha = 1. We then show that it is still possible to characterize the Nash solution using WSSP and SI only or using alpha -SSP, SI, and individual rationality (IR) only for any alpha is an element of [0, 1). Using the union of SS-dominance and E-dominance requirements, we obtain a stronger version of SSP (SSSP). It turns out that there is no bargaining solution that satisfies SSSP and SI, but the Egalitarian solution turns out to be the unique solution satisfying SSSP.","[Anbarci, Nejat; Sun, Ching-jen] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Sun, CJ (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",nejat.anbarci@deakin.edu.au; cjsun@deakin.edu.au,,"Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086; Sun, Ching-jen/0000-0002-7363-3533",,,,,16,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2011,37.0,3,,,,,453.0,470,,10.1007/s00355-010-0499-9,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,811OJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294220700005,0

We first develop a simple model predicting that these devices are substitutes: when termination incentives are low, optimal contracts provide stronger pay-for-performance incentives. We then use data from real estate organizations to provide two independent tests of the model's central prediction. First, we use the fact that chief executive officers of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and general partners of Real Estate Limited Partnerships (RELPs) perform similar tasks, yet organizational features of RELPs ensure that the latter are much harder to terminate. Consistent with the model, we find that pay-for-performance sensitivity is much higher for general partners of RELPs, where the termination threat is less credible. Second, we use a recent cross-section of REITs to show that in property types where it is expected to be more costly to replace managers, those managers have stronger pay-for-performance incentives.","[Hallman, Greg; Hartzell, Jay C.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Finance, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Parsons, Christopher A.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Hallman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Finance, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",greg.hallman@mccombs.utexas.edu; jhartzell@mail.utexas.edu; chris_parsons@kenan-flagler.unc.edu,,,,,,,46,7,7,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2011,39.0,3,,,,,507.0,546,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00300.x,0.0,,,40,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,807NK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293905500005,0

More specifically, it investigates the relevance of state, instrumental and emotional workplace and family support, based on a survey of 7867 service-sector workers in eight European countries. The article starts by mapping available state, workplace and family support in order to determine which source dominates in which country and whether these sources match Esping-Andersen's welfare regime typology. The impact of the different support sources is then examined. Findings indicate that support for employee work-life balance satisfaction has a direct and moderating effect. Finally, results show that emotional support and instrumental support in the workplace have a complementary relationship. Whereas emotional family support has a positive impact on work-life balance satisfaction, instrumental family support does not.","[Abendroth, Anja-Kristin] Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, ICS, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [den Dulk, Laura] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Abendroth, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Sociol, ICS, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",A.K.Abendroth@uu.nl,"Abendroth, Anja-Kristin/ACJ-1392-2022; Dulk, Laura den/J-8102-2012","Abendroth, Anja-Kristin/0000-0003-1408-9395;",,,,,53,149,183,7,149,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We compare estimates of WTP under the assumption that higher-order beliefs are in equilibrium (i.e., consistent with the choice distribution) with models estimated using stated beliefs which relax the equilibrium requirement. We estimate WTP in the latter case by allowing stated beliefs to be correlated with guilt aversion, thus controlling for a possible source of a consensus effect. All models are estimated using data from an experiment of proposal and response conducted with a large and representative sample of the Dutch population. Our range of estimates suggests that responders are willing to pay between (sic)0.40 and (sic)0.80 to avoid letting down proposers by (sic)1. Furthermore, we find that WTP estimated using stated beliefs is substantially overestimated (by a factor of two) when correlation between preferences and beliefs is not controlled for.

Capital inflows are associated with higher incomes per capita in the long run, but capital flows also brought incomes down in the short run via financial crises. Countries just barely made up for these losses over time, so that there is no conditional long-run income loss or gain for countries that experienced crises. This is in contrast to the recent wave of globalization when capital importing countries that experienced a crisis seemed to grow relatively faster over fixed periods of time. Some countries avoided crises and were able to raise incomes with foreign capital.

It compares trade policies in individual Southeast Asian countries; places them in the context of regional and global economic integration; and particularly draws implications for the region from the rise of China and India. The first section looks at recent trade and FDI patterns in Southeast Asia. Then follows an overview of key trade-policy trends, in the region overall and in individual countries. The next sections examine ASEAN countries in international trade negotiations and agreements: first in the WTO, especially in the Doha Round; then within ASEAN; and finally on cross-regional FTAs. The paper concludes that ASEAN countries cannot rely on external tracks 'from above' for meaningful trade policy reform. Since the Asian crisis there has been a slowdown of reform momentum, and too much reliance on trade negotiations - especially FTAs. Rather, countries in the region have to rely on themselves - 'from below' as it were. The engine of liberalisation and regulatory reform has to be home-driven - as it was before the Asian crisis - with governments taking unilateral measures in response to internal and external conditions.","[Sally, Razeen] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Sally, Razeen] ISEAS, Singapore, Singapore; [Sen, Rahul] AUT Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sally, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,"Sen, Rahul/AFK-4535-2022","Sen, Rahul/0000-0002-8067-7876; Sally, Mohamed/0000-0001-9069-0188",,,,,44,9,11,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2011,34.0,4,,,,,568.0,601,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01336.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,745KA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289163100004,0

To the two mechanisms of conditionality and socialization commonly mentioned in the Europeanization literature, this article adds a third - external imposition - which is specific to the case of Bosnia. The fact that the High Representative resorted to coercive measures in order to implement European conditions needs to be accounted for in any explanation of Bosnia's Europeanization. In the case of police restructuring, conditionality was monopolized by the High Representative and socialization did not take place because the reforms were not perceived as legitimate by at least one of the parties. Domestic factors, including the complex governance system introduced by the Dayton Agreement and recalcitrant nationalist elites, also hindered the Europeanization process in Bosnia.","Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol BS8 1TY, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Juncos, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 4 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TY, Avon, England.",a.e.juncos@bristol.ac.uk,,"Juncos, Ana E./0000-0002-6913-351X",,,,,40,38,40,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Individuals use outside options in two different ways. Actual outside options reflect the possibility to exit or to join other existing groups. Hypothetical outside options refer to hypothetical groups that are ultimately not formed. Articulation of hypothetical outside options in the bargaining process determines the relative bargaining power of the members of a group, which constitutes an instance of the power of voice. The adopted equilibrium concept, competitive equilibrium with free group formation and bargaining cum voice, endogenizes the outside options as well as the power of voice.

Unlike extant studies, this study employs a more reliable method of estimation, known as the generalised method of moments system, for establishing the importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) with regard to de-industrialisation. For a general assessment of the different factors of de-industrialisation, including FDI, this study classifies the causes of de-industrialisation in OECD countries into external and internal factors.

It explores this engagement as governing practices that have emanated quite independently from the interstate system commonly understood to be at the core of the anti-corruption regime. It demonstrates how corporate anti-corruption ties in with a relatively new way of perceiving corruption. In this framing, anti-corruption comes out as risk management, which is latched on to notions of corporate social responsibility and business ethics. Moreover, the constitution of corruption risk relates to the rise of new actors and networks engaged in a wider business of anti-corruption, including commercial and hybrid actors that supply corporations with managerial instruments, benchmarks for best practice, rankings, and information and surveillance systems. This facilitates the enrollment of corporations into the anti-corruption cause while cultivating their competitiveness aspirations. The article offers a novel perspective on international anti-corruption and the position of business herein, and in a wider sense, it also contributes discussions about the role of private actors and their micro practices in global governance.","[Hansen, Hans Krause] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Hansen, HK (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,,,,,90,17,19,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

At the heart of this transformation are the juridification of international politics and subsequently the judicialisation of international law. This contribution argues that scholars of critical International Political Economy have not yet paid enough attention to this process. What is needed is a theory of international law that is able to grasp the societal implications of this transformation. In a first step some accounts drawing on Antonio Gramsci and Evgeny Pashukanis are presented, with a view to making their theory fruitful for analysing international law. Against the background of an empirical study that compares the global regulation of trade in goods with the trade in services, delivered notably through natural persons, some major shortcomings of these accounts are outlined. The last part of the contribution presents some ideas on how to further develop a critical theory of international (trade) law that introduces a communicative dimension into the legal turn with a view to distinguishing between different extra-economic dynamics.","Univ Lausanne, Inst Polit & Int Studies, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Hartmann, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Inst Polit & Int Studies, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",E.Hartmann@unil.ch,,,,,,,108,10,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In a previous study, a forward suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) cDNA library was constructed to isolate differentially expressed genes at early stage of post-harvest banana ripening. SSH was performed with cDNA from banana fruit on the day of harvest as the driver and cDNA from banana fruit 2 days post harvest (DPH) as the tester. A total of 289 clones in the SSH library were sequenced. BLASTX results revealed that 191 cDNAs had significant sequence homologies with known sequences in the NCBI database (2006). Of the 191 cDNAs, 138 were singletons and 53 belonged to divergent clusters containing 2-8 sequences. The identified cDNAs encoding proteins are involved in cellular processes such as metabolism, protein destination and storage, protein synthesis, signal transduction, transport and intracellular traffic, cell structure, growth and division, transcription and post-transcription, and disease and defence. To characterise differentially expressed cDNAs in the SSH library, cDNA microarray analysis was conducted. A total of 26 cDNAs in the 2-DPH banana fruit were found to be up-regulated, and these results were confirmed by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

The literature on mortgage default and prepayment is often used to inform credit risk policies and asset pricing strategies. This literature has evolved from the use of logistic regressions to the use of survival and frailty models that control for unobserved heterogeneity. In this paper, we apply a shared-frailty survival model to analyze the mortgage termination risks. In particular, we investigate whether mortgages originated in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) share common unobserved factors and how these factors affect the mortgage termination risks. The paper demonstrates that MSA-level frailty, together with other risk factors, has significant effects on the probability of mortgage terminations risks.","[Li, Xiaowei] Discover Financial Serv, Riverwoods, IL 60015 USA; [Kau, James B.] Univ Georgia, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real State, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Keenan, Donald C.] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Li, XW (通讯作者)，Discover Financial Serv, 2500 Lake Cook Rd, Riverwoods, IL 60015 USA.",jkau@terry.uga.edu; dkeenan@uga.edu; helloxiaowei@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,8,11,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This study analyzes the influence of education and income on the relationship between BMI and mortality and between height and mortality. It is based on data collected between 1963 and 1975 by the Norwegian National Health Screening Service. 1.7 million subjects were recorded. The Norwegian statistics bureau linked these data to the national death records and to socioeconomic information. We apply Cox proportional hazards regressions in order to determine whether adding income and education as covariates affects the relations among BMI, height, and mortality. Previous findings and insights are either not present or ambiguous. We conclude that the omission of SES does not significantly bias the effect of BMI on most causes of death, with one exception: type 2 diabetes mellitus, where the effect of BMI is substantially lower for both adults and adolescents when adjusted for education.

The joint distribution of the interzone rainstorm and the flood level of outer Yuanshui River in Taoyuan County were established and the density of the bivariate joint probability is used to describe the chance of the bivariate encounter. Then we calculated the return period under different encounter situation. By the statistic of loss data and the division of the flood class at the county level, we analyzed the risk probability. The cases study indicates that the Copula function is able to simulate well in flood disaster in Taoyuan County, the results have great reference value in the local construction of flood control and the improvement of risk management.

Data were available for height and socio-demographic factors from a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of 4477 subjects above 18 years. Recruitment was between 2005 and 2006. Mean age of all subjects was 46.1 +/- 15.1 years. Mean height of males and females were 163.6 +/- 6.9 cm and 151.4 +/- 6.4 cm respectively. Mean height showed a significant negative correlation with age (p<0.001, r = -0.207). Highest mean height in females 154.0 +/- 5.9 cm and males 165.6 +/- 6.9 cm were observed in those born after 1977. Rural females (151.4 +/- 6.2 cm) were significantly taller than the urban (151.3 +/- 7.2 cm). However, this was not observed in males. In multivariate analysis, year of birth, level of education and household income were significantly associated with height. Height demonstrated a significant negative correlation with systolic blood pressure (r = -0.032), presence of diabetes (r = -0.069), total cholesterol (r = -0.106), HDL cholesterol (r = -0.142) and LDL cholesterol (r = -0.104). Height was associated with household income and level of education in Sri Lanka and demonstrated a distinct increasing trend over successive generations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Despite sharing the same objectives and technology, Portugal opted for a crown monopoly, England, the Netherlands, and Sweden franchised trade to private merchants, whereas in Denmark and France, king and merchants shared control. The financial condition of the crown appears to have been relevant for the monarchs' decision. I provide an economic mechanism to illuminate the historical variation in terms of the differences in relative endowments of king and merchants within each country. I also explore the implications of control allocation using archival data on labor compensation and shipping technology.

In a trilogy of books published between 1994 and 2007 Arrighi develops the master concept of his theoretical legacy, systemic cycles of accumulation, and advances an original reading of the history and dynamics of world capitalism as a succession of hegemonic episodes, each one more expansive than the previous and culminating in crises and chaotic transitions. He anticipated the rise of a Chinese-led East Asia as the emergent twenty-first century centre of a reorganised world economy and society. Arrighi is faulted for failing to develop any theory of politics, the state and collective agency in his construct, for his lack of attention to social forces from below, and for his dismissal of recent theorising on globalization.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Robinson, WI (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",wirobins@soc.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,22,9,14,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Understanding the infection process of Foc is a prerequisite for effective control and management of this disease. To visualise the infection process, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of tropical race 4 of Foc and characterised early events in infection and disease development in Cavendish plantlets. With fluorescence microscopy, the labelled strain was observed to infect roots, colonise the root mesocotyl and, finally, the plant pseudostem. These studies indicated that the preferential colonisation sites on the root surface were grooves along the junction of the epidermal cells. This resulted in mosaic patterns of infection that developed after specific epidermal and cortical cells were infected by intercellular hyphae, while surrounding cells remained free of fungus. Finally, hyphae developed inside xylem vessels of fully colonised, rotted roots. Specific infection structures, such as appressoria, were not observed. These observations clarify events that occur after Cavendish is infected by this important pathogen and provide new clues to explore infection mechanisms of Foc. More detailed knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction could help develop more efficient ways to control the disease.","[Yin, X. M.; Wang, B. Z.; Ma, W. H.; Mao, H. T.; Li, J. Y.; Sheng, Z.

This article examines this transition for what it can tell us about the value of diversity strategies as a means for widening access to the corporate legal profession on the basis of social class, focusing on five elite law firms based in the City of London. A number of studies have demonstrated how cultural practices within the legal sector maintain exclusionary mechanisms based on class. There has been less attention to how this is sustained within an amended institutional framework which outwardly 'celebrates' difference. This research suggests that though diversity strategies do little to change organisational cultures, those that recognise both the depth of professional prejudice within the sector and the reality of educational inequality across the UK may prove relatively progressive nonetheless.","Cass Business Sch, Fac Management, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Ashley, L (通讯作者)，Cass Business Sch, Fac Management, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",louise.ashley.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,63,69,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, most studies did not explicitly quantify the contribution of residential self-selection to the connection. Using the 2006 data collected from a regional travel diary in Raleigh, NC, this study applies propensity score matching to explore the effects of the regional location of individuals' residences on their vehicle miles driven. We found that residential location plays a more important role in affecting driving behavior than residential self-selection; and that the self-selection effect is non-trivial when we compare driving behavior between urban residents and people living in other areas. Therefore, for such comparisons, the observed influence of residential locations on driving should be appropriately discounted when we evaluate the causal impacts of the built environment on travel behavior.

J,"Georges, P",,,,"Georges, Patrick",,,Dispensing with NAFTA Rules of Origin? Some Policy Options,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMY,"The objective of this paper is to use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) methodology to estimate the economic gains, for both Canada and Mexico, of: (1) adopting a North American customs union (CU) that would also liberalise rules of origin (ROO); and (2) reviving the WTO scenario of multilateral free trade, thereby eliminating preferential commerce and thus the need for preferential ROO across free trade agreements (FTAs). Such a CGE methodology is useful as the approach permits computation of an efficiency (or ex post) cost of ROO that might, in some contexts, be more relevant than the existing ex ante indices of ROO restrictiveness, which are unable to account for the fact that the use of preferential access in an FTA (and the concomitant ROO compliance) is an option, not an obligation. The paper shows that the erosion of NAFTA tariff preferences at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, which resulted from a different phasing of the NAFTA and Uruguay Round measures, has reduced the efficiency cost of NAFTA ROO, making these rules economically less relevant, especially for Canada, and therefore limiting somewhat the gains from liberalising them through a CU. Given this, the WTO scenario of multilateral free trade remains the approach that would deliver the largest economic gains in terms of GDP and welfare, while making preferential commerce and ROO obsolete.","Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Georges, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1606.0,1637,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01279.x,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100010,0

Prior to 1950, no expedition was successful in making an ascent and almost half of expeditions experienced a death, frostbite, or altitude sickness. By the 1990s, however, over half of the expeditions would successfully make an ascent and only about one in seven would experience an adverse outcome. Our objective is to distinguish between the effects of learning by doing and knowledge spillovers versus the effects of changes in technology or economic organization in explaining these results. As we can identify each climber by name and nationality, as well as each expedition team's methods and outcomes, we are able to disentangle the effects of learning at the individual, national, and international levels from effects due to improvements in climbing technology or changes in organizational methods and objectives. We find evidence that both individual learning by doing and learning through knowledge spillovers have contributed to the observed increase in ascent rates and to the decrease in death, frostbite, and altitude sickness rates.","[Boyce, John R.] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Bischak, Diane P.] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Boyce, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",boyce@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,33,8,8,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

It has been pointed out that a gap emerged between observed and perceived inflation since the introduction of the euro notes and coins. Such a statement relies on the fact that inflation perceptions, measured by the well-known balance statistic from the European Commission's consumer survey, hiked after January 2002 and remained high thereafter, as opposed to the observed inflation, which has remained fairly stable. In this paper, we discuss the measurement of inflation perceptions, by comparing the balance statistic with a refined alternative measure, which is computed using the probability method. We argue that the balance statistic should be used carefully, as it can lead to misleading conclusions. In fact, we find no evidence, both for euro area and individual countries, of the breakdown in the relationship between observed and perceived inflation, as measured by the proposed alternative measure, at the time of the euro cash changeover.","[Dias, Francisco; Duarte, Claudia; Rua, Antonio] Banco Portugal, Econ Res Dept, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal,"Rua, A (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ Res Dept, Av Almirante Reis 71, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal.",antonio.rua@bportugal.pt,,"Rua, Antonio/0000-0003-2494-9758",,,,,31,7,7,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Higher housing prices may repel households and push them into neighboring areas, suggesting that separately identifying interactions within versus across local neighborhoods is important. Aggregate data and standard econometric models are unable to address the multiple identification problems that may arise from the simultaneity, spatial interaction, and unobserved spatial autocorrelation. Such problems can generate biased estimates that run counter to economic theory. Using Michigan census tract-level data, we estimate a spatial simultaneous equations model that jointly considers population change and housing values, while also explicitly modeling interactions within neighborhoods, spatial interactions across neighborhoods, and controlling for unobserved spatial correlations. After controlling for simultaneity and spatial autocorrelation, the results show that neighborhoods are likely to experience an increase in their housing values if they gain population and they are more likely to lose population if they experience an increase in housing values. Our results are consistent with theory and underscore the importance of accounting for spatial interdependencies between population change and housing values. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although the various asset classes we analyze yield significant gains in portfolio performance, even in the presence of short-sales constraints, the timeliness of the gains differs considerably across the asset classes. Our key result is that real estate and commodities and precious metals are the two asset classes that deliver portfolio gains when consumption growth is low and/or volatile, that is, when investors really care for such benefits. Our analysis highlights an important metric by which to judge the attractiveness of an asset class in a portfolio context, namely the timeliness of the gains in portfolio performance. Further, our results on the performance of real estate in both good times and bad times suggest that the typical institutional allocation to real estate may underweight the role of the asset class in a diversified portfolio context.","[Sa-Aadu, J.] Univ Iowa, Henry B Tippie Sch Management, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Shilling, James] Depaul Univ, Inst Housing Studies, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Tiwari, Ashish] Univ Iowa, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa; DePaul University; University of Iowa,"Sa-Aadu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Henry B Tippie Sch Management, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",jsa-aadu@uiowa.edu; shilling@depaul.edu; ashish-tiwari@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,41,22,24,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2010,38.0,3,,,,,529.0,565,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00276.x,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,639UL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281000000005,0

On the other hand, by specializing in teaching or being concurrently employed, adjuncts could enhance learning experiences.

I find that the estimation of structural parameters describing the Taylor rule and sticky contracts in prices and wages is particularly sensitive to the set of observables. In terms of the model's predictions, the exclusion of some observables may lead to estimated parameters with unexpected outcomes, such as recessions following a positive technology shock. More importantly, two ways to assess different sets of observables are proposed. These measures favor a dataset consisting of seven observables.

However, it is important that the assumed models are consistent with the stylized facts. For example selecting a normal distribution permits modeling two data characteristics-the mean and the variance, but it is not appropriate for data which are skewed or have thick tails. The adaptive methods developed here offer the flexibility found in many machine learning models, but lend themselves to statistical interpretation, as well. This paper contributes to the development of partially adaptive estimation methods that derive their adaptability from membership in families of distributions, which are distinguished by modifications of simple parameters.

We show that such sorting can be driven by asymmetric information in the labor market, specifically when firms do not know if a particular worker is of high or low skill. In a model with two types and two regions, workers of different skill levels are offered separating contracts in equilibrium. When mobile low skill worker population rises or there is technological change that favors high skilled workers, integration of both types of workers in the same region at equilibrium becomes unstable, whereas sorting of worker types into different regions in equilibrium remains stable. The instability of integrated equilibria results from firms, in the region to which workers are perturbed, offering attractive contracts to low skill workers when there is a mixture of workers in the region of origin.

Earlier research has shown that there has indeed been a tendency of convergence of social protection levels over the last decades. However, comparative studies frequently use indicators which may not be representative as measures of the welfare state. In this article we have done several convergence tests with the most recent data, using a variety of indicators of social protection: social expenditures, both at the macro and at the programme level, replacement rates of unemployment and social assistance benefits and poverty indicators. Together, these indicators provide a broader picture of the evolution of social protection. Our results are less clear cut than earlier findings. We still find convergence of social expenditure in EU countries over a longer period. However, this trend seems to have stagnated in recent years. The evidence is mixed for the other indicators. Replacement rates of unemployment benefits converged to a higher level, but social assistance benefits did not.

This approach has been developed following two methods: the stochastic parametric and the nonparametric deterministic models. Each method shows its advantages and disadvantages, but their joint application allows the best result appreciation. Therefore, we applied the two methods to estimate the technical efficiency scores in the irrigated schemes of Sidi Bouzid region. The results indicate the resource use inefficiency and the close correlation of the two models. However the technical efficiency scores measured by the parametric method are clearly higher, thus confirming that it is appropriate to consider the production function to estimate the stochastic frontier. The analysis of the production partial elasticities highlights that water is a determining factor in the production technological process.","[Chemak, Fraj; Dhehibi, Boubaker] Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Lab Econ Rurale, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Chemak, F (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron Tunisie, Lab Econ Rurale, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,"Chemak, Fraj/0000-0002-5164-5410; Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669",,,,,39,8,8,1,7,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2010,9.0,2,,,,,32.0,41,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,636RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280755800006,0

The standard asymptotic distribution of the test is an affine transformation of the symbolic entropy under the null hypothesis. The test statistic, with the proposed symbolization procedure, and its standard limit distribution have appealing theoretical properties that guarantee the general applicability of the test. An important aspect is that the test does not require specification of the W matrix and is free of a priori assumptions. We include a Monte Carlo study of our test, in comparison with the well-known Moran's I, the SBDS (de Graaff et al., 2001) and 7 test (Brett and Pinkse, 1997) that are two non-parametric tests, to better appreciate the properties and the behaviour of the new test. Apart from being competitive compared to other tests, results underline the outstanding power of the new test for non-linear dependent spatial processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the panoply of approaches to sales forecasting, relatively few published studies in forecasting address firm-specific sales forecasting model development for the construction industry. While there is evidence that events in the macroeconomy significantly affect the construction market, most published studies on construction sales forecasts using S-curve models are unable to account for the economic climate. This study proposes an approach that employs financial and macroeconomic indicators to forecast sales of large development and construction corporations. First, by using data for 37 large development and construction firms listed on the construction sector of the Taiwan Stock Exchange between 1997 and 2006, hypothesis tests uncover useful relationships between firm sales and financial and macroeconomic indicators. Second, based on these relationships, a two-stage mathematical modeling procedure is used to develop firm-specific sales forecasting models for three of the sample firms. Finally, out-of-sample forecasting accuracy is evaluated using Theil's U-statistic and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).","I Shou Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Dashu Township 840, Kaohsiung Cty, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Chen, HL (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, 1,Sec 1,Syuecheng Rd, Dashu Township 840, Kaohsiung Cty, Taiwan.",along314@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,10,11,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Within this point of view, its main preference properties will be characterized and its utility representation provided through local utilities with an explicit dependence on the assessed revenue's distribution (quantile) function. Then, an intuitive interpretation for the related probability dependence and the piecewise form of such utility will be introduced on an investment pricing context, in which a CVaR maximizer agent will behave in a relativistic way based on his previous estimates of the probability function. Finally, such functional will be extended to incorporate a larger range of risk-averse attitudes and its main properties and implications will be illustrated through examples, such as the so-called Allais Paradox.","Pontifical Univ Catholic Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Dept Elect Engn, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Street, A (通讯作者)，Pontifical Univ Catholic Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Dept Elect Engn, Marques Sao Vicente Str 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",street@ele.puc-rio.br,"Street, Alexandre/HKV-6109-2023","Street, Alexandre/0000-0003-1569-030X",,,,,28,22,22,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2010,68.0,1-2,,,,,49.0,68,,10.1007/s11238-009-9154-2,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,545RX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273755400004,0

It is of great use to analyse time series of ecological appropriation for food consumption of Chinese rural residents from the perspective of total agricultural land resources and then overall evaluation of resource basis to ensure food security with structure upgrading of food consumption. Firstly the appropriated land categories and domestic conversion factors of food consumption items were discussed. Accordingly, the ecological footprint (EF) model with refined factors was applied to macro-estimate the ecological pressure of food consumption and the changes of Chinese rural residents in the latest 30 years. The study indicated that ecological appropriation increased from 1.465 national standard acre (nsa) in 1980 to 1.782 nsa in 2006 with the changes of Chinese food consumption structure of rural residents, and especially the direct appropriated arable land has declined dramatically since 2000. The consumption category of grain was the largest category per capita in spite of decreasing percentage, so staple foods like grain products, vegetables were always laid the first place even though the consumption pattern has changed greatly. Food EF had a strong correlation with expenditure on food over the period; furthermore, it can be evidently proved by an elasticity of per capita meat and aquatic products EF 0.43. The overall ecological pressure of food EF of Chinese rural residents has increased unsteadily, as the grain-consuming animal products and aquatic product contributed to this. The comparison of dynamic analysis of food EF calculated by fixed yields and variable yields indicated that higher productivity of arable land has greatly alleviated the pressure on resources demanded by the process of structure upgrading of the food consumption of rural residents in China.

The permanent-income hypothesis is extended by taking demographic transition into consideration and using particular permanent income anticipation pattern to reflect Chinese saving behavior. The empirical analysis implies that saving rate is affected by length of the remaining earning years negatively, income growth rate positively and length of the remaining lifetime positively. The empirical result is consistent with the theoretical implications. And it also shows that net export and the saving rate are positively related and demonstrates that the influence of the total dependency on the saving rate is dependent on the value of the total dependency, that is, an increase in the total dependency results in a rise in the saving rate when the total dependency is larger than 63.8%, while the total dependency and the saving rate is related negatively when the total dependency is less than that. Eventually, we conclude that demographic transition affects the saving rate by changing the remaining earning years.","[Chen Yao] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Mangement Sch, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lin Deng; Cai Donghan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Mangement Sch, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,,,Innovative Experiment of National Undergraduate [091048611]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [70871094],Innovative Experiment of National Undergraduate; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the Innovative Experiment of National Undergraduate (Grant No.091048611) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.70871094).,,4,0,0,1,7,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-14-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,716.0,720,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298225400113,0

Simplified a little, it is a debate with two sides. To borrow Ivan Szelenyi's terms, one side constructs a 'hard' Karl Polanyi, the other a 'soft' one. The former advocated a socialist mixed economy dominated by redistributive mechanisms. He was a radical socialist for whom the market should never be the dominant mechanism of economic coordination. His 'soft' alter ego insisted that the market system remain essentially intact but be complemented by redistributive mechanisms. The 'double movement' - the central thesis of his 'Great Transformation' - acts, in this reading, as a self-correcting mechanism that moderates the excesses of market fundamentalism; its author was positioned within the social-democratic mainstream for which the only realistic desirable goal is a regulated form of capitalism. In terms of textual evidence there is much to be said for both interpretations. In this article I suggest a different approach, one that focuses upon the meaning of Polanyi's concepts in relation to their socio-political and intellectual environment.","Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Dale, G (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",gareth.dale@brunel.ac.uk,"Dale, Gareth/AAV-7142-2020","Dale, Gareth/0000-0003-4991-6063",,,,,65,52,55,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is very meaningful to promote the further development of urban travel services trade to define the status quo of the travel services trade in China's major cities accurately. This paper is based on 27 major cities in China. Using the existing statistic indicators and data, we works out an indicator system to evaluate the travel services trade development of China's major cities, which includes 6 primary indicators and 18 secondary indicators? Based on principal component analysis method, this paper evaluates the development of the urban travel services trade quantitatively. And then based on the method of cluster analysis, 27 major cities are divided into 5 main categories and 9 sub-categories. The travel services trade characteristics of each sub-category cities are analyzed.

The political culture of civil society in Latvia is relatively trusting, tolerant and pro-democratic, but elitist. The specific weaknesses of post-communist civil society can be attributed to the historical heritage of the communist regime as well as the context in which new foreign-funded civil society organisations emerged.","Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Uhlin, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",anders.uhlin@svet.lu.se,"Uhlin, Anders/L-5858-2019","Uhlin, Anders/0000-0002-3428-9573",,,,,38,11,12,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,5,,,,,829.0,852,PII 922843272,10.1080/09668136.2010.481388,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,609VO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278686200005,0

The analogy between the exchange of sentiments, opinions and goods is developed so that man may be seen as a 'commercial' animal. Economic transactions are seen as means for men to get the pleasures of social life and self approbation. Instead of highlighting man's autonomy and selfishness, Smith underlines the ethical character of economic agents made of justice, prudence, and self command, and their willingness to be approved by their fellows and by the impartial spectator.","Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Walraevens, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Benoit.Walraevens@malix.univ-paris1.fr,"Walraevens, Benoît/HTN-7772-2023",,,,,,43,13,14,0,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Such data are the yields of various crops, the prices of products and raw materials, the available quantities of production factors, etc. In this paper, a fuzzy multicriteria mathematical programming model is presented. This model is applied in a region of northern Greece with irrigated agriculture where the optimal production plan is achieved.

The empirical results are consistent with our expectations and suggest that programs of investments in public capital should be accompanied by additional policy measures that can remove the structural factors that hamper the total factor productivity growth in specific areas.","[Sena, Vania] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Destefanis, Sergio] Univ Salerno, CELPE & CSEF, I-84100 Salerno, Italy",Aston University; University of Salerno,"Sena, V (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",v.sena@aston.ac.uk,"Destefanis, Sergio/H-9336-2019","Destefanis, Sergio/0000-0003-3568-3414",,,,,58,4,5,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Drawing upon work histories it argues that discrimination on the grounds of age is bound up with gender, race and class. Older women described how all three categories had structured their working lives, with occupational and sectoral segregation underpinning a legacy of disadvantage. Intersectionality provides a tool to explore the interaction of social divisions over the life course, in preference to those privileging the instability and diversity of social identities. Although the testimonies of older women underline the need to situate their experiences within a unified system characterized by capitalist economic relations. The research enables analysis of the workers perceptions of the changing nature of work and the way that age can be constructed in terms of advantage and disadvantage within specific occupations and sectors already defined in terms of gender and race.","London Metropolitan Univ, Working Lives Res Inst, London EC3N 2EY, England",London Metropolitan University,"Moore, S (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, Working Lives Res Inst, 31 Jewry St, London EC3N 2EY, England.",Sian.Moore@londonmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,84,92,3,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The models offer a spectrum of transitional behavior among economies that includes convergence to a common steady-state path as well as various forms of transitional divergence and convergence. Mechanisms for modeling such transitions, measuring them econometrically, assessing group behavior and selecting subgroups are developed in the paper. Some econometric issues with the commonly used augmented Solow regressions are pointed out, including problems of endogeneity and omitted variable bias which arise under conditions of transitional heterogeneity. Alternative regression methods for analyzing economic transition are given which lead to a new test of the convergence hypothesis and a new procedure for detecting club convergence clusters. Transition curves for individual economies and subgroups of economies are estimated in a series of empirical applications of the methods to regional US data, OECD data and Penn World Table data.

Spillovers from multinational firms can be particularly beneficial to firms in less developed economies, because technological superiority and management expertise of foreign multinational firms yield various opportunities for learning. Yet, the importance of foreign firms' spillovers might vary with respect to two key features of domestic firms: their productivity level and their export status. In line with theories on the absorptive capacity of firms, we argue on the basis of an empirical analysis of Hungarian firms that larger and more productive firms are more able than smaller firms to reap spillovers from multinationals. However, the export status is found to be of minor importance once higher productivity is controlled for.","[Bekes, Gabor] HAS, Inst Econ, Helsinki, Finland; [Kleinert, Joern] Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Toubal, Farid] Univ Angers, Angers, France; [Toubal, Farid] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Universite d'Angers; Paris School of Economics,"Békés, G (通讯作者)，HAS, Inst Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Bekes, Gabor/0000-0002-6331-4408; Kleinert, Joern/0000-0002-1167-9245",,,,,42,26,29,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2009,32.0,10,,,,,1408.0,1433,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01179.x,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,509UH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271043400002,0

Current public sector preferential procurement policies have evolved in an environment of legal constraints in which procurement spending targeting MBEs has often been viewed as reverse discrimination. The objective of achieving a level playing field was adopted in response to this legal environment. Preferential procurement policies often miss their objectives, achieving perverse outcomes such as minimal assistance to MBEs and negligible local economic development impacts. Strategies for simultaneously achieving fundamental fairness in government procurement while increasing MBE capacity and job creation are identified.","Univ N Carolina, Kenan Inst, Minor Entrepreneurship Res Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Kenan Inst, Minor Entrepreneurship Res Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,,,,,25,15,25,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We isolate the rent effects of location density based on geographic information system (GIS) methodology, while controlling for variations in object characteristics in a cross-sectional hedonic model. While controlling for the age, location and quality of the object, we find a strong positive effect of being located in dense office areas. We find that the vicinity of other office objects is priced into rent levels, regardless of market conditions. This article extends existing literature by examining the influence of clustering outside the United States, during changing economic tides and by application of novel methodology, based on objective clustering schemes, which can be replicated for other geographic areas.","[Jennen, Maarten G.

This paper verifies these concerns by analyzing endogenous location choices by multi-store firms, which sell heterogeneous products and can charge different prices at every store. It takes a generalized transportation cost approach to Salop [Salop, S.C.. 1979. Monopolistic competition with outside goods. Bell journal of Economics 10, 141-156], in which consumers' utility not only depends on real transportation costs but also on their preferences or tastes. The model confirms that firms' location strategies contribute to retail sprawl. However. the resulting locations actually minimize consumers' generalized transportation costs for given sizes of retail chains. One of the implications is that further concentration in the retail industry is welfare improving. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Developing the right method of abandoning independence is thus a high-priority goal. However, little work has been done in this area outside of a few simple approaches. To fill the gap, we compare four methods based on distance metrics between judgment sets. The methods generalize the premise-based and sequential priority approaches to judgment aggregation, as well as distance-based preference aggregation. They each guarantee group consistency and implement a range of distinct functions with different properties, broadening the available tools for social choice. A central result is that only one of these methods (not previously considered in the literature) satisfies three attractive properties for all reasonable metrics.","[Miller, Michael K.; Osherson, Daniel] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Princeton University,"Miller, MK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, 130 Corwin Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mkmtwo@princeton.edu,,,,,,,45,56,57,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAY,2009,32.0,4,,,,,575.0,601,,10.1007/s00355-008-0340-x,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,418GG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264136100003,0

A new type of freight rate index, referred to as a repeat sailings index, is presented, which is similar to a type of index frequently applied to house prices. An econometric model of the freight rate market is estimated on monthly data from the 1850s. It is found that harvest failures, business cycles, the supply of tonnage and the Crimean War all significantly affected freight rates in this period. The Crimean War may have accounted for about a quarter of the surge in freight rates in the years prior to the outbreak of the War; once the War broke out in March 1854, however, it was of less importance.

Using a survey of Colorado golfers at 19 golf courses and a relatively novel hybrid individual observation and zonal travel cost model, the authors find the demand for golf is quite price inelastic with respect to transportation costs (-.433) and green fees (-.115). The typical golfer spends $8 oil transportation and $49 oil green fees/carts. The price inelastic demands translate into a consumer surplus of $18.44 per round of golf at Colorado golf courses. The annual net economic value to golfers in Colorado for the 7.8 million rounds of golf is $143.8 million.

When an equilibrium does exist, there are several possible outcomes. There may be 'conventional' equilibria where the rich are expropriated by the poor and middle class. There may be equilibria without full expropriation where redistribution is limited by the threat of evasion. Finally, there may be equilibria where redistribution goes from the middle class to the rich and poor.","[Borck, Rainald] Univ Passau, Dept Econ, D-94030 Passau, Germany; [Borck, Rainald] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",University of Passau; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Borck, R (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Dept Econ, D-94030 Passau, Germany.",rainald.borck@uni-passau.de,"Borck, Rainald/M-3077-2019","Borck, Rainald/0000-0003-0833-020X",,,,,23,11,14,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2009,32.0,3,,,,,439.0,454,,10.1007/s00355-008-0334-8,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,399FV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262786700007,0

The goal is the elaboration of a simple and operational model for every site, which allows calculating the production cost of a m(3) of pumped water, taking into account only the annual water need and the total manometric height. The model indicates that average pumping cost greatly depends on the amount of water supplied and on the total manometric height for both unconfined aquifer and groundwater. The production cost is on average 542 millimes and 801 millimes, respectively for unconfined aquifer and groundwater, that is to say an average increase of about 47% for the 4 sites of Kebili, Medenine, Gabes and Tozeur.",,,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2009,8.0,1,,,,,52.0,57,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,435MF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265347300008,0

In this model the governments provide public capital goods that are considered a factor of production. Thus, an optimal combination of the two taxes must be chosen. to maximize each jurisdiction's residents' consumption. It is argued that, in symmetric competition, the governments will employ only a land tax. However, in asymmetric competition, the signs of the wage taxes depend on jurisdiction sizes and the specific form of the production function. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We used Demographic and Health Survey data sets from 18 lower and middle income countries to explore paradoxical forms of malnutrition (maternal overweight with child underweight or stunting) in mother-child pairs. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of discordant pairs after adjusting for a number of important covariates. Several factors were significantly associated with an increased relative odds of discordant mother-child pairs, including working in subsistence agriculture, low levels of maternal education, more siblings in the household, and relative household poverty. However, many of these factors also predicted other combinations of poor nutritional status in mother-child pairs. We conclude that it is difficult to identify any specific factors that elevate risk above and beyond those that predict risk of maternal over-nutrition or child under-nutrition. Based on these analyses, it appears that paradoxical weight status between mothers and children can be best understood as a consequence of rapid secular increases in maternal weight, rather than a distinct nutritional condition with a discrete etiology.

The authors ask winter tourists about their expenditure patterns and other features of their visit.

The authors infer the direct expected economic impact of private land conversion on the winter tourism industry in Gunnison County. They then use tourists' stated expenditure patterns and reported change in visitation to derive the total, direct, indirect and induced impact of private land use change on the local economy through winter tourism visitation using a county level input-output analysis. The analysis also captures the extent to which tourists view private and public lands as providing complementary versus substitute goods and services, a potential issue of concern for county planners across high natural amenity and mountainous regions where public lands play a dominant role.","[Orens, Adam] BBC Res & Consulting, Denver, CO 80209 USA; [Seidl, Andrew] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Orens, A (通讯作者)，BBC Res & Consulting, 3773 Cherry Creek N Dr,Suite 850, Denver, CO 80209 USA.",aorens@bbcresearch.com,,"Seidl, Andrew/0000-0002-2338-1307",,,,,41,11,15,0,29,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"COLERIDGE HOUSE, 4-5 COLERIDGE GARDENS, LONDON NW6 3QH, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Three notable results emerge from such an exercise: (1) an equilibrium lobby structure exists under both specifications of the model, (2) moral hazard in teams may raise large groups' equilibrium lobby size, and (3) it may also raise the level of collective action of large groups with low organizational costs.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Anesi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Room B18,Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,31,11,15,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2009,32.0,2,,,,,197.0,219,,10.1007/s00355-008-0318-8,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,393ZH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262414500003,0

The portfolio value is supposed to be the sum of the discounted free cash flows and the discounted terminal value (the discounted selling price). According to Baroni et al. (Journal of Property Investment and Finance 25(6):603-625, 2007b), we assume that the terminal value corresponds to the real estate index. The optimization problem corresponds to the maximization of a quasi-linear utility function. We consider three cases. The first one assumes that the investor knows the probability distribution of the real estate index. However, at the initial time, he has to choose one deterministic optimal time to sell. The second one considers an investor who is perfectly informed about the market dynamics. Whatever the random event that generates the path, he knows the entire path from the beginning. Then, given the realization of the random variable, the path is deterministic for this investor. Therefore, at the initial time, he can determine the optimal time to sell for each path of the index. Finally, the last case is devoted to the analysis of the intertemporal optimization, based on the American option approach. We compute the optimal solution for each of these three cases and compare their properties. The comparison is also made with the buy-and-hold strategy.","[Barthelemy, Fabrice; Prigent, Jean-Luc] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Barthélémy, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.",fabrice.barthelemy@u-cergy.fr; jean-luc.prigent@u-cergy.fr,"PRIGENT, Jean-Luc/AAE-4806-2020","PRIGENT, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-5383-6691",,,,,16,9,9,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Tierney and Maliniak's TRIP data point to a strong elective affinity between, on the one hand, rationalist/liberal ontological assumptions and quantitative methodologies, and on the other, constructivist assumptions and qualitative methodologies. This affinity is neither natural nor obvious, as is discussed. It also raises deeper issues for the field about the nature of causation. As a variety of philosophers of science have insisted, we need to do much better in thinking about the relationship between our underlying notions of causation and the methodological tools that we employ. By so doing, we will not only be able to better build social-scientific knowledge, but also better help bridge the empirical-normative gap that Cohen identifies. More broadly, the paper suggests that by combining a more thoughtful approach to causation with a broadly pragmatist approach to the philosophy of science we can both remedy some of the defects of the American school of international political economy, and provide some pointers to the British school, too.","[Farrell, Henry; Finnemore, Martha] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Farrell, H (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,,,,,21,28,33,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It argues that the marked deterioration of trade and diplomatic relations between Argentina and Brazil in the late 1990s and early 2000s is best explained in reference to domestic political constraints on inter-state cooperation. Two domestic-level dynamics shaped the national preferences for regional cooperation of Argentina and Brazil: state-society relations and intra-state cleavages. The recurrent instances of defection in the late 1990s reflected not only societal pressure but also the macroeconomic and political calculations of national policymakers. Tension among different state agencies sharing power over regional policy-making further undermined the coherence of member states' behavior toward their regional commitments. This 'second-image' explanation of conflict in MERCOSUR is illustrated with case studies of three major trade disputes between Argentina and Brazil: the 1995 automobile sector crisis, the 1999 footwear industry dispute and the 2001 conflict over the common external tariff.","Univ Miami, Dept Int Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Gómez-Mera, L (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Int Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,,,,,,,79,15,20,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This raises the question whether subordinating the partners to a non-working principal (i.e. transforming the partnership into a corporation) can change the outcome. We give an example of a game between the principal and two agents (former partners) in which the answer to the above question is affirmative. A weakly renegotiation-proof public equilibrium is the solution concept that we apply. It results from the application of Farrell's and Maskin's concept of a weakly renegotiation-proof equilibrium to a perfect public equilibrium. We show that for discount factors close enough to one the game has a weakly renegotiation-proof public equilibrium with the following properties: the sum of players' equilibrium payoffs equals the maximal sum of their feasible payoffs and the expected output is maximized after each non-terminal history that occurs with a positive probability in equilibrium and the agents choose their actions after it. Thus, the equilibrium payoff vector is strictly Pareto efficient with respect to the set of all feasible payoff vectors in the repeated game.","[Horniacek, Milan] Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,,milan.horniacek@fses.uniba.sk,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,138.0,143,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900024,0

In the first instance, I identify its roots in practices of editorial gatekeeping among the leading journals and the self-selection of authors who publish in them, and on this basis put forward a set of sceptical reactions to Maliniak and Tierney's contention that we can adequately depict the 'state of the field' by analyzing the content of the 'top' journals. I go on to explore the implications of the close disciplinary association of IPE with the discipline of international relations in the United States, and argue that the marked contraction of pluralism in the American school of IPE is due in large part to its continued shackling to international relations as much as its emerging methodological monoculture.","Univ Manchester, Polit Econ Inst & Polit, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Phillips, N (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Polit Econ Inst & Polit, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Phillips, Nicola/0000-0001-9588-976X",,,,,14,25,27,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

J,"Plourde, A",,,,"Plourde, Andre",,,Oil Sands Royalties and Taxes in Alberta: An Assessment of Key Developments since the mid-1990s,ENERGY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper examines oil sands royalty and tax systems that have either been proposed or implemented since the mid-1990s. Simulation models of oil sands production projects are constructed and the distribution of ex ante economic rents for various assumed crude oil price paths is calculated. The results suggest that until 2007 changes in royalties and taxes had been favorable to producers. The pattern of estimated real internal rates of return obtained through the simulations supports this conclusion. The recommendations of the provincially appointed Royalty Review Panel were anchored in the view that Alberta's oil sands industry had matured since the mid-1990s and that a distribution of ex ante rents more favorable to Albertans, as owners of the resource, was thus warranted. In contrast, the changes proposed by the Government of Alberta in 2007 would effectively return the distribution of ex ante rents to what prevailed a decade earlier.

Initially low population densities allowed better anthropometric outcomes. The height advantage was due, among other factors, to easier access to animal products.

It is known that both the current system, according to the Treaty of Nice, and the voting system proposed in the Lisbon Treaty strongly deviate from Penrose's square root law, which under certain assumptions can be shown to be the ideal power distribution. Since it seems easier to make corrections to the current systems than to agree upon completely different new voting rules, one may hope that adjustments of the quota in the Lisbon Treaty might give rise to a system that is close to the square root law. In this article, this question is investigated.

However, the validity of research syntheses is threatened by the fact that not all studies on a given topic can be summarized. Research reviews may suffer from missing data, and this is especially crucial in those cases where the selectivity of studies and their findings affects the summarized result. So-called publication bias is a type of missing data and a phenomenon that jeopardizes the validity of systematic or quantitative, as well as narrative, reviews. Publication bias exists if the preparation, submission or publication of research findings depend on characteristics of just these research results, e. g. their direction or statistical significance. This article describes methods to identify publication bias in the context of meta-analysis. It also reviews empirical studies on the prevalence of publication bias, especially in the social and economic sciences, where publication bias also seems to be prevalent. Several proposals to prevent publication bias are discussed.","[Weiss, Bernd; Wagner, Michael] Univ Cologne, D-50939 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Weiss, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Greinstr 2, D-50939 Cologne, Germany.",bernd.weiss@uni-koeln.de; mwagner@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Weiss, Bernd/A-6997-2010; Wagner, Michael/E-2325-2011","Wagner, Michael/0000-0003-2589-6440",,,,,84,7,9,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This link is studied by estimating the cointegration vector and analysing the short causality between variables. The analysis recognises that inbound tourism can promote international trade and also that international flow of goods requires and may encourage tourist arrivals and departures. The statistical significance of this link supports the presence of business opportunities due to the potential complementary relationship between tourism and trade.

The log-likelihood function simulated through procedures based on a recursive algorithm formulated by the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane simulator is maximized. The simulation estimators are then applied to study the labor supply of married women. The rich dynamic structure of the labor force participation decision as well as hours worked decisions that are conditional on the participation of married women are identified by using the proposed simulation estimators. The average partial effects of the participation and hours worked decisions for married women in response to fertility decisions and increases in the husband's income are also investigated. It is found that the hypothesis that the fertility decision is exogenous and the hypothesis that the husband's income is exogenous to married women's labor supply function are both rejected in the dynamic and static two-tiered models. Moreover, children aged between 6 and 13 years old may have a negative impact on the hours worked decision for married women that is conditional on their participation. However, these children may provide some positive incentives for married women to participate in the labor force.

The structural problems concerning financial intermediation in the region turn out to be one of the major impediments for further economic development. From a political economy point of view, Mediterranean Partner Country (MPC) governments try to maximize short-run pay-offs in order to sustain political support and to trade these financial returns against a minimum of policy reform. The EU, on the other side of the bargaining table, tries to reap the benefits from policy reform, whereas its willingness to fund these compensation schemes can be assumed to be limited. Given these trade-off rationales on both sides of the Mediterranean Sea, both actors free-ride where possible which leads to suboptimal results. Therefore, this ostensible economic problem is analysed in its political economy context in order to suggest a macroeconomic co-operation scheme that explicitly takes into account political constraints and institutional deadlocks, hampering the development of a deeper economic co-operation within the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) framework.","[Kern, Andreas] Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Publ Policy Inst, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Salhi, Alexander] Free Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany",Georgetown University; Free University of Berlin,"Kern, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Publ Policy Inst, 413 Old N,37th & 0 St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",ak679@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,53,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics Time Use Survey 2006 to explore the relationship between parents' non-standard work hours, and the time they and their spouse spend in paid work, housework, childcare (subdivided into routine tasks and talk-based interaction) and in their children's company. Parents who work non-standard hours spend significantly longer in paid work and less time on housework and childcare than those who work standard hours. Spouses' schedules impact much more on mothers' than on fathers' time. When fathers work non-standard hours, mothers do more housework and routine childcare, so the gendered division of household labour intensifies. Mothers' non-standard hours allow them to schedule their own paid work and family responsibilities around each other, with little effect upon fathers' unpaid work.","[Craig, Lyn] Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Australian Res Council QEII, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Craig, L (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Australian Res Council QEII, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",lcraig@unsw.edu.au,"Powell, Abigail/B-6724-2009","Powell, Abigail/0000-0002-6141-9994; Craig, Lyn/0000-0001-9723-7255",,,,,50,86,100,1,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Our analytical results show that, while zoning decreases the marginal return from housing improvements for zoned landlords, it also increases the equilibrium subsidy per housing improvement. This raises the possibility that an increase in zoning stringency can increase the effectiveness of housing revitalization subsidies by influencing the allocation of funds across space. Our simulation analysis presents a case where zoning increases subsidy effectiveness up to 26%. Additional numerical simulations illustrate how this result varies with the degree of zoning stringency, government budget, and the spatial distribution of housing quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A simulation tool is presented to let the experimenter construct and test hypothetical interdependencies between geography, socially-linked travelers, and activity-travel choices. The exploratory tool is integrated in the Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation Toolbox (MatSim-T). Initially, any social network can be constructed and embedded in geography. It can remain static, or be adapted to the travel patterns of the agents. The interactions and exchanges between agents influencing socializing and/or travel behavior can be defined in substance and in time/space. The reward for socializing or being socially linked can be varied. Finally, the co-dependence of social factors and travel behavior can be studied.

The previous studies examine the problems associated with using aggregate data. The recent studies rely on bilateral data, yet another problem is that data for export and import prices are not available. Thus, this study proposes an alternative way of assessing the impact of currency depreciation by using the real exchange rate and the impact of income on bilateral trade. The models are applied between the EU and its major trading partners. Furthermore, the analysis includes the six major trading regions along side the eight major trading countries for 1980-2007, on the quarterly basis. This article uses the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) approach advocated by Pesaran and Pesaran (1997). Our results indicate a higher importance of income compared to the real exchange rate in defined bilateral export and import demand functions.

Empirical results from the Split Population Duration (SPD) model suggest that: (1) unemployment risk has a significantly negative effect on homeownership and delays its timing even after controlling for income variability measures, (2) the null hypothesis that every household will eventually become a homeowner is rejected, which supports the SPD model against the standard duration model, and (3) the standard duration model underestimates the effects of both unemployment risk and income variability. Finally, our simulation results indicate that changes in unemployment risk have a fairly large impact on the probability of home purchase-a 10 percentile increase in unemployment probability from its median level would reduce the probability by 2.0 percentage point, whereas comparable changes in income variability measures would reduce the probability mere 0.2-0.3 percentage points.

This approach has three limitations. First, it treats all underserved communities as interchangeable, ignoring that they differ in important ways in the nature and causes of their capital constraints. Second, it claims that underserved communities lack access to capital primarily as a result of information failure, overlooking numerous other obstacles that discourage investment in such communities. Third, its overarching assumption that the private sector can take the lead in meeting the capital needs of underserved communities is unrealistic because it fails to address these additional barriers to investment. The article recommends a more individualized approach to understanding the capital needs of underserved communities and recognition of the need for public sector leadership in solving this problem.","Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Rubin, JS (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, 33 Livingston Ave,Room 544, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",jlsrubin@rutgers.edu,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023","Rubin, Julia Sass/0000-0002-8183-3631",,,,,87,2,4,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Using microlevel economic data from the commercial fishery, this paper proposes a two-stage approach to estimate these parameters for a generalized fishery model. In the first stage, a fishery production function is consistently estimated by a within-period estimator treating the latent stock as a fixed effect. The estimated stock is then substituted into an equation of fish stock dynamics to estimate all other biological parameters. The bootstrap approach is used to correct the standard errors in the two-stage model. This method is applied to the reef-fish fishery in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The traditional method, which uses catch-per-unit-effort as a stock proxy, significantly overstates the optimal harvest level.","[Zhang, Junjie] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Duke University,"Zhang, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,"; Smith, Martin/D-9168-2016","Zhang, Junjie/0000-0002-0716-3828; Smith, Martin/0000-0002-4714-463X",,,,,29,29,31,0,22,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

If returns from smuggling cotton and contraband through the blockade of Confederate ports during the American Civil War were significantly lower than earnings from alternative investments, why did private firms so quickly adopt costly purpose-built steam ships in the face of the strengthening Northern blockade? First, we note that the rate of diffusion of steam ships, specially designed to run the blockade significantly exceeded any reported for innovations from the late 19th or early 20th century. Second, we correct an error in Stanley Lebergott's (1981) seminal work and conclude that that returns to infamous steamer, the Banshee (I) of 700% to be quite plausible. This finding of high returns is confirmed by two other historical sources, which have not been previously used. Additionally, we calculate that investors in the one of the leading blockade running firms, known as the Bee Company, earned in excess of 86% return on their investment, over double the profits previously reported. Finally, we demonstrate that adoption of purpose-built ships, significantly decreased the arrival rate of capture, thus increasing expected profits. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The lack of income-consumption data in the US surveys forces researchers to use an empirical strategy to impute consumption. This procedure is avoided by using the Spanish Household Budget Continuous Survey, which contains true panel data on consumption and income information in the same survey. We find full insurance for transitory income shocks and partial insurance for permanent shocks for some sub-groups. For the full sample, a 10% permanent income shock induces a 4.8% permanent change in consumption, with higher insurance capacity for college, home-owner and high-wealth households. We also compute the role of durables and family income transfers as smoothing devices. The comparison of insurance level when based on true consumption data versus imputed consumption data shows that the use of imputed consumption underestimates permanent insurance.","Banco Espana, Madrid 28001, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Casado, J (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28001, Spain.",jmcasado@bde.es,"Casado, Juan/E-1669-2012",,,,,,40,9,9,2,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Against the background of multiple legal, policy and institutional arrangements which have been created by the EU since 1995 to frame Euro-Mediterranean relations, the article considers how seemingly different priorities and methods come together. Of particular interest is the EU's stated goal of a 'partnership' across the Mediterranean, which is promoted by the EU at the same time as it seeks to project its own values in the countries just beyond its borders. The article considers the changing nature of 'the Mediterranean' within EU policy-making, as well as the EU's changing priorities, which suggests incoherency but which instead underlines the central role of the EU in a Euro-Mediterranean system of governance. The positive connotations of the language of governance (identified in the first part of the article) are not fully present in the overlapping policy frames since the stated 'partnership' between the two sides of the Mediterranean in a system of governance is not borne out in practice.","Univ Sheffield, Sch Law, Sheffield S3 7ND, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Cardwell, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Law, Bartolome House,Winter St, Sheffield S3 7ND, S Yorkshire, England.",p.cardwell@sheffield.ac.uk,"Cardwell, Paul James/HJY-1053-2023","Cardwell, Paul James/0000-0002-7485-3474",,,,,50,35,39,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We present some indicators accounting for the main aspects envisaged in the European Commission guidelines for the evaluation of the implementation of local plans, as utilisation of resources, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. In particular, the latter is intended in terms of institutional sustainability and analysed through the social capital theory. In order to demonstrate how the method works, two case studies are presented. The study shows how, using several sources of data, such a quantitative method can contribute to resolve the tension between the centre need for control of what has been achieved by each group and the endogenous logic which proceeds along locally-rooted paths characterized by specific value.","[Lopolito, Antonio; Nardone, Gianluca] Univ Foggia, Dept Prod & Innovat Mediterranean Agr & Food Syst, I-71100 Foggia, Italy; [Sisto, Roberta] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ Math & Stat DSEMS, I-71100 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia; University of Foggia,"Lopolito, A (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Prod & Innovat Mediterranean Agr & Food Syst, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",,"Sisto, Roberta/AAC-5673-2019; Nardone, Gianluca/H-5239-2013; LOPOLITO, ANTONIO/A-6670-2016","Sisto, Roberta/0000-0002-1112-0919; Nardone, Gianluca/0000-0003-3816-0993; LOPOLITO, ANTONIO/0000-0001-9358-3222",,,,,30,19,20,0,12,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2011,10.0,1,,,,,43.0,49,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,742HB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288930800006,0

Prior research indicates high-density urban development leads to decreased travel and thus sustainable mobility: however, personal attitudes seem to have greater effect on mobility than does the urban form. This research evaluates how households consider transit-oriented development (TOD) characteristics in their location decisions with regard to new Mandurah railway line stations opened in December 2007 in Perth, Western Australia. The results indicate that the choice of residence reflects neighborhood and housing attributes, with significant heterogeneity in the populations of the three precincts in terms of their valuation of various housing characteristics, proximity to urban facilities, and transport. There is also significant variation in households' attitudes to natural and artificial environments. A better understanding of the complex relationships among environment, travel, sociodemographic characteristics, and household attitudes can help transport planners leverage the benefits of TOD and improve the quality of urban design and community life.

The differing origins and amounts of forms of capital they can access are shown as is how these are converted into valued outcomes.

However, previous research into professional sports indicates that there are cases where decisions are consistently made that do not conform to this. This article examines this issue within the context of how indigenous Australian footballers are recruited via the Australian Football League (AFL) draft. A panel data econometric model was used to look at the relationship between player performance and the expectations placed on these players when they were first drafted. The results show that, on average, indigenous Australian footballers outperform their expectations. Therefore, the question is Why do AFL teams not draft more indigenous players? Some of the reasons why teams may be averse to drafting such players are discussed, although we are unable to rule out irrationality as a possible explanation.","[Stewart, Mark F.] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Stewart, MF (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, City Campus,239 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",mark.stewart@rmit.edu.au,,"Stavros, Constantino/0000-0003-3695-4503",,,,,32,17,17,3,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The topological variables represent concepts such as the directness of the chosen route and user knowledge of the network. For both of these factors, the necessary data is endogenous to the modelling process and can be quantified without the need for information-gathering beyond what is normally required for building route choice models. Other novel variables in the proposed formulation capture notions of user comfort such as vehicle occupancy rates and certain physical characteristics of network stations.

These can either be used as molecular markers for marker-assisted selection or directly by guiding the design of transgenic plants with high resistance. Cultivars with differential reaction to nematode infection and knowledge of time-course expression of defence genes after nematode infection are a prerequisite for the isolation of resistance genes in banana through functional genomics. Based on pot culture screening and biochemical studies, cultivars 'Karthobiumtham' (ABB) and 'Nendran' (AAB) were identified as resistant and susceptible, respectively, to the root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus coffeae. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNA levels of the chalcone synthase gene, the first enzyme in the pathway for flavonoid biosynthesis, was constitutively higher in roots of resistant 'Karthobiumtham' than in the susceptible 'Nendran'. The transcript level of this defence gene was found to increase up to 6 days after nematode inoculation (DAI) and start declining from 7 DAI onwards in both resistant as well as susceptible root samples. From these preliminary studies, it is inferred that for identifying and isolating differentially expressed genes due to nematode infestation, a subtractive library of the interaction of Musa with P. coffeae should be created by subtracting the cDNA of uninoculated root samples from cDNA of inoculated root samples within 6 DAI. A cDNA library is being created through Suppression Subtractive Hybridisation (SSH) for isolating the genes that are differentially activated during the nematode-host interactions.","[Backiyarani, S.; Uma, S.; Sundararaju, P.; Mayilvaganan, M.; Saraswathi, M.

It leads not only to an increased mortality and disease susceptibility, but also to a reduced capacity for work and delayed physical development. Annually, VAD afflicts close to 20 million pregnant women and 110 million preschool children, and results in the death of up to 250,000 children each year. Within sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, bananas, including plantains and cooking bananas (Musa spp.), are a primary staple food with per capita consumption levels as high as 400 kg/year in some regions. Musa fruit are thus a major source of energy and essential (micro) nutrients for these populations. Recent work has demonstrated that there is a huge range of variation in the provitamin A carotenoids (pVACs) contents of Musa fruit, with levels approaching those found in the best-performing sweet potatoes and carrot varieties. It is thus clear that the introduction of new (or non-indigenous) high pVACs Musa cultivars in these regions has great potential to help tackle the problems of VAD in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. Here we review the current status of our understanding of the genetic diversity of Musa micronutrients contents and outline possible strategies and bottlenecks for the introduction and development of pVACs-rich Musa cultivars.","[Davey, M.

To stem this decline, aid for trade to the region has increased rapidly in recent years. Assistance can target improvements in three important components of trade facilitation: transit times, documentation, and ports and customs. Of these, transit delays have the most economically and statistically significant effect on exports. Specifically, a one day reduction in inland travel times leads to a 7 percent increase in exports, after controlling for the standard determinants of trade and potential endogeneity. Put another way, a one day reduction in inland travel times translates into a 2 percentage point decrease in all importing-country tariffs. By contrast, longer delays in the other areas have a far smaller impact on trade. Large transit delays are relatively more harmful because they are associated with high (within-country) variation, making delivery targets difficult to meet. Finally, the results imply that transit times are primarily about institutional features-such as border delays, road quality, fleet class and competition and security-and not geography.

If there is production, it ends in the state in which it begins. Goods that are not consumed within a state merely perish. Nothing can carry over from one period to the next like money might, and comparisons between the units of account in different states may be problematical. This paper furnishes a two-stage model in which money assists as a special good which agents like to retain instead of consume. Holding money influences utility through pleasures of wealth and in safeguarding against completely unforseen events. The agents' planning is able in this way also to reflect continuing expectations of the future beyond the second stage. The ability of agents to retain money furthermore has the technical benefit that the survivability conditions needed to establish the existence of equilibrium can reduced to a very simple and yet much more appealing form than has been discerned until now.

In an effort to mitigate the disease, 'GCTCV-119', a Foc TR4resistant somaclonal variant of 'Giant Cavendish' selected by the Taiwan Banana Research Institute, was evaluated and compared with the commercial cultivar 'Grand Naine' in Foc-infested farms in Davao, Philippines. Isolates obtained from infected samples from these farms were previously typed as VCG1213/16, the vegetative compatibility group associated with TR4. Tissue culture-derived planting materials of 'GCTCV-119' and 'Grand Naine' were planted in randomised blocks in two farms where severe Fusarium wilt incidence was previously observed. After 12 months of disease incidence monitoring, 'GCTCV-119' showed no Fusarium infection, while 36 and 51% incidence was recorded for 'Grand Naine' in Calinan and Quibilan farms, respectively. Two years after establishment, 'GCTCV-119' plots in the Quibilan farm are still free from infection of Fusarium wilt while the 'Grand Naine' plots have been totally eradicated because of severe disease incidence. Agronomic and fruit quality traits were also recorded. Although 'GCTCV-119' proved to be highly resistant to TR4, it matured later and had a lower bunch weight and greater hand curvature resulting in more rejects when packed. 'GCTCV-119' is however sweeter as it has more total sugars and total soluble solids than 'Grand Naine'.","[Molina, A. B.; Sinohin, V. G.

This article concerns the revelation of this original procedure of a philosopher who had little interest in mathematics who constructed a clearly probabilistic procedure of choice.

Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) tropical race 4 (TR4), which is attacking banana in Asia, represents a threat to the export banana industry which in Latin America is based almost 100% on the Cavendish subgroup that is susceptible to Foc TR4. Production for national markets, based on apple banana, plantain and Gros Michel, is also under threat. Bioversity International has formed a strategic alliance with the Research and Development Network for Plantain and Banana for Latin America and the Caribbean (MUSALAC), the Regional Organization for Agriculture and Livestock Sanitation (OIRSA), the University of Florida and the Cuban Instituto Nacional de Investigacion de Sanidad Vegetal (INISAV) to launch an awareness campaign in order to prevent entrance of Foc TR4 into the Americas. The threat of Foc TR4 was first raised in the VII Steering Committee meeting of MUSALAC held in Panama in October 2007. The 12 country representatives prepared a resolution emphasising the importance of quarantine measures. The resolution of this workshop has been distributed to all 13 MUSALAC member countries. In addition, OIRSA sent an official communication to the agriculture ministries of nine countries in Central America in order to strengthen the quarantine measures of plant protection departments to prevent entrance of this pathogen. In addition to the resolution and actions by OIRSA, Bioversity International and OIRSA are co-organising a training workshop and expert consultation with country quarantine officers and international Fusarium specialists. The workshop will provide technical training to country representatives and input to prepare quarantine guidelines oriented to all stakeholders of the banana production chain and other related sectors such as ornamental plants.","[Pocasangre, L.

This is driven by the exercise of market power by other generators and the fact that the ability of these generators to exercise market power is inversely related to real-time wind availability. We examine the use of energy storage to mitigate this price suppression by shifting wind generation from periods with low prices to periods with higher prices. We show that storage can significantly increase the value of wind generation but the currently high capital cost of storage technologies cannot be justified on the basis of this use. Moreover, we demonstrate that this use of storage can reduce consumer surplus, the profits of other non-wind generators, and social welfare. We also examine the sensitivity of these effects to a number of parameters including storage size, storage efficiency, ownership structure, and market competitiveness showing that a more-competitive market can make storage significantly more valuable to a wind generator","Ohio State Univ, Integrated Syst Engn Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Sioshansi, R (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Integrated Syst Engn Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sioshansi.1@osu.edu,,,,,,,37,56,63,0,21,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,2,,,,,1.0,29,,,,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,742EF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288922900001,0

A Firm-level Examination,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PANEL-DATA MODELS; INITIAL CONDITIONS; UNITED-KINGDOM; INVESTMENT; EXPORT; HETEROGENEITY; PRODUCTIVITY; EMPLOYMENT; DEPENDENCE; TRADE,"Recent theoretical and empirical contributions stress the importance of financial development for international trade. This paper investigates whether financial constraints matter for foreign market entry at the firm level using dynamic panel data techniques. Dynamic Probit and Tobit models that account for state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity are used to analyse the effect of financial indicators on export activities. The empirical framework tests for heterogeneous effects among different quartiles of the size and productivity distribution, across previous exporters and potential starters, and across different types of industries as those are predicted by theoretical models. The empirical analysis is applied to a large panel dataset of French manufacturing firms over the years 1998-2005. The data contain a high share of small firms that are usually the most likely to be financially constrained. Although financial indicators are significantly correlated with export status and export share, there is no evidence that financial constraints have a direct impact on foreign market participation or sales in foreign markets once observed and unobserved firm heterogeneity is controlled for. This result is robust to using alternative estimation techniques and also holds for subgroups of firms that are more likely to face financial constraints and industries that are more dependent on financial factors.","Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Stiebale, J (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Essen, Germany.",,"Stiebale, Joel/JXM-8346-2024",,,,,,66,72,78,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2011,34.0,1,,,,,123.0,153,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01306.x,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,708YX,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286401300006,0

Thus, it aims to attract a substantial number of foreign direct investments (FDI) to its tourism industry in order to alleviate the poverty. However, achieving this objective has remained a major challenge for Zanzibar as its investment promotion agencies [including Zanzibar Investment Promotion Authority] lack the knowledge and understanding of the major factors that determine the FDIs location decision in hotel sector, a sub sector of tourism industry. Being the first study of its kind in Zanzibar, this paper explored the major location determinant; for the Hotel FDI in Zanzibar. We applied an email survey approach, to a sample of 44 foreign owned hotels located in Zanzibar to test the proposed set of hypotheses. The logistic analysis used to analyze the collected data. Regional tourism market, availability of diverse tourism assets, infrastructure, economic growth, political stability, and openness were found to be the principal variables that attract hotel FDI to Zanzibar. Tie influence of labour cost, and investment cost is moderate. The study revealed no significant relationship between hotel FDI inflows and exchange rate.","[Ussi, M.

Thanks to its huge hydrocarbon reserves, the region already exports a lot of oil and gas and has realistic plans to increase this further Although the global gas market is currently saturated and will be so for the next years, the hunger for additional supplies is likely to reappear in the second half of the new decade. Consequently, the gas exporting nations in the Middle East, such as Qatar the UAE, Oman and Iran have to prepare themselves for developing additional projects. The question discussed in this article is whether they are able to do so, given challenges such as high indigenous demand, energy inefficiency, reserve structures and the sometimes unstable political environment, which is making it difficult to attract the required capital. This review begins with a brief overview of each country's reserve structure and natural gas history. It then proceeds to analyze the current and future supply/demand balance, taking into account the relevant pipeline and LNG export projects, and draws conclusions for future export projects. The results suggest that Qatar the UAE, Iran and Oman could contribute to global LNG and pipeline gas supplies with additional volumes of 55 to 90 bcm/a in the period 2015 to 2020.","EON Ruhrgas Middle E, Vice President Grp Energy Projects, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Wietfeld, AM (通讯作者)，EON Ruhrgas Middle E, Vice President Grp Energy Projects, POB 9675, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",axel.wietfeld@eon-ruhrgas.com,,,,,,,64,2,3,1,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2011,32.0,2,,,,,203.0,228,,,,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,742EF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288922900008,0

Optimal horizons increase with the degree of persistence in shocks while they are not affected by the size of a shock unless the central bank is averse to interest rate volatility. In the face of multiple shocks, however, sizes as well as signs of shocks become important for optimal horizons even when the central bank is not averse to interest rate volatility.

One of the major aims of the Doha Development Round is to reduce agricultural protection and impose greater discipline on domestic agricultural subsidies, particularly those that are the most trade distorting. In this article, we examine whether the proposed WTO modalities for agriculture will actually achieve this aim in Norway, which ranks among the top providers of government assistance for agriculture. Norway has a complex system of farm subsidies buttressed by substantial import protection. The extent to which its agricultural support policies will have to change in response to new WTO disciplines provides an important indication of how successful these are likely to be. We find that Norway will probably be able to sustain its current agricultural activity and production levels while staying within the new WTO rules. Following recent practice in some other WTO members, Norway will be able to reduce its notified support without making real changes in some of its programmes. However, there will have to be a shift from market price support, which is paid for by consumers through higher food prices, to budgetary support paid by taxpayers. This could generate increased domestic pressure for policy reform.","[Blandford, David] Penn State Univ, Bergen, Norway; [Gaasland, Ivar] Econ & Business Adm, Inst Res, Bergen, Norway; [Vardal, Erling] Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Blandford, D (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,,24,7,8,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1470.0,1485,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01298.x,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100005,0

Dynamics of Power Delegation and Agency Losses in EU Trade Politics,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EUROPEAN-COMMUNITY; NEGOTIATIONS; UNION,"There has been considerable debate about power delegation in EU trade politics, but few studies explore the question of how and why agency losses occur. Focusing on agricultural issues in the Doha Round, this article analyses the impact of agency losses (agency shirking and agency slippage) in the process of power delegation in EU trade politics. Are agency losses the result of the delegation structure, which stimulates the agent to adopt a different position from the principals (agency slippage), or do conflict situations arise because of conflicting interests between the interests of the Member States and those of the European Commission (agency shirking)? Based on information collected from Agence Europe and interviews with European officials, the main conclusions are that: (1) the Council-Commission relationship can be conflict-laden or co-operative depending on the negotiating stage at the international level; (2) a low degree of interest alignment among Member States increases the Commission's discretion at the international level; (3) inter-institutional conflict weakens the EU negotiating position at the international level because the other WTO members know that the EU is divided and ask for further concessions.","Humboldt Univ, Inst Social Sci, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Da Conceicao, E (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Social Sci, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",conceihe@sowi.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,41,42,43,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Applying the framework by Gutner and Thompson and inspired by principal-agent theory, it is argued that existing studies have underspecified the institutional milieu that affects performance. The WTO represents a member-driven organization where Members are part of the international organization (IO) (e. g., through rule-making) and at the same time act outside the IO (e. g., through implementation). Thus, a narrow reading of the IO (focusing on the civil servants and the Director-General and his staff) will not suffice to understand IO performance in the WTO context. Selected evidence is presented to illustrate aspects of the WTO's inner-working and the institutional milieu of performance. In addition, the article discusses a number of performance parameters, including the relationship between Secretariat autonomy and performance, the role of information, and the mechanisms of performance aggregation. The article ends by cautioning against quick fixes to the system to improve performance.","Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Elsig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",manfred.elsig@wti.org,,"Elsig, Manfred/0000-0001-6950-108X",,,,,56,34,35,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The model is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem of maximizing the total weighted average remaining life of the fleet subjected to improvement program and budgetary constraints Two variants of the problem, one with an annual budget constraint and the other with a single budget constraint for the entire planning period, are formulated. Two independent approaches, namely, branch and bound algorithm and genetic algorithm are used to obtain the solution An example problem is solved and results are discussed in details.

This study addresses duration of long-distance commuting - 30 km or more between home and work - in Sweden, and what characterizes individuals who commute for shorter or longer periods. The effects of long-distance commuting in terms of economic outcome for both partners in a commuter household are analysed. The study is based on register data for the years 1995-2005 covering all long-distance commuters in Sweden. One finding is that previous experience of long-distance commuting makes it more likely to have a long duration of long-distance commuting In addition economic incentives, such as a higher income, are positively correlated for continuing to long-distance commuting more than a few years Furthermore, the analysis shows that male commuters benefit more in terms of economic outcome of long-distance commuting It is concluded that the trend with increasing long-distance commuting can sustain not only gender differences on the labour market but also within households. Finally, the paper indicates that long-distance commuting is a strategic mobility choice for households, rather than a short-term solution for a few years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our experiment replicates previous findings that individual players significantly overbid relative to theoretical predictions, incurring substantial losses. There is high variance in individual bids and strong heterogeneity across individual players. The new findings of our experiment are that groups make 25% lower bids, their bids have lower variance, and group bids are less heterogeneous than individual bids. Therefore, groups receive significantly higher and more homogeneous payoffs than individuals. We elicit individual and group preferences toward risk using simple lotteries. The results indicate that groups make less risky decisions, which are possible explanations for lower bids in contests. Most importantly, we find that groups learn to make lower bids from communication and negotiation between group members.","[Sheremeta, Roman M.] Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Zhang, Jingjing] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",Chapman University System; Chapman University; McMaster University,"Sheremeta, RM (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",sheremet@chapman.edu,"Sheremeta, Roman/B-9110-2011","Zhang, Jingjing/0000-0003-3274-5245",,,,,55,69,72,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2010,35.0,2,,,,,175.0,197,,10.1007/s00355-009-0434-0,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,608ZR,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278625000001,0

The emergence of this irreducible heterogeneity in statistical patterns casts some doubts on the attempts to explain log-normality of household consumption patterns by means of simple models based on Gibrat's Law applied to permanent income and marginal utility.","[Fagiolo, Giorgio; Barigozzi, Matteo] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Alessi, Lucia] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Barigozzi, Matteo] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Capasso, Marco] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Capasso, Marco] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Tjalling Co Koopmans Res Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; European Central Bank; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Fagiolo, G (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021; Barigozzi, Matteo/B-7145-2017; Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022","Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352; Barigozzi, Matteo/0000-0001-9090-5708; Capasso, Marco/0000-0003-2057-299X",,,,,52,10,10,1,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

These areas are submitted to different management practices but in general they are exploited collectively. Indeed, free access is allowed to the pastoral resources since there is no stock restriction and each and every breeder is entitled to exploit the rangelands and this leads to many management problems. The aim of this paper is to develop a management system based on control and planning of pastoral resources optimal allocation in dry conditions, through a dynamic approach and by applying the optimal control theory. Data have been retrieved from regional and local statistics, from field surveys carried out at regional level with thrillers and breeders and from the technical and economic records of the Economics and Rural Societies laboratory of IRA. The results helped defining the optimal forage resource management and primarily the optimal stocking rate and the bio-economic balance of the available forage stock. Following the application of the optimal control model some proposals have been made in order to create a favourable economic environment to preserve the rangelands and to promote a sound pastoral resource management.",,,,,"Sghaier, Mongi/AAV-9326-2020; JEDER, HOUCINE/ABG-6113-2020","JEDER, HOUCINE/0000-0003-1953-8209",,,,,16,1,1,0,1,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2010,9.0,2,,,,,11.0,16,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,636RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280755800003,0

Data from the scientific use files of the German micro-censuses for the years 1976 to 2004 show that the part-time and marginal employment rates of mothers have increased, while full-time employment rates have declined.

The relationship between attendance and game characteristics is shown to be fundamentally different between small market and large market teams.

Loss aversion equilibria are Nash equilibria of games where players are loss averse and where the reference points-points below which they consider payoffs to be losses-are endogenous to the equilibrium calculation. The first type is the fixed point loss aversion equilibrium, introduced in Shalev (2000; Int. J. Game Theory 29(2):269) under the name of 'myopic loss aversion equilibrium.' There, the players' reference points depend on the beliefs about their opponents' strategies. The second type, the maximin loss aversion equilibrium, differs from the fixed point loss aversion equilibrium in that the reference points are only based on the carriers of the strategies, not on the exact probabilities. In the third type, the safety level loss aversion equilibrium, the reference points depend on the values of the own payoff matrices. Finally, a comparative statics analysis is carried out of all three equilibrium concepts in 2 x 2 bimatrix games. It is established when a player benefits from his opponent falsely believing that he is loss averse.","[Driesen, Bram; Perea, Andres; Peters, Hans] Univ Maastricht, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Peters, H (通讯作者)，Univ Maastricht, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",B.Driesen@ke.unimaas.nl; A.Perea@ke.unimaas.nl; H.Peters@ke.unimaas.nl,,,,,,,19,10,16,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2010,68.0,4,,,,,367.0,391,,10.1007/s11238-008-9102-6,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,558CS,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274718700001,0

The findings in this work indicate that agents specializing in listing properties increase pricing precision.

The analysis of this governance mix reveals several characteristics of the EU that have been largely overlooked in the literature. First, the EU relies heavily on hierarchy in the making of its policies. Its supranational institutions allow for the adoption and enforcement of legally binding decisions without the consent of (individual) Member States. Second, network governance, which systematically involves private actors, is hard to find. EU policies are largely formulated and implemented by public actors. Third, political competition has gained importance in European governance. Member States increasingly resort to mutual recognition and the open method of co-ordination where their heterogeneity renders harmonization difficult. The article shows that the EU mainly governs through inter- and transgovernmental negotiations and political competition between states and regions. Both forms of public-actor-based governance operate in the shadow of hierarchy cast by supranational institutions. This governance mix does not render the EU unique but still distinguishes it from both international institutions and national states.","Free Univ Berlin, Ctr European Integrat, Otto Suhr Inst, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Börzel, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Ctr European Integrat, Otto Suhr Inst, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",europe@zedat.fu-berlin.de,,"Borzel, Tanja Anita/0000-0002-7313-2181",,,,,133,120,126,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To organise the empirical work, we rely on Antras and Helpman's model (2004), which predicts that high-productivity firms engage in trade (foreign sourcing) and low-productivity firms do not source abroad. The paper performs productivity comparisons between groups of firms sourcing abroad and firms which do not source abroad, applying non-parametric procedures to a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms. Our results indicate the existence of large and significant differences in productivity between firms that source abroad and those that do not. The productivity premium of foreign sourcing firms is robust to other characteristics that are associated with firm productivity. Furthermore, the evidence reported is consistent with self-selection of the most productive firms into the practice of sourcing abroad. The ex ante productivity distribution of firms that engage in foreign sourcing stochastically dominates the distribution of firms which do not source abroad. Finally, our estimates suggest that changing the intensity of foreign sourcing is a technology shifter for firms, and this has a direct impact on their total factor productivity.","[Farinas, Jose C.] Univ Complutense, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Fariñas, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Farinas, Jose Carlos/K-3581-2017; Martin-Marcos, Ana/K-8758-2014","Farinas, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-1545-0659; Martin-Marcos, Ana/0000-0003-0684-6261",,,,,29,33,36,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2010,33.0,3,,,,,482.0,506,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01264.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,573CA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275884800008,0

We do not find any statistically significant dynamic benefits from continuous treatment versus never attending small classes following grade 1.

In 2000, the United States dropped trade restrictions on a broad list of products through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Since the act was applied selectively to both countries and products, we can estimate the impact with a triple difference-in-differences estimation, controlling for both country and product-level import surges at the time of onset. This approach allows us to better address the endogeneity-of-policy critique of standard difference-in-differences estimation than if either a country- or a product-level analysis was performed separately. Despite the fact that the AGOA product list was chosen to not include import-sensitive products and despite the general challenges of transaction costs in African countries, we find that AGOA had a large and robust impact on apparel imports into the United States, as well as on the agricultural and manufactured products covered by AGOA. These import responses grew over time and were the largest in product categories where the tariffs removed were large. AGOA did not result in a decrease in exports to Europe in these product categories, suggesting that the AGOA exports were not merely diverted from other destinations. We discuss how the effects vary across countries and the implications of these findings for aggregate export volumes.","[Frazer, Garth] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, NBER, Louvain, Belgium",University of Toronto; KU Leuven,"Frazer, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,"Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/GLV-0353-2022","Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/0000-0003-4144-5578",,,,,40,52,63,2,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This way, the problem of ranking decisions is reduced to a problem of ranking sets of outcomes. All rankings that have emerged in the literature in this domain imply transitivity. In the current study, transitivity is subjected to an empirical evaluation in two experiments, where subjects are asked to choose between sets of monetary consequences. After analysis with a Bayes Factor, very few violations of transitivity were found. It can be concluded that transitivity seems a plausible condition for the ranking of sets of monetary consequences.","Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vrijdags, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",amelie.vrijdags@ugent.be,,,,,,,48,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2010,68.0,1-2,,,,,213.0,232,,10.1007/s11238-009-9166-y,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,545RX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273755400012,0

There can be two distinct interpretations of this apparently simple principle. According to one view, individual utilities represent the basic information for the calculation of social welfare: this is how utilitarianism works. According to a second view, social welfare is maximized if and only if individual utilities are maximized: this is what justifies utilitarianism. This aim of this paper is to show: that these two interpretations should not be confused; that they correspond to distinct definitions of welfarism; that they are likely to conflict; and that as a consequence we can draw important and surprising conclusions for political philosophy and economic science. One such conclusion is that fairness should be prior to goodness in a consistent Benthamian doctrine.","Univ Caen, CREM, F-14000 Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie,"Baujard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Caen, CREM, F-14000 Caen, France.",Antoinette.Baujard@unicaen.fr,,"Baujard, Antoinette/0000-0002-4156-7527",,,,,51,4,5,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In that work, he proposes an equation to determine the price level as the ratio of its monetary and real determinants. The paper addresses Kemmerer's key question of how money and credit are related to general prices. Two directions are investigated. Firstly, I explain Kemmerer's quantity theory by means of his exchange equation and how his interpretation may have influenced Fisher's economic theory. Secondly, I consider his test of the quantity theory on the US economy and I show the empirical validity of his theory. It is argued here that both elements give a key contribution to finding a new interpretation of the deepest meaning of Kemmerer's approach to quantity theory.","Univ Lyon 2, Triangle ISH, F-69363 Lyon 07, France",Universite Lyon 2; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON),"Betancourt, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, Triangle ISH, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69363 Lyon 07, France.",Rebecca-GomezBetancourt@univ-lyon2.fr,"Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/S-5957-2019; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/K-9494-2019; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/B-5910-2019","Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/0000-0002-5238-6705; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/0000-0002-5238-6705; Betancourt, Rebeca Gomez/0000-0002-5238-6705",,,,,50,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

This is done by modeling the conditional skewness and degrees of freedom of the skewed Student's t distribution of Lambert and Laurent (2001) as a function of the conditioning information. The proposed specification nests a large number of models in the literature and represents the first attempt to jointly model long memory in volatility and time variation in the third and fourth moments. The finite sample properties of MLE for this class of model are examined. The results indicate that the ARCH class of processes with time varying skewness can be reliably estimated with realistic sample sizes. Simulations and empirical evidence are unable to replicate the findings of Harvey and Siddique (1999), that accounting for time varying skewness reduces the persistence and asymmetry properties of the conditional variance. Simulations also suggest that time varying kurtosis estimation must be viewed with caution, because it can be difficult to identify in the presence of ARCH effects. Application of the HYAPARCH model with time varying skewness and degrees of freedom illustrates the usefulness of the proposed approach. Out of sample forecasts of the value at risk (VaR) however, generally support parsimonious models that assume conditional normality. When forecasting VaR, skewness and leptokurtosis in the unconditional return distribution is generally better captured via an asymmetric conditional variance model with Gaussian innovations.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Dark, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",jdark@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,82,13,14,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We look at evidence for a group of 13 OECD countries, and consider three alternative measures of inflationary pressure, including the output gap, labor share, and unemployment. We find that the SPI model is preferable to the Calvo SP and the SI models because it captures the type of strong inflationary persistence that has in the past characterized the economics in our sample. However, two caveats to this conclusion are that improvement in performance is driven mostly by lagged inflation and that the SPI model overemphasizes inflationary persistence. There appears to be room for improvement in all models in order to induce them to better 'track' inflation persistence. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons.

Yet, more people in developing countries like India earn their livelihood from this sector than from all other economic sectors combined. Agriculture, particularly prone to systemic and co-variant risk, doesn't easily lend itself to insurance. Lack of historical yield data, small sized farm holdings, low value crops and the relatively high cost of insurance, have further made it more difficult to design, a workable crop insurance scheme (Rao K N). Despite these constraints, India debated the feasibility of crop insurance schemes, since late nineteen forties, and could settle for 'yield index' based crop insurance on a country-wide basis since 1985. The yield index based crop insurance in India, presently under the name 'National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) is the flagship crop insurance programme, annually insuring about 25 million farmers with an area of over 35 million hectares (AIC's provisional figures as of 31(st) March 2010), and available for almost all seasonal and annual crops for which there exists historical yield data of 10 years at sub-district level. NAIS despite well suited for Indian conditions, suffers from some key problems. These include basis risk (insurance unit being too large), delay in receiving yield estimates leading to delay in settlement of indemnities, non-coverage of pre-sowing & post-harvest losses, huge infrastructure and manpower required to estimate yields (irrespective of yield loss), etc. Keeping in mind the challenges with yield index insurance, India started piloting 'rainfall (weather) index' based insurance since 2003. The government from 2007 started providing subsidies in premium, and is being tested as a substitute for NAIS. At present Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC), an entity created at the behest of the Government in 2003 and the largest market player in India, has insured 1.98 million farmers during 2009-10 (April to March) covering more than 2.68 million hectares of cropped area for a sum insured of approx. US $ 870 million for a premium income of US $ 80 million (AIC's Provisional figures as of 31(st) March 2010). India started experimenting the Biomass Index for crops like wheat, mustard, chickpea since 2005. The index has so far met limited success, but could play important role in near future, as remote sensing technology experiencing quantum jump in terms of all-weather satellites, high resolution data and higher frequency of fly-overs. Index based insurance is here to stay, and is the way forward in many developing nations. Best results could be obtained by careful deign of index and use of a combination of indices (multiple triggers) to capture the key production risks in agriculture.

During the period of this study there was steep and prolonged deflation. Firm-specific and industry-specific demand shocks also put downwards pressure on wages. Although it was common for individual wages at the banks to remain unchanged from year to year, wage cuts were very rare even for senior workers. Turnover at both banks was extremely low and, thus, despite flexibility in the wages of incoming workers, did not offset the effects of individual-level wage rigidity. Consequently real wages moved counter-cyclically. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This paper studies the effect of using a market mechanism to allocate scarce transmission capacity when the incumbent producers remain dominant. We show that granting exclusive use to an incumbent producer is preferred to trading access to this essential facility if interregional production-cost differences are significant and transmission capacity is scarce. This result counters the intuition on third degree price-discrimination, that arbitrage will improve the social surplus when there is no output contraction. The reason is that with arbitrage the incumbent can still charge different regional prices as long as it creates congestion on the transmission lines. As a consequence, welfare will be lower, since the incumbent distorts production decisions to congest the lines. We recommend that a market-oriented access to scarce transmission capacity should be accompanied by additional regulatory or structural measures to address market power.","[Willems, Bert] Tilburg Univ, TILEC & CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Kupper, Gerd] Katholieke Univ Leuven, CES, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Kupper, Gerd] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Energy Inst, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Tilburg University; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Willems, B (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, TILEC & CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",,"Willems, Bert/C-1338-2009",,,,,,31,3,4,1,18,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,3,,,,,41.0,66,,,,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,619HW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279421600003,0

In general, the historical data recorded of natural disasters in small region are not enough to be used for estimating the probability distribution in risk assessment, because the size of the sample observed is small. In this study, the method Information Diffusion is used to change limited sample observations into fuzzy sets, and a quantitative analyzing model for natural disasters risk assessment is proposed. Based on the statistical data of grain planting area and hazard area during the period of 1986-2006 in Dongting Lake area, the probability of natural disaster risk of grain production was calculated by using the Information Diffusion Theory in each county. The results showed that the probabilities of natural disaster risk of the area hazard ratio (AHR) of grain production over 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% were between 0.3576 similar to 0.9344, 0.0880 similar to 0.8618, 0.0080 similar to 0.7757, 0 similar to 0.6569 respectively in different county.

The primary measure for tracking the prevalence of obesity has historically been body mass index (BMI). This paper compares long-run trends in the prevalence of obesity when obesity is defined using skinfold thickness instead of BMI, using data from the full series of U.S. National Health Examination Surveys. The results indicate that when one uses skinfold thickness rather than BMI to define obesity, the rise in the prevalence of obesity is detectable 10-20 years earlier. This underscores the importance of examining multiple measures of fatness when monitoring or otherwise studying obesity. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We relate annual household consumption to capital gains in housing, controlling for characteristics such as age. In line with the empirical predictions of our model, we find the oldest households-which are less affected by the higher costs of future rent-to be the most affected by increases in real net housing wealth. Younger households, on the other hand, are not significantly affected in their consumption decisions by house price increases. We also take into account the fact that benefiting from capital gains is conditional on owning housing wealth and estimate the different impacts of house price changes on the savings behaviours of both homeowners and renters. Our estimates suggest that house price increases raise consumption not only for homeowners but also for renters.","[Calcagno, R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Fornero, E.] Univ Turin, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Finanziarie G Prato, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Rossi, M.

We assume that a regulator initially announces that land is not allowed to be developed during a finite period of time in the future. A developer, thus, must decide whether to develop land before the timing ordinance is imposed, or after it expires. The development moratorium reduces the developer's option value from waiting and, thus, accelerates development. We also use simulation analysis to demonstrate how the other factors that relate to the demand and supply conditions of the real estate market affect this accelerating effect.","[Lee, Tan (Charlene)] Univ Auckland, Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Jou, Jyh-Bang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Jou, Jyh-Bang] Massey Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, N Shore, New Zealand",University of Auckland; National Taiwan University; Massey University,"Lee, T (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Sch Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",tanlee65@hotmail.com,"JOU, JYH-BANG/L-9428-2018","JOU, JYH-BANG/0000-0002-9507-3370",,,,,25,5,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Empirical evidence indicates that South-East and East Asian economies are recovering from the Asian crisis with strong output growth driven largely by export growth. However, output growth in the post-crisis period is also accompanied by rising unemployment rates, growing government deficits, and declining FDI inflows into the South-East Asian region. The declining FDI inflows into South-East Asia after the crisis is of concern, as our empirical results show that FDI is important for output growth in the region. Our results also suggest that there might have been structural changes in the regional economies that could have led to a downward shift in the output growth of Asian economies in the post-crisis period.

In order to achieve this, three types of specifications, associated with three possible evolutions of the expected rate are considered. The first allows an overall instability of the trend or the expected inflation rate. The second considers an alternative specification in which the expected inflation rate is unstable in periodic segments of the sample. Finally, the last specification allows instability of a mixed type in which the trend inflation rate is assumed to be random or subject to a probability schema. The results of our study indicate that this last specification is the one that gives the most adequate characterization of the inflation rate dynamic. The inflation rate thus appears generated by a second order autoregressive process with, on the one hand, unchanging lag coefficients and, on the other, a unconditional mean which switches between three globals different frequency regimes of accession.","[Boutahar, Mohamed; Gbaguidi, David] Univ Aix Marseille 2, Fac Sci Luminy, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Boutahar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille 2, Fac Sci Luminy, Marseille, France.",boutahar@univmed.fr,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Over time, both multilateral and unilateral sanctions lead to an increase in a target country's exports to the EU, lending support to the third-country effect of sanctions.","[Yang, Jiawen; Askari, Hossein; Forrer, John] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Zhu, Lili] Shenandoah Univ, Winchester, VA 22601 USA",George Washington University; Shenandoah University,"Yang, JW (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,"Zhu, Li/GWV-0143-2022; Zhu, Li/GXH-9801-2022; Li, Ren/GZD-2291-2022","Zhu, Li/0000-0001-5249-6536; Li, Ren/0000-0002-2579-2580",,,,,16,29,35,1,35,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2009,32.0,8,,,,,1223.0,1244,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01190.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,472BT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268104800005,0

The real returns are based on the changes in the private, appraisal-based net asset values of REITs, whereas the public returns are measured by the variations in REITs' premiums/discounts. This study then investigates the price discovery of REIT prices. The results indicate that lagged public returns are useful in predicting real returns. In addition, the study documents concurrent factor exposures for public returns and lagged factor exposures for private returns under a variety of asset pricing models. Overall, the results are consistent with the notion that public markets are more efficient in processing information.","Univ Vermont, Sch Business Adm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Chiang, KCH (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Sch Business Adm, 55 Colchester Ave,315 Kalkin Hall, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Kevin.C.Chiang@uvm.edu,"Cherkes, Martin/A-4726-2012",,,,,,28,16,17,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Recently, Liu and Sercu, working on intra-ERM rates for the DEM, presented evidence consistent with career risk considerations: portfolio managers shun assets with danger signals. In this paper, we test the external validity of this finding: we compare floating rates to band regimes, and strong base currencies to weak ones. We find that both the exchange rate regime and base currency strength influence the evidence on various theories: floating and strong intra-ERM rates weakly support market friction or limit-to-arbitrage theories, while the HKD and weak intra-ERM strongly support the career risk effect. We also decompose forward premium into a short-term filtered component and a long memory trend. The filtered component is good at recognising danger signals or 'extreme' observation effects for band regime rates and weak floaters, while the trend works best for strong floaters. Lastly, the filtered premium provides the best fit, consistent with the idea that it has a closer link to expectations than the trend component.","[Liu, Fang; Sercu, Piet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Liu, F (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium.",,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2009,32.0,7,,,,,1055.0,1074,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01196.x,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,468PZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267833300005,0

In contrast with conventional analyses, we assume that awareness among travelers of changes in the transport system is limited and grows over time. Specifically, we postulate that each day (trip) provides travelers with an opportunity to learn about changes that occurred recently in the transport system. This learning process may involve learning through direct experience and indirect learning through for example social networks or information provision. Our measure of user benefits incorporates the conventional logsum-measure as a special case (when full awareness is assumed) and has a closed form solution under reasonable error term assumptions. A numerical illustration provides a first sign of face validity. We derive and discuss a number of practical implications, and discuss possible model extensions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We then estimate this specification by using data drawn from the Spanish National Survey on Drug Use in the School Population (2000) and the Spanish National Household Survey (2000).

For that purpose we make use of the representative German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). This survey offers data to which extent individuals support benefit cuts, longer working years, cutting subsidies to declining industries, phasing out of employment programmes, or a liberalisation of employment protection. Our theoretical considerations suggest that self-interest, information, fairness judgements, economic beliefs and other individual factors Such as socialisation under the communist regime in the former German Democratic Republic drive individual reform preferences. Our empirical results support this notion: While we find self-interest to be an important driving force, our results show that a number of factors well beyond the narrow scope of self-interest strongly shape individual reform preferences.","[Heinemann, Friedrich] ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Bischoff, Ivo] Univ Giessen, Giessen, Germany; [Hennighausen, Tanja] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Justus Liebig University Giessen; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Heinemann, F (通讯作者)，ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",heinemann@zew.de; ivo.bischoff@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de; hennighausen@zew.de,"Bischoff, Ivo/AAQ-3278-2021",,,,,,31,7,8,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Shirking is inferred if the player's actual performance falls below expected performance in the year following a newly signed long-term contract. In an attempt to shed light on these conflicting conclusions in the literature, we outline a novel approach for testing opportunistic behavior. We begin by running a standard test of shirking based upon a comparison of the player's expected to realized performance. We then introduce a new approach to analyzing shirking-one which is based on a comparison of a player's expected to realized Marginal Revenue Product. We find that tests for shirking are sensitive to the approach one uses in the analysis. In particular, when testing for opportunistic behavior using performance, we find no evidence of shirking. Yet when we conduct the test based on MRP, our tests suggest that players signing multi-year contracts create less value than they were expected to generate.",,,"Krautmann, AC (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",akrautma@depaul.edu,,,,,,,15,18,21,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Default on underlying commercial mortgages within a pool is a crucial risk associated with CMBS transactions. Two important issues associated with such default-extreme events and default dependencies among the mortgages-have been identified to play crucial roles in determining credit risk in the pooled commercial mortgage portfolios. This article pays particular attention to these two issues in pricing CMBS bonds. Our results show the usefulness and potential of copula-based models in pricing CMBS bonds, and the ability of such models to correctly price CMBS tranches of different seniorities. it is also important to sufficiently consider complex default dependence structure and the likelihood of extreme events occurring in pricing various CMBS bonds.","[Fan, Gang-Zhi] SW Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhan Yong] NumeriX LLC, Singapore, Singapore; [Lim, Kian Guan] Singapore Management Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Business, Singapore, Singapore",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Singapore Management University,"Fan, GZ (通讯作者)，SW Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",zliu@numerix.com; gzfan@swufe.edu.cn; kglim@smu.edu.sg,"LIM, Kian Guan/D-2160-2010",,,,,,35,6,9,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This study examines the growth in industrial share liquidity that occurred in Boston over the latter half of the 19th century. From primary sources hitherto unused for scholarly investigations, namely the running annual worksheets of securities price fluctuations that underlie broker Joseph Martin's volumes on the history of the Boston stock market, I construct broad-based indices of annual prices and returns for banking and industrial equities, as well as measures of real market capitalization. A series of vector autoregressive models then relate increases in liquidity, as measured by falling par values of industrial shares due to stock splits, write-downs and re-capitalizations, entries, and exits, to advances in prices and capitalizations among traded firms. The findings support the view that increases in participation were important for sustaining Boston as the nation's leading industrial market until finally overtaken by New York sometime around 1900.

The article uses Spinelli's analogy to assess how useful it is to compare the predicament of European integration with US constitutional politics. The analysis reveals both how Spinelli exaggerated the extent to which the US Constitution established and delimited federal political authority once and for all as well the way in which, despite its functionalist non-constitutional origins, the EU has experienced its own brand of constitutional politics. The analogy is thus most useful in showing how both polities faced similar tensions over the process of constitutionalism, restraining unit sovereignty and the institutionalization of popular sovereignty at the federal level.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Glencross, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Williams Hall 635,255 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",aglenc@sas.upenn.edu,"Glencross, Andrew/ABA-9246-2021","Glencross, Andrew/0000-0001-8320-9181",,,,,53,5,5,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We use the 1998, 2000 and 2002 waves of the child-mother merged files from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth combined with fruit and vegetable and fast food price data obtained from the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association and outlet density data on fast food and full-service restaurants and supermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores obtained from Dun & Bradstreet. Using a random effects estimation model, we found that a 10% increase in the price of fruits and vegetables was associated with a 0.7% increase in child BMI. Fast food prices were not found to be statistically significant in the full sample but were weakly negatively associated with BMI among adolescents with an estimated price elasticity of -0.12. The price estimates were robust to whether we controlled for outlet availability based on a per capita or per land area basis; however, the association between food outlets and child BMI differed depending on the definition. The associations of fruit and vegetable and fast food prices with BMI were significantly stronger both economically and statistically among low- versus high-socioeconomic status children. The estimated fruit and vegetable and fast food price elasticities were 0.14 and -0.26, respectively, among low-income children and 0.09 and -0.13, respectively, among children with less educated mothers.

The narrative presented is that of Laurence Connelly, a production worker with 14 years' service, who left the company only weeks before the disaster. Generated over a series of interviews as part of an independent study of the incident, Laurence's testimony depicts a seriously flawed health and safety regime that left workers exposed to a range of hazards, and recalls Theo Nichols' characterisation of such workplaces as constituting 'potentially injurious structure[s] of vulnerability'.

Hansen's benefit estimation in An aggregate demand model for air passenger traffic in the hub-and-spoke network,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Consumer surplus; Investment benefits; Airport capacity,,"This comment analyzes the demand model and method used by W. Wei and M. Hansen for computing the benefits of an airport capacity extension. The log-linear specification and coefficients of the demand function imply that the airport extension's positive effect on demand decreases with the volume of traffic and associated congestion. If this unlikely result is accepted, the surplus method used by Wei and Hansen underestimates the users' investment benefit. The note argues that the marginal willingness to pay for a capacity extension should rather increase with congestion. If this is the case, the method used by Wei and Hansen could actually overestimates the benefit. A better specification would rather allow for a function concave to the origin in order to account for capacity constraints, and also set a maximum finite price. Above all, a fair evaluation of the users' benefit should be based on a function which explicitly includes a variable, or function of variables, that permits an estimation of the users' cost of congestion.

The industry has boomed in the United States: There were 54 ethanol plants in 2000, 134 by the end of 2007, 171 in mid-September 2008. Estimates of the industry's effects on local economies vary wildly, chiefly because of assumptions regarding the corn industry. This article presents an overview of the industry, its location, and the public policy umbrella that supports its growth. It analyzes what happens to the local economy when a county adds an ethanol plant, demonstrates what must be done to modify input-output models to capture those effects, and applies the approach to proposed plants in four counties. An ethanol plant provides the enticing benefits of a manufacturing plant with 35 to 40 jobs, but several characteristics and uncertainties of the industry merit a careful look when making local economic development decisions.","[Low, Sarah A.; Isserman, Andrew M.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Low, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,,59,45,52,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This paper argues on the basis of extensive primary research that with respect to Japan's foreign direct investment during the 1970s, at any rate, this conclusion needs to be rethought. In the early 1970s, Japanese actors were remarkably forthright in ascribing their investment decisions to a desire to move polluting industry overseas. These statements allow us to examine 'pollution export' as a state strategy, a project advocated by industry organizations, and a response of individual firms to high levels of protest and regulation. The paper also traces the development of the Japanese debate over pollution export through the 1970s.","[Hall, Derek] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Hall, Derek] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Hall, D (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,,,,,,,102,16,18,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The article demonstrates that national questions remained uppermost in the discussions of party officials about the failure of the 1932 harvest in Ukraine and argues that a more definitive study of the famine would be enhanced by discussion of the disparate views and further use of archival evidence.","Univ Alberta, Dept Hist & Class, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Marples, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Hist & Class, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",drmarples@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,7,10,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,3,,,,,505.0,518,PII 910351987,10.1080/09668130902753325,0.0,,,14,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,434SI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265294000006,0

The choices made at city level form a commercial mix which, despite the differing emphases and specific features of single businesses, tends to mark the entire hotel industry, with limited differences according to quality levels and location. The Milan case, in particular, shows the capacity of trade fair events and business components to increase average room rates and occupancy. On the other hand, there is a resulting slackening in holiday periods and non-working weeks (some 100 days per year), when a low level of the average room rate and occupancy is seen. Empirical findings suggest the central role played by management strategy. For this reason the article proposes an approach to help destination managers to reduce the seasonalities on which to focus their lines of development. Moreover, the identification of the periods marked by high performances makes it possible to pinpoint some critical management aspects to guide development or re-launch actions.","[Sainaghi, Ruggero; Canali, Silvia] Univ IULM, Ist Econ & Mkt, I-120136 Milan, MI, Italy",IULM International University Languages & Media,,,"Sainaghi, Ruggero/I-4557-2019","Sainaghi, Ruggero/0000-0003-4306-9625",,,,,64,6,6,0,3,SICHUAN UNIV PRESS,CHENGDU,"29 WANGJIANGLU, JIUYANQIAO, CHENGDU, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5614-4376-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1227.0,1243,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268879300181,0

The results suggest that conventional surveys potentially underestimate expenditures by day visitors and overestimate expenditures by overnight visitors.","[Yang, Sheng-Ping] Gustavus Adolphus Coll, Dept Econ & Management, St Peter, MN 56082 USA; [Ryerson, Annette] Carroll Coll, Helena, MT 59625 USA",Gustavus Adolphus College,"Yang, SP (通讯作者)，Gustavus Adolphus Coll, Dept Econ & Management, 800 W Coll Ave, St Peter, MN 56082 USA.",syang10@gustavus.edu,,,,,,,10,2,3,0,9,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

While superficially supportive of steps towards greater Western European cooperation, the Menzies government had an ambivalent attitude towards the integration process. Ministers and officials in Canberra recognised the importance of a strong and prosperous Western Europe, but the formation of a tightly knit Continental grouping also posed a number of major challenges to the makers of post- war Australian foreign policy. The Menzies government soon began to wonder whether attempts to create supranational bodies in Continental Europe accorded with Australian political, economic, and security interests.","Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Benvenuti, A (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,"Benvenuti, Andrea/AAB-4661-2020","Benvenuti, Andrea/0000-0002-2483-2464",,,,,63,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

It is an important datum that drives successful scheduling and fleet decisions. There are two key components to this problem: the distribution of the time of day demand and how preferred travel time influences itinerary choice. This paper focuses on estimating the time of day distribution. Our objective is to estimate it in a manner that is not confounded with air travel supply; is a function of the characteristics of the traveler, the trip, and the market; and accounts for potential measurement errors in self-reported travel time preferences. We employ a stated preference dataset collected by intercepting people who were booking continental US trips via an internet booking service. Respondents reported preferred travel times as well as choices from a hypothetical set of itineraries. We parameterize the time of day distribution as a mixture of normal distributions (due to the strong peaking nature of travel time preferences) and allow the mixing function to vary by individual characteristics and trip attributes. We estimate the time of day distribution and the itinerary choice model jointly in a manner that accounts for measurement error in the self-reported travel time preferences. We find that the mixture of normal distributions fits the time of day distribution well and is behaviorally intuitive. The strongest covariates of travel time preferences are party size and time zone change. The methodology employed to treat self-reported travel time preferences as potentially having error contributes to the broader transportation time of day demand literature, which either assumes that the desired travel times are known with certainty or that they are unknown. We find that the error in self-reported travel time preferences is statistically significant and impacts the inferred time of day demand distribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, it argues that such strong similarities speak in favour of sister world regimes in these three domains. These sister regimes should first share the key principles of non-discrimination (national treatment (NT) and most favoured nation) embodied in the WTO. Second, by contrast, the climate and water communities should review the other WTO rules to adapt them to their specific demands when needed. Interestingly, when doing so, these two communities may provide much needed inspiration for improving some rules of the current trade regime. Finally, the climate and water regimes may also adopt provisions on pricing that are not needed by the trade regime, which deals mostly with well functioning markets.","Grp Econ Mondiale Sci Po, Paris, France",,"Messerlin, P (通讯作者)，Grp Econ Mondiale Sci Po, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,42,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2011,34.0,11,,,SI,,1883.0,1910,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01419.x,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,864SE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298259500004,0

We find that the change in own bonus-penalty alone entirely explains the effect on claims of a simultaneous change in one's own and the other's bonus-penalty. An increase in the other subject's bonus-penalty has a significant negative effect on claims when the own bonus-penalty is low, whereas it does not have a significant effect when the own bonus-penalty is high. We also find that expected claims are inconsistent with actual claims in the asymmetric treatments. Focusing on reported strategies, we document substantial heterogeneity and show that changes in choices across treatments are largely explained by risk aversion.","[Stanca, Luca] Univ Milan, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Basu, Kaushik] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Rome, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy",University of Milan; Cornell University; Sapienza University Rome,"Stanca, L (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy.",kb40@cornell.edu; becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it; luca.stanca@unimib.it,,"BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,29,8,8,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2011,37.0,4,,,SI,,575.0,595,,10.1007/s00355-011-0577-7,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,824AY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295172400005,0

Hence, I reason that prescriptions for decision making should respect actuality. That is, they should promote welfare maximization in the choice problem the agent actually faces. Any choice respecting weak and stochastic dominance is rational from the actualist perspective.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,17,12,15,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2011,71.0,2,,,,,195.0,210,,10.1007/s11238-009-9182-y,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,791HN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292655900004,0

Self-assessments of health are likely to be endogenous to labor supply due to justification bias and individual-specific heterogeneity in subjective evaluations. We address both concerns. We propose a semiparametric binary choice procedure that incorporates nonadditive correlated individual-specific effects. Our estimation strategy identifies and estimates the average partial effects of health and functioning on labor market participation.

We investigate the uncertainty about the future effects of tearing down the Alaskan Way Viaduct in downtown Seattle, using an integrated model of housing, jobs, land use and transportation, on outcomes including average commute times. Our methodology combines the urban simulation model UrbanSim with the regional transportation model. We assess uncertainty using Bayesian melding, yielding a full predictive distribution of average commute times on 22 different routes in 2020. Of these routes, 14 do not include the viaduct and eight do. For the 14 base routes that do not include the viaduct, the predictive distributions overlap substantially, and so there is no indication that removing the viaduct would increase commute times for these routes. For each of the eight routes that do include the viaduct, the 95% predictive interval for the difference in average travel times between the two scenarios includes zero, so there is not strong statistical support for the conclusion that removing the viaduct would lead to any increase in travel times. However, the median predicted increase is positive for each of these routes, with an average of 6 min, suggesting that there may be some measurable increase in travel time for drivers that use the viaduct as a core component of their commute.

Town residents can vote to override the 2.5% increase in the levy limit, but not if it exceeds the 2.5% levy ceiling. An override results in a permanent increase in the city or town's levy limit. We look at the role that Proposition 2 1/2 has played in the fiscal conditions of towns in Massachusetts. To do so, we develop a model of Proposition 2 1/2 override activity and local fiscal condition. We estimate the model using panel data on Proposition 2 1/2 override attempts since the mid-1980's as well as other town-level socioeconomic and fiscal information. Using a fixed effects estimator, we find that passing a reasonably sized override can significantly strengthen local fiscal condition, both in the short-run and long-run. Further, previous override attempts increase the likelihood of current override activity. The recent economic downturn has resulted in difficult times for local governments. Cuts in state aid have a disproportionate impact on poorer towns. These towns have been less able to attempt and to pass overrides and hence they have not been able to reap the benefits that this has for their fiscal condition. They are faced with reducing expenditures (e.g. teacher layoffs) or passing overrides to increase revenues. We find that worsening fiscal conditions lead to more overrides so we expect to see more override activity in the near future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to the T = 1 case considered in the literature, the payoff of the first proposer is not unique if T > 1, and even at the lower bound of the outcome continuum, it is substantially higher than with T = 1.

Choking is more likely for players who are worse overall free throw shooters, and on the second shot of a pair after the first shot is missed. In general, performance declines as pressure increases (as game time remaining decreases, and as the score margin decreases, whether the shooter's team is winning or losing). However, the authors find no evidence of choking when games are tied in the final 15 seconds.

Industry is the main regional user of water resources. Water is an essential production factor and is used in almost every production process of a manufactured good. We apply estimates of regional production functions, based on AFiD-panel micro-data for Germany, to calibrate regional industrial production and water usage within DANUBIA. Thus, we are able to simulate region-specific effects of climate change and the impact of social scenarios using an innovative model of the reciprocal influences of a huge network of interdisciplinary research areas. Simulation results show wide regional differences in production site reactions as well as between differing scenarios. Comparing scenarios of moderate and serious climate change, we are able to illustrate the severe environmental effects in some regions and to determine considerable economic effects on regional economic growth.","[Jessberger, Christoph; Sindram, Maximilian; Zimmer, Markus] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Jessberger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",jessberger@ifo.de; sindram.m@ifo.de; zimmer@cesifo.de,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This builds on fuzzy set theory whereby the definition of the threshold of who is poor or non-poor is fuzzy. This article proposes a method using a membership function and a confidence interval of poverty line to identify to what extent households can be considered as poor or non-poor. According to this membership function, a relative entropy measure is adopted to assess an aggregation method of fuzzy individual poverty. An application using individual well-being data from Tunisian households is presented.","Univ Tunis, ISG, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis,"Belhadj, B (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, ISG, Tunis, Tunisia.",besma.kaabi@isg.rnu.tn,"Belhadj, Besma/H-3616-2019",,,,,,29,26,26,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive framework for the optimal allocation of prerogatives by stressing the role of economic convergence in allowing for efficient centralization of policies. Harmonization of policies can be harmful when local economies are diverging too much. However, citizens or governments may agree through deliberation on the appropriateness of making their economies converge in order to be able to implement an efficient common policy that internalizes externalities.","Sci Po, F-75337 Paris 07, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Jamet, JF (通讯作者)，Sci Po, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75337 Paris 07, France.",jeanfrancois.jamet@sciences-po.org,,"Jamet, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-4610-1889",,,,,22,7,7,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We analyse the structure of the financial system and highlight the fact that the current system is not well configured for dealing with fluctuation. The good economic performance over the crisis is mainly built on the administrative resources deployed that counterbalanced the negative effect of short-term fluctuation. The high cost of this makes market liberalisation reform imperative.

In contrast, labor productivity has been converging across departments. Secondly, we find considerable agglomeration economies over the whole period.

By autumn, political preferences among smallholders and middling farmers had shifted in favour of protectionism too.

Applying a Dynamic Factor Model, which has seldom been used in market integration analysis, prices are decomposed into international, national and local components. Thus, national and international market integration are identified by a statistical restriction, and results for each single market are obtained. The first result is that globalization has accelerated faster in the first than in the second half of the 19th century, putting the post-1850 transport revolution into perspective. The USA integrated only later into the European market, discounting the role of the grain invasion for trade history. I also show that the European nations that turned protectionist after 1880 reduced the impact of foreign shocks, while free traders fully integrated into the international economy.

We present a model of effort choice over time that shifts the focus from completion of to performance on a single task. We find that being aware of the own self-control problems may reduce a person's performance as well as his or her overall well-being, which is in contrast to the existing literature on procrastination. Extending this framework to a multi-task model, we show that interim deadlines help a quasi-hyperbolic discounter to structure his or her workload more efficiently, which in turn leads to better performance. Moreover, being restricted by deadlines increases a quasi-hyperbolic discounter's well-being. Thus, we provide a theoretical underpinning for recent empirical evidence and numerous casual observations.","[Herweg, Fabian; Mueller, Daniel] Univ Bonn, BGSE, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Herweg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, BGSE, Adenauerallee 24, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",fabian.herweg@uni-bonn.de; daniel.mueller@uni-bonn.de,,"Herweg, Fabian/0000-0002-9874-1995",,,,,34,11,16,4,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2011,70.0,3,,,,,329.0,366,,10.1007/s11238-010-9195-6,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,719IX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287199500003,0

A candidate's fate depends only on the behaviour of two 'weather-vane' committee members. Committee members may vote against favoured candidates if the weather-vane is opposed; enthusiastic assessments by one of these weather-vanes may harm a candidate's chances by increasing others' thresholds for hiring him; sunk time costs may lead voters who voted against hiring to vote for tenuring him, even after a poor probationary performance. For two member committees that are patient and perceptive, the optimal voting rule is a (weak) majority at the hiring stage and unanimity at the tenure stage; when such committees are impatient or imperceptive, the double (weak) majority rule is optimal.

Following the approach of Combes et al. (J Urban Econ 56:217-243, 2004) for France, local employment growth is decomposed into internal growth resulting from employment changes in existing plants and into external growth determined by employment decisions of newly established plants. The dynamics of both components are estimated simultaneously, taking explicitly into account the timing of the impact of specialization, diversity, and competition in a region. The analysis is conducted for 24 sectors in the West German labor market regions from 1993 to 2002. Estimation results emphasize the positive influence of diversity on both the internal and external employment growth, whereas there is no clear result on specialization. A high degree of competition fosters external employment, but is detrimental to internal employment. Dynamic panel regressions show that static externalities dominate. Importantly, the impact of the local industrial structure on employment dynamics does not differ between small and larger plants, nor are there fundamental differences between Western Germany and France.","IAB Reg Saxony Anhalt Thuringia, Inst Employment Res IAB, D-06110 Halle, Germany",,"Fuchs, M (通讯作者)，IAB Reg Saxony Anhalt Thuringia, Inst Employment Res IAB, Frau von Selmnitz Str 6, D-06110 Halle, Germany.",michaela.fuchs@iab.de,,,,,,,30,12,12,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In the first step, the earnings distribution (levels and changes in earnings related to one year against the previous year) is analysed to determine whether there is a discontinuity (that is, a 'kink') at the zero point. The methodology used is frequency histograms. The existence of a kink in the earnings distribution is an approximation of earnings management to avoid losses and earnings decreases (Burgstahler and Dichev, 1997). In the second step, the incidence of certain variables in the critical intervals of the frequency distribution (small losses against small profits and small decreases in earnings against small increases in earnings) is tested. In this context, the paper's purpose is to identify a set of variables that determine different behaviour around the benchmarks.","[Parte Esteban, Laura] Spanish Natl Univ Distance Educ UNED, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Business & Accounting, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Such Devesa, Maria Jesus] Univ Alcala de Henares, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat Econ Struct & Int Econ Org, Antiguo Colegio Minimos, Madrid 28802, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Universidad de Alcala,"Esteban, LP (通讯作者)，Spanish Natl Univ Distance Educ UNED, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Business & Accounting, Paseo Senda del Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain.",lparte@cee.uned.es; mjesus.such@uah.es,"Parte, Laura/AAA-6368-2019; Such-Devesa, Maria J/N-1165-2015","Parte, Laura/0000-0003-3427-9292; Such-Devesa, Maria J/0000-0001-9469-3730",,,,,44,3,3,3,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

J,"Cho, SJ",,,,"Cho, Sung-Jin",,,AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF MAINFRAME COMPUTER INVESTMENT,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET,"This paper introduces a dynamic model of investment decisions in mainframe computer systems. I estimate and test the model using detailed micro data from a company in the telecommunications industry. The model accounts for 'technological depreciation' which distinguishes computers from other investment goods where physical depreciation is typically a key factor underlying replacement investment decisions. The company increased its installed mainframe computer capacity by over 30-fold over the 10-year sample period. Part of this growth was undoubtedly due to the huge increase in performance and the corresponding drop in the per unit cost of processing capacity of mainframes, a consequence of 'Moore's law'. However, there was also tremendous growth in the need for computers for billing, account processing and other tasks, due to the rapid growth in the telecommunications industry over this same time period. I estimate the unknown parameters of the investment model using a nonlinear least squares nested fixed-point algorithm (NLS-NFXP), which solves the Bellman equation underlying the dynamic model of investment and replacement of mainframe computers by nonlinear least squares. I demonstrate that it is feasible to estimate this model on an ordinary PC, whereas standard discretization approaches to solving the firm's optimal investment policy might not even be feasible using supercomputers. I show that the estimated model fits the data very well, and accurately captures the large growth in installed mainframe capacity, the timing and magnitude of replacement investment, as well as periodic upgrades of existing mainframe units. I use the model to decompose how much of the 30-fold increase in mainframe computer capacity is due to 'Moore's law' (i.e. the huge drop in the unit cost of installed mainframe capacity), and how much is due to the growth in demand for services of mainframes, due to the rapid growth in demand for telecommunications services (particularly cell phone accounts) by the firm's customers.

Eumusa members have contributed considerably to the evolution of present-day bananas. Rhodochlamys members, which are very close to the section Eumusa and more specifically to Musa acuminata, have a wide distribution in the Indian subcontinent. This paper deals with a detailed assessment of intersectional relationships between 24 accessions from Eumusa, Rhodochlamys and hybrids of Eumusa x Rhodochlamys, using morphotaxonomic and molecular characterisation. All the test accessions were morphotaxonomically characterised and documented. A total of 21 primer pairs were used to assess the microsatellite polymorphism, of which 81% amplified products, resulting in discrete, reproducible amplicons. A total of 145 alleles were identified with a mean of 8.05 alleles per primer pair. An average PIC of 0.55 was observed. The developed dendrogram failed to project a clear-cut distinction between Eumusa and Rhodochlamys members, indicating a close genetic make-up. Diversity analysis suggests that 'Matti', a Eumusa member, could be a parthenocarpic derivative of M. acuminata ssp. burmannica. Four M. acuminata wild forms identified from North Eastern India during recent explorations proved their uniqueness but exhibited higher genetic relatedness to Rhodochlamys. Musa laterita and its progenies grouped in the same cluster in both morphotaxonomic and molecular characterisation, indicating their close genetic make-up.","[Durai, P.; Uma, S.; Saraswathi, M.

To implement BMA the user must specify a prior distribution in two parts: a prior for the regression parameters and a prior over the model space. Here we address the issue of which default prior to use for BMA in linear regression. We compare 12 candidate parameter priors: the unit information prior (UIP) corresponding to the BIC or Schwarz approximation to the integrated likelihood, a proper data-dependent prior, and 10 priors considered by Fernandez et al. (Journal of Econometrics 2001; 100: 381-427). We also compare two model priors: the uniform model prior and a prior with prior expected model size 7. We compare them on the basis of cross-validated-predictive performance on a well-known growth dataset and on two simulated examples from the literature. We found that the UIP with uniform model prior generally outperformed the other priors considered. It also identified the largest set of growth determinants.

This article offers a corrective to this bias in two ways: by locating the analysis in two rural Central American communities; and by exploring the social relations of consumption in these communities. In doing this, I challenge assumptions about rural places being excluded from global processes and explore the complexities and contradictions of how such communities are inserted into global circuits of production and consumption. Drawing on extensive qualitative research, the article explores the ways in which capitalist development through tourism has reconstituted the political economy of consumption in terms of habits, attitudes and behaviour in these two communities. Using the community and the household as sites of analysis, I explore the complex ways in which inequalities have been reconfigured through changing relations of consumption. Certain kinds of social hierarchies, in particular traditional gendered power relations within the household, have been challenged. However, other inequalities - such as class, ethnicity and nationality - have been reinforced by these processes.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociales, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Ferguson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociales, Madrid, Spain.",l.j.ferguson@sheffield.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/F034288/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F034288/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,11,14,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In proposals for Lombard banks that appeared in the 1650s, proposers employed terms such as 'pawn', 'fund', and 'security' rhetorically in emphasizing the security of the envisioned institutions.

It is argued that the recent financial and economic crisis is a manifestation of a tendency of the aggregate demand to fall relatively to aggregate supply, generated by an asymmetric income distribution, which in turn both increases, and is reinforced by, the mobility of goods, capital and labour, in a process of cumulative causation. This process has not become manifest earlier due to counteracting tendencies generated by the financial system, that were disrupted during the crisis. It is also argued that mainstream economics does not have the adequate framework for explaining the crisis, and actually contributed to the crisis through its theories and policies. Hence an alternative economic framework is suggested for addressing the crisis, drawing upon the contributions of several heterodox economic traditions, especially post-Keynesianism.","Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Fac Econ & Gestao, Sch Econ & Management, Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Martins, N (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Fac Econ & Gestao, Sch Econ & Management, Porto, Portugal.",nmartins@porto.ucp.pt,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,31,19,23,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In this study, we explored the behavioral indicator to dissociate these two kinds of processing mechanism by using a special stimulus, a three-dimensional (3D) virtual hand, which may invoke a mental transformation of either the viewer's own body (hand) or the visual display. In the experiment, the observers were asked to place their palms down or up in order to perform (I) a left or right hand judgment task (LR task) and (2) a same or different judgment task (SD task). Results show that the performance in in-rotation (rotated medially) hand pictures was better than that in out-rotation hand pictures in the LR task (in-rotation effect) but not so in the SD task. Meanwhile, the observers' own initial hand position influenced the performance in the hand-palm view condition in the LR task but not so in the SD task. The findings of this study suggest that the participants use different spatial transformation mechanisms in LR (ego-centric) and SD (object-centric) tasks. Both the material of the body parts and the paradigms of mental rotation determine the reference frame that the participants adopted. The in-rotation effect and whether the observers' own initial hand position influenced the performance might serve as indicators to dissociate ego-centric and object-centric mental rotation.","[Tao, Weidong; Zhang, Xudong; Zheng, Jianhong] Zhanjiang Normal Univ, Sch Educ, Zhanjiang 524048, Guangdong, Peoples R China",LingNan Normal University,,neweidongtao@gmail.com,"tao, wei/GXN-4445-2022; Luo, Wenbo/F-8727-2010","Luo, Wenbo/0000-0002-3528-2111",,,,,34,0,0,0,7,ETP-ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY PRESS,HONG KONG,"ROOM 2202, PING CHUN HOUSE PING TIN ESTATE, LAM TIN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-18242-8-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,374.0,381,,,,,,8,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BVY48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293147200104,0

It means the company's common stock is issued to the public for the first time and listed and traded in the Stock Exchange. IPO underpricing is the deviation range of the issue price and the first day's closing price, and it usually be measured by Initial Return, that is Initial Return (IR) = (the first day's closing price - the issue price) / the issue price. The results show that IPO underpricing is a common phenomenon in.the global securities market. Since the establishment of China's securities market, high IPO underpricing phenomenon has always existed, and it even higher than that in the world's developed countries. From the perspective of the behavior finance, based on investors' prior optimistic sentiment, and by comparing the relative efficiency of the primary and the secondary market in China, this paper makes an empirical analysis on the causes of the high IPO underpricing. We find that compared with the secondary market price, the issue price reflects the corporate intrinsic value better, so it is more rational. Through an empirical test to a sample of the 222 IPO case in both Shanghai and Shenzhen security exchanges during 2010, we find that the three proxy variables, IR10. Turnover and Lotrate, represent a significant relationship to IPO expected underpricing. This finding provides a strong empirical evidence to the hypothesis that the investors' prior optimistic sentiment is related to the IPO expected underpricing. Finally, we make some reasonable suggestions to inhibit the high IPO underpricing.","[Wang, Weiqing; Geng, Yan] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Dept Financial Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Science & Technology Beijing,"Wang, WQ (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Dept Financial Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"zhu, zhu/JDN-0159-2023",,,,,,4,1,1,0,1,SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY PRESS CO LTD,HONG KONG,"UNIT D, 16-F, CHEUK NANG PLAZA 250 HENNESSY RD, WANCHAI, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-988-15121-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,224.0,227,,,,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BG9EG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000393147600057,0

This study considers whether restricting the use of eminent domain for economic development results in negative economic effects. The authors examine economic indicators before and after legislative or judicial restrictions on eminent domain across all states and between states based on the type of legislative/judicial change. Results indicate that there appear to be no negative economic consequences resulting from limiting the use of eminent domain when examining economic indicators before and after legislative/judicial change. Adopting either moderate or major eminent domain restrictions appears to create no economic ill effects when analyzing differences in trends based on the type of legislation passed or scope of judicial decision.","[Carpenter, Dick M., II; Ross, John K.] Inst Justice, Arlington, VA USA; [Carpenter, Dick M., II] Univ Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,"Carpenter, DM (通讯作者)，16630 Mesquite Rd, Peyton, CO 80831 USA.",dcarpent@uccs.edu,,,,,,,77,6,6,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This study uses Monte Carlo methods and demonstrates that the Engle-Granger two-step method leads to biased estimates of asymmetric parameters and in some cases suggests symmetry in the asymmetric data generating process (DGP). The single equation error correction models (SEECM) based on ordinary least squares (OLS) and nonlinear least squares (NLS) are employed for simultaneous estimation of the cointegrating vector and the ECM. The SEECMs perform better than Engle-Granger two-step procedures in estimating the asymmetry and making inferences on its existence in various DGPs. We show that SEECM estimations are less biased and inferences are less likely to be misleading compared to the Engle-Granger two-step procedure. Unlike the asymmetric specifications based on Engle-Granger two-step approach, the asymmetric SEECMs do not refute the possibility of long-run asymmetry by allowing different cointegrating vectors for positive and negative regimes. Examining the model with real data also supports the Monte Carlo results. While the conventional approaches imply symmetry, the proposed asymmetric SEECM, which has been embedded in a Threshold Autoregressive model, uncovers asymmetry at the presence of different cointegrating vectors for positive and negative regimes.","Canadian Energy Res Inst, Calgary, AB T2L 2A6, Canada",,"Honarvar, A (通讯作者)，Canadian Energy Res Inst, 150 3512-33 St NW, Calgary, AB T2L 2A6, Canada.",ahonarvar@ceri.ca,,,,,,,26,4,4,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This is mainly attributed to that, in most contexts, important components of worker skills are unobserved, leading to biased estimates of compensating differences. This article uses data on professional basketball players, which contain rich measures of worker ability, measures of employer nonpecuniary characteristics, and location amenities, to produce a new test of the theory. Empirical results strongly support the theory's predictions in this context. Using this data, we also find that when important measures of player skills are omitted from the specification, there is only limited evidence in support of compensating differences. Our findings indicate that in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity, the quality of the empirical results is distorted and inference on the validity of the theory is misleading.","IMPAQ Int, Labor & Social Policy Grp, Columbia, MD 21044 USA",American Institutes for Research,"Michaelides, M (通讯作者)，IMPAQ Int, Labor & Social Policy Grp, 10420 Little Patuxent Pkwy,Suite 300, Columbia, MD 21044 USA.",mmichaelides@impaqint.com,"Michaelides, Marios/S-1843-2017","Michaelides, Marios/0000-0002-0775-4724",,,,,39,6,10,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This finding is robust to alternative approaches to testing and model choice. The factor demands are those of the symmetric generalized McFadden cost function, which has several advantages in this context. The team factor inputs are the skill characteristics of players, the prices of which are obtained hedonically. In addition to investigating one- versus two-output models, the estimation results are used to obtain demand and substitution elasticities, factor input elasticities with respect to output, cost elasticities, and measures of economies of scale and scope. Although the results support a multiproduct conception of team production, output separability is not rejected, suggesting that team outputs may sometimes be adequately treated as a production aggregate.","[Stewart, Kenneth G.; Jones, J.

Second, the problem of current conceptualisations of skills policy creating narrowly-drawn, technicist interventions that are frequently incommensurate with the scale of the problems which they purport to tackle.

The case is made for a wider framing of both policy possibilities and avenues for relevant research to support such policy development.","[Keep, Ewart] Cardiff Univ, ESRC Ctr Skills Knowledge & Org Performance, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales; [Mayhew, Ken] Univ Oxford, Pembroke Coll, Dept Educ, ESRC Ctr Skills Knowledge & Org Performance, Oxford OX1 1DW, England",Cardiff University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Oxford; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC),"Keep, E (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, ESRC Ctr Skills Knowledge & Org Performance, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Aveue, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales.",KeepEJ@Cardiff.ac.uk; ken.mayhew@pmb.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,75,79,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

When and why did a low-productive pre-industrial agricultural sector turn into a fast-growing, more productive one? Unique data from Sweden, consisting of more than 80,000 observations of farm production output for the period 1700-1860, are used to calculate and explain decisive changes in pre-industrial agricultural production. Our estimations show that crop production more than quadrupled during the period studied, and from the 1780s and onwards production growth by far outstripped population growth. Furthermore, the data allow us to estimate the determinants of change at individual farm level. The results show that enclosures, markets and property rights were of significant importance. Institutional changes, affecting the incentives and the organization of production, made peasants invest in production and productivity. In a general sense this shows the flexibility and awareness of pre-industrial European peasants in exploiting markets and initiating institutional change.","[Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Olsson, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Mats.Olsson@ekh.lu.se; Patrick.Svensson@ekh.lu.se,,"Svensson, Patrick/0000-0002-7143-416X",,,,,71,41,42,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

As a result, while individuals face more idiosyncratic income risk in bad times than in good, households do not. I exploit variation in the cross-sectional covariance of husbands' and wives' incomes to infer the covariance of past income changes.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, despite declining infant mortality rates, adult heights have not increased. We argue that in Sub-Saharan Africa the decline in infant mortality may have been due to interventions that prevent infant deaths rather than improved nutrition and childhood morbidity.

Understanding the determinants of household car ownership, a key determinant of household travel behaviour more generally, is particularly important in the context of current policy developments which seek to encourage more sustainable means of travel. In this paper, we use longitudinal data to estimate dynamic models of household car ownership, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. We find income and previous car ownership to be the strongest determinants of differences in household car ownership, with the effect of permanent income having a stronger and more significant effect on the probability of household car ownership than current income. In addition, income elasticities differ by previous car ownership status, with income elasticities higher for those households with no car in the initial period Other important influences include household composition (in particular, the presence of young children) and lifecycle effects. which create challenges for policymakers in seeking to change travel behaviour (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Nolan, A (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",,,"Nolan, Anne/0000-0002-4597-180X",,,,,54,128,140,0,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

It juxtaposes the notion of special relationship inaugurated by the Lisbon Treaty to three models for organizing relations with proximate countries: pre-accession, the European Economic Area (EEA) and association. The convergence-access paradigm is found to be the basic pillar of the EU approach. The article brings in a series of dilemmas concerning the design and the implementation of the ENP as well as perceptions from selected partner countries. As a potential way to manage tensions and dilemmas inherent in the EU strategy, the article proposes an altogether novel dimension: decentred integration geared towards polity-building that could partially delink convergence and access. The last section maps out four scenarios for the future directions of the ENP that cover the whole continuum from piecemeal enhancement of the policy to the creation of a European Partnership Area underpinned by a new tier of institutions.","[Bechev, Dimitar] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Ctr European Studies, Oxford OX2 6JF, England; [Nicolaidis, Kalypso] Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Bechev, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Ctr European Studies, 62 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6JF, England.",dimitar.bechev@politics.ox.ac.uk; kalypso.nicolaidis@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,35,37,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The evidence provides support for our argument and casts doubt on studies that suggest either that there are no differences in bargaining strategies across EU member countries or that the main differences exist between old and new EU Member States.","[Duer, Andreas] Salzburg Univ, Dept Polit Sci, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Dür, A (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, Dept Polit Sci, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",Andreas.Duer@sbg.ac.at,"Dür, Andreas/HTN-9240-2023","Dür, Andreas/0000-0001-6621-7243; Mateo Gonzalez, Gemma/0000-0003-0924-3693",,,,,35,51,53,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Many do not operate vehicles themselves; instead, they contract out the provision of services. Contractors are paid for each hour of service. They are responsible for hiring crew, forming routes, dispatching, and operating and maintaining agency-owned vehicles. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Metro Mobility, the agency responsible for providing paratransit services, requires contractors to use agency-approved software for booking trips dynamically and sets parameters that guide contractors' practices. Customer trips booked in this fashion may not utilize capacity in the most efficient manner. Therefore, beginning with the daily trip schedules generated by the software, this paper proposes two approaches for improving the efficiency of paratransit operations and estimates the benefit of using these approaches via experiments that utilize Metro Mobility data. The first approach re-optimizes routes developed at the end of each day. The second approach evaluates the benefit to state agencies of selectively using non-dedicated service providers such as taxis. Both approaches are tested on actual data obtained from Metro Mobility. The study shows that a conservative estimate of savings from re-optimization would be approximately 5% of Metro Mobility's operating costs. Savings from the use of taxis are smaller and in the range of hundreds of dollars per day. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic panel data models are estimated to handle the unobserved child-specific factor, endogeneity of TV watching, and dynamic nature of the causal relation. A special emphasis is placed on the last aspect, where TV watching affects cognitive development, which in turn affects future TV watching. When this feedback occurs, it is not straightforward to identify and estimate the TV effect. We develop a two-stage estimation method which can deal with the feedback feature; we also apply the 'standard' econometric panel data approaches. Overall. for math score at ages 8-9, we find that watching TV during ages 6-7 and 8-9 has a negative total effect, mostly due to a large negative effect of TV watching at the younger ages 6-7. For reading score, there is evidence that watching no more than 2 hours of TV per day has a positive effect, whereas the effect is negative outside this range. In both cases, however, the effect magnitudes are economically small.

We find that pupils perceive the available institutions and programs as close substitutes relative to the outside option. This implies an ambiguous role for travel costs: they hardly affect the participation decision, but have a strong impact on the decision where and what to study. To illustrate how our empirical results can inform the debate on reforming public systems, we assess the effects of tuition fee increases. Uniform cost-based tuition fee increases achieve most of the welfare gains; the additional gains from fee differentiation are relatively limited. These welfare gains are quite large under conservative assumptions on the social Cost Of public funds, and there is a substantial redistribution from students to outsiders.

By the virtue of the monotonicity conditions, a decision rule is totally characterized by the set of minimal winning coalitions. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the families of minimal winning coalitions corresponding to maximal and proper simple voting games (SVG). We show that if the proper and maximal SVG is swap robust and all the minimal winning coalitions are of the same size, then the SVG is a specific (up to an isomorphism) system. We also provide examples of proper SVGs to show that the number of winning coalitions is not monotone with respect to the intuitively appealing system parameters like the number of blockers, number of non-dummies or the size of the minimal blocking set.","[Roy, Sonali] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Axenovich, Maria] Iowa State Univ, Dept Math, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Roy, S (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA USA.",axenovic@iastate.edu; sroy@iastate.edu,,,,,,,22,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2010,34.0,3,,,,,429.0,440,,10.1007/s00355-009-0408-2,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,553SQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274387500006,0
