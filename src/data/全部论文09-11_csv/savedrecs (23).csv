Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the custom of cross-holding among companies strengthens entrenchment by managers. We also find that bank directors force managers to disclose information more frequently. In addition, our results show the borrowing ratio is positively associated with information frequency, suggesting that the manager is likely to reveal more when his or her firm borrows money from financial institutions.

In a creditor (debtor) country, an aging population causes a real exchange rate appreciation (depreciation) due to a positive (negative) wealth effect. Structural parameters are estimated by GMM using quarterly data between 1960 and 2001. Then, numerical simulations show that the long-run relationship between population growth and real exchange rate is negative between 1960 and 1971 and positive between 1971 and 2000.

A case for common currency can also be made for Indonesia but for entirely different reasons.

We conclude that the theoretical models that revisit the bank capital channel under the new accord generally support the Basel II procyclicality hypothesis and that the magnitude of the procyclical effects essentially depends on (i) the composition of banks' asset portfolios, (ii) the approach adopted by banks to compute their minimum capital requirements, (iii) the nature of the rating system used by banks, (iv) the view adopted concerning how credit risk evolves through time, (v) the capital buffers over the regulatory minimum held by the banking institutions, (vi) the improvements in credit risk management and (vii) the supervisor and market intervention under Basel II. The recent events and instability in financial markets all over the world have led the procyclicality issue to enter the agendas of several political international fora and some measures to mitigate procyclicality are being put forward. The bank capital channel literature should now play an important role in evaluating their effectiveness.","[Drumond, Ines] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,,,,"Drumond, Ines/0000-0003-1466-3529",,,,,94,42,50,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

(J.E.L. E24, H24, J13, O41) Although the debate about the effects of the regulation of wages is long lasting, little attention has been paid to the role played by minimum wages in inter-temporal contexts with endogenous fertility. This paper investigates such effects within a standard OLG model of neoclassical growth. Some new results, so far escaped closer scrutiny, emerge: introducing a regulated wage may, despite the unemployment occurrence, (i) have a favourable impact on both capital accumulation and output per capita; (ii) reduce the population growth rate. This occurs more likely when a sufficiently high capital share as well as significant unemployment benefits do coexist. Moreover we show that such results also hold even with exogenous fertility and lump-sum taxation on the elderly. Therefore, we conclude that under suitable conditions the Stigler's (1946) result that the regulation of wages always causes a production loss may be violated, that is, in a dynamical context a regulated-wage economy may perform better than a market-wage economy, and the higher is the unemployment rate the higher is the (neoclassical) economic growth. Furthermore, we argue that the minimum wage may also be treated as a policy parameter to control population growth.","[Fanti, Luciano; Gori, Luca] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Fanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; luca.gori@ec.unipi.it,,"Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,36,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We introduce a set of vulnerability indicators and explore whether an ordinal ranking of East Asian economies according to these vulnerability indicators seems to be related to the cross-country differences in estimated slowdowns of economic growth during the crisis.

Using as guide-posts the three research papers of the present issue-written by some of the most notable scholars in the field-we argue that the economics of innovation has;brought to the front concepts which turn out inescapable in addressing what Ronald Coase called the nature of the firm The existence of the firm, first of all, and its ontological nature find in such notions as capabilities and competencies crucial explanatory factors. The same holds true for the firm boundaries, whose definition can not prevent from strategic elements pertaining to the management of innovation. Last, but not least, the firm organization has been found to mirror several aspects of the firm involvement in product and process technological innovations. Accordingly, not only is innovation affected by the market structure firms and consumers contribute to determine. But it also becomes closely linked to the way firms compete among them and crucially affects the dynamics of the industries they operate in Relying on Schumpeter's idea of the ubiquitous nature of the innovative process, these and other related insights become normal attributes of the nature of the firm and thus candidate as conceptual pillars of an innovation theory of the firm whose systematization is still diffuse but increasingly more urgent.","Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Montresor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",sandro.montresor@unibo.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019","montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,34,3,3,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Using data from 100 Czech municipalities and 100 Slovak municipalities, the viability of the Brown-Potoski model is tested. The results of the research show that a connection was identified between the measurability of the required service and its suitability for external provision, but the relationship between the specificity of investments and the suitability for external provision was not.

During a banking crisis in 1930, Atlanta expedited lending to banks in need. St. Louis did not. Outcomes differed across districts. In Atlanta, banks survived at higher rates, lending continued at higher levels, commerce contracted less, and recovery began earlier.

We also show that partial deunionisation leads to higher wages in both unionised and nonunionised sectors, but only increases welfare when the proportion of unionised sectors is sufficiently low.

The strategy generating the most cases historically is resale price maintenance. Here, the law has moved sharply in both Canada and the U.S. towards more solid economic foundations. Yet a gap between the law and economics remains. The economics of resale price maintenance is reviewed within a framework that is much simpler and more general than the existing literature. The law on a second strategy, predatory pricing, represents in my view a success story for the influence of economic theory in spite of the absence of a single accepted theory of predatory pricing. The remaining single-firm strategies are concerned largely with the exclusion by a dominant firm of rivals from a market. I review, with application to cases, the two most basic questions concerning exclusionary strategies. Are exclusionary, anticompetitive contracts ever entered into voluntarily by market participants? On the other hand, is complete or substantial foreclosure of a market through exclusionary strategies necessarily anticompetitive?","Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Winter, RA (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",ralph.winter@sauder.ubc.ca,,,,,,,44,4,6,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-4085,,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We call this a Discover-and-Stop bidding strategy and estimate that 1.39 percent of all bids in eBay auctions are placed by sellers (or accomplices) who execute this strategy. We argue that this kind of shill bidding is unnecessarily effective due to eBay's proxy system and the predictability of other bidders' bids. We also model eBay auctions with shill bidding and find that, in equilibrium, eBay's profits are higher with shilling than without it. Finally, to determine whether bidders have an incentive to bid on their own items, we mimic the bidding behavior of shill bidders in actual eBay auctions and find some evidence of the strategy's success.

This has been taken as strong evidence against Schumpeterian-style theories of business cycles that emphasize the idea that downturns in production may be good times to allocate labor towards innovative activities. Here we argue that the pro-cyclicality of R&D investment is in fact quite consistent with at least one of these theories. In our analysis we emphasize three key features of R&D investment relative to other types of innovative activity: (1) it uses knowledge intensively, (2) it is a long-term investment with uncertain applications, and (3) it suffers from diminishing returns over time.

After discussing the shortcomings of various standard approaches, I measure inequality in such a heterogeneous society by the inequality in individuals' so-called equivalent wages. This approach suggests that redistribution tends to reduce inequality by transferring income from high-ability to low-ability individuals, but to increase inequality by transferring income from consumption-loving to leisure-loving individuals. These countervailing effects lead in all my simulations to a U-shaped relationship between redistribution and inequality.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Hodler, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,"Hodler, Roland/0000-0001-8402-8243",,,,,25,5,5,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2009,76.0,304,,,,,704,718,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00727.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,496LW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000269976600005,0

Yet, empirical studies of monetary policy have typically found exchange rate effects that are inconsistent with overshooting. This puzzling result has been viewed by some researchers as a stylized fact to be reckoned with in policy modelling. However, many of these studies, in particular those using vector autoregressive (VARs) approaches, have disregarded the strong contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and exchange rate movements by placing zero restrictions on them. In contrast, we achieve identification by imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing for contemporaneous interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate. In a study of four open economies, we find that the puzzles disappear. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock has a strong effect on the exchange rate, which appreciates on impact. The maximum effect occurs within 1-2 quarters, and the exchange rate thereafter gradually depreciates to baseline, consistent with the Dornbusch overshooting hypothesis and with few exceptions consistent with uncovered interest parity (UIP).

For a small and isolated electricity system such as Ireland, a high penetration of wind is economically sound only with increased interconnection to Great Britain, since wind generation would otherwise be curtailed.

We find little evidence to support these hypotheses. We also assess whether differences in asset returns, an alternative measure of the attractiveness of financial assets, can explain the international pattern of capital flows. Lower bond yields have been generally associated with larger current account deficits in industrial countries. However, US bond yields have not been significantly lower than those in other industrial economies, suggesting that US financial assets have not been unusually attractive. We consider an alternative hypothesis that spending in the United States was uniquely responsive to lower costs of capital. However, we found this hypothesis also to be weak, as household saving rates have declined throughout the industrial economies.","[Gruber, Joseph; Kamin, Steven] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Kamin, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",steven.kamin@frb.gov,,,,,,,23,38,43,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our review shows that agricultural support policy instruments contribute to increasing the rental price of farmland, and that the extent of this increase closely depends on the level of the supply price elasticity of farmland relative to those of other factors/inputs on the one hand, and on the range of the possibilities of factor/input substitution in agricultural production on the other hand. The empirical literature shows that land prices and rents have in general a significant positive and inelastic response to government support. Such inelastic response is thought to reflect the uncertain future of the farm programmes. And in general, studies have indicated that land prices are more responsive to government-based returns than to market-based returns.","[Latruffe, Laure; Le Mouel, Chantal] INRA & Agrocampus Ouest, Rennes, France",Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; INRAE,"Latruffe, L (通讯作者)，INRA & Agrocampus Ouest, Rennes, France.",,,"Le Mouel, Chantal/0000-0001-8805-1918",,,,,65,75,82,1,39,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0950-0804,,,J ECON SURV,J.

In the conclusions, we speculate on whether this pattern can be explained by common heuristics that influenced the rate and direction of design activities or by doctrinal viewpoints influencing the development and use of tanks in the battlefield.","[Castaldi, Carolina] Univ Utrecht, Dept Innovat Studies, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Fontana, Roberto] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Fontana, Roberto] Bocconi Univ, KITeS, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Nuvolari, Alessandro] LEM St Anna Sch Adv Studies, I-56172 Pisa, Italy",Utrecht University; University of Pavia; Bocconi University; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Castaldi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Innovat Studies, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",c.castaldi@geo.uu.nl; roberto.fontana@unibocconi.it; alessandro.nuvolari@sssup.it,"Nuvolari, Alessandro/F-3151-2011; Castaldi, Carolina/Q-2128-2018","Nuvolari, Alessandro/0000-0002-7275-4827; Castaldi, Carolina/0000-0001-5747-6788",,,,,37,17,19,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using a large sample of German manufacturing firms, we find that companies with widely held capital stock are more active in innovation, i.e. weakly controlled managers show a higher innovation propensity.

With flexible labour markets, a fall in foreign market entry cost tends to generate more income inequality, but not necessarily so, as more firms pay foreign entry cost. By contrast, when labour markets are inflexible in the short run, globalization tends to increase unemployment. In this situation, government unemployment benefits reduce the wages that exporting firms need to pay workers as risk compensation. Thus more firms within an industry and more industries enter the foreign market, which in turn tends to increase unemployment.","Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Janeba, E (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany.",janeba@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Specifically, it employed the technique of a recently developed panel unit-root approach to examine and compare time-series behaviors of manufacturing productivity and services productivity of 25 countries from 1975 to 2004. Results indicated that long-run productivity convergence in manufacturing was trade-related as well as FDI-related. The results have also shown that grouping countries according to their trade partners tends to produce more significant evidence for productivity convergence than their FDI partners do. Furthermore, especially services sector shows no or little convergence, while the manufacturing sector shows strong evidence in favor of convergence. The findings suggest that trade and FDI matter for convergence particularly in the manufacturing productivity movement across countries but more specifically that trade proves more important in explaining long-run manufacturing productivity convergence.

This paper assesses the role of various factors - income distribution, social spending and demographic changes - in explaining the paradox.

Most analysts believe that oil price fluctuations have considerable consequences on economic activity. Oil markets have become relatively free, resulting in a high degree of oil-price volatility and generating radical changes to world energy and oil industries. Consequently, oil markets are naturally vulnerable to significant high price shifts. An example of such a case is the oil embargo crisis of 1973. In this newly created climate, protection against market risk has become a necessity. Value at Risk (VaR) measures risk exposure at a given probability level and is very important for risk management. Appealing aspects of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) have made convincing arguments for its use in managing energy price risks, In this paper, we model VaR for long and short trading positions in oil market by applying both unconditional and conditional EVT models to forecast Value at Risk. These models are compared to the performances of other well-known modelling techniques, such as GARCH, Historical Simulation and Filtered Historical Simulation. Both conditional EVT and Filtered Historical Simulation procedures offer a major improvement over the conventional methods. Furthermore, GARCH(1, 1)-t model may provide equally good results which are comparable to two combined procedures. Finally, our results confirm the importance of filtering process for the success of standard approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Its main finding is that such a relationship need not be monotonic. In particular, three results emerge from the analysis: (i) pooling equilibria, in which investment is independent of entrepreneurial wealth, are more likely to arise when entrepreneurial wealth is relatively low; (ii) separating equilibria, in which investment is increasing in entrepreneurial wealth, are most likely to arise when entrepreneurial wealth is relatively high and; (iii) for a given interest rate, an increase in entrepreneurial wealth may generate a discontinuous fall in investment.

We analyse daily time series of FX data for a set of 63 currencies, including gold, silver and platinum. We group together all the exchange rates with a common base currency and study each group separately. By applying the methods of filtered correlation matrix we identify clusters of closely related currencies. The clusters are formed typically according to the economical and geographical factors. We also study topology of weighted minimal spanning trees for different network representations (i.e., for different base currencies) and find that in a majority of representations the network has a hierarchical scale-free structure. In addition, we analyse the temporal evolution of the network and detect that its structure is not stable over time. A medium-term trend can be identified which affects the USD node by decreasing its centrality.

Both the departure from class and the occasional attempts to re-assert its theoretical and political significance have assumed diverse forms. This diversity is represented in the three books discussed here. The first comprises a collection of Marxist, non-Marxist and explicitly anti-Marxist chapters on class analysis, edited by Erik Olin Wright. The second is Michael Zweig's edited volume of Left-oriented interpretations of class in its various political, economic and social dimensions, with consistent reference to gender and race. Finally, there is Charles W. Mills's rejection of class and Marxism in favor of a black radicalism underpinned by the concept of white supremacy. The essay goes on to explore the possibilities for a reinvigoration of the radical potential of class, through its theoretical and political integration with other bases of difference and division, most notably gender and race.","Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2150, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Lafferty, G (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2150, Australia.",g.lafferty@uws.edu.au,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

A prudent central bank adjusts the nominal interest rate more aggressively to changes in the inflation gap, especially if the volatility of cost-push shocks is large. If the interest rate impacts the output gap after a lag, the interest also responds to the output gap, especially with strong persistence in aggregate demand. Prudence pushes up this reaction coefficient as well. If data are poor and appear with a lag, a prudent central bank responds less strongly to new measurements of the output gap. However, prudence attenuates this policy reaction and biases the prediction of the output gap upwards. particularly if output targeting is important. Finally, prudence requires an extra upward (downward) bias in its estimate of the output gap before it feeds into the policy rule if inflation is above (below) target. This reinforces nominal interest rate reactions. A general lesson is that prudent predictions are neither efficient nor unbiased. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This relationship may reflect the larger foreign exchange operations and trading positions of larger Chinese banks and their significant indirect foreign exchange exposure arising from impacts of the renminbi exchange rate movements on their customers. Empirical evidence also suggests that the average foreign exchange exposures of state-owned and joint-stock commercial banks in China are higher than those of banks in Hong Kong, notwithstanding their limited participation in international banking businesses compared with their Hong Kong counterparts. It is also found that negative foreign exchange exposure is prevalent for larger Chinese banks, suggesting that an appreciation of the renminbi tends to reduce their equity value. It is therefore likely that the banking sector's performance will be hampered. Together with the fact that decreases in equity values generally imply a higher default risk, the effects of different scenarios of renminbi appreciation on the default risk of Chinese banks should therefore be closely monitored.

Information about a stage can be bought at a fixed but arbitrary cost. Opponents cannot observe the information purchase by a player. For our main result, we make the usual assumption that the dimension of the set FIR of feasible and individually rational payoff vectors is equal to the number of players. We show that, if there are at least three players and each player has at least four actions, then every payoff vector in the interior of the set FIR can be achieved by a Nash equilibrium of the discounted repeated game if the discount factor is sufficiently close to 1. Therefore, nearly efficient payoffs can be achieved even if the cost of monitoring is high. We show that the same result holds if there are at least four players and at least three actions for each player. Finally, we indicate how the construction can be extended to sequential equilibrium.

Recipients are sometimes stuck with gifts they would not have purchased because the giver does not perfectly know the recipient's preferences and in-kind gifts cannot be costlessly refunded. Such gifts are welfare reducing compared to giving cash if, in addition, recipients possess full information as to which stores carry their desired goods and the ability to reach these stores costlessly. We replace these two latter assumptions with the more realistic assumptions of uncertainty about the location of goods and search costs. In contrast to existing economic models, gifts in our model enhance expected welfare. Moreover, gift giving cannot be replaced by a profit-maximizing trader nor the introduction of nearby specialty stores carrying gift goods. We use our model to explain a number of stylized facts about gift giving, the organization of retail trade and in-kind government transfers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To explain this we develop a model of time inconsistent preferences in the context of domestic violence. This time inconsistency generates a demand for commitment. We present supporting evidence that women in violent relationships display time inconsistent preferences by examining their demand for commitment devices. We find that no-drop policies - which compel the prosecutor to continue with prosecution even if the victim expresses a desire to drop the charges - result in an increase in reporting. No-drop policies also result in a decrease in the number of men murdered by intimates suggesting that some women in violent relationships move away from an extreme type of commitment device when a less costly one is offered.

In this two-sector model, globalization ultimately reduces labor market rigidities through either one of two channels: capital mobility triggers a re-allocation of resources, which trade integration amplifies, away from the high-rent / highly-unionized sector; the threat of costly relocations encourages labor market deregulation, The latter channel is more efficient because it avoids sub-optimal sectoral specialization.

WC study then the variation caused by two consecutive monetary changes with the same sign and amount and compare it with the case of a single change with double amplitude finding that in the short range the effect of the double amplitude is larger while in the long range is true the opposite implying that a sequence of changes with limited amplitude has the advantage of testing the system with smaller risk without compromising the final result, Finally, the case of two step variations of monetary policy with opposite amounts is considered for the circumstance when a first monetary change does not give the desired result and it is needed to go back to the previous monetary condition; we find that their total effects are reversible only asymptotically, but in a relatively short time the total effect may be negligible. The theory may be applied also to the effect generated by shocks other than monetary changes as a Sudden economic development or an international crisis.

Exploiting the status quo bias by setting a long investment horizon or low feedback frequency as a default turns out to be a successful behavioural intervention to increase investment levels.","[Fellner, Gerlinde] Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Vienna, Austria; Univ Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Innsbruck; University of Gothenburg,"Fellner, G (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Vienna, Austria.",,"Fellner-Röhling, Gerlinde/A-5995-2013; Sutter, Matthias/R-2018-2018","Fellner-Röhling, Gerlinde/0000-0002-8577-4456; Sutter, Matthias/0000-0002-6143-8706",,,,,24,48,52,2,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

(2) Under which regime is the expectation effect quantitatively important? Using two canonical DSGE models, we show that there exists asymmetry in the expectation effect across regimes. The expectation effect under the dovish policy regime is quantitatively more important than that under the hawkish regime. These results suggest that the possibility of regime shifts in monetary policy can have important effects on rational agents' expectation formation and on equilibrium dynamics. They offer a theoretical explanation for the empirical possibility that a policy shift from the dovish regime to the hawkish regime may not be the main source of substantial reductions in the volatilities of inflation and output.

On the purely economic front, the argument is not strong. Yet a broader political economy approach concludes that national currency policy can in fact impose non-pecuniary externalities on partner nations. This is especially the case with major policy-driven misalignments, which cannot easily be countered by other governments. For example, one country's substantially depreciated currency can provoke powerful protectionist pressures in its trading partners, so that exchange rate policy spills over into trade policy in potentially damaging ways. Inasmuch as one government's policies create these sorts of costs for other countries, and for the world economy as a whole, there is a case for global governance. This might include some institutionalized mechanism to monitor and publicize substantial currency misalignments. While there appears to be little global political attention to such a mechanism now, there have been initiatives along these lines at the regional level, and the current crisis may have stimulated more general stirrings of interest.","Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Frieden, JA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St,Off 211, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jfrieden@harvard.edu,"Frieden, Jeffry/P-8731-2019",,,,,,23,3,3,0,4,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 9,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,20096,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20LT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208142200001,0

Recent studies suggest also that institutions interact with each other and cannot be analysed in isolation. In this paper, we estimate a standard reduced-form model to explore the institutional determinants of unemployment and assess its robustness using a large battery of robustness checks. We show that, although the impact of each individual policy varies across countries owing to policy interactions, the simple linear model can be used to draw inferences for countries with an average mix of institutions. The model is then extended to encompass systemic interactions, in which individual policies interact with the overall institutional framework. We find relatively robust evidence of broad reform complementarities.","[Bassanini, Andrea] Univ Paris 02, OECD, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Bassanini, Andrea] Univ Paris 02, ERMES, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Bassanini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, OECD, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",andrea.bassanini@oecd.org; romain.duval@oecd.org,,,,,,,26,141,154,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Thus, the hard core of relevant economics is formed by the classical microeconomics and the classical theory of capitalist economic growth and by Keynesian macroeconomics. In contrast, neoclassical economists aiming to build a mathematical science wrongly adopted the hypothetical-deductive method and came to macroeconomic and growth models that do not have practical use in policymaking.

This distinction is important for macroeconomic theories, because the two models imply very different source of output fluctuations due to (transitory or permanent) shocks. We show, using an alternative method relative to the previous studies, that the period of turmoil experienced from 1929 to 1949 can be explained by several large shocks and some of them have a permanent effect due to the Great Depression and World War II. We also find evidence in favor of stochastic trend. These results show that the persistence in US output can be explained both by infrequent but significant economic and financial events (infrequent large shocks) and by period-by-period permanent innovations (frequent small shocks), such as productivity shocks resulting from technological changes, as the stochastic trend would imply.

We propose a model of the transition in which population and technology respond endogenously to climate. The available data on the southwest Asian case, other cases of pristine transition, and cases of non-transition are consistent with our model, but often inconsistent with rival explanations. In addition, our theory of the origins of agriculture has implications for instrumental variable strategies that can be used in empirical research on long run economic growth and development.","[Dow, Gregory K.; Reed, Clyde G.; Olewiler, Nancy] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Reed, CG (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",reed@sfu.ca,,"Dow, Gregory/0000-0002-5441-1353",,,,,63,20,23,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

We study this implication by explicitly proposing the variety of capital goods available for production as a direct measure of the state of technology. Within a simple growth and development framework, we derive a 'conditional technological convergence' hypothesis on how this variety should behave if it were indeed to represent the state of technology. The hypothesis is tested with highly disaggregated trade data, using tools from the income convergence literature. The results suggest that a trade-based count measure of the variety of available capital goods, allowing for product differentiation by country of origin, indeed behaves 'as if' it represented technology when change of technology is understood as a learning process, and that there is conditional technological convergence among our panel of mainly OECD and transition economies.

We present a model in which parents make schooling decisions for their children, weighing the utility benefit of having a child with formal public or private education versus the forgone income from child labor or household work. Parents vote over the preferred tax rate to finance freely provided public education. The utility benefit of an educated child is proportional to expenditure per student, so that there is congestion in public school. We find that when parents can send their children to work or to private school, high inequality leads to exit from public education at both ends of the income distribution. Thus high inequality reduces the support for public education, leading to a low tax rate and expenditure per student. Exit from public education results in both high child labor and a large fraction of students attending private school. In fact there is a threshold level of inequality above which there is no longer support for public education. In addition we explore the implications for the design of foreign aid. The results suggest that foreign aid policies should focus on promoting school attendance rather than increasing school resources, as the later policy might be offset by a reduction in the recipient country's fiscal effort, with little impact on outcomes.","[Gutierrez, Catalina] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Tanaka, Ryuichi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",The World Bank; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Gutiérrez, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW,Mail Stop MC4-415, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cgutierrez2@worldbank.org; tanaka@mei.titech.ac.jp,,", Ryuichi/0000-0002-3483-5175",,,,,36,11,13,5,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The collected survey data is then analyzed using factor analysis to capture the related determining factors indicative of competitiveness at the enterprise level. The findings demonstrate that government policies and related industry infrastructure are the most important determinants of competitiveness in the textile and apparel industries, followed by domestic demand. This suggests that the improvement of industry infrastructure can foster industry performance, and that more resources should be endowed to enhance the domestic business competitiveness of local enterprises.

The paper compares these outcomes with those from the market-orientated, more privatized transport and communications sector in Hong Kong, for the benchmark year 2004 and a review period from 1990 to 2005. The study is among the first to carefully compare labor productivity in specific sectors between the two countries. Although Singapore generally recorded higher levels of labor productivity, there was some catch-up by Hong Kong in the later part of the review period. There was also substantial variation in labor productivity performance within sectoral branches in the two sectors. The study suggests there is some evidence that the different political-economic structures and policy approaches to deregulation and liberalization played a role in determining productivity performance in the transport and communications sectors in Singapore and Hong Kong. The analysis infers a potential, increasing focus on privatization as the driving force for further liberalization of the transport and communications sector in Singapore.","[Lee, Boon L.] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Business, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Shepherd, William] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University,"Lee, BL (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Business, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",bl.lee@qut.edu.au; w.shepherd@griffith.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575",,,,,49,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The proposed 2NLS is applied to the derivation of the policy-relevant average gains in the presence of an endogeneity bias to a license fee implementation program regulated by states. Recreationists who purchased a license are likely to recreate more than are the nonlicensed holders because the regulation may reduce congestions at sites where licensee visit often. The license regulation has a greater impact on the use of natural resources after controlling observed and unobserved confounders which might be correlated with the probability of being a license holder and with the final outcome, the number of recreation trips. We confirm that the individual without a permit regards the recreation trip as less valuable than does the individual having a license permit. We also found that the likelihood of purchasing a license among young adult recreationists is not at the level the states may desire. In addition, the number of trips demanded is more responsive to the nontransportation-related implicit travel cost than to the transportation-related implicit travel cost, although travel implicit costs are price inelastic.","[Bilgic, Abdulbaki] Harran Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-63040 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Florkowski, Wojciech J.] Univ Georgia, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Griffin, GA USA",Harran University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Bilgic, A (通讯作者)，Harran Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Econ, TR-63040 Sanliurfa, Turkey.",tebrik@yahoo.com,"Bilgic, Abdulbaki/AAH-9111-2019; Florkowski, Wojciech/ABA-4946-2021",,,,,,48,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we find that the tax incentive in HIPAA increased the take-up rate of private LTC insurance by 3.3 percentage points, or 25%, for those eligible. Despite this seemingly strong response, our results imply that even an above the-line tax deduction would not increase the coverage rate of seniors beyond 13%, indicating that tax incentives alone are unlikely to expand the market substantially. We also present, to our knowledge, the first estimate of the price elasticity of demand for LTC insurance of around -3.9, suggesting that demand is highly elastic at the current low ownership rate. Finally, we evaluate the net fiscal impact of the tax incentive and find that the tax deductibility of LTC insurance premiums leads to a net revenue loss for the government, as the reduced tax revenue from granting the tax incentive exceeds the savings in Medicaid's LTC expenditures.

Nobility, a culturally determined, hereditary status marker, might act as such an indicator, and thereby serve as a vehicle for the cultural transmission of economic standing. As an institution, nobility is an anachronism. Status, however, plays an important role in most societies, making individuals allocate valuable resources to status-enhancing activities. This suggests that even though nobility no longer entails formal privileges, it may continue to be coveted as a status marker. We examine the relative performance of nobility in the marriage market. Data on Swedish marriages provide an opportunity to test the hypothesis that the probability of hypergamy (marrying 'up') in terms of wealth increases when an individual belongs to the nobility. Our main finding is a significantly higher probability of hypergamy for members of the nobility, controlling for own wealth and other covariates. This 'nobility premium' is sizeable. The effect is statistically significant and robust to a number of different measures of hypergamy. This finding has implications for the intergenerational transmission of inequality, and for the longevity of the institution of nobility itself.","[Almenberg, Johan] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Almenberg, Johan] Res Inst Ind Econ, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dreber, Anna] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stockholm School of Economics; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Harvard University,"Almenberg, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.almenberg@hhs.se; anna.dreber@hhs.se,"Dreber, Anna/D-8709-2010",,,,,,35,5,5,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,2,,,,,161,181,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00429.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,433FA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265188500002,0

This process is determined by different causes such as the internet, the cost and speed of conveyance, global problems and so on. There are four dimensions that define the organizational own profile of globalization: infrastructure, officialization, stratification and ways of action. Globalization does not reflect a linear simple logic of development and does not prefigures a world-wide society and can be seen rather a process or a complex of processes then as a singular state. Globalization downsides can be highlighted by thoroughly evaluating the opportunities and the risks and by staying apart from the nowadays tendencies of demonetizing or quite the opposite glorying the phenomenon consequences. When it comes about globalization public debates bring out issues such as erosion of the national state, social dumping, rich-poor cleavage. Some consider globalization a form of neo-liberalism. Others do not equalize globalization and neo-liberalism, furthermore criticizing the neo-liberal concept according to which forces of free market either favor consumers due to the competition between firms or lead to optimal allotting of the resources. They identify big firms as being the true controllers of globalization. One of the predictive consequences of oligopolist globalization is that even the market concept is about to change, once independent non-oligopolistic firms are about to vanish.., that means in fact that the market is vanishing. The economic mechanism of globalization supposes strategies and alliances within oligopols, but also financial and production tides within the firms. Future is not so bright for the firms searching for markets, because access to such a market is conditioned by the affiliation to a multi-national net.","[Andreea, Niminet Liviana] Univ Bacau, Bacau, Romania",University of Bacau,,liviananiminet@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,221,226,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800033,0

If implemented at the lowest possible cost, the 20% emissions reduction would lead to a welfare loss of 0.5-2.0% by 2020. Second-best policies increase costs. A policy with two carbon prices (one for ETS, one for the non-ETS) could increase costs by up to 50%. A policy with 28 carbon prices (one for the ETS, one each for each Member State) could increase costs by another 40%. The renewables standard could raise the costs of emissions reduction by 90%. Overall, the inefficiencies in policy lead to a cost that is 100-125% too high. The models differ greatly in the detail of their results. The ETS/non-ETS split may have a negligible impact on welfare, while the renewables standard may even improve welfare. The models agree, however, that the distortions introduced by total EU package imply a substantial welfare loss over and above the costs needed to meet the climate target. The marginal, total and excess costs reported here are notably higher than those in the impact assessment of the European Commission. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Tol, Richard S.

The drivers and impacts of technological change have therefore become an important research issue in the field of climate economics. While models to analyze the interactions between economy, energy and the environment initially treated technological change as exogenous, more recent modeling approaches often represent technological change as enclogenously induced. Typically, models of induced technological change in climate economics are based on perfect foresight in a deterministic world. However, both technological change and climate impacts are subject to large uncertainties that may substantially affect the design of efficient climate policies.

The selection of new chief executive officer If (CEO) is an important decision, which has implications for future performance of organization. However, there are no consistent agreements what attributes of executives' are likely to be associated with organizational success. The paper explores the attributes of executive successor and identifies what skills and traits of successor and personal characteristics are related to the organizational performance after succession. Besides, the paper revealed that most of the studies were carried out to identify the link between executive successor and financial organizational performance. A limited number of works analyzed the employees' reaction to the executive's change and a number of changes implemented by newly appointed executive. This paper aims to answer the question what attributes of executive successor's relate to financial results of organization, implemented changes and turnover of employees after succession. After exploring the attributes of executive successor and organizational performance indicators the conceptual model was developed. To test the relationships between attributes of executive successor and organizational performance variables a quantitative research methodology was employed. The survey was implemented in rapidly growing or most profitable Lithuanian organizations which experienced the CEO change within last 3 years. The results of the survey revealed that there is a tendency to promote a man as a successor with higher education at the age from 31 to 40 years having more than 5 years of experience in the sector and a top management experience from 4 to 10 years. It can be said, that external candidates were not considered more favorably than internal employees. The results of the survey allowed to identify what attributes of executive successor relate to organizational performance. There were found relationships between a) relation skills of successor and changes in working policies and practices, b) the education of successor and changes in organization and c) the age of successor and employees' turnover in organization and number of implemented technological changes, d) traits of successor and changes in organizational culture. The survey disclosed that there is no relationship between financial organizational performance and attributes of successor. Moreover, the relationships revealed between the attributes of successor and organizational performance variables was weak, and thus they lead to the confrontation of previous findings emphasizing the executive succession impact on organizational performance. Therefore, further research should be carried out solving the complexity of the executive succession.","[Buoziute-Rafanaviciene, Solveiga; Pundziene, Asta; Turauskas, Linas] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-44254 Kaunas, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics,"Buoziute-Rafanaviciene, S (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, E Ozeskienes Str 18, LT-44254 Kaunas, Lithuania.",solbuo@ism.lt; astpun@ism.lt; lintur@ism.lt,,,,,,,52,12,22,1,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

As the objectives, descriptions of the concept of sustainable development are analyzed and classified Then the analysis of the concept of sustainable development is given. After this analysis the systematic view of the dimensions of sustainable development is provided. Methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison and generalization were used for the research. Although the essence of the concept of sustainable development is clear enough, the exact interpretation and definition of sustainable development have caused strong discussions. Thus, we should take into consideration the fact that the concept of sustainable development may be difficult to understand and may have different meaning dependending on the analyzed literature on the concept in which it is used. For this reason, in the article we presented several descriptions of sustainable development that would include multiple aspects of this concept. Difficulties related to the definition of sustainability show that sustainable development is a complex and multidimensional issue, which combines efficiency, equity, and intergenerational equity based on economic, social, and environmental aspects. Debates on sustainable development presented in the literature can be classified into several thematic areas: a) conceptual; b) contextual; c) academic; and d) geopolitical, which are investigated in the article in more details. As a general concept, sustainable development encompasses three fundamental approaches: economic, environmental, and social development, which are interrelated and complementary. Traditionally, the concept of sustainable development involves three equivalent components: environmental, economic, and social development; as well as three dimensions of wellbeing, i.e. economic, ecological, and social, and their complex interrelations, which are investigated in article in more details. We tend to think that the analysis of sustainable development should be based on the assumption, indicating that sustainable development is based not on economic, social, ecological, or institutional dimensions, but rather on their system as an integrated whole. Not all relations identified in a sustainability analysis have the same relevance and the same meaning for the strategic instruments of regional sustainable development. Relations among sub-systems identified should be relocated in a logical structure, based on the intention of the cognitive tool being built. In order to attain this, a hierarchical framework with coherent sustainability logic is needed. Since sustainability issues should be analyzed and solved on the system levels where they develop and manifest themselves, one can consistently formulate respective aims of the sustainable development policy for separate dimensions (economic, ecological, social, and institutional) of sustainable development on each of these levels of economic development policy, thus obtaining the matrix of the aims of sustainability policy.","[Ciegis, Remigijus] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ciegis, Remigijus] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ramanauskiene, Jolita; Martinkus, Bronislovas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vytautas Magnus University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@aula.vukhf.lt; jolita.ramanauskiene@ktu.lt; bronius.martinkus@ktu.lt,,,,,,,76,141,166,4,146,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

There are many possibilities for people to study, work and live in any country of the world. Recently there was highlighted a new phenomenon of brain circulation in scientific works. Scientific researches theoretically attempt to describe the new tendencies of migration of highly skilled persons who are working in foreign country and then coming back to their motherland. It is important to stress that most scientists name this process as brain drain or brain gain. However, there is a gap in more detailed and specific explanation of this phenomenon. The authors call it as brain circulation. The research problem being solved in this article should be constructed: how to highlight the main theoretical features of brain circulation phenomenon in order to present hypothetical actions for stimulation of this phenomenon expression. The aim of the article was to highlight the theoretical features of brain circulation phenomenon and to suggest the hypothetical actions how to stimulate the brain circulation expression. The article stresses that brain circulation being the phenomenon of knowledge-based society is a vital process for the nations as well as for the world's economy development. Human capital is one of the most important pillars sustaining countries economy growth as well as its competitiveness in the knowledge-based world. Considering the aspects mentioned above, there was analysed many definitions of brain circulation phenomenon. As the conclusion of this analysis, it was pointed out that most of the scientists who investigated this phenomenon highlighted the same ideas concerning brain circulation. They named it as the mobility of highly qualified persons between motherland and foreign countries. This stimulates creation, dissemination, adaptation of new knowledge. In order to crystallise new understanding of brain circulation process, there was highlighted the difference between such conceptions as brain gain, brain drain, brain exchange, and brain waste. The factors fostering countries economy growth where process of brain circulation is highlighted as well as the model of components which stimulate brain circulation was constructed and presented in the article. The governments recognize the importance of human capital accumulation, its input into the nation's development. Therefore various programmes which help to attract the knowledge workers are implemented. Considering this the most successful brain circulation policies are analysed in this article. It is widely known that such Asian countries as India, Korea and Taiwan have experienced the exodus of their habitants. Therefore many qualified people have left their motherland. However these nations have managed to overcome this harmful They have created and implemented successful which have led to the brain circulation or even to brain gain. The experience of these countries and the circulation policies applied with the purpose to scientists to work in these countries is presented as best practice examples. The manifestation of brain circulation phenomenon in is revealed as well. There was made the that Lithuania has no coherent brain policy. However, some rudiments of actions stimulate the manifestation of brain circulation have highlighted Unfortunately they do not give the changes in this field. As the outcome of considerations and analysis of best practise as well as presentation of situation's in hypothetical actions for development of brain in Lithuania were suggested in the article.","[Daugeliene, Rasa; Marcinkeviciene, Rita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Daugeliene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rasa.daugeliene@ktu.lt; rita.marcinkeviciene@yahoo.com,,,,,,,29,21,24,1,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Despite this, there have been no published attempts to measure the impact of renewable technologies on energy security or to assess the major threats to that security. This analysis is important if the benefits of renewable energy sources in Fiji are to be evaluated adequately. This article considers the key threats to the security of electricity supply in Fiji for grid-connected and off-grid areas and uses these as a basis for a definition of energy security that is relevant to Fiji.

We show that a price-taking generator will generate only when the output price exceeds its operational marginal cost by the value of the option to delay the use of stored fuel. This option value, which is an increasing function of spot price volatility and the uncertainty about fuel availability, must be considered when evaluating whether market power is present in electricity markets. We calibrate our model to the California electricity market and show the implications of Hurricane Katrina for generators' offers. The standard approach for simulating electricity Supply curves for use in market power evaluations just uses operational marginal cost.

The results of this analysis may be of interest to those engaged in both technical trading and portfolio management. Our results support asymmetric return patterns for all stock markets and on the two definitions of return continuations. Further, we also identify that consecutive positive return days exhibit greater persistence than consecutive negative return days. Finally, using the holding-period definition we also identify whether longer holding periods are always associated with increased returns. Evidence whilst generally supportive is not ubiquitous, furthermore, the majority of the increase in returns occurs over a holding period of 7-10 days, with more limited increases over the remainder of the 45-day holding-period considered.

Standard risk-neutral valuation models cannot explain these patterns, and attempts to capture the exercise behavior of risk averse executives have been limited to the special case of one option. This paper solves for the optimal exercise behavior for a risk averse executive who is granted multiple stock options. We show that utility-based models do not predict block exercise behavior. Rather, the risk averse executive exercises stock options individually at a sequence of increasing price thresholds. When, in addition, the executive faces frictions such as costly exercise, he faces a trade-off between exercising little and often to maximize return, and exercising larger quantities oil fewer occasions to minimize effort. This generates realistic block exercise behavior and yields new predictions. In particular, executives should begin by exercising large blocks of options, but the block sizes should become smaller over time. Our framework also allows us to study the impact of multiple exercise dates on estimates of the cost of options to the company. We find that assuming the executive can only exercise on a single occasion underestimates the cost of the options compared with allowing for optimal exercise behavior.

In particular, the work examines the changes in trade patterns at sectoral level. In order to distinguish between the two types of trade specialization (inter-sectoral specialization and intra-sectoral trade (IST)) the empirical work was carried out using the Balassa index and the Grubel-Voyd index. The former examines the degree of inter-sectoral specialization by sector, the latter considers the level of trade specialization between sectors. The empirical results support both the new trade theory, which predicts an increasing level of intra-sectoral trade with liberalization processes, and the new strand of trade theory, which, distinguishing between horizontal and vertical IST, suggests a co-existence between inter- and intra-sectoral trade.","Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Grigorovici, C (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,4,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Growth in benefit levels explains 89 of overall healthcare spending growth in the ten countries over the period, with Norway, Spain, and the U. S. recording the highest annual benefit growth rates.

Noticeably, the feasibility of this concept is based on the perfect market assumptions and no riskless arbitrage opportunity.

Our model contains a government engaging in activities to accomplish objectives that depend on public support for the enforcement of the rule of law and agents who interpret the level of activities of the government as indications of the government's intent to enforce the rule of law. Agents, using the level of government activities as an input to their decisions, choose whether to support the government's objectives. We establish conditions under which the level of activities chosen by the government maximizes its benefits, and simultaneously induces the constituency to support enforcement of the rule of law. These conditions provide a basis for the argument for the implementation of the big-bang policy. When these conditions do not hold, however, we show that the level of activities that maximizes the government's benefits may have only a minor impact on support for the enforcement of the rule of law. Two characteristics play an important role in these conditions: the initial level of crime and the types of activities the government chooses to undertake. We present examples showing that the initial level of crime has the more dramatic effect on subsequent support for the rule of law.","[Katz, Barbara G.; Owen, Joel] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Katz, BG (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA.",bkatz@stern.nyu.edu; jowen@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Among nine east-west highways in Korea, the East-West 9 highway increases the GDP by 0.3% over the 30-year time period horizon, with 0.016% of the GDP due to the synergy effect. The East-West 9 highway has the largest synergy effect of US$0.164 billion per year on the manufacturing sector of Kwangju Metropolitan Area, resulting in a gain in a regional GRP per capita of US$15.88 per year. Since most synergy effects are generated in less developed regions, highway development can contribute to the reduction in regional disparities.","[Kim, Euijune] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

This debate relies on the impressive literature devoted to the link between labor market institutions and economic performance. It's however striking that most of the contributions in this field has eluded one important source of divergence across European countries namely the level at which wage bargaining takes place. The motivation of this article is to consider, from a theoretical viewpoint, the very nature of the. interactions between the wage bargaining's level and the labor market policies. In this perspective, we appeal to a search and matching model in the style of Pissarides (2000) in an economy made up of a number of industries. In such a, framework we demonstrate that wage bargaining at; the industry level leads to an inefficient resource allocation.

The result is robust after we account for the endogeneity problem regarding the contestants' racial composition, which arises due to the voting mechanism.

Globalization provides on new dimensions opportunity for some wider markets, the possibility of producing and marketing a larger range of goods, increasing chances for attracting capitals and for access the high technologies.

Costa Rica's debt ratio remained stable but at a high level; near 50 per cent. Is there reason to be concerned about the solvency of the public sector in these economies? We provide an answer to this question based on the quantitative predictions of a variant of the framework proposed by Mendoza and Oviedo (2007). This methodology yields forward-looking estimates of debt ratios that are consistent with fiscal solvency, for a government that faces revenue uncertainty and can issue only non-state-contingent debt. In this environment, aversion to a collapse in outlays leads the government to respect a natural debt limit equal to the annuity value of the primary balance in a fiscal crisis. A fiscal crisis occurs after a long sequence of adverse revenue shocks, and public outlays adjust to their tolerable minimum. The debt limit also represents a credible commitment to remain able to repay even in a fiscal crisis. The debt limit is not, in general, the same as the sustainable debt, which is driven by the probabilistic dynamics of the primary balance. The results of a baseline scenario question the sustainability of current debt ratios in Brazil and Colombia, while those in Costa Rica and Mexico are inside the limits consistent with fiscal solvency. In contrast, current debt ratios are found to be unsustainable in all four countries for plausible changes to lower average growth rates or higher real interest rates. Moreover, sustainable debt ratios fall sharply when default risk is taken into account.","[Mendoza, Enrique G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oviedo, P.

Budgetary restrictions, the failure of the Constitutional Treaty, and an arrogant strategy for EU enlargement have diminished the viability of deeper European integration. Neither policies for citizenship and cohesion nor a common external policy will be reinforced by a Europe that prefers enlargement over improvement of its financial, legislative, and institutional resources. The case of Turkey is illustrative in this regard: Europe seems to assume this new enlargement without considering its advantages and disadvantages (qualitative and quantitative). While I support Turkish adhesion, I also suggest prior evaluation of the implications, as well as of the actions necessary to prepare Turkey's EU membership. The reason is simple: if the EU continues its enlargement without reinforcing its budget and its internal dimension, the possibilities for implementing cohesion, citizenship, and external policies will be seriously reduced.","Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Solís, JAN (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",janietos@ccee.ucm.es,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The usual competitive bidding process - which assists in both value-for-money evaluation and in lowering corruption risk - is used much less often than expected in defence procurement. Whilst there can be good reasons for single sourcing, the opportunities and inducements for corruption are significantly escalated. Further, some countries that claim to employ single-source only in rare instances are found to have high percentages of non-competitive defence procurement. This is of particular concern as defence is perceived to be one of the more corruption-prone international business sectors, as identified in the 2002 Bribe Payers Index (Transparency International, 2002), with procurement presenting a significant source of corruption risk. The work presented here gives data on the percentage of defence single source procurement in a number of countries.

Our series are based on new evidence from estate and wealth tax data, foreign and domestic family firm-wealth, and pension wealth estimates. We find that Swedish wealth concentration was high in the agrarian state, and changed little during early industrialization. From World War I until about 1950, the richest percentile lost ground to high-income earners in the rest of the top-wealth decile. This equalization continued postwar; the entire top decile lost-out relative to the rest of the population. Around 1980, wealth compression stopped and inequality increased.

We focus on whether the sector resembles its counterpart in industrialized countries, characterized by the risk-taking nature of the entrepreneurial activity, or if it is the result of labour market distortions and disguised unemployment, as in the dual economy hypothesis. Our results suggest a segmentation of the micro-entrepreneur sector. Both young uneducated and middle aged highly educated salaried workers have the highest likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. However, the first segment has a high probability of becoming own-account workers, while the probability of becoming micro-entrepreneurs with employees is strictly increasing in both age and education. Moreover, the probability of entrepreneur failure (as measured by the transition to the salaried sector) has an inverted U shape, implying that both high and low skill individuals are more likely to remain entrepreneurs.","[Rojas, Gabriel V.

This spatial fragmentation determines a decrease in the complexity of the production systems. On the other hand, outsourcing, as a form of functional fragmentation, increases the density of transactions and linkages within an economy. The overall impact of fragmentation on the complexity of the regional and national economic systems depends on the net effect of these two fragmentation forces.

The study describes the system of international environmental certification and other sustainable development protection measures, encompassing the eco-labeling of products, accommodation and recreation services, forest and timber supply chains, the energy certification of buildings, the ISO ecological and ergonomic certification of computer equipment and mobile phones, identification of packaging materials, environmental management systems (EMS) certification, etc. The article also presents the international benchmarking of the ecological footprint - an integral indicator reflecting sustainable development. It should be noted that the current level of human consumption already exceeds the Earth's ecological potential, i.e., the ecological footprint of all the countries in the world exceeds nature's capacity for regeneration. Lithuania has a positive ecological balance, meanwhile, the ecological footprint of the Ukraine and Belarus exceeds the country's biological potential respectively by 0.3 and 0.4 global hectares per person. The features and problem areas of EMS (namely, ISO 14001 and EMAS), and the process of implementation of other measures in Lithuania and in an international context are also presented. For a more objective comparison of sustainable development in individual countries and regions, the author suggests the use of a new indicator - the number of certificates (ISO 14001, EMAS, ecological products, etc.) per 1 million inhabitants of a country's total population. Although there was a marked increase in the implementation of ISO 14001 systems in recent years, according to the number of implemented environmental management systems per 1 million inhabitants, Lithuania lags considerably behind not only the most developed nations, but also some of the new EU countries. To date, there are no EAMS environmental systems in place in Lithuania, yet they are being successfully implemented in other EU countries and in the neighbouring Baltic countries. The main reason why this type of system of environmental measures has not been implemented in Lithuania is an inadequate understanding on the part of the leaders of organizations of the essential differences between EMAS and ISO 14001 (this was noted by 89% of respondents). It is recommended that the government institutions responsible for formulating Lithuania's environmental policies boost their environmental certification infrastructure, carry out the realistic development of green purchases, and encourage Lithuanian organizations to create and certify EAMS environmental systems, while secondary schools should be drawn into the globally acknowledged and effective Kids' ISO 14000 programs. The implementation of such a program in our country is very important and deserves to receive government funding as well as funding from business organizations declaring their social responsibility. The education of children in environmental awareness is one of the most important ways to solve environmental concerns in Lithuania and throughout the world, and to develop the way towards creating an ecological balance. Effective environmental education should also involve tertiary students from all disciplines, business enterprises, and public sector and government administration institutions.","Vilnius State Univ, Int Business Sch, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Ruzevicius, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Int Business Sch, Sauletekio Av 22, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",juozas.ruzevicius@ef.vu.lt,,,,,,,45,7,10,1,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Special emphasis is given to effects that have resulted from implementing the Common Agricultural Policy. Two approaches are applied. First, in an ex post analysis we address how accession has thus far influenced structural changes and the income situation. Second, in an ex ante analysis we apply the agent-based model AgriPoliS to simulate the impact of decoupling top-up payments on structural change, farm income and payment redistribution. In the ex post analysis, it is observed that structural change is still influenced by the transformation process. Farm income partially follows the increase of payments, but there is also a capitalisation of payments into factor prices for land, labour and other inputs. Furthermore, simulations support empirical findings that accession slows down structural change compared to a scenario without accession, while decoupling top-ups in 2009 has no significant impact on structural change. However, depending on the type of decoupling, a redistribution of payments among farmers can be observed.","[Sahrbacher, Christoph; Kellermann, Konrad] Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Jelinek, Ladislav; Medonos, Tomas] Inst Agr Econ & Informat ZEI, Prague, Czech Republic",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Sahrbacher, C (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",Sahrbacher@iamo.de,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646;",,,,,22,6,6,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,4,,,,,495,511,,10.1080/14631370903339872,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277673900007,0

Also in Poland, principles of that concept are Put into practice. There is, however, a shortage of elaborations which the future investor or designer could, in an easy way, utilise for the selection of environment-friendly materials, technologies, building utilities and so forth, i.e. to design a facility which causes the least harm possible to the environment, maintaining at the same time low energy demand during its life cycle. According to the philosophy of environmental protection, a building design should take into consideration its entire life cycle, and its structure and utilities should allow the supplies of energy needed for heating to be eliminated while using the building. The present paper aims to give multi-attribute analysis for assessment of building variants, which utilises the Life Cycle Assessment method (LCA). The method defines a number of so-called environmental impact categories, which include criteria to be considered while selecting a solution, which minimises such impacts. The most important of them and costs are taken into account in the multi-criteria analysis for optimum solution selection. The results of eco-energetic assessment of variants house are grounds to supporting decisions in programming, designing and performing houses, taking into consideration numerous others aspects (usable, technical, social etc.).","[Sobotka, Anna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Rolak, Zbigniew] Univ Phys Educ Warsaw, Fac Phys Educ Biala Podlaska, PL-21500 Biala Podlaska, Poland",AGH University of Krakow; Jozef Pilsudski University Physical Education in Warsaw,"Sobotka, A (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Al Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",sobotka@agh.edu.pl; rolak@onet.pl,"Sobotka, Anna/W-6148-2018","Sobotka, Anna/0000-0002-4477-8821",,,,,31,25,26,0,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The survey was conducted in Estonian, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Czech, Finnish, German and Slovakian electric-electronic machine, retail store and machine-building enterprises. The main aim of the study is to find connections between corporate social responsibility and different organizational culture types. According to Cameron and Quinn (1998), culture defines the core values, assumptions, interpretations and approaches that characterise an organization. Competing Values Framework is extremely useful in helping to organize and interpret a wide variety of organizational phenomena. The four dominant culture types - hierarchy, market, clan and adhocracy emerge from the framework. According to Strautmanis (2007), social responsibility is part of organizational culture and a value in the organizational culture environment. Development of social responsibility is a change in values orientation, whose task is shaping the attitudes, transformation of the personal position so that it matches individual and public interests. Different organizations have framed different definitions about corporate social responsibility - although there is considerable common ground between them. Nowadays corporate social responsibility is an integral part of the business vocabulary and is regarded as a crucially important issue in management (Cornelius et al., 2008; Humphreys, Brown, 2008). In order to find connections between corporate social responsibility and organizational culture, the authors conducted an empirical study in 2007-2008. The total number of respondents was 6094. A standardized organizational culture and corporate social responsibility questionnaire comprising 38 items was developed by the Denki Ringo research group (Ishikawa et al, 2006). The questionnaire was administered in Estonian, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Czech, Finnish, German and Slovakian electric-electronic machine, retail store and machine-building enterprises. Data about four different culture types and eight different countries - Estonia, China, Japan, Russian, Czech, Finnish, German and Slovakian were compared by means of the ANOVA-test. The linear regression analysis was used in order to find statistically relevant connections between corporate social responsibility and organizational culture. The model was developed in order to explain how four organizational culture types hierarchy, clan, market, adhocracy - predict two facets of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues and the firm respects the interests of agents. The main research question is: How does organizational culture predict corporate social responsibility? According to the results, clan, hierarchy and adhocracy culture types predict two facets of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues and the firm respects the interests of agents. Market culture type predicts one facet of corporate social responsibility - the firm performance concerning social issues. Different organizational culture types are dominating in enterprises from different countries. In Estonian and Finnish enterprises clan, in Chinese enterprises market and adhocracy, in Japanese enterprises market and hierarchy, in Russian and German enterprises market, in Czech and Slovakian enterprises hierarchy culture types were dominating in enterprises. Organizational culture is influenced on national culture where organization is operating.","[Uebius, Uelle; Alas, Ruth] Estonian Business Sch, EE-10114 Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian Business School,"Übius, Ü (通讯作者)，Estonian Business Sch, Lauteri 3, EE-10114 Tallinn, Estonia.",,,,,,,,55,51,69,0,94,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This has created new opportunities for many; but not for all becouse the gulf between the rich and the poor is still growing. Poor countries are moving to market solutions and pragmatic arrangements for increasing trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) to create more jobs and alleviate poverty. The outcomes are highly uneven. International trade has helped increase income, and has helped millions of people out of poverty, but it is also sustaining unequal patterns of consumption. Outsourcing the extraction of natural resources, as well as production and manufacturing to developing countries, means they must struggle to deal with their resulting hazardous wastes and other environmental impacts. Human Development is a development paradigm that is about much more than the rise or fall of national incomes. It is about creating an environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accord with their needs and interests. The HDI provides a composite measure of three dimensions of human development: living a long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy), being educated (measured by adult literacy and enrolment at the primary, secondary and tertiary level) and having a decent standard of living (measured by purchasing power parity, PPP, income). The HDI for Romania is 0.825, which gives the country a rank of 62(nd) out of 179 countries with data (International Human Development Reports).

The success and profitability of a contemporary company depend on the changes of global environment, whereas new strategies, markets, competitors, technologies, management initiatives and changing requirements of the customers represent routine facts of operating in such environment. The future of companies is increasingly more chaotic and the issue of survival constantly hovers, however, after uniting employees for the common purpose, integrating information; processes and technologies, never-ending movement is obtained, which is oriented towards problem-solving, leading the companies to new business opportunities. All companies take part in social or economic exchanges and first and foremost they should, therefore, monitor the value orientations of the society and their changes, to pay due consideration to the effect of national culture to their activities and form the appropriate marketing culture for successful development of their business. The creation of marketing culture in the company can be good opportunity to strengthen competitive advantages as marketing culture is a very important feature of company's (organization's) culture due to which the companies provide higher value of goods to the customers and thus strengthen their position in the market most effectively and efficiently. It can be reached by developing close relationships with customers and suppliers as well as other market subjects paying big attention to the changes in the market and company's possibilities to use these changes better as competitors do. This study aimed at finding out, which elements shaping competitive advantage should be focused to by the companies operating in different spheres: production, services and sales, in order to survive in the market. Many managers of companies realize that it is rather difficult to survive and work profitably under market conditions. The market is not endless, and the competitors do not drowse away, either. The winners are those who acquire competitive advantages, employ the means and actions of marketing creatively. However, spontaneous and unfocused use there of will not bring the expected success. A company which strives to survive and function in the market should assess its capabilities, i.e., whether it will manage to continue strengthening the customers' trust and expanding its activities under constantly changing market conditions.","[Zostautiene, Daiva] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Fac Management & Adm, Dept Management, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania; [Daraskeviciute, Birute] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Fac Management & Adm, Dept Econ, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Zostautiene, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Fac Management & Adm, Dept Management, Nemuno Str 33, LT-37164 Panevezys, Lithuania.",daiva.zostautiene@ktu.lt; birute.daraskeviciute@ktu.lt,"Zostautiene, Daiva/AGU-6576-2022",,,,,,45,6,6,0,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using a theoretical model, this study compares the implications of civil and criminal penalty schemes from the viewpoint of social welfare, where civil and criminal schemes are distinguished by whether penalties are paid to the copyright holder or the government. The analysis suggests that when the costs of developing a copyrighted product are low, the socially most desirable scheme is one in which there are no civil penalties and criminal penalties are low. Although very severe criminal penalties may lead to the complete elimination of copyright infringements, they could also result in excessive monopoly profits for the producer of the copyrighted good. A further finding is that the number of copyright infringements is smaller under the criminal than the civil law scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article presents a heretofore unpublished exchange in 1971 over the efficacy of the Cobb-Douglas by two future Nobel Laureates, Robert Solow and Herbert Simon. Solow emerges as the defender of the Cobb-Douglas, and Simon the engaging critic. The correspondence demonstrates that the logical and empirical problems with the Cobb-Douglas were well known by the most advanced minds of mainstream economics. This calls into question the rationale for its continued use as an empirical corroboration of marginal productivity theory.","Univ Tulsa, Dept Econ, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA",University of Tulsa,"Carter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tulsa, Dept Econ, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.",,,,,,,,56,9,9,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Our model suggests that the wage levels of the public firm can be lower or higher than those of private firms depending upon the degree of inefficiency.

To date, only Caceras-Delpiano (J Hum Resour 41(4): 738-754, 2006) tests this theory by considering private school enrolment. This study extends this work by using a unique data set containing a broader range of parental investments that are arguably linked to parental intentions for producing higher quality children, such as overall and nonsectarian private school enrolment, the number of computers in the home per child, and saving for the child's education. Both studies find that fertility reduces parental investments. However, the literature generally finds that fertility has no impact on child outcomes. The study offers three potential explanations for this 'puzzle'.","Social Res & Demonstrat Corp, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Frenette, M (通讯作者)，Social Res & Demonstrat Corp, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",mfrenette@srdc.org,,,,,,,25,9,9,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Strengthening patent protection increases the South's welfare by enhancing innovation and FDI, but it also allows the firms with patents to charge higher prices for their goods, which decreases welfare. However, the model shows that the former positive welfare effect outweighs the latter negative effect. Moreover, introducing the strictest form of patent protection in the South, that is, harmonizing patent protection in the South with that in the North, may maximize welfare in the South as well as in the North.

First, consumption expenditures on both durable and nondurable goods are hump-shaped. Second, young households keep very few liquid assets and hold most of their wealth in consumer durables. In our model durables play a dual role: they both provide consumption services and act as collateral for loans. A plausibly parameterized version of the model predicts that the interaction of consumer durables and endogenous borrowing constraints induces durables accumulation early in life and higher consumption of nondurables and accumulation of financial assets later in the life cycle, of an order of magnitude consistent with observed data.","[Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Krueger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dkrueger@econ.upenn.edu,,,,,,,80,88,109,1,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We show that the evidence for such feedback is sensitive to the estimation period. Support for a nonlinear model is strongest for samples starting before 1973. Instead, using post-1973 data only, the evidence against symmetry becomes considerably weaker. For example, at the aggregate level, there is no evidence against the hypothesis of symmetric responses to oil price innovations of typical magnitude, consistent with results of Kilian and Vigfusson [Quantitative Economics, 2(3), 419-453 (2011)] for U.S. real GDP. There is strong evidence of asymmetries at the disaggregate level, however, especially for industries that are energy-intensive in production (such as chemicals) or that produce goods that are energy-intensive in use (such as transportation equipment). Our analysis suggests that these asymmetries may be obscured in the aggregate data and highlights the importance of developing multisector models of the transmission of oil price shocks.","[Herrera, Ana Maria] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Herrera, AM (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, 2095 Fac Adm Bldg,656 W Kirby, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",amherrera@wayne.edu,"Wada, Tatsuma/AAL-2252-2021; 和田, 龍磨/IAM-5184-2023","Gupta, Latika/0000-0002-8501-5847; Wada, Tatsuma/0000-0002-3699-4954; Herrera, Ana Maria/0000-0003-3583-2555",,,,,26,103,107,0,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

While the geographical concentration of current account imbalances is significant-with the People's Republic of China accounting for the lion's share of the region's current account surplus-how Asia contributes to global rebalancing also depends critically on the newly industrialising economies and larger Association of Southeast Asian Nations economies. Given the region's huge diversity, the necessary national macroeconomic and structural policies will vary significantly across Asia's emerging economies. Whereas near-term rebalancing efforts will be driven primarily by macroeconomic and exchange rate policies, structural reforms are essential for boosting domestic and regional demand as sources of economic growth over medium to long-term. We argue that regional rebalancing will depend critically on the adoption of deeper and more comprehensive structural reforms and further trade liberalisation to unlock the potential of strong domestic and regional spending-thus reducing Asia's high dependence on extra-regional demand.

This is costly when ads are priced per-click because many visitors (clickers) will not purchase. This renders per-click advertising particularly conducive to the transmission of information via ads. The admissibility of information transmission depends not only on advertiser behaviour, but also upon consumers' interpretation of and trust in ads. In less conducive environments, consumers quickly learn to place little stock in the claims they see advertised. This mechanism undermines the ability of advertisers and consumers to communicate under per-impression or per-sale fee structures. Consumers benefit from increased informativeness, but distortions introduced by the market power given to advertisers imply that society may be better-off with no information transmission taking place.

RoT consumers use the margin that hours and wage negotiation provides them to improve their lifetime utility, by narrowing the gap in utility with respect to Ricardian consumers. This margin for intertemporal optimisation has not been studied yet, because this class of restricted agents has been mainly used in models with no equilibrium unemployment. Our approach allows for a deeper study of the effects of shocks on vacancies, unemployment, hours, wages and how they interact. As habits increase, RoT consumers find it optimal, after a positive technology shock, to negotiate lower hours and higher wages, and this mechanism reduces the simulated correlation between the real wage (or productivity) and total hours to values closer to those obtained empirically. Thus, with the interaction of RoT consumers and consumption habits, the labour market search model improves significantly in reproducing some of the stylised facts characterising the US labour market.

Utilizing a data set relating to the English Premier League that combines both financial measures and indicators of playing skills and performances, our empirical analysis is based on three behavioural equations. Our analysis indicates that on-field success can be directly related to players' skills and abilities and that revenue is positively related to on-field success. Wage expenditure is also shown to systematically reflect player skills and performances. One interpretation of this evidence is that investment in players' skills and ability buys on-field success, with richer teams becoming ever richer and able to maintain or even build upon success by spending more on players than less successful clubs. To the extent that richer clubs are successful in their objective there is a causal link between revenue earned and competitive imbalance via investments in players. The implications of this tendency within a league are discussed in our conclusion, which also considers the potentially wider implications of our study as they relate to the evolution of firm size and issues of market share.","[Thomas, Dennis] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, Wales; [McHale, Ian] Univ Salford, Salford Business Sch, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Carmichael, Fiona] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Aberystwyth University; University of Salford; University of Birmingham,"Thomas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wales, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth SY23 3DD, Ceredigion, Wales.",det@aber.ac.uk,"carmichael, fiona/B-1973-2013","McHale, Ian/0000-0002-7686-3879; Carmichael, Fiona/0000-0002-7932-2410",,,,,83,33,34,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Which one is the best measure? In this article, I assume that agents update their understanding and expectation period by period, a learning process. In terms of econometrics, I use a recursive Vector Autoregression approach and conduct a forecasting exercise that considers updating of information sets used for formation of expectation. I find that the traditional output gap measure is a more significant variable explaining the dynamics of the U.S. inflation rate, as compared with a measure of the labor income share. Furthermore, the role of the output gap cannot be replaced using lagged values of inflation. Instead, both the output gap and lags of the actual inflation rate are important determinants of inflation.","Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Liu, DD (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",dliu1@kent.edu,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

At the end of a period, in which individuals work and invest in regionally immobile social capital, there may be an income shock. Given a negative shock, individuals have to decide whether to move so they can maintain their income but lose social capital, or to stay in the region, accepting the income loss but retaining their social capital. As a result, the effects of labour market shocks on mobility patterns depend on social environments.

Biographical interviews show the complexity of the everyday situation of Soviet officers before 1991, which involved attachments of various sorts: professional, family, friends, identity.... Although these officers clearly identified political changes in 1991, changes in their careers occurred in the years preceding or following this date, whereas a longer period of time was needed to rework the aforementioned attachments. For military officers, work, politics, family or friendship were no longer synchronized, and tension arose among these aspects of their lives. Veteran organizations helped them handle individual difficulties and provided them with a place for reworking their feelings of shared attachments in relation not only to professional factors but also to friendships, which, in turn, cultivated a shared political outlook.","Univ Clermont Ferrand, CHEC CERCEC, Clermont Ferrand, France",,"Daucé, F (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Ferrand, CHEC CERCEC, Clermont Ferrand, France.",francoise.dauce@univ-bpclermont.fr,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,3,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We set up an overlapping generations model in which young agents invest in both width and depth of human capital in order to adopt new technologies. The model develops explicitly the micro-mechanism of the role of human capital in adopting new technologies as well as that of the process of human capital production in the uncertain environments. In our model, a higher level of width of human capital relative to the level of depth leads one country to a higher growth path. We also show that an economy can have different growth paths depending on the initial structure of human capital and the uncertainty about the nature of new technologies. In particular, new technologies with more uncertain characteristics may adversely affect human capital accumulation and income growth, leading the economy to a low growth trap.","[Kim, Yong Jin] Ajou Univ, Suwon 441749, South Korea",Ajou University,"Kim, YJ (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Suwon 441749, South Korea.",,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961",,,,,32,9,11,1,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Monetary theory with endogenous search intensity seems ideal for studying this. However, in standard models, inflation is a tax that lowers the surplus from monetary exchange and hence reduces search effort. We replace search intensity with a free entry (participation) decision for buyers-i.e., we focus on the extensive rather than intensive margin-and prove buyers always spend their money-faster when inflation increases.

What are the policy implications if volatility turns out to be significant? We assess this issue in an economics/finance nexus for Korea using a VEC model including interest rates, economic activity, real stock returns, real oil prices and oil price volatility. Our main aim is to capture the effects of crude oil prices on the Korean economy thoroughly covering the period of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, which heavily affected the country, and the oil price hikes in the early 1990s after the Gulf War. South Korea was the country most hit by the financial crisis together with Indonesia and Thailand. Results indicate the dominance of oil price volatility on real stock returns and emphasize how this has increased over time. Oil price volatility cart have profound effect on the time horizon of investment and firms need adjust their risk management procedures accordingly. This increase in dependency has been found in other net oil importing emerging equity markets. We test the relationship between oil price movements and economic activity by using modern time series techniques in a cointegrating framework. We expand the standard error correction model by examining the dynamics of out of sample causality through the generalized variance decomposition and impulse response function techniques. The evidence from persistence profiles also gives important guidelines based on how fast the entire system adjusts back to equilibrium. In addition, we find the cointegrating relationship to be stable and find that the linear error correction model to be more favorable than an asymmetric 2 period Markov switching model.

Bulgaria adopted a Currency Board (CB) monetary system. This paper aims at investigating if the adoption of the CB monetary system, which involves the cost of losing monetary autonomy, has provided a relatively better (with respect to other CEEC) monetary integration of Bulgaria with the European Monetary Union (EMU). Since Bulgarian monetary variables are endogenous under a CB, we focus on the ECB and FED interest rates as the main sources on monetary volatility. First, we find that ECB shocks are more rapidly absorbed and have less significant impact of domestic variables, with respect to other external monetary shocks (FED rate changes). Second, the responses of Bulgarian variables following changes in the ECB interest rate present lower persistence and significance, with respect to what the previous literature emphasized for other CEEC with monetary autonomy. This latter result still holds when accounting for different sources of cross-country heterogeneity outlined in the literature, thus supporting that the adoption of the CB may have worked as a rather good device in terms of integration of Bulgaria into the EMU.

To boost the decreasing national economies, many countries introduced various stipulating measures. The automotive industry has been among the numerous fields, which were affected by the decline. The proclaimed importance of this industry led to the introduction of a new economic tool to support the short-term consumption, usually referred to as the car scrapping scheme. This scheme stands for a special incentive to purchase a new car. Usually, the incentive is introduced in the form of a direct financial support or an ex-post tax relief, and is conditioned by scrapping the applicant's old car. The microeconomic analysis of consumer behaviour proved that the car scrapping scheme can mitigate the maximum decline of the aggregate consumption, thanks to the shift of the consumption line and of the map of the indifference curves. However, the car scrapping scheme has many other impacts, whose research should be elaborated.","Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Mohelsky, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",lukasmohis@yahoo.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The striking contrast between the estimated processes followed by the actual and risk-neutral arrival intensities of defaults, and between the parameters governing the actual and risk-neutral dynamics of the risk-neutral intensities, indicates the presence of substantial default risk premia in CDX swap market rates. The effects of risk premia on swap rates covary strongly across maturities, and depend on general stock market volatility and several measures of credit spreads. Large moves in the effects of these premia on swap rates have natural interpretations in terms of economic and financial market developments during the sample period, April 2004 to October 2007. Our results suggest that a large portion of the movements in CDX swap market rates observed during the sample period may be caused by changing attitudes toward correlated default risk rather than changes in the economic factors affecting the actual risk of clustered defaults, which ultimately governs swap payoffs.

In our study we analyse the returns to language skills in a developing country context where the dominant language of business, government and education is that of the former colony, although not more than one percent of the African majority population group speaks English as their home language. Our findings suggest large returns among Africans to reading and writing English very well, and particularly among those who have a tertiary education.

After carrying out an exploratory spatial analysis, the results of the estimation of spatial lag and spatial error models confirm positive spatial-autocorrelation for the property tax and the building activities tax, with an order of magnitude between 0.3 and 0.5.

F22, J24, J61) This paper contributes to the literature on the assimilation of immigrants into the Italian labour market by using over-education as an indicator of labour market performance. The analysis is based on data taken from the Italian Labour Force Survey (LFS) for the period between 2005 and 2007. Distinguishing between the effect of human capital acquired abroad and domestically on over-education, we aim at finding indirect evidence on the increase in skill transferability over time. We find that foreigners are much more likely to be over-educated than natives upon their arrival in Italy and that work experience gained in the country of origin is not valued in the. Italian labour market. Moreover, we find that not even experience acquired in Italy is helpful in improving immigrants' educational job matches, suggesting that catch-up by foreigners seems unachievable, even after they adapt their skills to the host country labour market.","[Dell'Aringa, Carlo] Univ Cattolica Milano, Fac Econ & Commercio, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Pagani, Laura] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Polit, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Dell'Aringa, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Milano, Fac Econ & Commercio, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",carlo.dellaringa@unicatt.it; laura.pagani@unimib.it,,,,,,,39,13,14,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In both cases, electronic systems have played a key role in French primary fish markets. The computerisation of trading rooms started in the mid 1980s while connection through Intranet or Internet systems first started in the mid-1990s and then has spread more actively in France since 2007. However, the socioeconomic impact (on prices for example) of expanding markets by electronic means is far from being clearly predictable. First based on an econometric analysis, this article presents evidence of increases in price level and variability after the implementation of local electronic auction systems. Secondly, a comprehensive survey of the 40 fish auction markets in France brings additional information about the effects of electronic remote bidding on fish prices. The analysis of these two empirical outcomes uses the cross-fertilization of the positivist auction theory in economics with the constructionist approach of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in sociology to enrich the potential hypotheses lying behind the study of the structural impact of electronic systems on market prices.

O'Hara (1995) points out the many difficulties in specifying all the necessary elements of a strategic model for determining and attaining an equilibrium describing intraday patterns. We develop an autonomous agent-based market microstructure simulation with both informed agents and uninformed liquidity-motivated agents. Both types of agents can learn when to trade, but are zero-intelligence on all other behavior. We do not impose an equilibrium concept but instead look for emergent behavior. Our results demonstrate that trading patterns can arise in such a model as a result of interactions between informed and uninformed agents even though the agents are non-strategic and not fully rational. As long as there is rudimentary social or individual learning, uninformed liquidity-motivated agents can coordinate to avoid trading with informed agents and suffering adverse selection losses. The extent and pattern of coordination between uninformed agents depends on the learning specification, the percentage of informed agents and the degree of cooperation/competition among the informed agents.

Agents are required to save through individually managed Personal Security Accounts without, and with mandatory annuitization. When the analysis is restricted to CRRA preferences our results are congruent with the literature in indicating that the complete elimination of social security is among the reform scenarios that maximize welfare. However, when self control preferences are introduced, and as the intensity of self control becomes progressively more severe the social security elimination scenario loses ground very rapidly. In fact, in the case of relatively severe temptation the elimination of social security becomes the least desirable alternative. Under the light of the above findings, any reform proposal regarding the social security system should consider departures from standard preferences to preference specifications suitable for dealing with preference reversals.

In addition, the results suggest that a symphony orchestra's music director does not have a significant impact on the degree of program conventionality.","[Pompe, Jeffrey; Munn, Johnathan] Francis Marion Univ, Dept Econ, Florence, SC 29502 USA; [Tamburri, Lawrence] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Sch Publ Policy & Management, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Pompe, J (通讯作者)，Francis Marion Univ, Dept Econ, Florence, SC 29502 USA.",jpompe@fmarion.edu,,,,,,,21,10,15,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In a context in which pollution abatement technology shows increasing returns to scale and an inverse U-shaped pollution-income path is present, this study demonstrates the existence of a majority voting equilibrium, and concludes that the inverted U-shaped relationship is between median income and environmental degradation rather than between per capita income and environmental degradation. Our results suggest that an increase in equality in income distribution improves environmental quality and social efficiency. The implication of the model for the empirical estimation of environmental Kuznets curves is examined using a panel data set of 36 countries over a 20-year period. Estimation results using different models show that income distribution might be an important factor in the empirical estimation of these curves.","[Qu, Baozhi] Moscow Sch Management, SIEMS, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yifan] Lingnan Univ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University,"Qu, BZ (通讯作者)，Moscow Sch Management, SKOLKOVO Inst Emerging Studies, 8 Beichendong Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",Baozhi_Qu@skolkovo.ru,"Zhang, Yifan/AAZ-9430-2021","Zhang, Yifan/0000-0003-2286-0178",,,,,20,23,24,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The present paper attempts to provide a theoretical basis and to define a robust econometric approach to assess the performance and potential of Chinese ODI. In this paper, foreign direct investment (FDI) performance is estimated using a frontier FDI model to measure how foreign investors, especially China, and the recipients of this direct investment perform relative to a benchmark of potential FDI. The results show that Chinese ODI achieves less of its potential compared with other investors. However, its ODI to Australia has performed much better than investment to other destinations. The results suggest that Chinese policy-makers should look at the pattern of China's ODI and, in light of superior performance in destinations like Australia, adjust policy strategies and institutional arrangements to enhance performance and reduce barriers to Chinese ODI.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Armstrong, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",shiro.armstrong@anu.edu.au,"Armstrong, Shiro/Q-4118-2019","Armstrong, Shiro/0000-0001-9756-7860",,,,,34,14,14,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2011,19.0,4,,,SI,,22,37,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01248.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,800XJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293400700002,0

A wide range of institutional arrangements are addressed within the same general framework. When the characteristics of jobs or workers are advertised the efficient outcome pertains. Commitment without advertising typically leads to market unravelling: the Diamond paradox. But, whenever wages and human capital are advertised, firms become residual claimants: the private and social returns to investment coincide. Absent wage commitment, the Hosios condition implies efficiency when investments are advertised. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the lack of dynamism of manufacturing is the main cause behind the low rates of economic growth and employment in Mexico.

We design trust games with partner selection, in which the proposer chooses between a familiar responder and a stranger with a higher multiplier. When choosing between the two responders, the proposer faces tradeoffs between economic opportunities and social distance. Comparing participants' behaviors to those in a standalone trust game, we find that in the virtual world experiment the proposers are more likely to select the socially closer responders despite the lower rate of investment returns, and the latter reciprocate by returning a higher proportion than the socially distant responders. Virtual communication also plays an important role on the proposers' choice and the responders' reciprocity. In contrast, social distance and virtual communication have less impact in the lab with a student sample. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis focuses on the change in firms' product portfolio and pricing policy. Using product-level data on the Korean cigarette manufacturing industry, which underwent major reform recently, a random-coefficient discrete choice model is estimated to approximate substitution patterns among cigarette products. The findings are as follows. First, in the post-reform period, new products are significantly less price-elastic than existing ones; however, no such relationship is found in the pre-reform period. Second, data in the pre-reform period is not consistent with firm-level profit maximization mainly due to the failure to internalize within-fill)? substitution. In the post-reform period, however, partial evidence supports the view that pricing of new products is compatible with firm-level profit maximization. Overall, the analysis suggests that firm efficiency improves in the post-reform period through the introduction of profitable products and the proper pricing of these products.","Hansung Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136792, South Korea",Hansung University,"Min, H (通讯作者)，Hansung Univ, Dept Econ, 389 Samseon Dong,3 Ga, Seoul 136792, South Korea.",hmin@hansung.ac.kr,,,,,,,14,7,7,1,7,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The maxmin utility over multiple priors framework is used to model and solve the irreversible investment problem. Multiple priors are modeled using the notion of K-ignorance. This set-up is used to analyze finitely lived options. For infinitely lived options the notion of constant K-ignorance is introduced. For these sets of density generators the corresponding optimal stopping problem is solved for general (in-)finite horizon optimal stopping problems driven by geometric Brownian motion. It is argued that an increase in the set of priors delays investment, whereas an increase in the degree of market completeness can have a non-monotonic effect on investment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I test the impact of property rights institutions and contracting institutions on high-growth-aspiration (HGA) entrants using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) survey data for 2000-2005. I find that property rights are more significant for profound market expansion and rule of law is more significant for high job growth. The number of procedures in enforce a contract, the number of procedures to start a business, and the number of days to start a business are negatively correlated with all types of HGA entrepreneurship. A common law legal system is negatively correlated with entrepreneurship combining high job growth and market expansion. These findings add nuance to prior studies that tout the importance of property rights and rule of law for entrepreneurship. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Limited competition in the banking sector causes a high loan-deposit spread, worsens the initial effect of corruption, and depresses growth. Fostering bank competition, for instance, by allowing foreign bank entry, would be a simple solution to this problem, but frequently, authorities choose to hamper bank competition. Therefore, we explain the persistence of non-competitive banking as a result of governments' regulatory choice. If the government has a stake in the banking sector there exists a trade-off between current benefits from bank profits and future growth. Firm-level corruption affects intertemporal optimization and distorts the government's choice towards more restrictive regulation, i.e., less bank competition, even if the deciding institution itself is not corrupt. These results show that the two prominent problems for small and medium enterprises, corruption and finance, are mutually reinforcing. Journal of Comparative Economics xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx.

We show that the country has been immersed in a 'great depression' since the mid-seventies. We also show that although Venezuela is an oil abundant economy, this growth experience is largely due to the evolution of its non-oil GDP. We perform a growth accounting exercise to quantify the extent to which the growth experience in the non-oil sector is a result of physical capital accumulation, finding that non-oil sector behavior can largely be explained by the evolution of total factor productivity (TFP). Finally, we calculate the correlations between oil rents and physical capital accumulation and TFP in the non-oil sector, finding a high positive correlation during the good performance period, but a negative correlation in the implosion period.","[Iza, Amaia] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Agnani, Betty] Univ Granada, Granada 18011, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Granada,"Iza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",bagnani@ugr.es; amaia.iza@ehu.es,"Iza, Amaia/H-1971-2015","Iza, Amaia/0000-0002-3142-0038",,,,,28,3,5,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

J,"Bertocchi, G",,,,"Bertocchi, Graziella",,,The enfranchisement of women and the welfare state,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Women's suffrage; Inequality; Public goods; Welfare state; Culture; Family; Divorce,WESTERN-EUROPE; GENDER-GAP; SUFFRAGE; GROWTH; INEQUALITY; DEMOCRACY; DAUGHTERS; FRANCHISE; EDUCATION; SELECTION,"We offer a rationale for the decision to extend the franchise to women within a politico-economic model where men are richer than women, women display a higher preference for public goods, and women's disenfranchisement carries a societal cost. Men and women are matched within households which are the center of the decision process. We derive the optimal tax rate under two alternative regimes: a males-only enfranchisement regime and a universal enfranchisement regime. The latter is associated with a higher tax rate but, as industrialization raises the reward to intellectual labor relative to physical labor, women's relative wage increases, thus decreasing the difference between the tax rates. When the cost of disenfranchisement becomes higher than the cost of the higher tax rate which applies under universal enfranchisement, the male median voter is better off extending the franchise to women. A consequent expansion of the size of government is only to be expected in societies with a relatively high cost of disenfranchisement. We empirically test the implications of the model over the 1870-1930 period. We proxy the gender wage gap with the level of per capita income and the cost of disenfranchisement with the presence of catholicism, which is associated with a more traditional view of women's role and thus a lower cost. The gender gap in the preferences for public goods is proxied by the availability of divorce, which implies marital instability and a more vulnerable economic position for women. Consistently with the model's predictions, women's suffrage is correlated positively with per capita income and negatively with the presence of catholicism and the availability of divorce, while women's suffrage increases the size of government only in non-catholic countries.

We propose a new hybrid solution concept, the free-riding-proof core (FRP-core), which endogenously determines a contribution group, public goods provision level, and how to share the provision costs. The FRP-core is always nonempty in public goods economies but does not usually achieve global efficiency. The FRP-core has support from both cooperative and noncooperative games. In particular, it is equivalent to the set of perfectly coalition-proof Nash equilibria (Bernheim et al. 1987) of a dynamic game with players' participation decisions followed by a common agency game of public goods provision. We illustrate various properties of the FRP-core with an example. We also show that the equilibrium level of public goods shrinks to zero as the economy is replicated.","[Furusawa, Taiji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Konishi, Hideo] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Hitotsubashi University; Boston College,"Furusawa, T (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",furusawa@econ.hit-u.ac.jp; hideo.konishi@bc.edu,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243023, 20223001] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,15,16,1,20,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

In India, trade now accounts for 38 percent of all enterprises and contributes about 14 percent to GDP. In real terms, gross value added in trade has been growing at around 8 percent per annum since 1999-2000, indicating that the trade industry is one of the key drivers of GDP growth in India. Since the retail trade industry in India is predominantly run by unincorporated enterprises, measuring the output of this industry and its contribution to the GDP is difficult. The problem is compounded by the fact that at present the periodic enterprises sample surveys carried out in India on the unorganized sector do not cover trade. This paper explains how India has approached the problem of measuring the gross value added of the retail trade sector by an indirect method involving what is here described as a labor input method and a benchmark-indicator approach using a special trade index. The paper also briefly reviews country practices in measuring the output of retail trade and presents the advantages and disadvantages of India's approach, particularly in the context of achieving GDP exhaustiveness.",,,"Kolli, R (通讯作者)，107 Jahaz Apts,Inder Enclave,Rohtak Rd, New Delhi 110087, India.",rameshkolli52@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Our test relies on a structural model that assumes households are objective expected utility maximizers and claims are generated by household-coverage specific Poisson processes.

We analyze the widely held belief among Asians that children born in the Year of the dragon are superior. We use pooled cross section data from the U.S. Current Population Survey to show that Asian immigrants to the United States born in the 1976 year of the dragon are more educated than comparable immigrants from non-dragon years. In contrast, no such educational effect is noticeable for dragon-year children in the general U.S. population. We also provide evidence that Asian mothers of dragon year babies are more educated, richer, and slightly older than Asian mothers of non-dragon year children. This suggests that belief in the greater superiority of dragon-year children is self-fulfilling since the demographic characteristics associated with parents who are more willing and able to adjust their birthing strategies to have dragon children are also correlated with greater investment in their human capital.

This microeconomic evidence also suggests that the frequency with which firms adjust their prices varies across sectors. Building on the insights of Carvalho (2006), we present Monte Carlo evidence that suggests that in the presence of this heterogeneity estimates of the NKPC obtained using conventional methods, such as GMM, are likely to considerably overstate the degree of aggregate price stickiness. Furthermore, if roundabout production is a characteristic of the economy the NKPC will falsely suggest that a sizeable fraction of prices are indexed to past inflation.

Our research supports three central findings. First, we determine the main factors that explain the cross-sectional variance in gross benefits. Second, we estimate the predicted probabilities that a household does not desire to adopt the Internet and that a household desires to adopt the Internet but does not because its adoption costs are higher than its gross benefits. We show that while the cross-sectional variance in the first predicted probability is high, the cross-sectional variance in the second one is low (except for the age factor). Third, we compute the predicted adoption probability assuming that the adoption costs are homogeneous across households. We show that, for a given dimension (except for the age factor), the adoption rate will be only slightly modified if the adoption costs are homogeneous across households. Our results support the argument that the digital divide is mainly due to differences in gross benefits of adoption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper examines some properties of this model, which encompasses most micro-founded adjustment rules rationalizing infrequent changes. We illustrate that this model is flexible enough to fit data characterized by infrequent adjustment and variable adjustment size. We show that, to the extent that there is variability in the size of adjustments (e.g. if both small and large price changes are observed), (i) a large band parameter is needed to fit the data and (ii) the average band of inaction underlying the model may differ strikingly from the typical observed size of adjustment.

Using electronic archives, it shows that the frequency of its appearance in leading journals of economics has fallen rapidly from the 1950s. As well as to the declining popularity of Keynesian ideas since about 1970, the decrease in this use of the uncertainty concept is additionally related to the increasing mathematical formalization of economics and to the prevalence of a positivist emphasis on prediction. Some possible causes of this formalization are examined. Finally the essay discusses the prospects for a broadening of economics within universities, beyond a relatively narrow preoccupation with predictive formalism and including a reinvigorated Keynesianism.","Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, De Havilland Campus, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,79,33,36,0,20,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In this paper we analyse the preconditions for creative work. Using multilevel logistic modelling we examine what characteristics of the individual, the organisation of work and the national institutional context promote creative work. At the national level we focus on the effects of national education and training systems and labour markets. The analysis demonstrates, not surprisingly, that individuals with higher education and a certain amount of work experience are more likely to have creative jobs. It also shows that creative jobs are more likely at workplaces where managers support employees and where work is organised to promote knowledge diversity. In terms of international differences, we find that creative work tends to be more developed in Scandinavian countries than in the South and East of Europe. Interestingly, we find significant positive relations between the likelihood of creativity at work, on the one hand, and the development of broad competence-based systems of education and labour market flexicurity, on the other. This implies that policy attempts to attract 'the creative class' as it has been defined by Richard Florida through promoting diversity should at the national level be combined with the institutional reform of Europe's education systems and labour markets.

We find that remittances are larger for countries with a larger diaspora or when the diaspora is located in wealthier countries, and that they behave counter-cyclically, consistent with a role as a shock absorber. Although the effect of remittances in growth regressions is negative, countries with well functioning domestic institutions seem nevertheless to be better at unlocking the potential for remittances to contribute to faster economic growth.","[Singh, Raju Jan] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Haacker, Markus] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Lee, Kyung-woo] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Le Goff, Maelan] Univ Auvergne, CERDI CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",The World Bank; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Columbia University; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Singh, RJ (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rsingh9@worldbank.org,,,,,,,44,71,78,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

Each buyer knows only the signal that the seller observes about him, but not the signals she observes about other buyers. The seller first chooses how to disclose her information and then chooses a revenue-maximizing mechanism. We allow for very general disclosure policies, that can be random, public, private, or any mixture of these possibilities. Through the disclosure of information privately, the seller can create correlation in buyers' private information, which then consist of valuations plus beliefs. For the standard independent private values model, we show that information revelation is irrelevant: irrespective of the disclosure policy an optimal mechanism for this informed seller generates expected revenue that is equal to her maximal revenue under full information disclosure. For more general allocation environments that allow also for interdependent, for common values, and for multiple items, disclosure policies may matter, and the best the seller can do is to disclose no information at all.","NYU, Leonard Stern Sch Business, Kaufman Management Ctr, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Skreta, V (通讯作者)，NYU, Leonard Stern Sch Business, Kaufman Management Ctr, 44 W 4th St,KMC 7-64, New York, NY 10012 USA.",vskreta@stern.nyu.edu,,", Vasiliki/0000-0001-5045-5327",,,,,39,18,20,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

China's major cities have experienced significant real estate price increase which has been fueled by the sustained growth of the economic fundamentals. It is well believed that deeper integration with the world market is one of the major reasons for such high speed macroeconomic growth. In this paper, we examined the linkage between urban economic openness, the ratio of trade volume as a percentage of GDP, and urban real estate prices basing on the quality of life theory as well as Balassa-Samuelson (B-S) effects. Using panel data of 35 large Chinese cities from the year 1998 to 2006, we empirically find that for every 1% increase in urban economic openness, urban real estate prices will increase significantly by 0.282%, after controlling for other traditional demand-supply factors. Urban economic openness alone accounted for about 15.90% appreciations of Chinese real estate prices during the sample period, which is not neglectable. This result implies that urban real estate price fluctuations are potentially affected by international economic factors. The economic distance to the international market could be deemed as productive and consumption amenity for a city as well. This study enriches the perception of quality of life factors, and furthermore provides a new perspective for understanding the real estate price dynamics in the globalized economic development today.

McKenzie and the Proof of the Existence of a Competitive Equilibrium,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,"The theorem proving the existence of general equilibrium in a competitive economy, which necessarily involved specifying the conditions under which such an equilibrium would exist, is an extraordinary achievement of twentieth-century economics. The discovery is commonly attributed to a paper by (eventual) Nobel Prize winners Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreau: Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy, published in the July 1954 issue of Econometrica. However it is less well-known that Lionel McKenzie published a paper in the previous issue of Econometrica, On Equilibrium in Graham's Model of World Trade and Other Competitive Systems, that discussed many of the same themes. Both papers established the existence of a competitive equilibrium for suitable general equilibrium models and employed fixed point theorem arguments. McKenzie had priority in publication in 1954 and received credit for simultaneous discovery in prominent sources around that time. But over the years, McKenzie's role in creating the proof of the existence of a general equilibrium seems to have faded from the collective consciousness of the economics profession. Newly available archival material permits a reexamination of the events surrounding the publication of both Econometrica papers in 1954.

In this paper, we argue that it is largely responsible for the sharp increase in income inequality in rural China at the beginning of this decade. As a result of the one-child policy implemented in 1979, fewer young adults have reached working age during this period. This leads to a fall in the ratio of household members in working age. Regression-based inequality decomposition shows that labor shortages and the expansion of industrialization significantly increases the return of a higher ratio of household members in working age to household income while the distribution of this ratio becomes increasingly unequal. The interaction of two effects significantly increased income inequality in rural China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, tax competition yields globally efficient levels of source based corporate income taxes if residence based taxes on capital income are absent. In contrast, in the presence of residence based taxes on dividends, source based corporate income taxes are inefficiently high.

Furthermore, the most commonly proposed solution to the distortion, term limits, may have a significant, negative effect on the quality of sitting representatives.

Most importantly, the effect of trade on the (endogenous) productivity gap could be non monotonic over time. In the short-run, where the number of incumbents cannot adjust to trade, the effect of import competition dominates and the productivity gap between countries is closed as domestic firms in the laggard country face tougher competition from leading country exporters.

The sample is an unbalanced panel and comprises monthly time series from more than 100 economies. The time period of at most 45 years is subdivided into three regimes according to dominating monetary policies. To exploit the cross-sectional dimension for inference on parameter homogeneity, we apply mean group estimation of functional coefficients that allow the conditioning of key model parameters on economic states. The evidence in favor of cointegration is weakened over states of negative real interest rates that are likely to coincide with scenarios of high inflation. The ex post real interest rate is mostly diagnosed as unstable. The Fisher hypothesis is particularly confirmed for states characterized by large positive interest rate adjustments during the inflation-targeting regime.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, D-23100 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Herwartz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-23100 Kiel, Germany.",herwartz@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Our model finds (1) when speculators face no liquidity shocks, the central bank tends to appreciate the currency quickly to discourage speculative capital; (2) when speculators face liquidity shocks, the central bank optimally pre-commits to a slower appreciation path, and the appreciation takes the longest time when the probability of liquidity shocks takes intermediate values; (3) the central bank tends to appreciate the currency more quickly when it conducts discretionary policy.

Tax progressivity results residually, whereas educational policy guarantees an optimal tax wedge on, but not necessarily efficiency in, educational investment. The less elastic are the unobservable educational investment and skilled labor (the latter relative to unskilled labor supply), and the more educational policy cares about the skilled labor supply, the more progressive the tax system will be.

This article investigates the Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) modelling strategy in an application to real exchange rates. The key findings are as follows. First, using the methodology advocated by Terasvirta (1994), we find evidence of nonlinear dynamics for several of the spot dollar real exchange rates using monthly data on five of the G7 countries. However, once estimated, we find that the STAR specification is appropriate for only one of the three exchange rate series indicated to be an Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive (ESTAR) process. Moreover, using simulations, we show that the underlying methodology used to detect nonlinearities in the data exhibit substantial size biases, which we attribute to influential observations. We find, upon investigating alternative nonlinear specifications, that the open-loop Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) process is a more appropriate specification than the ESTAR process for the dollar-sterling and dollar-lira real exchange rates.","[Ahmad, Yamin; Glosser, Stuart] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Glosser, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 800 W Main St, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",glossers@uww.edu,"Ahmad, Yamin/B-3708-2012",,,,,,42,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, little discussion appears to focus explicitly on quantifying the cost of economic crises in terms of human lives, especially the lives of the most vulnerable members of society, infants. Using a statistical approach that is robust to the increases of mortality in outlying years, we quantify the effect that economic crises, periods of prolonged economic recession, have on infant mortality. Moreover, we investigate whether different levels of public spending on health across advanced industrialized democracies can mitigate the impact of crises on infant mortality. We find that economic crises are extremely costly and lead to a more than proportional increase in infant mortality in the short-run. Substantial public spending on health is required in order to limit their impact.","[Harding, Matthew] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Alexander, Marcus] Stanford Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lamarche, Carlos] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Harding, M (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mch@stanford.edu,,"Alexander, Marcus/0000-0001-8627-7534",,,,,29,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Considering the critical role of trade integration in the East Asian integration process, we study whether East Asian countries are characterized by business cycle synchronization. The related empirical literature dedicated to business cycles synchronization in East Asia does not lead to firm conclusion. In this paper, we suggest a different empirical approach allowing, contrary to the previous studies, to detect endogenously structural changes in the comovement process between outputs. We apply a new measure based on the time-varying coherence function. Such a measure not only detects comovement dynamics but it distinguishes also this dynamics between short- and long-term. We compute also cohesion statistics to test if countries tend to be more synchronized or not. The main finding of this paper is that the increase in bilateral trade inside the East Asian region significantly improves long-run business cycle synchronization. The short-run influence of bilateral trade shows mixed results. Indeed, short-run cycles remain significantly influenced both by shocks hitting each country and by economic policy responses.

This paper constructs a measure of financial frictions that is consistent with this prediction of theory. Using bond deals from 47 countries, financial frictions are captured as the sensitivity of bond spreads to the issuing firms' financial leverage. This dynamic measure of financial frictions provides new insights into three characteristics of financial frictions. 1) In contrast to the inferences drawn from widely-used measures, financial frictions display a large degree of variability, and have decreased over time. 2) The effect of financial frictions on private credit supply has decreased both in significance and magnitude over time. 3) Bankruptcy reforms, in general, have not been effective in improving creditor/borrower rights.","[Aysun, Uluc] Univ Connecticut Stamford, Stamford, CT USA",University of Connecticut,"Aysun, U (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Unit 1063, 341 Mansfield Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",uluc.aysun@uconn.edu,,"Aysun, Uluc/0000-0002-3136-2915",,,,,66,1,1,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Due to the lag in data capturing quality of the institutional environment, a comprehensive analysis is possible firstly now. The indices measuring economic freedom were affected significantly by the recent financial crisis. After 30 years of successful global growth in economic freedom the EU, together with other advanced economies, has suffered a significant drop. This was caused by regulation policies and overspending in the old EU member states. The year of 2010 seemed to be a year of slow return to the path of free market liberalism. The far-reaching solution does not lie in strengthening state supervision and regulation, but in return to the principles of market economy. Similarly, in the most recent assessment of Transparency International's flagship - CPI - a negative effect of financial crisis on the corruption perceptions was captured. According to the CPI, among the most notable decliners over the past years belong particularly countries most affected by the financial crisis. Other indices measuring institutional quality show a similar negative effect of global crisis.","[Bajzikova, Anna; Zak, Milan] Ctr Ekonomickych Studii VSEM, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",,,anna.bajzikova@vsem.cz; milan.zak@vsem.cz,"Zak, Milan/AAB-3520-2021","Zak, Milan/0000-0002-5814-7668",,,,,12,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

For the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM), a risk-based extension of the traditional Leontief model, which describes the propagation of inoperability throughout interconnected economic sectors, uncertainty is manifested in parameters describing the strength of interdependencies among sectors and in parameters describing the adverse impacts of a disruptive event, among others. As the model is used to evaluate preparedness options to reduce the impact of these disruptive events, such uncertainty can impact decision-making efforts. This paper introduces interval arithmetic as an approach for dealing with uncertainties in the IIM when probability distributions are not known and only variable bounds are available. Illustrative examples highlight the use of the approach as well as a means to improve the evaluation and comparison of risk management strategies in interdependent systems when only intervals are known.","[Barker, Kash] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Ind Engn, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Rocco S, Claudio M.] Cent Univ Venezuela, Fac Ingn, Caracas, Venezuela",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Central Venezuela,"Barker, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Sch Ind Engn, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",kashbarker@ou.edu,"Barker, Kash/GQA-6312-2022; Sanseverino, Claudio M Rocco/G-5427-2010","Sanseverino, Claudio M Rocco/0000-0002-8022-0446; Barker, Kash/0000-0002-0142-1558",,,,,44,15,17,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The simulation of the possible macroeconomic effects of the championship on Poland's economy, including three forecast variants, has been derived using a dynamic general equilibrium model (CGE) where the organization of the championship is treated as an exogeneous shock, which brings about some extraordinary growth impulses accelerating economic growth. The most important stimulus is provided by speeding up extensive investments in the transport infrastructure (highways, railways, and airports), investments related to the construction or renewal of stadiums and other sport objects, as well as complementary investments in hotels and restaurants. The second growth impulse is the expected increase in the inflow of FDI, partly related to investments made under the former heading. The third impulse is the expected increase in the inflow of foreign tourists visiting Poland both during the championship and afterwards (facilitated by the improved transport infrastructure and an extended net of hotels and restaurants). According to the forecast, the synthetic effect of the EURO 2012 on Poland's economy over the period 2008-2020 may be an increase in real GDP by 1.4-2.7% of its total value in 2009. This growth effect will be unevenly distributed over the period covered by the analysis, with a steep increase in the three years preceding the championship, a peak in 2012, the year of its organisation, and a gradual phase-out after the event, until its almost complete disappearance by 2020. The expected total long-term growth effect of the Europe's Football Championships on the Polish economy is stronger (in relative terms) as compared with the effects on the economies concerned, noted during the former editions of the same football games.","[Boratynski, Jakub; Plich, Mariusz] Uniwersytet Lodzki, Lodz, Poland; [Dykas, Pawel; Tokarski, Tomasz] Uniwersytet Jagiellonski, Krakow, Poland",University of Lodz; Jagiellonian University,,jakub_borowski@poczta.onet.pl; jborat@uni.lodz.pl; ddam.czerniak@gmail.com; paweldykas@op.pl; plich@uni.lodz.pl; rrapacki@sgh.waw.pl; tomtok67@tlen.pl,"Plich, Mariusz/AAN-8846-2020; Rapacki, Ryszard/HLW-5654-2023; Czerniak, Adam/AAV-3688-2020","Plich, Mariusz/0000-0001-8657-0458; Rapacki, Ryszard/0000-0001-6244-3171; Czerniak, Adam/0000-0003-1182-2483; Boratynski, Jakub/0000-0002-4288-2596",,,,,44,4,4,1,24,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,4,,,,,493,525,,,,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,829GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295565500002,0

We argue that these two changes are causally related. We develop a growth model based on Galor and Weil (1996) where female participation in market activities, fertility, and government size, in addition to consumption and saving, is endogenously determined. Rising incomes lead to a rise in female labor force participation as the opportunity cost of staying at home and caring for the children increases. In our model, higher government spending decreases the cost of performing household chores, including, but not limited to, child rearing and child care, as in Rosen (1996). We also use a wide cross-section of data for developed and developing countries and show that higher market participation by women is positively and robustly associated with government size. We then investigate the causal link between participation and government size using a novel unique data set that allows the use of the relative price of productive home appliances as an instrumental variable. We find strong evidence of a causal link between female market participation and government size. This effect is robust to the country sample, time period, and a set of controls in the spirit of Rodrik (1998). (JEL O4, E62, H11).","[Cavalcanti, Tiago V.

The results indicate that between 6 factors that are analyzed in this research only auditor size is significantly related to auditor switch among companies listed on Tehran Stock Exchange.

The ultimate decisions of the European Commission on the subject are to be taken in July 2011, just at the beginning of the Polish presidency in the EU. It is important that new regulations are conducive to the development of agriculture in Poland and in all the Europe. In the authors' view, of crucial importance is to maintain the common character of the CAP in spite of the attempts to re-nationalise agricultural policies. If the CAP is discontinued and the related subsidies for agriculture are stopped for the sake of the liberal rules of the economy, it would imply a drainage of the value added from agriculture to other sectors of the economy. This would cause adverse external effects, weakening the competitiveness of the European agriculture, especially in the new EU member countries. The future CAP should correct market failure, protect the environment, and secure the interests of local communities. The intended reforms of the CAP will be implemented under the pressure of a rising competition in world markets, an increasing concern about the environment, and the demand of some states for the reduction of the EU budget. There is therefore a need for a complex re-assessment of the mechanism of the financial support for the agricultural. sector in respect of its economic efficiency, social adequacy, and ecological standards. The authors point to the success of the CAP in promoting structural changes in the European agriculture and its adjustment to the requirements of a balanced growth. Referring to the proposed changes in the CAP, the authors specifically analyze such questions as the intended changes in direct subsidies, allocation of the financial support, and new demands for public goods supplied by the agricultural sector. The authors also present their own remarks and proposals as regards the future shape of the CAR In particular, they propose to equalize the rules of the financial support for agriculture in all the EU countries (will special consideration of the needs of new member countries), to establish the minimum amounts of subsidies for small farms, and to maintain current funds earmarked for the development of rural areas, supplemented by adequate payments for the supply of public goods.","[Czyzewski, Andrzej; Stepien, Sebastian] Uniwersytet Ekonomi, KMiGZ, Poznaniu, Poland",,"Czyzewski, A (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekonomi, KMiGZ, Poznaniu, Poland.",kmigz@ue.poznan.pl; sebastian.stepien@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,29,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,1,,,,,9,36,,,,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,741CJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288840400001,0

Existing models, however, consider typically a single time period and correspondingly do not properly account for actual dispatch constraints and energy sources with a non-dispatchable, variable output. This paper presents a portfolio theory model that explicitly distinguishes between installed capacity (power), electricity generation (energy) and actual instantaneous power delivery. This way, the variability of wind power and ramp limits of conventional power plants are correctly included in the investment optimization. The model is written as a quadratically constrained programming problem and illustrated in a case study. The results show that the introduction of wind power can be motivated to lower the risk on generation cost, albeit to smaller levels than typically reported in the literature. This wind power deployment further requires the need for sufficiently rampable technologies, to deal with its fluctuating output. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The argument is that the latter, in addition to being sheltered from the ageing problem, generate better macroeconomic performance. In our opinion, this view is completely flawed, because it is based on a set of assumptions that are not reflected in the real world. Moreover, it is also based on the consideration that the main objective of a pension system is to generate a market-clearing equilibrium outcome. On the contrary, we argue that this should not be the objective of a pension system; rather, it should be focused on providing individuals with sufficient income to maintain a socially acceptable level of consumption. Starting from this objective, and accepting the existence of uncertainty problems, we argue that current PAYGO pension systems are more efficient than unfunded systems. Moreover, by reducing uncertainty about the future, the PAYGO systems help to stabilise the working of the economy. Therefore, in our opinion, any reform of the current PAYGO pension systems intended to face the challenges of ageing must necessarily maintain the essential nature of these systems.","[Ferreiro, Jesus; Serrano, Felipe] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,,,"Serrano, Felipe/X-9303-2019; Ferreiro, Jesus/J-3556-2019","Serrano, Felipe/0000-0002-5993-7178; Ferreiro, Jesus/0000-0002-5732-7966",,,,,51,1,1,0,4,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-23030-768-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2011,,,,,,,154,189,,,,,,36,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BWV66,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295079400005,0

Using a sample of 528 syndicated loans to Russian borrowers, we perform regressions of the spread on a set of variables including information on local bank participation and the characteristics of loans and borrowers. Unlike earlier studies, ours distinguishes foreign banks with a local presence from those without such presence. The intuition here is that a local presence may influence a foreign bank's monitoring ability and access to information about borrowers. We observe no significant impact on the spread when there is local bank participation in a syndicated loan, nor do we find any significant influence of the presence of domestically owned banks or foreign-owned banks on the spread. Additional estimations considering subsamples with exacerbated information asymmetries provide similar results.

The difference in credit constraints across racial minority and non-minority households is not explained by a broad set of covariates.

The analysis suggests that investors in these countries are mainly interested in low (unit) labour costs coupled with a well-trained and educated workforce and an expanding market with high growth rates in the purchasing power of potential buyers. It also suggests that the financial crisis reduced the attractiveness of the region as a source for localised knowledge and technology. There appears to be a match between investors' expectations and the quantitative supply of unqualified labour, though not for the supply of medium qualified workers. The analysis suggests that it is not technology-seeking investors that are particularly content with the capabilities of their host economies in terms of technological cooperation.

To the extent that our results approximate causal estimates, increasing education may be a cost-effective way to improve population health.","[Golberstein, Ezra] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, St Paul, MN USA; [Hirth, Richard A.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lantz, Paula M.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; George Washington University,"Golberstein, E (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, St Paul, MN USA.",egolber@umn.edu; RHIRTH@UMICH.EDU; plantz@gwu.edu,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This assessment, performed by the think tank Health Consumer Powerhouse, reports outcomes, and ranks accordingly several countries. In turn, this paper explores the ability of national data at explaining the differences observed in that ranking. The innovative features of this paper are mainly two. First, it shows how the Euro Health Consumer Index which is comprised from 6 indicators - can be used as a single-outcome latent variable. This feature expands the possibilities of incorporating EHCI in future research. Secondly, this paper also serves as an example of the use of Partial Least Squares (PLS) and its characteristics. The analytical technique is PLS. The empirical analysis uses a set of 22 European countries (20 from European Union plus Norway and Switzerland) and departs from a model that relates four latent constructs, one representing National Performance (the aggregated measure of the EHCI) and the others representing financial investment in health care and human and physical resources. The final estimates provide very interesting results. The main result, or a judgment from the point of view of political implications of this research, is that a successful health care system needs mainly financial investment. Secondly, it also benefits - to a lesser extent - from physical capabilities. Finally, the way resources namely human resources - are organized is possibly critical to the overall performance, measured from a consumer point of view. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Its econometric implementation interacts shocks with backward-looking inertia. The right fork approach emphasizes forward-looking expectations that can jump in response to anticipated policy changes.

Previous studies investigated the impact of globalization on a range of individual expenditure shares in gross domestic product (GDP) and they did not take into account indirect effects. Our empirical strategy is to estimate system of equations in order to uncover to what extent the relative importance of specific expenditure categories is influenced by globalization. We use different measures of globalization (foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade (TRADE) as sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of gross domestic product). We investigate this panel model for the seven selected new EU member states - Bulgaria, Estonia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary and Slovakia) during period 1995-2008. We use four control variables - covariates - the real economic growth, the age dependency ratio, the inflation and the lending rate charged by banks on loans to prime customers. We estimate our panel regression model using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) including cross-section country effects. Our results show that globalization influenced the total and composition of government expenditure in a notable way. From the point of view of the government expenditure structure the strongest impact of globalization has been demonstrated by foreign direct investments on government expenditures for goods and services (positively) and capital expenditures (negatively). The second indicator of globalization TRADE determinated mainly government expenditures for goods and services (negatively) and capital expenditures (positively).","[Hanclova, Jana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jana.hanclova@vsb.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020; Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852;",,,,,11,10,10,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,161,170,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200018,0

We thereby combine the concept of sigma convergence with Shorrock's inequality decomposition in order to determine the driving forces in distributional dynamics of farmers' revenues. Additionally, we apply alternative methodologies to investigate how per capita incomes have evolved over time. Explicitly comparing the situations with and without transfers, our results indicate that the CAP tends to smooth differences in farmers' revenues across regions, but does not impede a strong divergence through time. The latter is mainly driven by increasing structural differences between the regions, while disparities in intensity turn out to be less important. The empirical analysis also shows that CAP transfers reduce income inequality within society as a whole. However, this impact proved to be negligible in explaining distributional dynamics and growth of per capita incomes.","[Hansen, Heiko] Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Teuber, Ramona] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Hansen, H (通讯作者)，Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",heiko.hansen@vti.bund.de,"Teuber, Ramona/AAE-1925-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Teuber, Ramona/0000-0001-6283-0438",,,,,33,12,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Existing methods can become completely unfeasible due to the full path dependence of such models. In this article, we demonstrate how to overcome this problem. We formulate a full MS-ARMA-GARCH model and its Bayes estimator. This facilitates the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and allows us to develop an algorithm to compute the Bayes estimator of the regimes and parameters of our model.

Such experiments are generally regarded as the preferred framework within which to collect data to reveal the preferences of individuals in a particular application context. Analysts have developed sophisticated ways of analysing such data, typically using a form of discrete choice model that identifies the marginal (dis) utility associated with each observed attribute linked to an alternative, as well as accounting for sources of preference and scale heterogeneity. There is also a growing literature studying the attribute processing rules (or heuristics) that respondents use as a way of simplifying the task of choosing, for all manner of meaningful reason. We find that there is relatively less effort placed on looking closely at the data defining each choice situation for each respondent, as constructed by the stated choice experiment, and seeing if there exist, evidential. rules that support in a plausible way, the choice responses. Heuristics investigated in this paper that might aid in our understanding of how choice scenarios are processed, leading to a choice outcome, include the role of dimensional vs. holistic attribute processing, the influence of relative attribute levels, and the revision of the reference alternative as value learning across sequenced choice sets. We find a high level of confidence in the evidence, and identify at least two features of choice set processing, namely value learning and majority of confirming dimensions, that are worthy of future inclusion in the estimation of all choice models. The evidence suggests that there is a great deal of behavioural sense in stated choice responses, for all manner of possible reason.","[Hensher, David A.; Collins, Andrew T.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,"; Masiero, Lorenzo/O-8734-2014","Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-2500-250X; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242; Masiero, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6933-1700",,,,,27,41,42,3,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

However, the answer whether banks provide sufficient provisions when the economy is in an upturn trend remains unsolved. Furthermore, provisioning must be influenced not only by business cycles and bank earnings, but also by the regulatory system. Nevertheless, empirical research on this issue has been scarce. Thus, this study intends to answer two questions shown above. The evidence shows that with steady growth in both the economy and bank earnings, the bank management will tend to increase LLP, whereas with a buoyant economy but negative growth in bank earnings, the management will exhibit an inclination to reduce LLP. As regards the influence of bank regulation on provisions, the evidence shows that, under certain circumstances, banks make more provision based on regulatory considerations. This explains why bank regulations regarding LLP across countries do have an impact on banks' provisioning behaviour.","[Shen, Chung-Hua] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Meng-Fen] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Finance, Taichung 404, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Shen, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",chshen01@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this way, they cannot only reduce investment risks, but also enhance production efficiency, reduce costs and generate more profits. The conventional method of profit-sharing between JV firms is based on ratio of investment. However, as the firms make different contributions to the project, the rationality of such a profit-sharing method is often doubtful and thus is difficult to maintain a stable cooperative relationship for a JV team. Based on the concept of the cooperative game theory, this paper proposes a contribution-based profit-sharing model using Shapley Value. A case study is used to describe how firms can use this model to reach decisions of participation, and determine a fair profit-sharing rule after cooperation to enhance mutual trust and create the advantages of cooperation.","[Yan, Min-Ren] Chinese Culture Univ SCE, Dept Int Business Adm, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Hsueh, Sung-Lin] Tung Fang Design Univ, Dept Interior Design, Hu Nei Shang Kaohsiung H, Taiwan",Tung Fang Design University,"Yan, MR (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ SCE, Dept Int Business Adm, 231 Sec 2,Jianguo S Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",hsueh.sl@msa.hinet.net; mjyen@sce.pccu.edu.tw,,"Yan, Min-Ren/0000-0002-8270-9763",,,,,27,17,18,2,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Presently, competitiveness is assessed at the macro level, i.e. it is assessed as the potential of an economy to establish itself on the world markets and maintain its long-term position there. Sustainable performance growth of any economy requires a shift to competitive advantages of higher quality, thus representing a transition from the cost-related competitiveness to competitiveness based on the capacity of an economy to make use of technology and innovations. Such use is driven by the potential of businesses to manufacture new products by employing sophisticated business procedures.

The established profitability cost approach compares the profit of a universal service provider (USP) with and without a universal service obligation (USO). This paper argues that the net cost of universal service provision critically depends on the regulatory counterfactual and hence the USP's strategy space without USO. On the one hand, a strong USO limits the USP's means to position itself in the market, which offers cream-skimming opportunities and invites competition. On the other hand, a simple game-theoretic entry analysis shows that the USO may effectively serve as a valuable strategic commitment device to deter entry. Hence, the USO may be valuable to the USP despite causing inefficient operations. From a policy perspective, this constitutes a counter-intuitive result for the definition of the USO: the stricter it is regulated, the more detrimental it may be to competition and, therefore, the smaller is its burden on the USP.","Swiss Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Jaag, C (通讯作者)，Swiss Econ, Stampfenbachstr 142, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",christian.jaag@swiss-economics.ch,,,,,,,35,5,5,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Since 1980, the services sector has overwhelmingly predominated in the economic activity of the European Union, Japan, and the US, but there is substantial heterogeneity among services. Personal, finance, and business services have low productivity growth and increasing shares in employment and GDP. By contrast, shares of distribution services are constant, and productivity growth is rapid.

The model implies that the increase in government expenditures covered by the budget deficit stimulates the growth of output and employment whereas the effect of the increased government spending financed by raising the tax rates is not unambiguous, depending on the specific conditions of the given economy. In order to evaluate the effects of the rise in government spending in Poland covered by an increased taxation, the author estimated the model using quarterly data for the period 1995-2009. The results of the simulation show that the increase in the government spending financed by the rise in income taxes reduces the employment, capital, consumption and output levels, confirming the adverse effect of tax rises on the economy. At the same time, the effect of the increased government spending financed by budget deficits tends to be positive. The analysis supports the thesis that the choice of the method of financing is the crucial factor determining the impact of government spending on the economy.","Uniwersytetu Lodzkiego, Inst Ekon, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Krajewski, P (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Lodzkiego, Inst Ekon, Lodz, Poland.",piotr_krajewski@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,4,,,,,551,+,,,,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,829GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295565500004,0

We find a negative relation between governance quality and equity return. Countries with low governance scores, on average, have higher equity returns than those with high governance scores after controlling for global risk factors known to influence international equity returns. This implies that investors associate low governance quality with increased risk and thus demand higher risk premium. We find that the quality of governance as measured by Political Stability and Absence of Violence is key governance dimension affecting international equity returns, suggesting that heightened investor concerns over political risks have profound impact on equity markets. Interestingly, we find no evidence that variation in equity returns is affected by the governance indicator representing Voice and Accountability. The findings of this study provide important policy implications.","[Low, Soo-Wah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Grad Sch Business UKM GSB, Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Kew, Si-Roei; Tee, Lain-Tze] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sch Management, Fac Econ & Management, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Low, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Grad Sch Business UKM GSB, Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",swlow@ukm.my,"Tee, Lain-Tze/GWC-8873-2022",,,,,,36,23,25,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Introducing idiosyncratic shocks into the model implies that plants have non-constant operating profits and as a result there is an endogenous exit margin and incumbent plants must decide in each period whether or not to remain in the industry. By using the forward Kolmogorov equation, we analytically characterize the Stationary Equilibrium. Our main contribution is to show that if a model is being calibrated/estimated without idiosyncratic shocks, where plants face constant productivity over time and the exit rate is exogenous to fit data generated from a model with shocks and endogenous entry, TFP distortions will be overestimated.","[Maria Da Rocha, Jose; Salvador Pujolas, Pau] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Maria Da Rocha, Jose] Univ Vigo, RGEA, Vigo, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidade de Vigo,"Da Rocha, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",jmrocha@uvigo.es; PauSalvador.Pujolas@uab.cat,"Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/CAJ-5410-2022; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/Y-7181-2018","Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/0000-0003-3985-8816",,,,,12,2,2,0,8,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The two groups form a heterogeneous integrated area (EU-27) with respect to country size, income levels, relative factor endowments and a different history of economic systems. The estimation was conducted on industries with different degrees of scale economies and factor intensities in the presence of both spatial (distance and borders) and non-spatial (Eastern enlargements and Euro membership) trade costs. The results highlight the asymmetry in intra-bloc trade when the latter is heterogeneous: country size, income, factor endowments and the various trade barriers or facilitators are found to be significant determinants of trade between old and new EU members to an extent that is specific to different country and industry groups. The results also show how this heterogeneity eliminates the equivalence between exports and imports as the dependent variable in gravity models and makes the results sensitive to the definition of the bilateral flows to be estimated.","Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Illes Balears, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Marques, H (通讯作者)，Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Edifici Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos,Km 7,5, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Illes Balears, Spain.",helena.ferreira-marques@uib.es,,"Marques, Helena/0000-0002-9257-7848",,,,,28,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Professor of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University E.K. Zavadskas was the first to use these methods in Lithuania in the mideighties of the last century for evaluation, substantiation and choosing of optimal technological solutions at various stages of construction (3(sic) 1987). In this period, new multicriteria evaluation methods were being developed and widely used in the world in various scientific and practical areas. Later, numerous disciples and colleagues of prof. Zavadskas as well representatives of various scientific schools extensively used the considered methods in Lithuania. The main concept behind the quantitative evaluation methods is integration of the values of the criteria describing a particular process and their weights (significances) into a single magnitude, i.e. the criterion of the method. For some particular (maximizing) criteria the largest value is the best, while for others (minimizing criteria) the smallest value is the best. The units of criteria measurement are also different. The alternatives compared are ranked according to the calculated values of the criterion of the method. Great numbers of multicriteria evaluation methods, based on different logical principles and having different complexity levels and the inherent features, have been created in the world. There is hardly any 'best' multicriteria evaluation method. Therefore, a parallel use of several multicriteria evaluation methods as well as the analysis of the spread of estimates and averaging of the values obtained may be recommended for evaluating complicated multifaceted objects and processes. The method SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) is one of the simplest, natural and most widely used multicriteria evaluation methods. It clearly demonstrates the idea of integrating the values and weights of criteria into a single estimating value - the criterion of the method. However, SAW uses only maximizing evaluation criteria, while minimizing evaluation criteria should be converted into the maximizing ones by the respective formulas prior to their application. This limitation is eliminated in the method COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment). The authors of the method, E.K. Zavadskas and his disciple A.Kaklauskas suggested that the influence of maximizing and minimizing evaluation criteria should be assessed separately. In this case, the component, taking into account the effect of maximizing criteria, matches the estimate yielded by the method SAW. Despite the fact that the method COPRAS is most commonly used in Lithuania, its main characteristics and properties have not been clearly defined and demonstrated. However, the awareness of these properties allows us to show the benefits of the method's application, to predict the influence of minimizing criteria values on the final result (estimate), to check the calculations and to take into account possible instability of estimates yielded by the method due to the specific character of the actual data. The paper describes the main features of multicriteria evaluation methods SAW and COPRAS and their common and diverse characteristics, as well as defining and demonstrating the properties of the method COPRAS, which are of great theoretical and practical value. All theoretical statements are illustrated by numerous examples and calculations.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-2040 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Podvezko, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-2040 Vilnius, Lithuania.",valentinas.podvezko@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,74,204,217,2,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Previous studies found that elderly patients were discharged from hospital 'quicker and sicker' under PPS and concluded that families were coping at home. We analyse a national longitudinal survey, the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its Epidemiologic Followup Study, which includes data on more outcomes over a longer period than earlier studies. We find that the rate of admission to nursing homes from the community in the first weeks after a hospital discharge more than tripled under PPS, suggesting that families were not always able to cope. As another response to sicker patients, discharges directly to nursing homes from hospitals, which jumped initially under PPS, may have risen further when payment rates were tightened in the early 1990s. Hospital readmissions fell after the first few years. Our findings are strengthened by the fact that we control for patients' health using health information collected independently of hospital admission.","[Russell, Louise B.; Miller, Jane E.] Rutgers State Univ, Inst Hlth, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Russell, Louise B.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Qian, Xufeng] Moodys Investors Serv, New York, NY USA; [Valiyeva, Elmira] EisnerAmper LLP, Edison, NJ USA; [Miller, Jane E.] Rutgers State Univ, Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Russell, LB (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Inst Hlth, 112 Paterson St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",lrussell@ifh.rutgers.edu,,"Russell, Louise/0000-0003-3599-0991",,,,,25,35,45,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

But unlike most economists of his time, he attempted to apply a Walrasian general equilibrium framework to the situation. The present paper studies how Hicks developed this approach in the last chapters of Value and Capital (1939). Hicks came to argue that the fluctuations of the capitalist system endangered its existence and imagined a theory of the trade cycle giving a major role to expectations and showing the possibility of an economic collapse. The paper analyses the problems raised by this research program in order to explain why Hicks abandoned it while he wrote A Contribution to the Theory of the Trade Cycle (1950).","[Rubin, Goulven] LED, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Rubin, Goulven] Univ Paris 08, F-93526 St Denis 02, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Rubin, G (通讯作者)，LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France.",goulven.rubin@univ-paris8.fr,,,,,,,33,4,5,0,5,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

The SUBE approach does not require any kind of inverse matrix and incorporates the traditional approach (with square supply-use tables) as a particular case. The empirical analysis shows that the SUBE carbon dioxide multipliers for the EU27 are considerably lower than those obtained by the traditional Leontief inverse. In an application of the SUBE approach, the European economy appears to emit about 10% less carbon dioxide than in a situation in which it would not import any intermediate inputs from outside the EU27.","[Rueda-Cantuche, Jose M.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr IPTS, Inst Prospect, Seville, Spain; [Rueda-Cantuche, Jose M.] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Rueda-Cantuche, JM (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr IPTS, Inst Prospect, Seville, Spain.",jose.rueda-cantuche@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,25,3,4,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Academic dishonesty was becoming rampant among university students due to lack of self-awareness and not much concern given by academia in combating this problem. It was found that most of them were not aware either they have cheated or plagiarized because of lack of understanding about it. Academic rules must be communicated to the students and they also needed to be trained to be more information literate through awareness programmes and information skills courses. As the major causes of academic dishonesty have been identified, cooperation from all university communities was important to deal with this more systematically instead of enforcing rules and reforming the existing education system. The study was intended to examine the incidence of academic dishonesty among final year undergraduates in Malaysian public university to acquire a clear picture on their perceived behaviours compared from gender and age groups.

The current emergency communication systems in Japan, as well as in the Czech Republic, were unable to distribute needed warning information before bad accident to all potential disaster victims. The level of economic and human losses during similar situations depends substantially on timely and high-quality notification. It needs to be targeted to every affected person in imminent danger to direct them to implement appropriate lifesaving and health and property protection. The sharing, distribution and dissemination of adequate information in special and unexpected situations is one of the crucial roles of any governmental level. Unfortunately this role is not always fulfilled correctly. With appropriate information distribution, it should be possible to not only save on material values but also human lives.

Using in-sample daily data of Taiex over the period 4 January 1980 to 25 August 1997 and postsample daily data over the period 26 August 1997 to 10 September 2007, the evidence reveals that a curvaceous risk-return relationship and both asymmetric volatility and asymmetric trend of returns are significant in Taiex. The episode of asymmetric trend of returns is that the positive information creates a higher return trend than the negative information of the same amount, while similarly to most studies, the evidence of asymmetric volatility appears that the negative information makes a higher volatility than the positive information of the same size. Most remarkably, we evidence that the volatility asymmetry effect is a conservative trading factor and the return trend asymmetry effect is an active trading factor. In comparison of post-sample performance using rolling-window technique, the leverage trend GARCH model indeed outperforms the other three models with single asymmetry adjusted or without asymmetry adjusted, while the asymmetry nonadjusted model performs the worst. It implies that the return trend asymmetry (active trading) and the volatility asymmetry effects (conservative trading) tend to compensate, but not offset each other.","[Su, Ender] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Bilson, John F.

The hypothesis that skilled workers, living and working overseas, can effectively channel technological knowledge back to their home country, which in turn contributes to that country's economic growth, is tested utilizing data on the stock of high-skilled workers from 50 developing countries working in industrialized countries over the last two decades. Results obtained lend strong support to this hypothesis. In addition, the effect that remittances from workers in developed countries, which are used for investment purposes in developing countries, have on the rate of growth of those developing economies is investigated. Our empirical evidence indicates that this remittance channel exerts a significant, positive impact on growth, although quantitatively the contribution of such investment-oriented remittances in driving sustainable economic development appears to be somewhat smaller than that of more general technological diffusion.","[Thanh Le; Bodman, Philip M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Bodman, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.bodman@economics.uq.edu.au,,"Le, Thanh/0000-0002-1665-7926",,,,,28,19,21,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We argue that, though relevant, emphasis should shift from competitiveness to differential rates of growth of domestic demand as its chief explanatory factor. Euro core countries have experienced a shortage of domestic demand, with wage restraint playing a key role. This has led them to experience a current account surplus, which could not be understood independently of a buoyant domestic demand in the peripheral countries, funded with private debt. As a byproduct of that strong demand, the periphery suffered from wage inflation and a loss of competitiveness. This dual growth pattern is unsustainable as indebtedness cannot go on without any limit. Neither wage cuts nor fiscal austerity in the periphery will help to solve this mess: although trade balance would be restored, it would lead to a negative shock in aggregate demand, threatening their ability to settle debts at due dates.","[Uxo, Jorge; Febrero, Eladio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Paul, Jesus] CEU San Pablo Univ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; San Pablo CEU University,"Uxó, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",Jorge.Uxo@uclm.es; pagut@ceu.es; eladio.febrero@uclm.es,"Uxó, Jorge/AAB-3357-2019; Febrero, Eladio/AAB-5335-2019","Uxó, Jorge/0000-0002-2218-1004; Febrero, Eladio/0000-0002-0722-9487; Paul Gutierrez, Jesus/0000-0002-2939-3341",,,,,22,26,26,0,13,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,5,,,SI,,571,592,,10.2298/PAN1105571U,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,877OY,,gold,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299193000002,0

Life satisfaction is found to be negatively associated with the unemployment rate and inflation, but positively associated with the growth rate. In contrast to earlier findings, the weights placed on inflation and unemployment are of a similar magnitude. The life satisfaction regression is used to determine the weights to be attached to growth, employment, and price stability in a macroeconomic performance index.

These forms are as follows: investments into an authorized capital stock, conclusion of a license agreement, franchising, leasing, sell of rights on intellectual assets that are objects of intellectual property, etc. The process of commercializing intellectual assets broadens opportunities of acquisition of income from realized innovative projects for a high-technology enterprise. Results of these projects lead to formation of a system of innovations at an enterprise. Some elements of this system (e.g., technological innovations) are directly reflected in the structure of enterprise property. Thus, commercialization of these elements is relatively simple. The other elements of the innovative system of a high-technology enterprise (e.g., marketing managerial-organizing innovations) are not directly taken stock in the structure of enterprise property. The process of commercializing these elements is more complex. Thus, a high-technology enterprise must have an appropriate economic-organizing mechanism that enables to commercialize a variety of its intellectual assets. The paper looks into the mechanism of commercializing intellectual assets of a high-technology enterprise, which is suggested by the authors. The authors regard this mechanism as a control system that consists of several subsystems. The paper researches into main subsystems which are: marketing, information, financial and economic-organizing. The paper suggests algorithms of effective functioning of these subsystems. The economic-organizing mechanism of creating and commercializing intellectual assets as a control system must be resistant to changes in external and internal environment factors. The authors regard these changes as perturbation actions on the system of managing processes of commercialization of intellectual assets and analyze a feedback mechanism within the suggested system.","[Zimovets, Olga] Moscow State Technol Univ Stankin, Econ & Enterprise Management Dept, Vadkovskiy Pereulok 1, Moscow 127994, Russia; [Baranov, Vyacheslav] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Inst Business Studies, Moscow 119571, Russia; [Zaytsev, Alexander] Moscow State Text Univ AN Kosygin, Anal Lab, Moscow 119071, Russia",Moscow State Technology University Stankin; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Kosygin State University of Russia,"Zimovets, O (通讯作者)，Moscow State Technol Univ Stankin, Econ & Enterprise Management Dept, Vadkovskiy Pereulok 1, Moscow 127994, Russia.",zimovets@gmail.com; baranow@nln.ru; az-inform@mail.ru,"Baranov, Vyacheslav/HLH-2557-2023",,,,,,10,0,1,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,599,+,,,,,,2,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200064,0

Due to the relatively advanced stage of the transitional processes in Romania, the behavioral functions were accommodated - as much as possible - to the standard relationships. Unlike the versions that used the statistical series beginning in 1980, the present one is based exclusively on information concerning the period 1989-2004. Therefore, we have considered more adequately naming this variant the macromodel of the Romanian market (not transition, as before) economy.

We study the stability properties of alternative transformations of the state variable, such as taking logarithms, which the agent can endogenously set forth. Surprisingly, for the considered class of economies, we found that the transformations that an econometrician would attempt are destabilizing, whereas alternative transformations, which an econometrician would never consider, such as convex transformations, are stabilizing. Therefore, we ironically find that in our set-up, an active agent who is concerned about learning the economy's dynamics and who in an attempt to improve forecasting transforms the state variable using standard transformations, is more likely to deviate from the steady state than a passive agent.","[Chatterji, Shurojit] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Lobato, Ignacio N.] Ctr Econ Res, Inst Tecnol Antonomo Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Singapore Management University; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Chatterji, S (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",,"CHATTERJI, Shurojit/D-1420-2009","chatterji, shurojit/0000-0003-0879-4346",,,,,21,1,1,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1742-7355,,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

When the manufacturing and retail sectors are competitive, a manufacturer would not voluntarily want to impose a minimum resale price maintenance since it would reduce the sales of the product and hence its profit, whereas a retailer with a higher price than its competitor would desire to have the minimum resale price maintenance imposed. This paper shows that a retailer with a larger market share can coerce manufacturers of less popular products into adopting minimum resale price maintenance, using it as a strategic tool for raising a rival retailer's price. The possibility of implementing such coercion depends on the extent of availability of retail shelf space and the disparity in the retailers' market shares.","Korea Energy Econ Inst, Uiwang Si 437713, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Korea Energy Economics Institute,"Doh, HJ (通讯作者)，Korea Energy Econ Inst, 665-1 Naeson Dong, Uiwang Si 437713, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",hjdoh@keei.re.kr,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

This discretion at work kicks in the potential importance of gift exchange or reciprocity between workers and employers in their employment relationship. Built on the seminal work of Akerlof (1980), this paper adopts a social norm approach to model reciprocity in labor markets and theoretically derives two versions of downward wage rigidity. The first version explains why employers may adopt a high wage policy far above the competitive level. This version is not a novel finding in the existing literature and is mainly served as a benchmark for later comparison in the current paper. Our main contribution lies in the second version in which not only may employers adopt a high wage policy far above the competitive level, but one can also account for the asymmetric behavior of wages and explain why employers are hesitant about wage cuts in the presence of negative shocks. We argue that this second and stronger version of downward wage rigidity has moved the efficiency wage theory a step forward. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Lin, Chung-Cheng; Yang, C.

We assume that once one of the two firms adopted the new technology, joint adoption is preferable for both firms, that is there are profit complementarities in the product market. There are, moreover, externalities derivig from the first firm's investment. By modelling the switch from a well established technology to a new one as a dynamic stochastic game, we fully characterize the equilibria of the game under both non-cooperative and cooperative firms' behaviour. We show that in the cooperative equilibrium firms will invest later under negative externalities and earlier under positive externalities. Thus we identify circumstances in which competiton can be suboptimal (too much waiting). Overall, compared to earlier models that only allow for a new market game, our model examines a richer set of strategic interactions of adoption decisions.","[Marseguerra, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica Milano, Fac Sociol, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Cortelezzi, Flavia] Univ Insubria, Fac Giurisprudenza, I-22100 Como, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Insubria,"Marseguerra, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Milano, Fac Sociol, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",giovanni.marseguerra@unicatt.it; flavia.cortelezzi@uninsubria.it,,"Cortelezzi, Flavia/0000-0001-7481-1541",,,,,22,1,1,0,7,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

INEQUALITY; RURAL-URBAN; EQUALITY; OUTCOMES,"While there is a large and growing body of research describing and analyzing changes in the Chinese income distribution, researchers have paid considerable less attention to inequality of opportunity. The aim of this paper is to contribute to filling this gap in the literature. The two main questions addressed empirically for the first time in a Chinese context are: to what extent are individuals' incomes and individual income differences due to factors beyond the individual's control (in Roemer's terminology circumstances) and to what extent are they due to outcomes of the individual's own choices (effort). What is the relationship between income inequality and inequality of opportunity? For this purpose we use data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey collected from nine provinces during the period 1989 to 2006. The CHNS has detailed information about incomes and other factors enabling us to construct a host of circumstance and effort variables for the offspring. We find that China has a substantial degree of inequality of opportunity. Parental income and parents' type of employer explain about two thirds of the total inequality of opportunity. Notably, parental education plays only a minor role implying that parental connections remain important. The results show that the increase in income inequality during the period under study largely mirrors the increase in inequality of opportunity. Thus, increased income inequality does not reflect changes in effort variables, or expressed differently, increased income inequality has not been accompanied by a decrease in inequality of opportunity.

Some feminist contributions to discussions about ontology and critical realism suggest strong reluctance to adopt realist philosophies and these provide a marked contrast with post-Keynesians' frequent appeals for economics to reflect 'reality'. At the same time, however, some post-Keynesians are calling for a more inclusive, pluralist approach to economic research, a discussion that has areas of commonality with various feminist discussions of epistemology. Continued productive dialogue between the two traditions may be facilitated through an understanding of their contrasting ontological and epistemological debates.

In one treatment, players are informed about the monetary payoffs associated with each bundle of goods; in a second treatment only the ordinal ranking of the bundles is given. We find that in both cases, inequality aversion plays a prominent role. In the ordinal treatment, individuals apparently use the ranks in the respective preference orderings over bundles of goods as a substitute for the unknown monetary value. Allocations that distribute the value (money or ranks, respectively) most equally serve as natural reference points for the bargaining processes. Frequently, such equal split allocations are chosen by our subjects even though they are Pareto dominated. Whether a Pareto optimal allocation is chosen or not depends on whether or not it is a Pareto improvement relative to the equal split reference allocation. We find less Pareto-damaging behavior due to inequality aversion in the ordinal than in the cardinal treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that subdivision affects both components of intertemporal choice, the utility function as well as the intertemporal discount function. In my first experiment, I demonstrate that differential concavity of utility for gains and convexity for losses implies that the discounting of losses is even more subadditive than the discounting of gains. Individuals display even more relative impatience over divided time intervals for negative amounts of money than for positive amounts of money. My second experiment utilizes alternative elicitation methods, which impose an intertemporal status quo, to highlight these utility effects. Subadditivity is stronger when delaying an early gain than for hastening a later gain. The reverse pattern holds for losses; discounting is more subadditive when hastening a later loss than for delaying an earlier loss. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To answer, I build a model that captures government's sympathy to trade-affected workers and allows me to decompose the channels through which trade-induced unemployment affects the level of sectoral protection chosen by a politically-driven incumbent official. I provide empirical evidence that the US government is very sensitive to the presence and the magnitude of trade-induced unemployment. Specifically, I estimate the weight that the office holder attaches to the welfare of trade-affected workers to be positive, significant, and four times larger than the weight on the welfare of those who are not affected by trade.","Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Yotov, YV (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, 3141 Chestnut St,503C, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",yotov@drexel.edu,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The conceptual framework is based on the family labour supply model, human and social capital theory, and immigrant assimilation theory. Our findings indicate that in regard to employment status, family background variables, including the presence of small children and husbands' characteristics, play a more significant role in determining the employment probability for these foreign spouses than do human capital variables. In particular, for spouses from Southeast Asia, each additional child is correlated with a decrease in working probability of 11.3%, whereas college education has an insignificant effect on their employment probability. Employment assimilation for these marriage immigrants may be confirmed by the finding that the employment probability of foreign spouses rises rapidly with the number of years that have elapsed since migration. As for the choice of employment sector, a strong linkage between the employment sector of the foreign spouses and their husbands' employment sector is found in this study.","[Chuang, Hwei-Lin] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Chuang, HL (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",hlchuang@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,6,7,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In our political system, the transfer of resources across generations is determined as a Markov equilibrium of a probabilistic voting game. Low realized returns on the risky asset induce politicians to compensate the old through a PAYG system. This political system typically generates an intergenerational risk sharing scheme that is (i) larger, (ii) more persistent, and (iii) less responsive to the realization of the shock than the social optimum.

Many of these equilibria require an extreme precision of beliefs among voters that is unlikely to be reached in real elections. At the same time, mechanisms like pre-election polls exist to shape the beliefs of voters about expected turnout. We combine these two features in a model of voter learning in elections and characterize the asymptotically stable equilibria of both complete and incomplete information games in a simple symmetric setting with two candidates. We also show how the model can be used to qualitatively explain several phenomena observed in reality: increases in costs of voting affect turnout adversely but there may be persistence of turnout levels between elections even though costs and other parameters change. Increase in uncertainty increases turnout while increases in the size of the electorate decrease it, in line with intuition.","[Demichelis, Stefano] Univ Pavia, Dept Math, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Dhillon, Amrita] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Pavia; University of Warwick,"Demichelis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Math, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",sdm.golem@gmail.com; a.dhillon@warwick.ac.uk,,"dhillon, amrita/0000-0003-4659-3617",,,,,39,5,5,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The voters are uncertain about the state of the world and the incumbent's choice of policy. Under complete information they would reelect the incumbent if and only if the state is sufficiently high. Undesirable policy outcomes may be due to either a bad state or the incumbent's choice of inefficient policies. The incumbent uses inefficient policies in intermediate states, whereby he creates uncertainty about the true state in such a way that voters are better off in expectation reelecting him.

We use these network-based measures of connectedness to explain stock market returns during recent episodes of financial crisis. We find that a crisis is amplified if the epicenter country is better integrated into the trade network. However, target countries affected by such a shock are in turn better able to dissipate the impact if they are well integrated into the network. A network approach can help explain why the Mexican, Asian, and Russian financial crises were highly contagious, while the crises that originated in Venezuela and Argentina did not have such a virulent effect. We suggest that a network approach incorporating the cascading and diffusion of interdependent ripples when a shock hits a specific part of the global trade network provides us with an improved explanation of financial contagion.

We use matching methods and a panel household and village data set with national coverage to compare changes from 2001 to 2004 in designated poor villages that began plan investments and in designated poor villages that had yet to begin plan investments. We find that the program significantly increased both government- and village-financed investments. While the program did not increase the income or consumption of poorer households, it did increase the income and consumption of richer households by 6.1 to 9.2%. We also find suggestive evidence that governance matters in the distribution of program benefits. Relative gains were greater for richer households in villages with more educated leaders, and higher quality village committees delivered greater benefits to both richer and poorer households.

Foreign capital flows, however, can be volatile as is evident from the recent financial crises. It has also recently been noted by researchers that there is little systematic empirical evidence that foreign capital contributes to the economic growth of developing countries. In this context, this paper attempts to theoretically reevaluate the borrowing behaviour of a developing economy that relies on foreign borrowing for its capital formation. In particular, this paper investigates the implications of different lending policies of international financial institutions. It is found that no matter whether the borrowing interest rate increases with the level of foreign debt per capita or with the foreign-capital/total-capital ratio, the economy always moves toward the stationary state. The result holds even when the representative agent regards the interest rate given as constant. This implies that foreign borrowing does help economic growth, irrespective of lending policies of international financial institutions.","[Huh, Hyeon-Seung] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Inoue, Tadashi] Hiroshima Shudo Univ, Hiroshima, Japan; [Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, Kangweon, South Korea",Yonsei University; Kangwon National University,"Huh, HS (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Recent trade models with heterogeneous firms predict that the export decision of firms is affected by sunk entry costs in foreign markets, with only the most productive firms self-selecting into exports. We test a latent variable model of the export decision by probit regressions and standard OLS panel regressions. Our results support the self-selection prediction. The process further appears to be conditioned by scale effects, market structure and multinational affiliation. Regarding alternative explanations, we do not find evidence for the learning-by-exporting hypothesis, even when controlling for the firm's distance to the international productivity frontier.","[Kox, Henk L.

This paper tests for hysteresis of unemployment for 29 OECD countries through the use of a new nonlinear panel unit root test developed by Ucar and Omay (2009). The test examines the joint null hypothesis of linearity and a unit root against the alternative hypothesis of nonlinear stationarity. Large power gains are achieved by both combining cross-sectional information with nonlinearities in the data. In addition, after the unit root null being rejected, we use a sequential panel selection method suggested by Chortareas and Kapetanios (2009) to classify the whole panel into a group of stationary countries and a group of non-stationary countries. The empirical findings show that the nonlinear panel test gives strong evidence in favor of the natural rate hypothesis of unemployment for 23 of 29 OECD countries, in contrast to those obtained by Chang's (2002) linear panel test that 17 countries display evidence of stationary unemployment.

We find that NAFTA partner FDI in Mexico has increased since the inception of NAFTA above what is implied by other determinants of FDI and the global upward trend during this time.

Second, using the GMM estimation technique, it is found that undervaluation of the Pak-rupee has improved output growth in Pakistan and this result is robust to alternative growth equation specifications.

For this purpose we construct, for any given propositional language, a canonical state space such that each proposition a of the language is associated with a unique event A defined on this state space. As our main result we establish a one-one onto correspondence between the canonical state space and the set of all truth conditions for the propositional logic such that proposition a is exactly true at every truth condition that corresponds to some state in A.

In particular, if matching is completely random, spite is stable, and a positive degree of assortativity is necessary for pure selfishness to be stable.

We implement a difference-in-differences methodology to construct appropriate counterfactuals for the covered provinces. Our findings suggest that both subsidy programs did lead to significant net increases in registered jobs in eligible provinces (5%-13% for the first program and 11%-15% for the second). However, the cost of the actual job creation was high because of substantial deadweight losses, particularly for the first program (47% and 78%). Because of better design features, the second subsidy program had lower, though still significant, deadweight losses (27%-46%). Although constrained by data availability, the evidence suggests that the dominant effect of subsidies was to increase social security registration of firms and workers rather than boosting total employment and economic activity. This supports the theory that in countries with weak enforcement institutions, high labor taxes on low-wage workers may lead to substantial incentives for firms and workers to operate informally.

The first, the eligibility condition, required that they remain on welfare for at least 12 months. The second, the qualification condition, required that they find a full-time job within 12 months after establishing eligibility. In this paper we focus on a neglected and important feature of the program, namely that the financial reward for becoming qualified is inversely related to the expected wage rate. Under very simple assumptions we show that those who have a low expected wage rate have a clear incentive to establish eligibility. Empirical non-parametric evidence strongly suggests that individuals self-select into eligibility. We jointly estimate a participation equation and a wage equation that are correlated through individual random effects.

In addition to illuminating the mechanism through which existing discrimination tends to be eliminated, we also consider the more difficult case of consumer discrimination.

In contrast, we find that entrepreneurs can correct the inefficiencies associated with this form of discrimination by influencing the costs and benefits associated with consumer discrimination.

Governments throughout the world, however, responded differently towards the regulation of M&A activities by adopting and enforcing merger control regimes with a varying degree of stringency. This article examines the impact of the electoral system on the governmental intervention on merger & acquisitions (M&A) activities. Empirical analyses of the data set that includes all M&A transactions from 1975 to 2006 suggest that countries with the majoritarian electoral system are more likely to not only adopt stringent merger control laws but also to disapprove the proposed deals than countries with the proportional electoral system. This finding confirms that merger control policies are indeed vulnerable to political influence and provides a support to recent works that link majoritarian systems with pro-competitive regulatory policies.","Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Kim, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",dhkim71@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,68,6,7,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2010,63.0,3,,,,,432,449,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00481.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,626AV,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279939000006,0

If the demands can be satisfied, they are; otherwise, neither player receives any money. This game has many pure-strategy equilibria. This paper characterizes mixed-strategy equilibria. The condition critical for an equilibrium is that players' sets of possible demands be balanced. Two sets of demands are balanced if each demand in one set can be matched with a demand in the other set such that they sum to one. For Nash's original game, a complete characterization is given of the equilibria in which both players' expected payoffs are strictly positive.

Three key messages come out of this analysis. First, there exists a core type of household that remained persistently poor over the period 1999-2005. These households were largely not members of the dominant ethnic group, land poor, lived in remote areas, and were headed by uneducated individuals, most commonly women. Second, in addition to establishing the existence of persistent differences in poverty across groups, relative differences in returns to education, land and remoteness underscore the existence of differences within groups, as one characteristic affects the returns to another. Third, persistent differences in groupwise poverty are associated with multiple different identities, some of which are offsetting and some of which are reinforcing. For example, women's higher education tends to offset the disadvantages associated with being a head of household, while remoteness compounds the disadvantages associated with living in female-headed households.","[Stifel, David] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Forster, Felix] NERA Econ Consulting, New York, NY USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",Lafayette College; Cornell University,"Stifel, D (通讯作者)，Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",stifeld@lafayette.edu,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",,,,,28,3,5,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Overall, the results show that fiscal shocks matter not only for aggregate variables but also for the sectoral composition of output. The sectoral output results are consistent with previous work concerning the impact of fiscal shocks on the real exchange rate and the relative price of nontradables.","[Lane, Philip R.] CEPR, London, England; [Benetrix, Agustin S.; Lane, Philip R.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ & IIIS, Dublin, Ireland",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Trinity College Dublin,"Lane, PR (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",benetria@tcd.ie; plane@tcd.ie,,"Benetrix, Agustin/0000-0002-6377-7509",,,,,35,29,30,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We estimate a production function using a population-based dataset composed by all active hospitals in an Italian region during the period 1998-2007. We show that cream skimming and upcoding have a negative impact on hospitals' technical efficiency, while readmissions have a positive effect. Moreover, the results indicate that private hospitals engage more in cream skimming than public and not-for-profit ones, while we observe no ownership differences regarding upcoding. Not-for-profit hospitals have the highest readmission index. Last, not-for-profit and public hospitals have the same efficiency levels, while private hospitals have the lowest technical efficiency.

In particular we give an alternative explanation to the Cabral and Mata (2003) finding. In that paper they show that the distribution of surviving firms tends to the log-normal distribution. As an explanation they consider the small-firms selection argument and introduce the financial constraint model. We give an alternative explanation based on a sample selection bias argumentation. In other terms, a cohort of surviving firms may have a positive average rate of growth. This simple fact breaks the assumptions needed in order to have an asymptotic Pareto FSD. Furthermore, we show how a simple modification of a well-known multiplicative process of firms' growth, taking into account common and idiosyncratic elements, may reconcile an old aggregate-sector puzzle (Quandt, 1966) on firms' size distribution reported in the literature. The paper shows the possibility to have aggregate Pareto distributed FSD and non-Pareto distributed sectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

Economic data confirm that the key structural imbalance problems, such as overinvestment, large current account surpluses, low consumption share of GDP and income inequality, have all deteriorated over the past few years, despite continuous policy efforts to correct these problems. We argue that the key determining factor is repressed factor cost, which is associated with heavily distorted markets for labor, capital, land, resources and the environment. These are like implicit subsidies for producers, investors and exporters. They boost growth and, at the same time, lift investment and exports. Previous policy efforts have focused more on administrative measures, which have not been sustainable. Therefore, a more fundamental solution to the imbalance problem lies in completing market-oriented reforms for production factors and allowing free markets to determine prices of labor, capital, land and resources.","[Huang, Yiping; Wang, Bijun] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Huang, YP (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yhuang@ccer.edu.cn; wangbijun007@126.com,"Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023","Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053",,,,,18,27,28,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2010,18.0,4,,,SI,,1,17,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01201.x,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,625MQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279899800001,0

We would logically predict that a high degree of flexibility characterizes changes in labor markets there. Contrary to expectations however, employment protection legislation (EPL) has been solidly established. It has brought these countries closer to European standards and, on some points, offers more protection than what is provided elsewhere in the EU. Counterbalancing this apparent employment security are exonerations and circumventions that grant de facto an informal flexibility to employers. This particularity of Baltic labor markets - security and flexibility - could have served to develop flexicurity. However the 2008 recession, with its negative impact on equilibria and equality, has provided Baltic leaders and employers with the possibility of reinforcing flexibility, a trend assumed and legitimated owing to the current emergency.",,,,celine.bayou@dila.gouv.fr,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,5,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

It first explores the implications of the global economic downturn of 2008-9 for environmental policies, focusing in particular on the example of action against climate change. The arguments for and against activist fiscal policies in general are then reviewed, and the case made that a demand-induced downturn provides a very good opportunity to undertake a necessary step change in the public spending component of environmental policies and to start working through a backlog of public investment to improve the environment. Fiscal policy should be used to improve the allocation of resources across time and space. Recent fiscal stimuli are considered in the light of this discussion. It is also argued that there is little cause to delay the introduction of price signals to internalize environmental externalities. But the levels at which such signals should be set requires careful analysis; changes over the business cycle may be warranted, depending on the nature of the environmental externality and the cause(s) of the business cycle in question.","[Bowen, Alex; Stern, Nicholas] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bowen, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",a.bowen1@lse.ac.uk; n.stern@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,78,46,48,3,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We consider two shareholders and two firms: one firm is jointly owned by the two shareholders and the other is owned by a single shareholder Labor is unionized and the firms produce substitute products. We show that partial ownership increases the bargaining strength of the firm owned by a single shareholder; although this firm pays lower wages produces less output than the other firm. Compared with the case in which each firm is owned by a single shareholder, partial ownership reduces the wage paid by firms, the output of industry and therefore employment. Whether firms obtain greater or lower profit depends on the degree to which goods are substitutes. In fact, we obtain the surprising result that when the degree to which goods are substitutes is low enough, the firm that is owned by a single shareholder makes more profit than the other firm.","[Carlos Barcena-Ruiz, Juan; Luz Campo, Maria] Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Bárcena-Ruiz, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",juancarlos.barcena@ehu.es; mluz.campo@ehu.es,"Campo, Maria Luz/N-4337-2014; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/G-6104-2011","Campo, Maria Luz/0000-0002-8240-605X; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8808-2543",,,,,22,0,0,0,10,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0304-2758,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

The debate was largely due to the primary conclusion of the Coleman Report that school inputs (other than student demographics) explain little, if any, of the variance in student performance, with the implication that more money was not the solution to educational problems. While the methodology and the conclusions of the Coleman Report have been criticised in the 40 years since its publication, the fundamental question of the magnitude and extent of the consequences of educational inequalities has relevance to the South African situation. Utilising a cross-sectional data set drawn from three universities, and the theoretical framework of an education production function, this paper addresses the issue of whether, over a decade after the first democratic elections in South Africa, black, Indian and coloured students studying Introductory Microeconomics, have benefited academically from attending historically advantaged (i.e. white) universities (HAU) relative to their counterparts who are attending historically disadvantaged universities (HDU).","Durban Univ Technol, Dept Publ Management & Econ, Durban, South Africa",Durban University of Technology,"Parker, KM (通讯作者)，Durban Univ Technol, Dept Publ Management & Econ, Durban, South Africa.",koo@dut.ac.za,,"Parker, Kudayja Mahommed/0000-0002-9321-1581",,,,,18,3,3,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The behavior of output following these more exogenous changes indicates that tax increases are highly contractionary.

We show that establishing truthful upward communication raises the cost of inducing managerial effort compared with stand-alone firms. This effect dominates a positive effect on effort driven by competition for the firm's resources. We derive predictions about optimal firm scope and structure. In particular, we show why it is optimal to separate the tasks of allocating resources and running a division.

The present paper estimates the marginal effect of China changing its holdings of foreign reserves on the value of the US dollar in Europe and Asia. Because using traditional techniques to find this estimate would be inappropriate due to severe problems resulting from omitted variables, the present paper uses a new approach, bidirectional-reiterative truncated projected least squares, that has been proven to minimize problems associated with omitted variables. It is found that if China would sell 1 percent of its foreign reserves, then the value of the US dollar would fall by 0.44 percent. With such a large effect, China has an incentive to either not sell any of its US dollar reserves or sell all of its US dollar reserves.","[Leightner, Jonathan E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Hopkins Nanjing Ctr, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Leightner, Jonathan E.] Augusta State Univ, Augusta, GA USA",University System of Georgia; Augusta University,"Leightner, JE (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Hopkins Nanjing Ctr, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",jleightn@aug.edu,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2010,18.0,3,,,,,24,39,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01194.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,597ZO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277801400002,0

We show that it is immaterial whether one uses seemingly traded goods, nontraded goods, or even a single, unimportant consumer good, say beer. The ease of attributing the variation to any such deviations is explained using a model with intermediate goods trade. In the model, the stage of production determines the traded/nontraded distinction. We find empirical substantiation for the model: law of one price deviations lose explanatory power and, defined appropriately in terms of intermediate goods, relative prices matter.","[Popper, Helen] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Parsley, David] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA",Santa Clara University; Vanderbilt University,"Popper, H (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",hpopper@scu.edu,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Using multiple responses on risky income gambles in the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), I investigate the effect of individual risk tolerance on the probability of entry into self-employment. I construct a measure of individual level of risk tolerance that is corrected for reporting error and that varies with age and other covariates that potentially affect self-employment decision. I find that risk tolerance is an important determinant of the decision to enter self-employment. However, I find that the estimated effect of risk tolerance on the probability of entering self-employment is dramatically understated if measurement error is not taken into account. In addition, I find that that accounting for the correlation between risk tolerance and other covariates is important to correctly assess the effects of the other determinants of self-employment while it has a trivial effect on the estimated marginal effect of risk tolerance.

This paper argues that common concerns regarding the effects of patents on prices and on research incentives of pharmaceutical multinationals are misplaced. Rather, the most significant effects are likely to concern access to patented drugs in poor countries. Because prices in developing countries are much lower than in the developed world, multinationals may choose to enter such markets with a delay, or not at all, implying a complete loss of access to patented drugs in developing countries. Even when multinationals enter countries like India, their marketing and distribution networks are not currently built out, leading to limited access within the country. Such considerations may provide a justification for policies targeting access in the short and medium run, such as compulsory licensing.

Agents may invest in environmental care, depending on how much they expect to live. In turn, environmental conditions affect life expectancy. As a result, our model produces a positive correlation between longevity and environmental quality, both in the long-run and along the transition path. Eventually, multiple equilibria may also arise: some countries might be caught in a low-life-expectancy/low-environmental-quality trap. This outcome is consistent with stylized facts relating life expectancy and environmental performance measures. We also discuss the welfare and policy implications of the inter-generational externalities generated by individual choices. Finally, we show that our results are robust to the introduction of growth dynamics based on physical or human capital accumulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Firms are not necessarily symmetric in their R&D abilities; some may have an advantage in early stages of the R&D process while others may have advantages in other stages of the process. This paper uses a two-firm asymmetric-ability multistage R&D race model to analyze the effect of patents, imitations and licensing arrangements on the speed of innovation, firm value and consumers' surplus. By using numerical analyses to study the MPE of the R&D race, the paper demonstrates the circumstances under which a weak patent protection regime, that facilitates free imitation of any intermediate technology, may yield a higher consumers' surplus and total surplus than a regime that awards a patent for the final innovation. The advantage of imitation may hold even when we allow for voluntary licensing of intermediate technologies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

When the parameters of the model are calibrated to match the distribution of income in terms of the wage/wealth ratio, the redistributive effect dominates, and agents with a high wage/wealth ratio would experience a large loss in utility if capital income taxes were eliminated.","[Garcia-Mila, Teresa] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CEPR, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Garcia-Milà, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Garcia-Mila, Teresa/C-4856-2013; Marcet, Albert/ABE-7882-2020; Ventura Colera, Eva/D-6732-2013","Garcia-Mila, Teresa/0000-0003-4268-8571; Ventura Colera, Eva/0000-0002-9116-4005; Marcet, Albert/0000-0003-1042-5240",,,,,27,16,15,0,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

This paper endeavours to develop an alternative way of explaining the institutional discrimination against migrants by studying workers' job mobility rates in three cities: Beijing, WuXi and Zhuhai. Migrants are commonly perceived to have high occupational mobility; however, Cox proportional hazards regressions in this paper show a different picture. Institutional discrimination reduces the number of jobs available to the migrants, increases their job search costs and the cost of losing jobs. Even though migrants take jobs unacceptable to local residents, the effects of this institutional discrimination still constrain migrants in changing jobs. The regressions show that temporary migrants have longer job durations and shorter unemployment durations than local people or permanent migrants. Moreover, migrants start to change jobs more often only after they have stayed in the city for some time and have accumulated enough assets to be able to survive when unemployed.

Thanks to a unique institutional setting and an unusually rich data set, I directly control for trade costs, which - despite their importance - cannot account for the observed segmentation of local markets at current prices.

In the absence of other uninsurable uncertainties (e.g., income), there will be no residual purchases or sales of annuities later in life, thereby avoiding any adverse-selection. In contrast, the presence of such uncertainties creates an active residual annuity market based on the arrival of new information. We characterize the equilibrium in the residual annuity market and propose a new financial instrument, refundable annuities with a guaranteed refund price, which enables individuals who hold a portfolio of such annuities to better adjust their optimum consumption plan to different realizations. Refundable annuities are shown to be equivalent to annuity options, that is, options that, if exercised, enable the purchase of annuities later in life at a predetermined price. Holding a variety of refundable annuities is (ex ante) welfare enhancing.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Sheshinski, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",mseytan@pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,9,6,6,4,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Although empirical studies suggest male-female differences in work attitudes have a part in these facts, this aspect is often overlooked in economic theory. In this paper, we propose an employment relationship model to capture the role of work attitudes. We consider agents exhibiting self-esteem motives which may represent a source of non pecuniary work motivation. Depending on the optimal contract, an agent develops such a motivation or not. We rely on this model to offer an explanation of observed disparities.

For this purpose we've developed a two-country model with an exogenous foreign sector following the New Open Economy Macroeconomics (NOEM) paradigm. The main features of the NOEM are nominal rigidities and market imperfections which provide influential role for monetary policy (for more details see Lane [4]). The model assumes optimizing households and monopolistically competitive firms, monetary policy conducted according to a Taylor rule, complete international financial market and competitive labour market. The sticky price setting of producers presents nominal rigidities in the model. The need for exogenous foreign sector is given by the membership of both countries in the EU.

Productivity dispersion between firms and countries has motivated the improved measurement of firm organization across industries and countries. There appears to be substantial variation in management practices and decentralization not only between countries, but also especially within countries. Much of the poorer average management quality in countries like Brazil and India seems to result from a long tail of poorly managed firms, which barely exist in the United States. Some stylized facts include the following: (a) Competition seems to foster improved management and decentralization; (b) larger firms, skill-intensive plants and foreign multinationals appear better managed and are more decentralized; (c) firms that are both family owned and managed appear to have worse management and are more centralized; and (d) firms facing an environment of lighter labor market regulations and more human capital specialize relatively more in people management.

This article, investigates how the central bank of China managed the rapid build-up of international reserves in 2003 and 2004. The relationship between real international reserves and real domestic credit is examined with a Vector Error Correction Model, estimated on monthly data from January 1997 to March 2006. Empirical results show that this relationship was negative, which suggests that the central bank succeeded in slowing down real domestic credit when real international reserves increased.

An empirical research on students' population has been applied in our work in order to identify, their attitudes towards marriage, family and children. The results point to students' positive attitudes and the fact that these attitudes reflect their family structure and their provenience (urban, rural).

The operational adjustment burdens in the European Monetary System were asymmetrically distributed, however, in particular between Germany and the other member countries. The emulation of such an asymmetric system in East Asia is not likely to be sustainable, due to the much lower support for regional integration there than was the case in Europe. For a future Asian Monetary System to be sustainable, it should be designed in such a way as to promote symmetry in the adjustment burdens arising from its operation. To this end, it may be desirable for the Asian Monetary System to employ an exchange rate and intervention mechanism that levies adjustment burdens largely on participant currencies deviating substantially from the average member currency movements. This mechanism should also be constructed in such a way that each currency's probability of identification as a deviant currency is similar.","Inst Monetary & Econ Res, Bank Korea, Seoul, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Chey, HK (通讯作者)，Inst Monetary & Econ Res, Bank Korea, Seoul, South Korea.",hkchey@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,69,1,1,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The paper focuses on indicators specific to low-income countries, such as the quality of policies and institutions, the special access to official external financing, and the role of shocks. In addition to more standard factors, we find that domestic financial liberalization is associated with higher current account balances and net foreign asset positions, whereas capital account liberalization is associated with lower current account balances and net foreign asset positions and with more appreciated real exchange rates. Negative exogenous shocks tend to raise (reduce) the current account in countries with closed (opened) capital accounts. Finally, foreign aid is progressively absorbed over time through net imports and is associated with a more depreciated real exchange rate in the long run.","[Christiansen, Lone; Prati, Alessandro; Ricci, Luca Antonio; Tressel, Thierry] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,,,,,,,,,88,7,7,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",1932-8796,,978-0-226-70749-5,NBER INT SEM MAC,,,2010,6.0,,,,,,265,+,,,,,,68,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQH63,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281026600007,0

In this paper we utilize an eleven year panel of 26 transition countries to identify short term effects of structural policies that are large and significant A ten percent change in the quality of structural policies (or the Rule of Law) towards OECD standards is shown to raise annual growth by about 2.5%. To control for endogeneity, we develop an instrument using the hierarchy of institutions hypothesis and find that it holds a robust explanatory power.

Two distinct features have attracted particular attention, namely growing consolidation of the downstream industries and serious farm fragmentation. Consequently, in the debate numerous concerns have been expressed that the sector's restructuring has been proceeding, so to speak, at farmers' expense. Most frequently farmers' relatively weak bargaining position, compared with that of processors and retailers, has been blamed for this state of affairs. Up to now, however, no convincing evidence has been provided that these arguments really hold. This article aims at verifying the above view by examining the mechanism of price transmission. To put the problem in a theoretically consistent, structural equation setting, an approach using exogenous demand and supply shifters is followed. The analysis is couched in a vector error correction model framework. The results suggest that price transmission between farm and retail levels is affected by both short-run and long-run asymmetries. Moreover, behaviour of prices in the fluid milk sector in Poland is consistent with the use of market power by the downstream sector.","Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Falkowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020","Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342",,,,,54,31,36,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,4,,,,,513,529,PII 929160218,10.1080/14631377.2010.518477,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,676AU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283883300006,0

The option pricing literature in finance has been extended to study the risks and pricing of mortgages and MBS in the USA over the last three decades. However, given the robust and rapid growth of emerging mortgage and mortgage-related capital markets, there is surprisingly little known about to what extent the option pricing theory can be applied to the emerging mortgage and MBS markets in the global arena.

The existence of common housing cycles among the countries of the euro zone could lead the European Central Bank to integrate more specifically the evolution of such asset prices in its assessment. In this paper, we implement a multivariate unobserved component model on housing market variables in order to assess the common euro area housing cycle and to evaluate its relationship with the economic cycle. Among the general class of multivariate unobserved component models, we implement the band-pass filter based on the trend plus cycle decomposition model and we allow the existence of two cycles of different periods. The dataset consists of gross domestic product and real house prices series for four main curo area countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Empirical results show a strong relationship for business cycles in France, Italy and Spain. Moreover, French and Spanish house prices cycles appear to be strongly related, while the German one possesses its own dynamics. Finally, we find that GDP and house prices cycles arc related in the medium-term for fluctuations between 4 and 8 years, while the housing market contributes to the long-term economic growth only in Spain and Germany.","[Ferrara, Laurent] Banque France, Directorate Business Condit & Macroecon Forecasti, Paris, France; [Koopman, Siem Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Ferrara, L (通讯作者)，Banque France, Directorate Business Condit & Macroecon Forecasti, Paris, France.",laurent.ferrara@banque-france.fr; s.j.koopman@feweb.vu.nl,"Koopman, S.J./M-7814-2019","Koopman, S.J./0000-0002-4440-9524",,,,,29,4,5,0,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-15339-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,105,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_6,0.0,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS93,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300025200006,0

In addition to that, there is a significant lack of cross-border transmission capacity. Combining both facts justifies the assumption that these dominant players are able to influence the market outcome of an internal European energy market due to strategic behavior. In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation in order to solve a Stackelberg game for a network-constrained energy market using integer programming. The strategic player is the Stackelberg leader and the independent system operator (including the decisions of the competitive fringe firms) acts as follower. We assume that there is one strategic player which results in a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). This MPEC is reformulated as mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by using disjunctive constraints and linearization.

In the present paper a study about sustainable management of tourism in national parks is presented. A case study approach is applied to coastal national parks (NP) in Venezuela. Tourism can contribute to the sustainability of national parks but currently it is their main cause of environmental impact. The Government of Venezuela and its natural park managers are therefore looking for new sustainable tourism development strategies. To help managers in making decisions about NP sustainability a new multicriteria approach based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP) technique is proposed. ANP provides a more realistic approach for modelling complex situations such as decision making for sustainable tourism management because ANP allows the general study of the quantitative and qualitative explanatory variables and the incorporation of feedback and interdependence relationships among variables. A case study has been carried out with the help of two experts closely related to the 12 coastal NP analyzed and 8 stakeholders of Los Roques national park who provided most of the information needed.,"[Garcia-Melon, Monica; Gomez-Navarro, Tomas] Univ Politecn Valencia, Projects Engn Dept, Valencia 46020, Spain; [Acuna-Dutra, Silvia] Univ Metropolitana Caracas, Dept Environm Studies, Caracas 76819, Venezuela",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"García-Melón, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Projects Engn Dept, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46020, Spain.",mgarciam@dpi.upv.es; tgomez@dpi.upv.es; sacuna@unimet.edu.ve,"García-Melón, Mónica/L-5200-2014; Navarro, Tomás Gómez/I-5792-2014","García-Melón, Mónica/0000-0001-8101-4049; Navarro, Tomás Gómez/0000-0001-6114-2414",,,,,37,15,15,2,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The attractiveness of separation is understandable due to the problems regulators often experience when regulating a monopoly that is vertically integrated into competitive markets, but separation in practice rarely if ever lives up to its promises. We examine experiences with business separation in the United States to draw lessons about its effects. We consider the separation of local and long distance, separation between telecommunications and information services, and separation between wholesale networks and retail services. These experiences show that business separation lowers efficiency and delays innovation, that adapting separation rules to an ever changing industry is costly and creates controversies, that rivals try to gain strategic advantage through the regulatory process, and that behavioral rules can be more effective in facilitating competition and innovation than structural rules.","[Jamison, Mark A.; Sichter, James] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Jamison, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jamisoma@ufl.edu; jsichter@everestkc.net,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We identify the sources of CEE's advantages over competing exporters, such as India, China and Brazil, using disaggregated data on service exports and a novel estimation technique for the gravity equation. Our results indicate that the importance of geographical distance varies substantially across types of service exports. Geography is important for exports of construction services, but it has a negligible impact on computer-related services. However, the relative quality of legal institutions influences trade across a broad range of service categories. The results demonstrate that aggregating services that are not homogeneous could conceal important differences in the effects of geographical distance and other variables on the pattern of service trade.","[Kandilov, Ivan T.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Grennes, Thomas] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Kandilov, IT (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",ivan_kandilov@ncsu.edu; tom_grennes@ncsu.edu,,"Kandilov, Ivan/0000-0002-0761-8095",,,,,43,15,18,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The extent of undeclared work is not reflected in official statistics, thus measurement of change in the officially registered level of unemployment might produce the image of unemployment as an economic and social issue, which fails to represent reality. The article addresses the issue pertaining to ambiguous treatment of the concept undeclared work in scientific and special researches, analyses cases when the concept is treated as identical to other employment and unemployment ideas, and explores quantitative assessment aspects of undeclared work. Scientific literature and applied research uses different terminology while describing undeclared work (namely, undeclared work, illegal work and hidden unemployment) and provides various definitions. The chosen concept of undeclared work (as a structural part of shadow economy) depends on objectives of a research as well as the concept of shadow economy. In this article, the concept of the shadow economy contains economic activities undertaken in spite of legislative requirements and restrictions even though such activities are subject to rigorous regulation and control (Krumplyte 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2010). In this research, undeclared work is considered in the context of tax non-compliance, disassociating from economic activities attributable to unregulated economy (self-employed natural persons, legally not required to register their activity and pay taxes) as well as criminal activities. This article defines the undeclared work as an economic activity (comprising labour relations in enterprises as well as self-employed), which is carried out in violation of legislative requirements with the purpose of tax non-compliance. Phenomena of undeclared work may be classified into tax avoidance and tax evasion categories. Tax avoidance is perceived as reduction or nonpayment of payable taxes in the form of reduction or elimination of tax base of a certain tax with the help of artificially created business schemes or sequences of transactions Tax evasion is attributed to the group of the most serious offences, i.e. tax non-compliance in the form of concealed economic activity (Krumplyte, 2009b, 2009c). Under the given context, a classification of undeclared work phenomena in Lithuania was designed in the course of the empiric research. Evaluating the trends of undeclared work in a complex manner, the authors suggest identifying indicators pertaining to distribution of each phenomenon and the extent of formally undocumented income. The distribution indicator of a phenomenon indicates a portion of economic operators who were involved in a certain economic activity and participated in shadow economy. The indicator showing the extent of officially undocumented income indicates the portion of income within a certain type of total income per one economic operator, not included into official accounting documents. The article offers the results of the empiric research (delivered following the peer review method) on distribution of undeclared work phenomena in Lithuania and trends (of the periods 2006-2008 and 2009-2011) pertaining to the extent of undeclared income (employment income and earnings received from self-employment).","[Krumplyte, Jolita; Samulevicius, Jurgis] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Krumplyte, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jolitakrumplyte@gmail.com; jurgis.samulevicius@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,75,10,10,2,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, there is little empirical evidence on the foreign currency exposures that are embedded in international balance sheets. Using a new database, we provide stylized facts concerning the cross-country and time-series variation in aggregate foreign currency exposure and its various subcomponents. In panel estimation, we find that richer, more open economies take longer foreign-currency positions. in addition, we find that an increase in the propensity for a currency to depreciate during bad times is associated with a longer position in foreign currencies, providing a hedge against domestic output fluctuations. We view these new stylized facts as informative in their own right and also potentially useful to the burgeoning theoretical literature on the macroeconomics of international portfolios.

On average, workers at construction sites face double the chance of non-fatal accidents at work compared with workers from other EU sectors. With a view to reducing the number of accidents and occupational illnesses in the construction sector, numerous legal acts have been passed and consistently implemented within recent decades, which allowed improving work conditions in the EU member countries. Although EU legal acts apply in Lithuania, the increase in accidents at work in the construction sector is reflected in the statistics. To prevent accidents at work and occupational illnesses, as well as increase work productivity and job satisfaction, the implementation of measures ensuring safe work at construction sites becomes a necessity. Work safety in various construction processes can be achieved not only by making use of collective and personal protective equipment, occupational risk assessment, employee instruction and training on safety at work, but also by properly organizing work and creating proper working conditions. In order to ensure safe work for construction workers, knowledge and application of standard legal acts is necessary.","[Liaudanskiene, Rita; Varnas, Nerijus] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44043 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ustinovichius, Leonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Liaudanskiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44043 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rita2290@gmail.com; n.varnas@ktu.lt; leonasu@vgtu.lt,"Ustinovičius, Leonas/AAH-8369-2020","Ustinovicius, Leonas/0000-0002-0027-5501",,,,,33,12,12,0,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We then estimate the asymmetric error-correction specification utilizing the Momentum Threshold Autoregressive Consistent (M-TAR-C) approach particularly proposed by Enders and Siklos (2001). We find that, for the daily data over 2 January 2001 through 15 October 2006, the petroleum futures prices are cointegrated with the spot prices. This effectively confirms the expectations hypothesis and that asymmetric adjustments for the futures basis towards the long-run value display a negative basis from the long-run equilibrium level more persistently than a positive basis from that level. The empirical result suggests that short-run arbitrages manipulating buy-long (sell-short) futures contracts be profitable when a positive basis is weakening (a negative basis is strengthening).","[Lin, Jeng Bau; Liang, Chin Chia] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung 402, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Liang, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Business Adm, 250 Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",d9323003@mail.nchu.edu.tw,,,,,,,43,10,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We contrast this with DCEs that have a long-standing, well-tested theoretical basis in random utility theory, and we show why and how DCEs are more general and consistent with economic demand theory.

Nonconvexities are associated with detrimental producible public commodities but not with nonproducible public commodities in Boyd and Conley (1997) [7]. Disposability properties (costly or costless) imply that producible public commodities are either by-products (e.g., pollution) or joint-products (e.g., national defense). Markets fail for both beneficial and detrimental by-products. Nonconvexities imply that price-based equilibria, e.g., Pigovian tax equilibrium, may not be Pareto-efficient.

The proposed approach allows the calculation of both efficiency and technical changes, for economic agents operating under different technologies. Moreover, it also enables the computation of changes in the technological gap between regional and global frontier technologies. The proposed index is employed in measuring productivity growth and its decomposed components in 46 countries between 1993 and 2003. The main finding is that Europe has taken the lead in the world frontier technology and that Asia has attempted to move towards the frontier technology.

The FUGI global model M200 classifies the world into 200 countries/regions where each national/regional model is globally interdependent. Each national/regional model has nine subsystems as population, foods, energy, environment, economic development, peace and security, human right, healthcare and quality of life (IT revolution). This is a super complex dynamic system model using integrated multidisciplinary systems analysis where number of structural equations is over 170,000. Economic model as a core includes major economic variables such as production of GDP. employment, expenditures of GDP, income distribution, prices, money, interest rates and financial assets, government finance, international balance of payments, international finance, foreign exchange rates and development indicators. The purpose of this article is twofold, namely to provide information on a new frontier science of economics: global model simulation as well as appropriate policy exercise for sustainable development of the interdependent global economy. The world economy is facing green energy revolution to change from fossil to create alternative energy and energy saving technology against sky rocketing higher oil prices. Japan takes a lead in this field of technology innovation. Under such circumstances, Japan should take an initiative to create a new peaceful world through not only harmonized adjustments of Japanese economic policy but also wise cosmic mind to promote human solidarity with the ever changing nature will be desirable to adjust orbit of the fluctuated global economy. Japan should challenge for a new strategy to accelerate economic growth rates by CO(2) reducing environment investment based on technology innovations. (C) 2009 Society for Policy Modeling.

Previous studies estimating gasoline consumption per total passenger cars ignore the recent increase in the number of diesel cars in most European countries leading to biased elasticity estimates. We apply several common dynamic panel estimators to our small sample. Results show that specifications neglecting the share of diesel cars overestimate short-run income, price and car ownership elasticities.

For this purpose, data were collected on the number of times that articles published in these journals are cited in international journals on the ISI Journals lists. The study focused on the number and characteristics of the citations received during the period 1996 to 2004 by articles published between 1995 and 1999 in a limited number of Spanish, Italian, French and German journals. The international impact of the Spanish journals was found to be similar in size and characteristics to that of Italian publications. However, it differed sharply from the impact of the highest-ranking French and German journals, which received considerably more citations. Moreover, restricting the group of citing journals to the 'blue ribbon journals', the highest-ranking publications in the economics sector, only the leading journals in Germany and France received a significant number of references.","[Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist & Inst Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Pons-Novell, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometria Estadist & Econ Espanyola, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Tirado-Fabregat, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Hist & Inst Econ, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",datirado@ub.edu,"Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A./Z-5854-2019","Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A./0000-0002-7717-2674",,,,,8,5,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In fact, the crisis has become an ordinary topic: the crisis of values, the crisis of role models, the crisis of resources, the financial crisis, failure of the economy. The specter of crisis has undoubtedly impacted upon the field of rural economy. Thus, the Romanian village, defined amongst others by its main activity: agriculture, was, is and seem destined for a perpetual crisis. The origins of the current situation are well-known: the beginning of the modern era coincided with a new way of distributing property that resulted in a polarization of the Romanian society and rural areas, which led to wide disparities. We are referring to the peasant issue, the issue of land and yield, as well as its manifestations: poor yield, poverty of the peasants, bloody uprisings such as the 1907 one. Furthermore, we also know the attempts that have been made to address this key issue of the Romanian society: the 1921 reform and its subsequent amendments. However, the issue persists and, at present, we are still discussing agriculture/village/rural in terms of crisis. Moreover, the effects of the centuries-long village crisis overlapped with the equally negative effects of the current financial-economic crisis. The situation is all the more so delicate since, at the outbreak of the crisis, we had already been talking about a crisis of resources, which is responsible amongst others for the onset of an acute food crisis.","[Popescu, Doris-Louise] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Popescu, DL (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania.",,"Popescu, Doris-Louise/IAQ-4204-2023",,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-987-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,528,533,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI7KE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000414298300073,0

The new candidate countries, at different levels of development, are Western Balkan countries and Turkey. The objective of the paper is to investigate the differences among the EU candidate countries according to the current measures of welfare/sustainability and to find their similarities and differences. This analysis of the differences and the similitude between candidate countries is done by using Multidimensional scaling method (MDS) and hierarchical cluster analysis of sustainability, which takes into account, at the same time, economic, health, standard of living, people and environmental variables, as part of the multivariate statistical analysis technique - one of the basic methods of multidimensional scaling. Furthermore, MDS method allows a standardized (transformed) analysis of the data collected in different scales. This study is based on the data standardized by means of Z score transformation.

However, most of the analysis has addressed aggregate performance at the institutional level, an approach inconsistent with recent policy emphasis on diversity among universities and one that ignores performance variations across disciplines. Using averaged and all available data for 2000-2004, cluster analysis is used to classify Australian Commerce Faculties into groups that exhibit similar research performance, measured by publication, PhD completion and secured competitive research grant funding. We also use factor analysis to generate full-multidimensional rankings within the resulting two or three clusters. It is found that in terms of total research output, with the exception of Adelaide all the Group of 8 (Go8) members plus University of Technology, Sydney and Griffith always belong to 'Clusters A'. However, when research performance is expressed in per academic staff terms, an additional 11 universities join this same cluster.

The way we model the market highlights the fact that prices are not solely determined from consumers' willingness to pay as in the monopolistic setting studied in the previous literature. In effect, equilibrium prices are determined endogenously, from the interaction of the distribution of consumers' valuations for high quality and the distribution of firms' reputations--the demand and the supply sides of the market, respectively. This paper shows that: (i) there is a steady-state distribution of reputations, a result that allows the study of a stationary equilibrium; (ii) there are parameter configurations for which the existence of a high-quality equilibrium is guaranteed, and where the incentives for high quality production in the repeated game depend on the shape of the price function; and (iii) the Walrasian-equilibrium price function depends on the shape of the steady-state distribution of reputations, and the assignment of consumers to firms with different reputation levels in such an equilibrium is positively assortative if quality is a normal good.",,,,,,"Vial, Bernardita/0000-0002-4649-6991",,,,,24,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This model, given by stochastic differential equation with cubic drift, is called the cusp within standard catastrophe theory. The closed-form solution of density for this process is known only in the stationary case and this density belongs to the class of generalized exponential distributions, which allows for skewness, different tail shapes and multiple equilibria. The transition density has to be approximated and for that purpose, the finite difference method is employed and then parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood principle. The finite difference method is often used for approximating partial differential equations, however the cubic drift is not handled sufficiently in current software, therefore own computational method is proposed and used. An empirical example deals with the crash known as Black Monday, where parameters of the drift are driven by market fundamentals.","[Vorisek, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, CZ-18675 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,vorisek@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,676,681,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900114,0

We examine the impact of increases in risk and changes in persistence in the ITC policy on investment behavior. Our results indicate that a temporary ITC (lower policy persistence) generally increases the variability of investment both in the short and the long-run. It lowers investment in the short-run and raises it in the long-run. Thus, perhaps surprisingly, a temporary ITC does not always lead to higher investment but always leads to more volatile investment. Policy-makers may thus face a long-run trade-off between the level and the volatility of investment. We also find that increases in risk defined in terms of mean-preserving spreads may lead to lower investment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The first part looks at how global macroeconomic trends-including sustained strong growth, low real interest rates, and high saving rates-provided an environment conducive to increased financial risk-taking. The second part examines macroeconomic policies and the international monetary system, assessing whether too easy monetary policy contributed to asset price bubbles, whether excessive reserve accumulation contributed to a glut of global savings, whether the US dollar's reserve currency status aggravated financial excesses, and whether policies in capital-importing countries were sufficiently countercyclical. We do not find a single factor that can explain the crisis and account for differences in countries' experiences leading up to it; instead, the contribution of macroeconomic policy choices seems complex and ambiguous. However, there are still important policy lessons for, in particular, rebalancing economies away from export-dominated growth and having monetary policy place greater weight on macrofinancial stability.","[Faruqee, Hamid; Scott, Alasdair; Tamirisa, Natalia] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Faruqee, H (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",AScott@imf.org,,"Scott, Alasdair/0000-0002-2957-9138",,,,,22,5,5,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

As a criterion for fairness we propose an inequality index, termed fairness ratio, the maximization of which produces Lorenz-undominated, Pareto-optimal allocations. The fairness ratio does not depend on the choice of any particular social welfare function, and hence it can be used for an a priori evaluation of any given feasible resource allocation. The fairness ratio for an allocation provides a bound on the discrepancy between this allocation and any other feasible allocation with respect to a large class of social welfare functions. We provide a simple representation of the fairness ratio as well as a general method that can be used to directly determine optimal fair allocations. For general convex environments, we provide a fundamental lower bound for the optimal fairness ratio and show that as the population size increases, the optimal fairness ratio decreases at most logarithmically in what we call the inhomogeneity of the problem. Our method yields a unique and balanced fair optimum for an important class of problems with linear budget constraints.","[Goel, Ashish; Weber, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Meyerson, Adam] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Comp Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Weber, TA (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ashishg@stanford.edu; awm@cs.ucla.edu; webert@stanford.edu,"Weber, Thomas A./C-3892-2018","Weber, Thomas A./0000-0003-2857-4754",,,,,59,8,10,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

From a methodological viewpoint, we address the critique on the Glaeser et al.

At the same time, by implementing an error-correction approach, we improve on previous dynamic specifications that do not allow for short-term fluctuations along the steady-state growth path. It turns out that long-run employment growth is positively influenced by specialization, with a smaller role played by urbanization externalities. These results are in line with the empirical findings of recent analysis based on firm-level TFP (total factor productivity) estimates, thus providing them with a valuable cross-validation, considering that TFP measurement is far from being undisputed, especially in the service sector.","[Micucci, Giacinto] Bank Italy, Econ Res Unit, I-60100 Ancona, Italy; [Di Giacinto, Valter] Bank Italy, Econ Res Unit, Laquila, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Micucci, G (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Res Unit, Piazza Kennedy 9, I-60100 Ancona, Italy.",giacinto.micucci@bancaditalia.it; digiacinto.valter@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,40,7,8,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

A simple general equilibrium model with the interest rate as the policy instrument,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DESIGN,,,English,Article,,,,,,General equilibrium; Inflation; Interest rates,RISK-AVERSION,"This paper analyses the connection between the assumptions often made on the utility functions of economic agents when general equilibrium is considered. Concretely, we analyse the effect of certain assumptions regarding the elasticity of marginal utility for both the existence of equilibrium and, assuming equilibrium exists, for the effect that raising the nominal interest rate has on the equilibrium inflation rate. Typical macroeconomic wisdom states that an increase in the interest rate will decrease inflation, and this seems to have been the basis for real-life macroeconomic policy in several countries. However, this wisdom is based on models in which the money supply, and not the interest rate, is the policy instrument. Using a very simple general equilibrium model of intertemporal consumption, this paper finds sufficient conditions for the negative relationship to hold (and for it not to hold) in the short run, when monetary policy is characterised by a given nominal interest rate.

The reformers suggest changing the design of the system by moving to fully funded defined contribution retirement plans. Others argue that the so-called demographic problems are being used as an excuse to privatize the system. But both sides spend almost all of their energy and time figuring out the timing of insolvency of the system and the validity of the assumptions made in each forecast. In contrast, the present study closely examines the changing macroeconomic dynamics of the system since the 1960s. The analysis shows that undermining of the system is caused not by demographic changes or financing mechanisms but by low wages and medical inflation.","Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Yasar, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,7,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The shared reward dilemma arises when the prisoner's dilemma is supplemented with a second stage in which a fixed reward is equally distributed among all cooperators. We first extend our previous results on the equilibrium structure of this game to the case of a one-shot game taking place on a regular network. Subsequently, we consider an evolutionary version of the game on both lattices and random networks. We show that the evolutionary game on graphs exhibits important differences with the case of well-mixed populations. In particular, there exists an important parameter range in which the cooperation is boosted and a single cooperator can invade a population of defectors. We study the dependence of the cooperation levels on the neighborhood size, finding that on random networks the level of cooperation reached decreases as the neighborhood size increases. Moreover, square lattices favor cooperation more than random networks, and on them cooperation may be almost full for certain parameter regions even for large neighborhood sizes. Further, we show that the effect of the population structure is never detrimental for cooperation. We interpret our results in terms of weak versus strong temptation and discuss the nontrivial issues involved in trying to promote cooperation exogenously by means of such a reward mechanism.","[Cuesta, Jose A.; Sanchez, Angel] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Matemat, GISC, Leganes, Spain; [Jimenez, Raul] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Lugo, Haydee] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Sanchez, Angel] Inst Ciencias Matemat CSIC UAM UC3M UCM, Madrid, Spain; [Sanchez, Angel] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Biocomputac & Fis Sistemas Complejos BIFI, Zaragoza, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas (ICMAT); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM); University of Zaragoza,"Sánchez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Matemat, GISC, Leganes, Spain.",raul.jimenez@uc3m.es; cuesta@math.uc3m.es; hlugo@eco.uc3m.es; anxo@math.uc3m.es,"Lugo, Haydee/AAA-4639-2019; Cuesta, Jose A/A-7157-2008; Cuesta, Jose A/Z-4696-2019; Sanchez, Angel/A-9229-2008; Jimenez, Raul/K-6438-2014","Lugo, Haydee/0000-0001-5971-2086; Cuesta, Jose A/0000-0001-9890-9367; Sanchez, Angel/0000-0003-1874-2881; Jimenez, Raul/0000-0002-8125-1586",,,,,22,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We find clear and strong evidence that the variables in the foregoing categories have an economically and statistically significant relationship with spreads. In particular, we find a major role for the tenns-of-trade volatility and the level of current account leverage in explaining spread variation.

The less-informed player has an incentive to delay her action in order to gain more information. The more-informed player also intends to delay her action, not through a desire to learn but rather to prevent the less-informed player from gaining information. Hence, if a waiting option is available, both players want to delay their actions and the conflict between the two types of second mover advantage yields a delay race. Although both players can benefit from a delay, the gain from a delay in order to learn is greater than that from a delay intended to prevent the other from learning. Therefore, the cost for a delay plays an important role in characterizing the equilibrium, and if the sequential timing of actions is derived in a pure equilibrium, the leader will be the more-informed player. If a given cost for a delay is sufficiently low, the only equilibrium is a mixed equilibrium. Interestingly, in that equilibrium, the existence of the first-mover advantage from being imitated is also derived.

The welfare ranking of symmetric multilateral subsidy games is shown to depend on whether or not investment levels are friendly, raising rival profits in total, and/or strategic complements, raising rival profits at the margin. In both Cournot and Bertrand competition, when spillovers are low and competition is intense (because goods are close substitutes), national-welfare-maximizing governments over-subsidize investment, and banning subsidies would improve welfare. When spillovers are high, national governments under-subsidize from a global welfare perspective, but the subsidy game is welfare superior to non-intervention.","[Neary, J.

The results from the numerical simulation of the model show significant welfare gains, provided that the policymaker is allowed to borrow and lend in order to smooth taxes across time instead of maintaining a balanced budget at all times.

This analysis is the first extensive study for this country. We construct a regional-level data set (for the 95 departements of metropolitan France) with measures of crimes as reported to the Ministry of Interior. To assess social conditions prevailing in the departement in that year, we construct measures of the share of unemployed as well as other social, economic, and demographic variables using multiple waves of the French Labor Survey. We estimate a classic Becker-type model in which unemployment is a measure of how potential criminals fare in the legitimate job market. First, our estimates show that in the cross-section dimension, crime and unemployment are positively associated. Second, we find that increases in youth unemployment induce increases in crime. Using the predicted industrial structure to instrument unemployment, we show that this effect is causal for burglaries, thefts, and drug offenses. To combat crime, it appears thus that all strategies designed to combat youth unemployment should be examined.

There is evidence that for school districts that employ (variants of) the so-called Boston mechanism the transition would lead to efficiency gains. The first two mechanisms are strategy-proof, but in practice student assignment procedures typically impede a student to submit a preference list that contains all his acceptable schools. We study the preference revelation game where students can only declare up to a fixed number of schools to be acceptable. We focus on the stability and efficiency of the Nash equilibrium outcomes. Our main results identify rather stringent necessary and sufficient conditions on the priorities to guarantee stability or efficiency of either of the two mechanisms. This stands in sharp contrast with the Boston mechanism which has been abandoned in many US school districts but nevertheless yields stable Nash equilibrium outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset retrieved from original financial reports of 32 Australasian banks (1980-2005). Credit losses rise when the macro economy is weak. Asset markets, particularly the equity market, are also important. Larger banks provide more for credit losses while banks with high cost-income-ratios show greater loan loss provisions. Strong loan growth translates into significantly higher credit losses with a lag of 2-4 years.

The Act conveys monetary inducements from the state to the exclusive licensee in exchange for certain performance requirements. The financing of any pipeline requires the contractual commitment from the shippers (producers) to pay to ship the gas over an extended period of time.

The inefficiency is decomposed into allocative and technical inefficiency based on standard production theory. Allocative inefficiency is measured by the deviation of actual investment from the theoretically desired investment demand. Institutional factors are then identified as part of the driving force of the deviation. The resulting model is applied to Chinese provincial panel data. The main findings are: Chinese investment demand is strongly receptive to expansionary fiscal policies and inter-provincial network effects: the tendency of over-investment remains, even with signs of increasing allocative efficiency and improving technical efficiency.

We develop a model in which product developers can play a useful role in monitoring the deployment of their technology abroad. The analysis demonstrates that when firms want to exploit technologies abroad, multinational firm (MNC) activity and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows arise endogenously when monitoring is nonverifiable and financial frictions exist. The mechanism generating MNC activity is not the risk of technological expropriation by local partners but the demands of external funders who require MNC participation to ensure value maximization by local entrepreneurs. The model demonstrates that weak investor protections limit the scale of MNC activity, increase the reliance on FDI flows, and alter the decision to deploy technology through FDI as opposed to arm's length technology transfers. Several distinctive predictions for the impact of weak investor protection on MNC activity and FDI flows are tested and confirmed using firm-level data.","[Antras, Pol] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Antràs, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,51,120,140,2,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Our method compares successful and unsuccessful applicants in a lottery used by Pakistan to allocate Hajj visas. Pilgrim accounts stress that the Hajj leads to a feeling of unity with fellow Muslims, but outsiders have sometimes feared that this could be accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. We find that participation in the Hajj increases observance of global Islamic practices, such as prayer and fasting, while decreasing participation in localized practices and beliefs, such as the use of amulets and dowry. It increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women, including greater acceptance of female education and employment. Increased unity within the Islamic world is not accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. Instead, Hajjis show increased belief in peace, and in equality and harmony among adherents of different religions. The evidence suggests that these changes are likely due to exposure to and interaction with Hajjis from around the world, rather than to a changed social role of pilgrims upon return.","[Clingingsmith, David] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Harvard University; Brookings Institution; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Clingingsmith, D (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,,,,,,,43,148,171,0,32,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

While a great deal of research has examined the efficiency consequences of adverse selection in health insurance markets, less attention has been devoted to other aspects of consumer choice. The nation of Switzerland offers a unique opportunity to study price competition in health insurance markets. Switzerland regulates health insurance markets with the aim of minimizing adverse selection and encouraging strong price competition. We examine consumer responses to price differences in local markets and the degree of price variation in local markets. Using both survey data and observations on local markets we obtain evidence suggesting that as the number of choices offered to individuals grows, their willingness to switch plans given a set of price dispersion differences declines, which allows large price differences for relatively homogeneous products to persist. We consider explanations for this phenomenon from economics and psychology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two analytical methods are used to analyse the age at which artists produce their best works-one based on year-of-birth cohorts of modern visual artists and the other on stylistic groups. The cohort-analysis shows that the career patterns develop similarly over time for artists working in the USA and Europe; over time the artists' peak ages first increase, reach their maximum for artists born between 1890 and 1909, and then decrease again. The study of stylistic groups shows that artists associated with Fauvism, the Nabis and Post-Impressionism experience an early peak, whereas artists associated with Surrealism, Impressionism, Abstract Expressionism, Art Informel, Pop Art, Expressionism and Cubism peak later in their careers.","Trin Coll, Coll Green, Dept Econ & Inst Int Integrat Studies IIIS, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Hellmanzik, C (通讯作者)，Trin Coll, Coll Green, Dept Econ & Inst Int Integrat Studies IIIS, Dublin 2, Ireland.",hellmanc@tcd.ie,,"Hellmanzik, Christiane/0000-0002-7013-4659",,,,,30,17,20,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Performance variables are identified by two dimensions, including selling performance and non-selling performance. The study identified three dimensional attributes of the government's supporting programs including 1) institutional factor, 2) policy implementation factor and 3) booth factor. Using multiple regression analyses, it was found that the institution factor and the booth factor have a positive effect on both the selling and non-selling performance of supported exhibitors, while the policy implementation factor does not have any effect on the selling or the non-selling performance. It was also found that both selling and non-selling performance have a positive effect on the overall satisfaction of participating in ITFs, but only the non-selling performance has a slight positive effect on the intention of re-participation in ITFs. Findings emerging from the study lead to policy and managerial implications for both governments and private enterprises, including the important finding that the responsibility of organizing exhibitors attending ITFs should be delegated to professional exhibition organizers (PEOs) for the best performance and highest return on a government's investment in export support programs.","[Kim, Bong-Seok; Kim, Chulwon; Kim, Dae-Kwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Convent Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Zhou, Yan] Kyung Hee Univ, Inst Convent & Exhibit Policy, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Kim, BS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Convent Management, Seoul, South Korea.",herz5@khu.ac.kr,"Kim, Bong-Seok/AAH-9256-2020; Kim, Chulwon/I-1742-2013","Kim, Bong-Seok/0000-0002-4117-0108",,,,,67,2,2,1,10,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Motivated by empirical evidence against EU theory, we study the possibility of agreeing to disagree within the framework of Choquet expected utility (= CEU) theory which generalizes EU theory by allowing for ambiguous beliefs. As our first main contribution, we show that people may well agree to disagree if their Bayesian updating of ambiguous beliefs is psychologically biased in our sense. Remarkably, this finding holds regardless of whether people with identical priors apply the same psychologically biased Bayesian update rule or not. As our second main contribution, we develop a formal model of Bayesian learning under ambiguity. As a key feature of our approach the posterior subjective beliefs do, in general, not converge to true probabilities which is in line with psychological evidence against converging learning behavior. This finding thus formally establishes that CEU decision makers may even agree to disagree in the long-run despite the fact that they always received the same information. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For each country, the analysis proceeds in two steps. First, modifying the procedure of Kilian I Kilian, L, (forthcoming). Not All Oil Price Shocks are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market. American Economic Review. 1, we employ a vector error-correction or vector autoregressive model to decompose oil-price changes into three components: oil-supply shocks, global aggregate-demand shocks, and global oil-demand shocks. The last component relates to specific idiosyncratic features of the oil market, such as changes in the precautionary demand concerning the uncertainty about the availability of future oil supplies. Second, recovering the oil-supply shocks, global aggregate-demand shocks, and global oil-demand shocks from the first analysis, we then employ a vector autoregressive model to determine the effects of these structural shocks on the stock market returns in our sample of eight countries. We find that international stock market returns do not respond in a large way to oil market shocks. That is, the significant effects that exist prove small in magnitude. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The predicted daily oil price variation is compared with the actual daily variation of the oil price and the difference is implemented to activate the learning algorithms. In order to reduce the effect of unpredictable short term disturbances, a data filtering algorithm is used. in this paper, the prediction is called true if the predicted variation of the oil price has the same sign as the actual variation, otherwise the prediction is false. It is shown that for several randomly selected durations, the true prediction is considerably higher than the result of most recent published prediction algorithms. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the algorithm, several on line predictions are executed during one complete month. The on line results indicate that the true predictions are consistently the same percentage for periods of one month. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The heterogeneity arises from uninsurable and idiosyncratic uncertainty in preferences and employment status. We calibrate the model to match the distribution of wealth in U.S. data and features of transitions between employment and unemployment. in comparison with much of the literature, we find rather large effects. For our benchmark model, we find welfare effects that. on average across all consumers, are of a bit more than one order of magnitude larger than those computed by Lucas [Lucas Jr., R.E,, 1987. Models of Business Cycles. Basil Blackwell, New York]. When we distinguish long- from short-term unemployment, long-term unemployment being distinguished by poor (and highly procyclical) employment prospects and low unemployment compensation, the average gain from eliminating cycles is as much as 1% in consumption equivalents. In addition, in both models, there are large differences across groups: very poor consumers gain a lot when cycles are removed (the long-term unemployed as much as around 30%), as do very rich consumers, whereas the majority of consumers-the middle class-sees much smaller gains from removing cycles. Inequality also rises Substantially upon removing cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, I argue that this is a systemic crisis-a crisis of what Hyman Minsky called money manager capitalism. I link this to the analyses of Hilferding and Veblen of an earlier period, finance capitalism, and argue that this is, in effect, the second failure of this type of capitalism. The essential characteristics of early finance capitalism are: relatively small government, use of external finance for investment, and growing concentration of economic power in the hands of 'trusts'-or what we might today call megacorporations with varied interests and diverse affiliations across 'industry', 'finance' and 'insurance'. Unlike the first phase, the second phase of finance capitalism took place in the context of a big government, neoconservative model. Minsky's analysis helps us to understand how the New Deal and big government created a paternalistic capitalism after World War II, which favoured high consumption, high employment, greater equality and financial stability; however, that stability was destabilising because it permitted the rise of managed money. Over time, innovation and deregulation increased fragility, which generated increasingly frequent and severe financial crises. While previous crises were resolved quickly enough to prevent 'it' (another debt deflation) from happening again, this crisis appears to be sufficiently severe that the very survival of money manager capitalism is thrown into question. The article examines the contributing factors to the current crisis, including the real estate boom and bust, the rise of risky financial instruments such as securitised debts and credit default swaps, the commodities market bubble and the fiscal squeeze. The article concludes with some suggestions concerning the possible outcome of the failure of this form of finance capitalism.","[Wray, L.

The economy now consists of streams of energy conversions that direct energy to the production of goods and services. The focus on energy generates a variety of insights. It yields a new taxonomy of economies and economic activities; allows a better grasp of the tasks performed by labor and capital; raises the prospect of examining growth as the speeding up of machines; and identifies greater use of energy as an important independent source of growth. In addition, I use these results to explain the near stagnation in living standards in agrarian economies in the millennia before 1800, and the dramatic acceleration in growth since that date.","Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Alam, MS (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",m.alam@neu.edu,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

However, the very process of cooperative knowledge creation affects the heterogeneity of people through the accumulation of knowledge in common. The model features myopic agents in a pure externality model of interaction. The equilibrium process tends to result in the accumulation of too much knowledge in common compared to the most productive state.

This paper investigates the effect of aging on global asset markets and asset returns, focusing on markets for productive capital, and especially on interactions between European and Asian economic development. Aging has complex effects on the markets for real capital. If elderly people save less than younger people, interest rates will increase. At the same time, however, the younger generation becomes smaller, which reduces the demand for new investment. The equilibrium effect is thus uncertain. Our multicountry computational equilibrium model delivers a subtle picture: there will be some decline in the return from productive capital, but it is relatively small. We find noticeable interaction effects between labor market and pension reforms in Europe on the one hand, and the demographic and economic developments in Asia, especially India and China, on the other hand.","[Boersch-Supan, Axel] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Mannheim; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Börsch-Supan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Res Inst Econ Aging, L13,17, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",axel@boersch-supan.de,,,,,,,37,10,11,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

This folder included a bulky file on what AER Editor Davis Rich Dewey would come to refer to as the Cross/Eaves Controversy-a controversy that, according to a letter he wrote, would give him no end of trouble. The trouble erupted with a book review that appeared in the first issue of the American Economic Review. The review, written by Ira Cross, addressed a book by Lucile Eaves entitled A History of California Labor Legislation. The controversy that ensued illustrates the eternally fascinating interaction of the reviewer and the reviewed and casts a revealing light on the era's standards and rituals of scholarly conduct, on the drawing of disciplinary boundaries as economics became a more distinct academic discipline, and on the differing treatment of men and women in the academic life of the time.","[May, Ann Mari] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Dimand, Robert W.] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Brock University,"May, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",amay1@unl.edu; dimand@brocku.ca,,,,,,,63,5,5,1,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The idea of 'cost saving' is closer to the entrepreneur's view of productivity. An entrepreneur would expect a reduction in the cost of production if trade openness brings any benefits to their firm. The output-enhancing (primal) productivity effect of openness is obtainable from the cost-saving (dual) productivity effect through the cost-output link. The cost-function framework also enables us to investigate whether trade openness induces firms to adopt a technology that is biased towards the use or saving of any factor of production. An empirical exercise based on time series data for the Australian two-digit manufacturing industries reveals significant cost-saving and output-enhancing productivity effects of trade openness. Trade openness is biased towards the saving of labour and the use of capital. These results are quite insensitive to the choice of alternative measures of openness.,"[Paul, Satya] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Econ & Finance, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Paul, S (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Econ & Finance, Parramatta Campus,Room EDG 136,Locked Bag 1997, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",s.paul@uws.edu.au,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We test the theory using county-level data from late-nineteenth-century Prussia, exploiting the initial concentric dispersion of the Reformation to use distance to Wittenberg as an instrument for Protestantism. We find that Protestantism indeed led to higher economic prosperity, but also to better education. Our results are consistent with Protestants' higher literacy accounting for most of the gap in economic prosperity.","[Becker, Sascha O.] Univ Stirling, CESifo, Ifo Inst, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, CESifo, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Stirling; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Becker, SO (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, CESifo, Ifo Inst, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",,"Becker, Sascha O./B-2463-2012",/0000-0002-0672-4865,,,,,102,522,576,13,186,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

The stability conditions are nevertheless quite analogous to the order-based Beja-Goldman model. The effects of parameter variations are also studied in a stochastic setting, where special emphasis is put on the misalignment between price and the time-varying fundamental value, the market maker's risk aversion, and the differential profits of fundamentalists and chartists.

We find that our calibrated model, relative to the standard DMP model, comes closer to the data regarding the volatility of vacancies and unemployment without introducing unrealistic sensitivity to policy changes.

But firm-level data on physical quantities of output, capital, and intermediate inputs are typically unobservable. Therefore, when constructing productivity measures, most analysts proxy these variables with real sales revenues, depreciated capital spending, and real input expenditures. Our first objective is to argue that the resultant productivity indices have little to do with technical efficiency, product quality, or contributions to social welfare. Nonetheless, they are likely to be correlated with policy shocks and managerial decisions in misleading ways. Our second objective is to develop an alternative approach to inference. We assume firms' costs and revenues reflect a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium in a differentiated product industry, as in Berry [Berry, Steven (1994) Estimating discrete-choice models of product differentiation, Rand journal 25(2), pp. 242-262.]. This allows us to impute each firm's unobserved marginal costs and product appeal from its observed revenues and costs. With these in hand, we calculate each firm's contribution to consumer and producer surplus. Further, we link these welfare measures to policy and managerial decisions by assuming that marginal costs and product appeal indices follow vector autoregressive (VAR) processes, conditioned on policy proxies and/or managerial choice variables. We estimate the demand system parameters and VAR parameters jointly using Bayesian techniques. Applying our methodology to panel data on Colombian paper producers, we study the relation between our welfare-based measures and conventional productivity measures. We find that the two are only weakly correlated with one another. Further, they give contrasting pictures of the relationship between firms' performances and their participation in foreign markets. One reason is that product appeal variation has little effect on standard productivity indices, but it is captured by welfare-based performance measures. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Indirect network effects tie together the performance of firms on the same platform: a successful competitor raises the value of all firms on the same platform, where an unsuccessful firm may enjoy a windfall increase in its market value. In contrast to the tipping result in the literature, we find tendencies toward increasing competition across platforms for a wide range of market structures. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal program may display two novel features, which cannot be present in stationary models. First, UI transfers are bounded below by a minimal assistance level that arises endogenously in the efficient contract. Second, the optimal scheme implies a wage subsidy for long-term unemployed workers. Numerical simulations based on the Spanish and U.S. economies suggest that both assistance transfers and wage subsidies should be part of the UI scheme in these countries.","[Pavoni, Nicola] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Pavoni, N (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",n.pavoni@ucl.ac.uk,,"pavoni, nicola/0000-0003-3086-9447",,,,,45,25,32,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

A shock of the same magnitude on the two banks level of capital may have a different effect on total investment.

Redistribution has two opposite effects on voluntary giving. The price of charitable giving decreases with the degree of redistribution, and this has a positive effect on the total amount of giving (substitution effect). However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect). The theoretical model developed in this paper demonstrates that, under a general Class of Utility functions, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Hence, charitable giving increases with file tax rate. In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized Independent of the ex-ante income inequality. However, the positive impact of taxation on charitable giving and Welfare may disappear if individuals generate their income levels in anticipation of taxation and redistribution does not take into account the cost of effort.

This paper differentiates between HMO penetration and competition and examines their relationship to the adoption of cardiac catheterization laboratories in all non-federal, short-term general community hospitals in the U.S. between 1985 and 1995. Results show that a hospital is less likely to adopt the technology if HMO market penetration increases but more likely to adopt if HMO competition increases. Further, the latter effect is non-linear in the number of adopters. In markets where fewer than a critical number of neighboring hospitals have already adopted, the probability of adoption increases with the number of HMOs, but in markets where more than the critical number of neighbors have already adopted, the probability of adoption decreases with the number of HMOs. Thus, in markets where technology is rare, HMO penetration and competition have countervailing effects on the diffusion of technology such that the net effect could be small. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Career progression is observed over five-year intervals within the period 1986-2001. Transition probabilities are estimated using a three-equation model with initial divisional status, retention and divisional transition as dependent variables. Retention depends on age, divisional status, first-team appearances, playing position and birthplace. Divisional transition depends on age, first-team appearances and playing position. Black players tend to be employed by teams of higher divisional status and have higher retention probabilities, suggesting a form of hiring discrimination affecting the process of becoming a professional.","[Wilson, John O.

This article explains why misinterpreting Coasian negotiations as a market driven process leads to erroneous conclusions. More importantly, this article demonstrates why negotiations between polluters and victims would fail to yield efficient outcomes even if property rights were well-defined, even if there were only a single victim, even if negotiations entailed no transaction costs, and even if negotiators behaved rationally and reached a successful agreement. Unlike other critiques of the Coase theorem that focus on irrational behavior and transaction costs, our critique identifies perverse incentives that arise even under conditions most favorable to the theorem.

Later, welfare-state institutions in interaction with external shocks were identified as more plausible causes of rising equilibrium unemployment in Europe.

Based on the assertion of the neutrality of money in the medium and long run, the search for causes of European unemployment has shied away from the policy of central banks.

Moreover, it fails to be fully Pareto optimal and incentive compatible and is also not implementable as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of an extensive form game (Glycopantis et al. in Econ Theory 26:765-791, 2005). The lack of all the above properties is mainly due to the fact that the agents are supposed to predict the equilibrium market clearing price (as agent's expected maximized utility is conditioned on the information that equilibrium prices reveal), which leads inevitably to the presumption that agents know all the primitives in the economy, i.e., random initial endowments, random utility functions and private information sets. To get around this problematic equilibrium notion, we introduce a new concept called Bayesian-Walrasian equilibrium (BWE) which has Bayesian features. In particular, agents try to predict the market-clearing prices using Bayesian updating and evaluate their consumption in terms of Bayesian price estimates, which are different for each individual. In this framework agents maximize expected utility conditioned on their own private information about the state of nature, subject to a Bayesian estimated budget constraint. Market clearing is not an intrinsic part of the definition of BWE. However, both in the case of perfect foresight and in the case of symmetric information BWE leads to a statewise market clearing; it then becomes an ex post Walrasian equilibrium allocation. This new BWE exists under standard assumptions, in contrast to the REE. In particular, we show that our new BWE exists in the well-known example in Kreps (J Econ Theory 14:32-43, 1977), where REE fails to exist.","[Yannelis, Nicholas C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Balder, Erik J.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Math, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Utrecht University,"Yannelis, NC (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",nyanneli@uiuc.edu,,,,,,,13,7,7,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The reported beliefs tend to be well calibrated to frequentist probabilities and also predict individual choices. Contrary to previous conclusions, we find that respondents do not tend to overweight private information when updating beliefs.

The paper shows how changes in technology have caused the method of standard setting to come full circle. New switching technologies, in particular electronic switching, enabled a change from integral to modular problem solving and thus a change from quasi-vertical integration to open standard setting in the wireline telecommunications industry in the late 1970s and later in the mobile phone industry. Growth in those mobile phone markets that initially implemented an open standard setting process encouraged other countries to adopt similar types of standard setting where government agencies and firms were the mechanisms for this transmission of open standard setting methods. However, the latest technological change, the mobile Internet, requires integral problem solving and this has caused quasi-vertical integration to return in the form of service providers determining the mobile Internet standards and the specifications for the phones that support their mobile Internet services.

We examine the impact of state community rating regulations enacted in the 1990s, which greatly limited insurers' ability to risk rate premiums, to determine if adverse selection is more evident in non-group insurance markets. Using data from large, national surveys we find evidence of a shift to a less healthy pool of non-group enrollees as a consequence of community rating. Community rating made healthy people 20 to 60% less likely to be insured by non-group health insurance; in addition, we found evidence that young and healthy people were 20 to 30% more likely to be uninsured as a result of community rating. We also find evidence that individuals in poor health were 35 to 50% more likely to be insured in the non-group market, but only limited evidence suggesting that persons in poor health were less likely to be uninsured. Our results are further supported by findings suggesting that non-group enrollees were sicker as a result of the community rating laws. Lastly, we find evidence suggesting that HMO penetration in the non-group market increased disproportionately in states that implemented community rating relative to states that did not.

Such programs are increasingly being introduced in Europe and other parts of the world as a means against quality uncertainty in globalized markets. An equilibrim - displacement model is developed for a segmented market with differential qualities that can be utilized for a broad variety of marketing programs. It is applied to one selected European case, i.e. Gepruefte Qualitaet - Bayern. It is shown that the price impacts on high-quality and low-quality segments depend crucially on substitutive relationships between the markets and the advertising elasticities. Welfare implications for producers in a program depend strongly on advertising elasticities, too, but also on the costs of participation including quality control and on the co-financing mechanism between government and producers.","[Herrmann, Roland] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Thompson, Stanley R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Anders, Sven] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Justus Liebig University Giessen; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Alberta,"Herrmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Roland.Herrmann@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,"Anders, Sven/0000-0001-8261-6973",,,,,34,3,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To illustrate their importance, we simulate the combined direct and indirect effects of changes in decoupled payments and farm size on the probabilities of farm households engaging in these two activities. We also illustrate that the probability of engaging in these two activities depends on whether the farm is located in a state, or local agricultural district or participates in a related farmland retention program.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Boisvert, Richard N.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",National Taiwan University; Cornell University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",,,,,25,12,15,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results from this test suggest that the Japanese stock market is pairwise cointegrated with the Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and the US stock market but not with the market of South Korea. These findings should prove valuable to individual investors and financial institutions holding long-run investment portfolios in these markets.","[Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Mo, Chien-Wen] Meiho Inst Technol, Dept Publ Finance, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Liu, Wen-Chi] Da Yeh Univ, Dept Business Adm, Changhua, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Da Yeh University,"Chang, T (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",tychang@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

J,"Chen, MY; Lin, FL; Chang, CK",,,,"Chen, M. -Y.; Lin, F. -L.; Chang, C. -K.",,,Relations between health care expenditure and income: an application of local quantile regressions,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BANDWIDTH SELECTION; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; MODELS; COINTEGRATION; CHOICE,"In this article, local relationship between per capita health care expenditure (HCE hereafter) and GDP is investigated with local quantile regressions. Logarithmic per capita GDP and HCE of 154 countries in 2001 and 25, 50 and 75% quantile regressions are considered. Three main findings are obtained from our empirical study. First, conditional distribution of per capita HCE on GDP is asymmetric. For lower GDP countries, the conditional distribution is skewed to the right which means less health care tends to be consumed. On the contrary, the conditional distribution is skewed to the left which implies more health care is apt to be consumed for high GDP countries. Second, variance of the conditional distribution is larger when per capita GDP is low and smaller when per capita GDP is high. This confirms the necessity of restricting the sample observations to OECD countries for holding the homogeneity of HCE when the conditional mean is considered. Third, whether health care is 'necessary' or 'luxury' depends on the level of per capita GDP. For 50% quantile, the income elasticity is significant > 1 when per capita GDP is greater than US$ 1882 (ln(1882)=7.56), which indicates that health care becomes luxury for countries with per capita GDP higher than US$ 1882. For 75% quantile, the elasticity is significantly > 1 and health care becomes luxury for countries with per capita GDP higher than US$ 1737 (ln(1737)=7.46). As to 25% quantile, the elasticity is significantly > 1 and health care becomes luxury for countries with per capita GDP higher than US$ 1920 (ln(1920)=7.56). These results indicate that health care is a necessity for 37 countries with per capita income lower than $ 1920 and is luxury for other countries.","[Chen, M. -Y.] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, F. -L.] Da Yeh Univ, Dept Financial Management, Changhua, Taiwan; [Chang, C. -K.] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; Da Yeh University; National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, MY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan.",mei_yuan@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,"Lin, Fu-Lai/AAI-2907-2020",,,,,,23,32,34,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In this article, we study the stability of the money demand function from the standpoint of structural changes in the function. We first investigate if a stable money demand function can be found for the US for the period from the first quarter of 1959 to the fourth quarter of 2000. The results show that a stable long-run money demand function does not exist for the sample period under consideration. We then estimate unknown structural break points in the variables of the money demand function using Bai and Perron's (1998) method and test if there is a stable relationship in each sub-sample period of the break points. The results show that a stable relationship exists for each sub-sample period. The estimated income elasticity and interest rate semi-elasticity are relatively smaller than Ball's (2001) estimates, but consistent with his argument.","[Choi, Kyongwook] Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul 130743, South Korea; [Jung, Chulho] Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University of Seoul; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Choi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, 90 Cheonnong Dong, Seoul 130743, South Korea.",kwchoi@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,8,8,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.
