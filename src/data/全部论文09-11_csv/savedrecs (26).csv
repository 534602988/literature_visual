Combining the results with a hazard analysis of the characteristics of exotic plants introduced in North America, we explore optimal tax simulations for internalizing the risk and costs of a potential plant invasion. If the share of the exotic plant sales in final profits is large, then the resulting annual fee will be high, discouraging the expansion of the nursery industry.

Whether the consumer is actually paying a price premium for ecolabelled products is of fundamental importance as it indicates a return on the investment of sustainable practices, providing an incentive for producers to undertake such practices. This article seeks to address the question of whether or not an actual premium is being paid by consumers for ecolabelled seafood by conducting a hedonic analysis of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)-certified frozen processed Alaska pollock products in the London metropolitan area in the UK market using scanner data. Regression results show a statistically significant premium of 14.2%.

Using a nationwide survey of rice farmers in Taiwan, we estimate two stochastic production frontier models that accommodate technical inefficiency and production risk simultaneously for farmers both with and without off-farm work. The stochastic dominance criterion is then applied to compare the differences in the distributions of the estimated technical efficiency and yield risk between groups. The empirical results indicate that these two groups of farmers use resources in different ways, and off-farm work is not necessarily associated with lower technical efficiency. For farmers in the lower percentiles of the efficiency distribution, those with off-farm work are more efficient than their counterparts without off-farm work. In addition, farmers with off-farm work face higher production risk and this result is robust for the entire distribution.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Wen, Fang-I] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC96-2415-H-002-020],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",H.H.

There is some evidence however to suggest that some asset prices do not follow random walks but display long-range dependence. Such systematic behavior of past returns is of interest to traders. This article examines long-range dependence in wheat futures prices using rescaled range analysis and the Hurst exponent. Since this estimate is biased when long-range dependence is absent and its distribution is unknown, a Monte Carlo simulation approach is proposed. Results show that wheat futures prices show no evidence of long-range dependence and there are no profitable trading rules.","Newcastle Univ, Reader Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dawson, PJ (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Reader Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",P.J.Dawson@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

To define the percentage change in the consumer demand for food caused by changes in the VAT rate or in the physical persons' income tax rate, the differential-logarithmic model of the Marshallian demand function was applied: dQ/Q x 100 = epsilon x [ln(1 + nu(1)) - ln(1 + nu(0))] x 100 + eta x [ln(1 - mu(1)) - ln(1 - mu(1))] x 100. The general form of the dynamic demand model was adjusted to the conditions of the Czech final food market through the respective coefficients of the price elasticity (epsilon) and the income elasticity (eta) as follows: dQ/Q x 100 = -0.514 x [ln(1 + nu(1)) - ln( 1 + nu(0))] x 100 + 0.583 x [ln(1 - mu(1)) - ln(1 - mu(1))] x 100. On the basis of the derived differential model, it may be stated that an increase in the VAT rate by 1 percentage point from the original rate (10%) would cause a decrease in the demand for food of an average Czech household by 0.4652%. In the case of an increase in the physical person's income tax by 1 percentage point from the original rate (15%), the demand for food of an average Czech household would decrease by 0.6899%. The achieved results show that the demand of Czech households for food responds more sensitively to changes in the income tax. Quantification of the relative change in the consumer demand for food caused by the tax rate changes, especially the VAT tax rate change, is also useful for making estimates of the relative changes in demand functions within the respective agriculture and food-processing industry verticals. The performed analysis shows that the changes in the volume of consumer demand for food will be transferred in the same percentage rate to the demand functions within the respective agriculture and food-processing industry verticals, provided the technical and technological conditions are stabile.","Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Syrovátka, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",pavels@mendelu.cz,"Pavel, Syrovátka/E-3536-2018","Pavel, Syrovátka/0000-0002-3915-4328","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,10,2,2,1,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Choice experiment designs have typically addressed efficiency of utility function parameter estimates. The recently developed concept of C-efficiency recognises the salience of willingness to pay estimates rather than utility function parameters in studies that seek to put money values on attributes. C-efficiency design benefits have been illustrated in a theoretical context, but have not been tested in applied settings. This study reports a choice experiment field application that used initial responses to update statistical designs to maximise C-efficiency. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the revised design delivered significant reductions in the variance of willingness to pay estimates, illustrating that C-efficient designs can indeed decrease costs of choice experiments by reducing required sample sizes.","[Kerr, Geoffrey N.] Lincoln Univ, Dept Environm Management, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Sharp, Basil M.

Because milk from cloned animals is not currently labeled in the market, we utilized a stated preference experiment to determine consumer preferences for the attribute, but also sought to determine whether the survey-based choices were consistent with people's revealed preferences given by scanner data. Our analysis indicates that a pooled model combining stated and revealed preference data exhibits overall better out-of-sample prediction performance than either data set used alone. Results from the pooled model indicate that consumers are willing to pay large premiums to avoid milk from cloned cows-an amount that is over three times that for organic or rBST-free milk.

We conduct a choice experiment to identify the effects of multiple health and nutrition information labels for two products representing a healthy and less healthy food choice. Although our consumers attach positive utility to most of the individual labels evaluated here, the simultaneous presence of more than one label only has positive impact on utility in one of nine possible cases. Therefore, promotion of multiple labels should not be considered beneficial a priori either from a regulatory or business perspective.

This article analyzes impacts of changing water inflow distributions on irrigation and farm income extending a conjunctive river basin model toward a stochastic modeling approach. Regional climate scenarios are used to derive a maximum likelihood density estimate of current and future water supplies. Based on these distributions, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to obtain stochastic model results on surface and groundwater irrigation as well as economic indicators for six oases along the river. The probability of farmers to receive revenues below the subsistence level is around 2% under current conditions, but this is likely to rise to rates of 6% to 15% depending on the underlying climate change scenario. The composition of water sources for irrigation will shift to more groundwater use. The river basin model is able to represent complex spatial interactions between oases as well as a partial complementarity between groundwater and surface water irrigation due to salinity management effects. Interestingly, the value of groundwater is not necessarily increasing under future climatic conditions as salinity problems are aggravated with expanded groundwater use.","[Heidecke, Claudia; Heckelei, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Heidecke, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",claudia.heidecke@vti.bund.de,"Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011","Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01 LW 0301A]; Ministry of Science and Research of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia [223-21200200],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Science and Research of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia,"We would like to acknowledge very helpful comments of two anonymous referees in improving the article.

The district was divided into three strata; from each stratum two villages were randomly selected and from each village ten loanee farmers were randomly selected from the given list of borrowers. An equal number of non-loanee farmers were also selected. Cobb Douglas function was used to calculate the impact of credit on rice productivity. Findings - The coefficient of credit was significant, which indicated that credit has a positive impact on the productivity of rice, providing a clue that credit is an important tool for improving and increasing the agricultural productivity in general and that of rice in particular. Originality/value - The paper will be an important addition to the literature in the current credit impact studies and will help especially the agricultural planners who are responsible for allocating funds for the agricultural sector in general and for the rice sector in particular.

The final element was an analysis of logistic costs on the example of 50 enterprises specialising in agricultural production. The obtained results of empirical studies prove that costs of logistic infrastructure form a significant part of general costs, which can be reduced through proper management. Consequently, as far as the creation of the competitive edge is concerned, it is important to identify and control these costs precisely and continuously in the structure of enterprise operation costs.","[Kubon, Maciej] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Agr Engn & Informat, PL-30149 Krakow, Poland; [Krasnodebski, Andrzej] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Management & Mkt Agribusiness, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow,"Kubon, M (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Agr Engn & Informat, Ul Balicka 116B, PL-30149 Krakow, Poland.",maciej.kubon@ur.krakow.pl; rrkrasno@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Kubon, Maciej/K-4642-2019","Kubon, Maciej/0000-0003-4847-8743",,,,,14,18,18,3,55,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

While the number of the banks was declining, own funds per bank, bank offices and staff were expanding. The banks managed to adjust to the EU requirements by having implemented limits on loan concentration, procedures for counteracting money laundering and meeting minimum capital requirements. They introduced system of the deposit guarantee, monitoring and control of credit risk and adapted new regulations. The cooperative banks for the most part retained their original characteristics.

This article analyses the incentives for setting private quality standards before governments do so. Since food quality standards are generally multifaceted, different types of standards will affect revenues differently. Our model shows that private firms can pre-empt public regulation by setting their own private food quality standards in order to choose the type of standards that minimises their costs. The emergence of private food standards in grocery retailing is discussed in this context.","[McCluskey, Jill J.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Winfree, Jason A.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Washington State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"McCluskey, JJ (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",mccluskey@wsu.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020",,,,,,16,18,21,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

This paper investigates whether the use of the share contract regime is positively correlated to increased economic returns. The principal-agent framework is applied to develop a theoretical model for the remuneration choice. Empirical estimation is conducted using a switching regression model that accounts for the effects of certain vessel characteristics on revenue, depending on remuneration regime used (i.e., share contract or flat wage), as well as the potential selection bias in the vessels' contractual choice. Key findings from counterfactual simulations indicate: (a) a negative selection related to choosing share contracts, and (b) flat wage vessels would experience significantly higher revenues if they switched to share contracts. Thus, even though the labor market in Hawaii's longline fisheries relies upon foreign crew members, the results suggest that owners of flat wage vessels would benefit by applying share contracts to increase their revenues.","[Nguyen, Quang] Univ Lumiere Lyon, Fac Sci Econ & Gest, CNRS, GATE, Ecully, France; [Leung, PingSun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Nguyen, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Lumiere Lyon, Fac Sci Econ & Gest, CNRS, GATE, Ecully, France.",,,,,,,,20,10,11,0,9,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Adoption of modern varieties increased from less than 5% of the maize area in the 1970s to about 60% in 2005, yielding an aggregate rate of return on research and development (R&D) investment of 43%. The estimated number of people moved out of poverty through adoption of new maize varieties rose gradually in the 1980s to more than one million people per year since the mid 1990s.

Under duopoly, a firm may increase its sales through privately funding product quality improvements. However, such endogenous sunk costs may also be used to exclude a rival. Industry-funded check-off programs affect firms' strategies and can be procompetitive. The rationale lies not only in how the check-off enhancement is perceived by consumers but also in the way the check-off's crowding-out effect reduces the ability of a firm to use its private expenditures to bar a rival's market access.","[Crespi, John M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Crespi, JM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,,,,,,,32,5,7,1,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The results show that in addition to being nonlinear, the impacts are also characterized by significance thresholds that are difficult to capture in a parametric model.

The hedonic model generalizes previous studies by recognizing that the bundle of externalities generated by crop production may increase the price of some homes and decrease the price of others, depending on their respective locations. Using an instrumental variables approach to estimate the model for San Joaquin County, California, suggests that proximity to cropland increases the value of most, but not all, single-family homes near the agricultural-urban edge. The results imply an agricultural buffer zone of 68 meters would mitigate most cropland disamenities.","Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Kuminoff, NV (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,North Carolina Center for Environmental and Resource Economic Policy; Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station,North Carolina Center for Environmental and Resource Economic Policy; Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station,Research support from the North Carolina Center for Environmental and Resource Economic Policy and the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station is gratefully acknowledged.,,26,12,15,0,6,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Our primary motivation is to gain a better understanding of the mechanics of innovation related to the adoption of product and process innovation. In particular, we consider the jointness of ex post realizations of product and process innovations, and assess whether there are underlying differences that result from innovations developed inhouse versus those developed externally by a third party. Using a multivariate probit model, we find evidence of significant interrelationships between product and process innovations that are developed inhouse. These findings suggest that firms that conduct both process and product innovations inhouse are better able to enjoy complementarities that arise in the discovery process. We also find that firms are more likely to innovate in response to keeping pace with competitors.","[Brewin, Derek G.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Monchuk, Daniel C.] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Econ, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Manitoba; University of Southern Mississippi; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Brewin, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",derek_brewin@umanitoba.ca; daniel.monchuk@usm.edu; partridge.27@osu.edu,"Brewin, Derek/ABB-1374-2020","Brewin, Derek/0000-0003-4514-5441",,,,,34,21,26,2,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The need for harmonization of this tax in the existing EU member states is obvious, but the results in this field are not entirely convincing. Also the provision of services is a problematic field among others in the implementation of value added tax. It is essential to examine the issue of the value added tax, in this case, both the possibilities of the use of the self assessment system of the value added tax by the recipient of the service compared to the accounting of service including the value added tax by a provider of this service, even if the provider of service from the EU member state shall have a permanent establishment in other member state of the customer, but this establishment is not involved in the provision of the service, as well as the inclusion of services within the so-called extended guarantee to the taxable or exempt fulfilment, when the subject provides the technical support and the assistance to its customers, such as in the case of failures of agricultural machinery, which the provider had supplied to a subject in other member state. On the basis of empirical research, it is needed to assess the results of the harmonization efforts, to identify and recommend the direction in which the European Union should take in this field. The comparison of the individual European Union countries is important here. Value added tax is, regarding its features, still an unsurpassed excise tax, even if it has some weaknesses. The technique of the selection of this tax enables to discover the paid tax at all stages of treatment and it is very appropriate, due to its features for the use in international trade. It is therefore necessary to ensure the sufficient clarity, lucidity and equal conditions for players from the European Union on the basis of the development and adaptation of the rules of the value added tax set at the European Union level within each European Union country.","Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"David, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",david@mendelu.cz,"David, Petr/Q-5673-2016","David, Petr/0000-0002-5055-0989","Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno, Czech Republic [VZ 62156 48904]","Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno, Czech Republic(Czech Republic Government)","Supported by the Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno, Czech Republic (Project No. VZ 62156 48904).",,7,3,3,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The estimates of price and income elasticities of the beef meat demand are also obtained. The results indicate that the food patterns development in Slovakia during the past two decades has undergone rapid structural changes.

The ultimate version of the compulsory modulation measure adopted under the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) assumes the reduction of direct payments if the total individual claim exceeds 5 thousand (sic) or 300 thousand (sic) level. The Czech agricultural sector will be impacted by this measure substantially, given the large scale farming enterprises. In 2013, the total farmers' direct payments will be cut by more than 10% ((sic) 91 million). Moreover, there are regional differences in farm structures (the average farm size and the extent of collectivization) which will bring about various effects of policies in the heterogeneous regions. The analysis further shows that the regions that are least affected are at the same time more environmental sensitive and are mostly situated in the mountainous or sub-mountainous parts of the country or more urban areas than the average. Hence the effect of the modulation, from a purely environmental perspective, may not contradict the objectives of other environmental policies. That is to say the regions that need support the most will be reduced the least. However, the picture is less obvious in the regional economies where more rural regions (potentially more vulnerable with socio-economic problems) tend to be more affected.","[Medonos, T.; Jelinek, L.; Humpal, J.] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Medonos, T (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Slezska 7, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",medonos.tomas@uzei.cz; jelinek.ladislav@uzei.cz; humpal.jaroslav@uzei.cz,"Shahan, Fauziah/HMP-7251-2023",,Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [MZE 0002725101]; Rural Areas in the Czech Republic in Conditions of the EU and European Model of Agriculture,"Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic); Rural Areas in the Czech Republic in Conditions of the EU and European Model of Agriculture",Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (Research Plan MZE 0002725101 - Analysis and Evaluation of Possibilities of the Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Areas in the Czech Republic in Conditions of the EU and European Model of Agriculture).,,8,3,3,0,3,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

One reason for this is to contribute to the fight against climate change. Sustainability criteria have been introduced recently by some countries to help ensure biofuels have lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels. Concerns have been expressed from various quarters that such criteria could represent World Trade Organisation (WTO)-incompatible barriers to trade. We, first, question recent contributions to the (mainly legal) academic literature which have sought to find ways of allowing biofuels to be treated differently in trade policy terms, based on whether or not they have been derived from feedstocks produced sustainably. We then draw on the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (TBTA) to offer guidance as to how to establish WTO-compatible sustainability criteria. There is little direct case law to draw on at the design stage, but we argue that if TBTA guidance is followed, a long-term absence of case law could be taken as an indication that the sustainability criteria established are indeed WTO-compatible.","[Ackrill, Robert] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Div Econ, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England; [Kay, Adrian] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Nottingham; Nottingham Trent University; Australian National University,"Ackrill, R (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Div Econ, Burton St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England.",robert.ackrill@ntu.ac.uk,"Ackrill, Robert/J-3874-2019","Ackrill, Robert/0000-0002-0739-1812; Kay, Adrian/0000-0002-5854-4516",ESRC [RES-000-22-3607]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H003010/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H003010/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Robert Ackrill, Division of Economics, Nottingham Business School, Nottingham Trent University, Burton Street, Nottingham, NG1 4BU.

Our work has direct implications for the analysis of the global land use impacts of biofuel mandates.","[Villoria, Nelson B.; Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Villoria, NB (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,"Villoria, Nelson/0000-0003-1929-0725",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Transportation and Air Quality [SP09H000962],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Transportation and Air Quality,The authors thank Dr. David Hennessy and three anonymous referees for helpful comments on the article.

This is due to the nature of such problems in which decisions may be influenced by multiple different, relevant aspects, and accordingly multiple corresponding expertises are required. Fuzzy expert systems (FESs) are widely used to model expertises due to their capability to model the real world values, which are not always exact, but frequently vague, or uncertain. In this paper, different expertises relevant to the decision solution are modelled using several corresponding FESs. These systems are then integrated to comprehensibly judge the YES-or-NO binary decision making problem, which requires all such expertises. This integration involves several independent and autonomous FESs arranged synergistically to suit a varying problem context. Then, the main focus of this paper is to realize such integration through combining the crisp numerical outputs produced by multiple FESs. The newly developed methods MPDI and WMPDI are utilized to combine the crisp outputs of multiple parallel FESs, whilst weights are determined through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The presented approach of utilizing the proved efficient MPDI combining criteria along with AHP will encourage practitioners to take advantage of integration and cooperation among multiple numerically outputting knowledge sources in general.","[Aly, Shady; Vrana, Ivan] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Engn, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Vrana, I (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16951 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",vrana@pef.czu.cz,"Vrana, Ivan/H-1768-2018; Aly, Shady/C-4812-2013","Vrana, Ivan/0000-0001-5920-5631; Aly, Shady/0000-0002-3348-5185","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 604070904, 2C06004]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Projects No. MSM 604070904 - Information and knowledge support of strategic management and No. 2C06004 - Intelligent instruments for assessment of relevance of content of data and knowledge resources).",,24,0,0,0,5,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We use a unique four-round panel dataset on farm households in northern Ethiopia that had access to microfinance, observed on two key poverty indicators: household consumption and housing improvements. Fixed-effects and random trend models are used to reduce potential selection biases due to time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and individual trends therein. Results show that borrowing indeed causally increased consumption and housing improvements. A flexible specification that takes into account repeated borrowings also suggests that borrowing has cumulative long-term effects on these outcomes, implying that short-term impact estimates may underestimate credit effects.","[Berhane, Guush] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Ethiopia Strategy Support Program, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Gardebroek, Cornelis] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Wageningen University & Research,"Berhane, G (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Ethiopia Strategy Support Program, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012","Berhane, Guush/0000-0002-1947-9483",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [WB 46-450],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Guush Berhane is a postdoctoral fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, Ethiopia Strategy Support Program, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey of farmers in Inner Mongolia, China, is undertaken. Selected variables are used to explain crop insurance purchases, and a probit regression model is used for the analysis. Findings - Results show that a number of variables explain crop insurance purchases by farmers in Inner Mongolia. Of the eight variables in the model, seven are statistically significant. The eight variables used to explain crop insurance purchases are: knowledge of crop insurance, previous purchases of crop insurance, trust of the crop insurance company, amount of risk taken on by the farmer, importance of low crop insurance premium, government as the main information source for crop insurance, role of head of village, and number of family members working in the city. Research limitations/implications - A possible limitation of the study is that data includes only one geographic area, Inner Mongolia, China, and so results may not always fully generalize to all regions of China, for all situations. Practical implications - Crop insurance has been recently expanded in China, and the information from this study should be useful for insurance companies and government policy makers that are attempting to increase the adoption rate of crop insurance in China. Social implications - Crop insurance may be a useful approach for stabilizing the agricultural sector, and for increasing agricultural production and food security in China. Originality/value - This is the first study to quantitatively model the factors affecting crop insurance purchases by fanners in Inner Mongolia, China.","[Boyd, Milton] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Boyd, Milton; Pai, Jeffrey] Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Zhang, Qiao; Wang, Ke] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiao; Wang, Ke] Minist Agr China, Key Lab Digital Agr Early Warning Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, H.

This aim was achieved by econometric modelling of the production function, which was specified as a Cobb-Douglas function, with the level of average daily increase as the dependent variable, and feed compounds, mortality and weight of new stock as independent variables. The model was specified as a fixed effect model, and the parameters of the function were estimated by the method of least squares dummy variable, based on the ordinary least squares method. Verification of the estimated model was based on a t-test, coefficient of determination, Wald test, autoregressive test, and test of normality distribution of residuals. Subsequently, the estimated function was analysed and significant determinants of production were identified. The behaviour of the production functions was analysed for the average and marginal productions. The functions were also illustrated in graphs of production surfaces, from which the maps of isoproduction functions were derived. The isoproduction functions were used for the final analysis of the potential for pork production. The analysis was based on panel data from 32 farms focused on pig fattening, collected by our own survey. The research indicated significant differences between the surveyed farms. It also declared the most important factor of final production to be, with 99% probability, the new stock weight. The second most important determinant of final production is the feed compound A3, which is used in the final stage of fattening. For maximized production, the farmer should focus on the weight of pigs coming into fattening, choose the biggest one, and introduce the use of the feed compound A3. The results in the submitted paper should also be used by farmers to evaluate their production activity, and to compare their actual output with the theoretical value enumerated by the production function.","[Maly, Michal; Kroupova, Zdenka; Zidkova, Dana; Peterova, Jarmila; Sobrova, Lenka; Cechura, Lukas; Pankova, Ludmila; Mach, Jiri; Kristkova, Zuzana; Maier, Tomas; Hucko, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Maly, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 1076, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",maly@pef.czu.cz; kroupovaz@pef.czu.cz,"Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Pánková, Ludmila/H-5090-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; Mach, Jiri/H-4657-2018; Maier, Tomas/H-7627-2018; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018; Rumankova, Lenka/H-4357-2018","Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Pánková, Ludmila/0000-0001-8861-4733; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Mach, Jiri/0000-0002-0526-4246; Maier, Tomas/0000-0003-2386-6977; Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874; Rumankova, Lenka/0000-0003-0734-6883; Smeets Kristkova, Zuzana/0000-0003-3100-7945","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Projects No. MSM 6046070906 - Economics of resources of Czech agriculture and their efficient use in the context of multifunctional agri-food systems).",,7,3,3,0,26,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, if distance is a proxy for transport and other trade costs, then the true effect of transport costs is impossible to determine. We attempt to remedy this by utilizing the newly compiled Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Maritime Transport Cost database to investigate the role that maritime freight costs play in determining ocean-shipped agricultural imports.

Results reveal that female labour accounts for a substantial 28% of total labour use (mainly supplied from the family) and contributes significantly to productivity as well as technical efficiency. Contrary to expectation, the cost share of female labour input is significantly higher than the male share, and has a substitution relationship with all other inputs, including male labour. The estimated mean level of technical efficiency is 0.90, implying that crop output might be increased by 10% by eliminating technical inefficiency. Both male and female education have a significant impact on improving technical efficiency. Other significant technical efficiency shifters are farming experience, family size and crop diversification. Owner operators are found to be technically inefficient relative to the tenants. Policy implications include creation of a hired labour market for female labour so that more women can be involved in the production process, and can contribute to towards improving productivity and efficiency. In addition, investment in education for both men and women, strategies to promote crop diversification and effective regulation/modification of the tenancy market will significantly improve technical efficiency in this case.","Univ Plymouth, Fac Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Earth & Environm, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Rahman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Fac Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Earth & Environm, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",srahman@plymouth.ac.uk,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191",,,,,63,54,63,2,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

However, adoption rates for CA in many regions of the world remain below expected levels. This article looks at the effects of participation in organic markets and farmers' organizations on the adoption of soil conservation practices. Based on original survey data from 241 small-scale farm households in Honduras, we find that both participation in organic markets and farmer-based groups have positive effects on the number of soil conservation practices adopted. The results indicate that besides supply-oriented policy measures, such as the provision of technical assistance and extension, demand-related factors are likely to play an important role in sustainable soil management. Demand-oriented policy measures include support for labeling initiatives and consumer education to facilitate value-added product differentiation and market segmentation.","[Wollni, Meike] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Lee, David R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Thies, Janice E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Gottingen; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Wollni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",mwollni1@uni-goettingen.de,"Thies, Janice/A-5074-2014","Wollni, Meike/0000-0002-8460-7840",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),The corresponding author gratefully acknowledges funding received from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).,,57,115,128,1,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Building upon Fezzi et al. (2008), who assess the costs of Water Framework Directive-related measures on farm accounts data, we estimate regression models allowing such costs to be predicted for any region for which land use patterns and livestock numbers are known. We derive economic impacts in terms of changes in farm gross margin for (a) reducing inorganic fertilizer application, (b) reducing livestock stocking rates, and (c) converting arable land to ungrazed grassland. A case study of the agriculturally diverse Yorkshire Derwent catchment, in the North of England, demonstrates the overall approach. In addition, for this illustration, we combine these cost estimates with prediction of the water quality changes arising from each measure, derived via an integrated hydrological model of the Derwent. This allows a comparison of cost-effectiveness. Finally, we implement our spatially explicit approach to target the measures to specific subcatchments identified as being of particular environmental policy interest.","[Fezzi, Carlo; Bateman, Ian J.; Posen, Paulette; Hadley, David] Univ E Anglia, CSERGE, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Hutchins, Michael] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Bateman, Ian J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hillcrest 3216, New Zealand; [Bateman, Ian J.] Univ Western Australia, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of East Anglia; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); University of Manchester; University of Waikato; University of Western Australia,"Fezzi, C (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, CSERGE, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",c.fezzi@uea.ac.uk,"Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009; Hutchins, Michael G/K-3370-2012; Bateman, Ian J/F-8011-2010; Hadley, David/C-5924-2008","Hutchins, Michael/0000-0003-3764-5331; rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740; Bateman, Ian/0000-0002-2791-6137; Posen, Paulette/0000-0002-5154-5583; Fezzi, Carlo/0000-0002-4860-9128; Hadley, David/0000-0001-8634-2586",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-227-25-0024] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010022] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [RES-227-25-0024] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,24,25,0,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Based on a brief review of rural policies since the new century, the paper aims to investigate whether these policies are successful and discusses what the government should do next as well as how to improve the reform and development of rural economy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the framework of China's rural policy since 2000 in the first section. Then, the impact of the financial crisis on rural development is analyzed. In the third section, this paper discusses the new issues of current rural reform and development. Findings - The current rural polices are successful and have improved rural economic and social development greatly in the past six years. However, new problems have appeared such as insufficient funds for rural public services, inefficiency of agricultural subsidies, and unfair treatment of rural migrant workers and so on. The impact of the financial crisis on rural development is not as bad as anticipated. Originality/value - The paper reviews the main policies of China's agriculture and rural development and points out the new issues during the rural reform. The impact of the financial crisis on rural development is discussed also.

Given the present state of technology and input level, the possibility of enhancing production can be achieved by reducing technical inefficiency by 21 percent through adoption of practices of the best fish farm.","[Onumah, Edward Ebo; Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Hoerstgen-Schwark, Gabriele] Univ Gottingen, Dept Anim Sci, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Onumah, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Aquaculture Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Albrecht Thaer Weg 3, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",eonumah@gwdg.de,"Onumah, Edward Ebo/HLQ-0366-2023; Brummer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brummer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346",,,,,46,13,15,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Specifically this study looks at two agencies: the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture and the Agricultural Market Agency. Data were obtained from responses to a set of questions asked of the nationwide sample of 200 Polish farmers in December 2006-January 2007. The farmers' evaluations according to a range of statements about the agencies were measured using ten-point Likert scale. Partial Least Squares Path Modelling was employed to estimate the latent (theoretical) variables such as trust, image, performance, satisfaction etc. Additionally, descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages and means as well as correlation coefficients were applied. Evidence is presented that the trust of farmers in the institutions of state, represented here by two agricultural agencies, is statistically correlated with the image of the agencies, respondents' expectations and their satisfaction about the way the agencies work as well as with perceived value of the services and programmes provided by the agencies. Farmer's socioeconomic characteristics (gender, education, the period of their interaction with the agencies, farm size) did not relate to trust score with the exception of age. Causality analysis showed that trust towards both agencies was significantly impacted by their image with the customers. Trust had significant impact on the overall satisfaction with the ARMA.","Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Zawojska, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, 166 Nowoursynowska Str, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",aldona_zawojska@sggw.pl,"Zawojska, Aldona/C-9397-2011","Zawojska, Aldona/0000-0003-3668-0127",,,,,92,9,9,1,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The key theoretical result is that the marginal net benefits of increasing forest can be convex, in which case corner solutions-converting either none or all of the agricultural land in a section to forest-may be optimal. Corner solutions are directly linked to the spatial process determining habitat benefits and the regulator's incomplete information regarding landowner opportunity costs.

This article measures consumers' responses to apples enriched with an antioxidant coating. Antioxidant-enriched apples are believed to provide additional health benefits reducing the risk of cancer and heart diseases. We discuss the consumer's benefit-risk trade-offs. Although functional food products provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition, some consumers may reject them because they utilize new technology. Face-to-face consumer surveys with contingent valuation questions were conducted in Seattle and Spokane, Washington in 2006. Consumers who choose where to shop based on organic availability are less likely to pay a premium for apples enriched with antioxidants. Also, there is evidence that consumers in Spokane are more likely to pay a premium for the product than consumers in supermarkets in Seattle. Information regarding the potential health benefits of antioxidants has a positive significant effect on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). The estimated mean WTP suggests that there is a small premium associated with this product in the mind of an average consumer.","[McCluskey, Jill J.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [McCluskey, Jill J.] Washington State Univ, IMPACT Ctr, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Markosyan, Armenak] Econ One Res Inc, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA; [Wahl, Thomas I.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",Washington State University; Washington State University; North Dakota State University Fargo,"McCluskey, JJ (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",amarkosyan@econone.com; mccluskey@wsu.edu; tom.wahl@ndsu.edu,"Wahl, Thomas/D-3272-2013","Wahl, Thomas/0000-0003-2154-6742",PACE International; IMPACT Center at Washington State University.,PACE International; IMPACT Center at Washington State University.,The authors wish to thank without implicating Tom Marsh and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and Carolina Torres for scientific consultation.

The analysis centers on the adoption of hybrid wheat and hybrid pearl millet in India. In the local context, both crops are cultivated mainly on a subsistence basis, and they provide examples of hybrid technologies at very different diffusion stages: while hybrid wheat was commercialized in India only in 2001, hybrid pearl millet was launched in 1965. The analysis is based on surveys of wheat and millet farmers in the state of Maharashtra. Comprehensive data on farmer characteristics and social interactions allow for identifying individual networks, thereby improving upon previous research approaches that employed village-level variables as proxies for network effects. Using econometric models, we find that individual social networks play an important role for technology adoption decisions. While village-level variables may be used as suitable proxies at later diffusion stages, they tend to underestimate the role of individual networks during early phases of adoption.","[Matuschke, Ira] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Global Perspect Studies Unit, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Gottingen,"Matuschke, I (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Global Perspect Studies Unit, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",ira.matuschke@fao.org,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This article was developed while the first author was a PhD student at the University of Hohenheim, Germany.

Additionally, the paper employs the error-correction and the adjustment-cost model to test for differences in the investment behaviour between various farm categories. The results show that in general Russian farms exhibited an error-correcting behaviour in the period under investigation. From 1999 to 2005 the output-capital gap was closed by an average rate of 10% per year. Estimates of the adjustment-cost model show that Russian farm investments are very sensitive to the sales-capital ratio, suggesting that Russian farms exhibit increasing returns to scale and positive expectations about future revenues. Yet, such farm characteristics as ownership structure, access to input markets and also regional specifics were found to be decisive for farm investment not only in the short but long term too. Finally, the results show that the adjustment-cost model is adequate for the evaluation of differences in short-term investment behaviour, whereas it is noticeably less powerful for investigating differences in the farms' long-term investment behaviour.","[Bokusheva, Raushan] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Agri Food & Agri Environm Econ Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bezlepkina, Irina] LEI, Agr Econ Res Inst, Wageningen Ur, Netherlands; [Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Bokusheva, R (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Agri Food & Agri Environm Econ Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",bokushev@ethz.ch,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Bokusheva, Raushan/ABB-1198-2020","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Bokusheva, Raushan/0000-0002-3080-6270; Verweij-Novikova, Irina/0000-0002-6724-1875",,,,,63,9,9,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Most previous studies have used parametric methods, which require specific functional forms for retail demand, input supply and processors' cost equations. However, researchers often find that market power estimates from parametric methods are sensitive to the choice of functional forms and specifications. An application to data from cattle procurement experiments shows that our nonparametric approach greatly outperforms commonly used parametric methods in estimating the degree of market power. While parametric estimates are sensitive to functional form specification and are at least 90% smaller than 'true' market power indices, estimates from our nonparametric procedure deviate from the actual value by no more than 25%.","[Chung, Chanjin] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Tostao, Emilio] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Div Agr Econ, Maputo, Mozambique",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Eduardo Mondlane University,"Chung, CJ (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",chanjin.chung@okstate.edu,,,Oklahoma State University Agricultural Experiment Station,Oklahoma State University Agricultural Experiment Station,"Chanjin Chung is Associate Professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Oklahoma State University, and Emilio Tostao is Assistant Professor in the Division of Agricultural Economics at Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo, Mozambique.

A stochastic search procedure, compressed annealing, is used to identify profitable sets of weed management strategies in a simulation model representing a large number of potential combinations of chemical and non-chemical forms of weed control. In contrast to a continuous-cropping sequence, the inclusion of a serradella phase in a rotation is profitable at high weed densities and with increasing levels of herbicide resistance. A single year of pasture in the rotation is optimal if resistance to Group A selective herbicides is present at the beginning of the planning horizon, but a three-year phase is required if resistance to multiple herbicide groups is observed. Sowing a serradella pasture twice over a two-year phase is also shown to be economically attractive given benefits of successive high weed kills.","[Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Revell, Clinton K.] Dept Agr & Food Western Australia, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.; Revell, Clinton K.] CRC Australian Weed Management, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Doole, Graeme J.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Cooperat Res Ctr CRC Plant Based Management Dryla, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia; Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Doole, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",gdoole@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Revell, Clinton/AAB-1212-2019; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Doole, Graeme/0000-0002-6293-6491",,,,,32,11,11,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This paper formalizes three points on the matter. Statistical laws on aggregates do not imply a normal distribution. Whenever the weather-conditioned mean yield has diminishing marginal product with respect to a weather-conditioning index, then there is a disposition toward negative yield skewness. This is because high marginal product in bad weather stretches out the yield distribution's left tail relative to that for weather. For disaggregated yields, unconditional skewness is decomposed into weather-conditioned skewness plus two other terms and each is studied in turn.","[Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",,,,,,,,41,38,45,0,18,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Poverty in rural India has declined at a modest rate during this time period. We provide region-level estimates that illustrate considerable geographic heterogeneity in this progress. Poverty estimates correlate well with region-level NSS data on changes in agricultural wage rates. Agricultural labor remains the preserve of the uneducated and also to a large extent of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. We show that while agricultural labor grew as a share of total economic activity over the first four rounds, it had fallen back to the levels observed at the beginning of our survey period by 2004. This all-India trajectory also masks widely varying trends across states. During this period, the rural nonfarm sector has grown modestly, mainly between the last two survey rounds. Regular nonfarm employment remains largely associated with education levels and social status that are rare among the poor. However, casual labor and self-employment in the nonfarm sector reveals greater involvement by disadvantaged groups in 2004 than in the preceding rounds. The implication of this for poverty is not immediately clear-the poor may be pushed into low-return casual nonfarm activities due to lack of opportunities in the agricultural sector rather than being pulled by high returns offered by the nonfarm sector. Econometric estimates reveal that expansion of the nonfarm sector is associated with falling poverty via two routes: a direct impact on poverty that is likely due to a pro-poor marginal incidence of nonfarm employment expansion; and an indirect impact attributable to the positive effect of nonfarm employment growth on agricultural wages. The analysis also confirms the important contribution to rural poverty reduction from agricultural productivity, availability of land, and consumption levels in proximate urban areas.","[Lanjouw, Peter; Murgai, Rinku] Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",,"Lanjouw, P (通讯作者)，Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",planjouw@worldbank.org,,"Lanjouw, Peter/0000-0002-4150-7890",,,,,30,70,78,1,48,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Despite its capacity for solving constrained optimization problems under uncertainty, some methodological obstacles have persisted over the years. The main problem is that the eventually complex results of an unbiased statistical analysis (multiple correlated stochastic variables with different distributions and nonadditive links between) cannot be adequately accounted for within minimization of total absolute deviation (MOTAD) or expected value-variance (EV) models that rely on the algorithmic determination of the variability measure. In this paper, we develop a methodological hybrid consisting of Monte Carlo simulation and genetic algorithms: the Monte Carlo simulation facilitates the easy representation of diverse stochastic processes and correlation, and the genetic algorithm ensures that the optimization procedure remains applicable even in the case of complex stochastic information. This hybrid approach is applied to the production-planning problem of a German crop farm. Variant calculations are used to account for the unknown risk attitude of the farmer. Model results demonstrate that optimized production programs and expected total gross margins are not only highly sensitive to the risk attitude, but also to the stochastic processes that are estimated (or assumed) for various activities. We furthermore find evidence that the hybrid approach is able to generate considerable improvement in farm-program decisions and outperforms planning models that assume static distributions.","[Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Hirschauer, Norbert] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Fac Nat Sci 3, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, D-06108 Halle, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de; norbert.hirschauer@landw.uni-halle.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors thank two anonymous referees and the editor for helpful comments and suggestions.

Estimates of the effects of liberalising current agricultural trade restrictions indicate an approximately $385 billion increase in global welfare, with the disproportionate share of the benefit being enjoyed by developing countries. In response to difficulties in adopting agricultural trade reforms, individual groups of countries have formed multiple bilateral and regional preferential trade agreements (PTA) to enhance trade among members. Few sectoral analyses exist of the effects on agricultural and food product trade of PTAs. This research uses a gravity model to isolate the effects of various PTAs on both intra- and extra-bloc agricultural and food product trade for three time periods: 1995, 2000 and 2004. Findings strongly support PTA benefits in terms of increased intra-bloc trade in both sectors. The findings also generally support trade creation in agricultural products. PTA membership was also associated with food trade creation in most cases, although diversion was observed for several associations composed primarily of developing countries.","[Lambert, David; McKoy, Shahera] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Lambert, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",david.lambert@ndsu.edu,,,North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station,North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station,"David Lambert is Professor and Shahera McKoy former Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota.

The results also show that import restrictions directly undermine the effectiveness and increase the costliness of a higher consumption mandate in Canada. The relatively less expensive ethanol is for the final consumer, the more likely they will use it as fuel over available alternatives. The implication is that restricting imports of ethanol is counterproductive to the policy objective of increasing domestic ethanol consumption.","[Le Roy, Danny G.; Klein, K.

An MQS can enhance net welfare because it may correct for deficient production of high-quality product by the industry in the absence of an MQS, even though an MQS causes the destruction or diversion of low-quality products. However, any MQS imposed voluntarily by a profit-maximizing PCMO decreases the welfare of all consumers of the product and is also highly likely to reduce net (producer plus consumer) welfare.","[Saitone, Tina L.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",saitone@primal.ucdavis.edu; rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,"USDA, Economic Research Service; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics","USDA, Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support through a cooperative work agreement with the USDA, Economic Research Service, and the Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics, and the helpful comments of Pierre Merel, Danny Pick, and seminar participants at Michigan State University, Oklahoma State University, USDA Economic Research Service, University of California, Berkeley, and University of Florida.

Using household-level fixed effects, estimated yield functions from 1993 to 2003 confirm that FYM application directly increases crop productivity in upland cereals, but not in paddy rice. Complementary effects through an increase in the marginal product of inorganic fertilizer is observed for both paddy and upland cereals, especially where inherent soil fertility is low. Farmers' FYM use is responsive to changes in the price of FYM, but transport costs limit price transmission across space. Dairy sector development thus improves crop productivity, but only in the small area around the animals which limits the spread of FYM-based development strategy.","[Kajisa, Kei] IRRI, Manila, Philippines; [Kajisa, Kei] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Palanichamy, N.

The options include halting the decline, triage of some assets along the River or staying with the declining river system. To support decision-making, a survey was designed to elicit willingness to pay for improvements in environmental quality. Over 3000 Australians responded to this survey. The study focuses on key River Murray environmental quality indicators: the frequency of bird breeding along the River Murray, increasing native fish populations in the River Murray, increasing the area of healthy vegetation along the River Murray, and restoring water bird habitat in the Coorong. State/Territory models were jointly estimated using a panel multinomial logit error-components model. Willingness to pay estimates for improvements in environmental quality were calculated for the River Murray and the Coorong. Respondents were found to be willing to pay most for the Coorong and to improve waterbird breeding frequency.

Risk attitudes in turn may be affected by certain socioeconomic characteristics of producers. Using 2004 survey data from a cross-section of 130 Spanish rice farms, we estimate risk-aversion coefficients of farmers and investigate the influence of a series of socioeconomic variables on their risk attitudes. Our results show that farmers exhibit risk-averse behavior and that risk attitudes are related to a series of socioeconomic characteristics. In particular, the belief that the farm will continue after the producer retires is found to increase the degree of risk aversion, while age is found to have nonlinear effects on risk aversion. Off-farm income, especially from nonagricultural activities, is found to reduce risk aversion. Neither the educational level of the producer nor the presence of dependents on the household is found to have an effect on risk preferences. Regarding the production technology, we find that land, labor, and fitosanitary products are risk-reducing inputs, whereas capital, seeds, and fertilizer all increase risk.","[Wall, Alan] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain; [Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Valencia,"Wall, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain.",awall@uniovi.es,"Wall, Alan/L-1921-2017; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/C-2545-2011","Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/0000-0002-7129-5606","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion; FEDER [AGL2009-12553-C02-01, ECO2008-05908-C02-02/ECON]; Generalitat Valenciana [2009-098]",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the comments from three anonymous referees, which have contributed to significantly improving the article.

Nevertheless, this paper attempts an evaluation through the use of alternative data sources such as household surveys and geographic information, a strategy of identification of beneficiaries and control households based on spatial proximity to the projects' sites, and an econometric approach consisting of a double-differencing technique. The empirical analysis is guided and interpreted with the help of a theoretical model that considers the effects of an irrigation project on the distribution of production, employment and income for different types of landowners. The paper concludes that the irrigation projects implemented in Peru had a positive impact on intended beneficiary households, but not in the way it could have been simplistically expected. The project did benefit the poor but not by increasing production in their own small plots but by providing them with better employment opportunities in larger farms.","[Del Carpio, Ximena V.; Loayza, Norman] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Datar, Gayatri] Dalberg Global Dev Advisors, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank,"Del Carpio, XV (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",xdelcarpio@worldbank.org,,,,,,,18,7,9,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

We find that consumers have a similar qualitative assessment of brand value in different product categories across different locations. That is, consumers have a stronger preference and higher WTP for brands in consumer electronics, followed by clothing and then processed food, and the lowest in fresh produce. Furthermore, we simulate price premiums and market shares of brands relative to generic products in different categories. Simulation results suggest that brands in fresh produce have the highest price premium but lowest market share. Despite the similarities, the magnitude of WTP for brands as well as the simulated price premium and the corresponding market share in the same product category are location variant. The similarities and dissimilarities suggest validity of having global brand strategies adapted to local conditions, that is, the so-called thinking globally and acting locally strategy.","[Jin, Yanhong H.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zilberman, David] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Heiman, Amir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Rehovot, Israel; [Li, Ying] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Informat & Operat Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Jin, YHH (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",yjin@aesop.rutgers.edu,"heiman, Amir/S-1377-2016","heiman, Amir/0000-0002-8469-5211",BARD (Binational Agricultural Research and Development) [US-4096-08],BARD (Binational Agricultural Research and Development),"Jin, Zilberman, and Heiman acknowledge the funding support from BARD (Binational Agricultural Research and Development), under the project US-4096-08.

Interviews and surveys were conducted to estimate transaction costs faced by producers marketing through the Quebec milk marketing board in Canada and bilateral contracts in England and Wales in the United Kingdom using the measurement methodology of the cost of exchange. Our results show that the relative magnitude of transaction costs incurred by producers across both settings is quite low, which indicates that both hybrid coordination mechanisms minimize transaction costs in the dairy sector. However, results from the bilateral contracting setting indicate a strong heterogeneity of transaction costs levels among farmers. In that respect, the milk marketing board and its institutional setting would act as a collective insurance, pooling transaction costs and sharing them among producers. Our analysis leads to recommendations on bilateral contracting.","Wageningen Univ, Dept Business Adm Management Studies, NL-6700 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Royer, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Business Adm Management Studies, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",annie.royer@wur.nl,,"Royer, Annie/0000-0002-2704-7517",,,,,36,25,28,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In fact, these outcomes are typically uncertain. This article proposes a methodological approach to incorporate delivery uncertainty into benefit estimation based on stated preference methods. In the study design of a choice experiment survey on land-based climate change mitigation, we explicitly include delivery uncertainty as the risk that a proposed mitigation project fails to deliver emission savings. We find that respondents' preferences do not change significantly after being confronted with choices that included risk of failure. However, failure risk itself does have an important impact on the preferences for delivering emission reductions. We show that delivery uncertainty can have a large impact on stated preference estimation of benefits of public programmes. This result should condition conclusions drawn from ex-ante environmental cost-benefit analyses that make use of such benefit estimates.","[Glenk, Klaus] Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Colombo, Sergio] Ctr Camino Purchil, IFAPA, Area Econ & Sociol Agr, Granada, Spain",James Hutton Institute,"Glenk, K (通讯作者)，Scottish Agr Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",klaus.glenk@sac.ac.uk,"Glenk, Klaus/B-8743-2014; Colombo, Sergio/IXD-1645-2023; Colombo, Sergio/D-2143-2011","Glenk, Klaus/0000-0002-2472-0235; Colombo, Sergio/0000-0001-7307-9811",Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate (RERAD); Spanish Institute for Agricultural Research INIA [RTA2009-00024-00-00]; FEDER,Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate (RERAD); Spanish Institute for Agricultural Research INIA; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"Klaus Glenk was with the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen, UK and is now with the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC), Edinburgh, UK.

We then develop a semi-parametric panel data estimation to measure the effects of experience on the adoption of stacked varieties.

The demand for beer in the Czech Republic reacts more strongly to the changes in price than it does to the investments in advertising. The results suggest two implications for the policy-makers.

However, the passage of low-density zoning is often challenged by landowners who claim that through it, they lose their land's equity due to lower land values. We investigate whether low-density zoning impacts rural land value using arm's-length sales in Maryland's nine Eastern Shore counties. Using both a propensity score matching method and an instrumental variable approach, we find that low-density zoning has differentiated impacts.

It tests empirically the two hypotheses that, first, publicly funded research and development (R&D) in crop production is a significant determinant of total factor productivity (TFP) in the crop sector and, second, that its social rate of return is high. The statistical analysis applies error correction methods to national level time series data for Thailand, covering the period 1970-2006. Emphasis is given to public research in crop production, where most publicly funded agricultural R&D has occurred. The role of international research spillovers and other possible determinants of TFP are also taken into account. The results demonstrate that public investment in research has a positive and significant impact on TFP. International research spillovers have also contributed to TFP. The results support the finding of earlier studies that returns on public research investment have been high. This result holds even after controlling for possible sources of upward biases present in most such studies, due to the omission of alternative determinants of measured TFP. The findings raise a concern over declining public expenditure on crop research, in Thailand and many other developing countries.","[Suphannachart, Waleerat] Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Warr, Peter] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Kasetsart University; Australian National University,"Suphannachart, W (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand.",peter.warr@anu.edu.au,"suphannachart, waleerat/JHU-8339-2023","Suphannachart, Waleerat/0000-0001-7379-1681",,,,,53,26,29,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Using experimental data, a stochastic production relationship between yield and soil nitrate is estimated. Numerical results show that input uncertainty may cause farmers to overapply nitrogen. Survey data suggest that farmers are risk averse, but prefer small chances of high yields compared to small chances of crop failures when expected yields are equivalent. Furthermore, yield risk and yield variability are not equivalent.","[Paulson, Nicholas D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Babcock, Bruce A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Babcock, Bruce A.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Paulson, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",,,,,,,,34,27,38,1,22,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

This convergence is based upon neoclassical economic analysis of industrial organization. The role of empirical economic analysis, however, has not converged as rapidly as the conceptual model because different countries have different enforcement institutions and strategies. This article explains how antitrust enforcement has evolved over time from public agencies to a market for enforcement that admits private parties. Private party law suits, and especially class action law suits on behalf of groups such as farmers and consumers, is a mechanism for redressing the often superior legal and economic resources that defendant corporations have and public agencies do not have. Enforcement and the role of empirical analysis are compared in the United States and other countries. Examples of enforcement from different countries illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. Finally, some insights explain how economists function in enforcement and the attributes required for success.","Univ Connecticut, Food Mkt Policy Ctr, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Cotterill, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Food Mkt Policy Ctr, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

However, policy makers fear that a change in the pricing methods may cause income loss for some farmers, and that this income inequality may generate public discontent and policy inertia. The aim of this paper was to compare some pricing methods in order to measure their effects on income distribution. The analysis focuses on the income distribution among different types of farms, and the income distribution between different social groups (landowners, capitalists and workers) in the short term. A linear programing model based on expected utility theory is used to take into account the effect of commodity prices and rainfall variability, which are among the most relevant factors affecting farmers' income. According to the findings, water pricing schemes do not affect the income distribution among farm types, although a significant impact emerges on the distribution among social groups, and in particular on the wages of temporary workers.","[Giannoccaro, Giacomo] Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Policy, Cordoba 14014, Spain; [Prosperi, Maurizio] Univ Foggia, Dept Prod & Innovat Mediterranean Agr & Food Syst, I-71122 Foggia, Italy; [Zanni, Giacomo] Univ Ferrara, Dept Engn, I-44122 Ferrara, Italy",Universidad de Cordoba; University of Foggia; University of Ferrara,"Giannoccaro, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Policy, Campus Rabanales C5, Cordoba 14014, Spain.",es2gigig@uco.es,"Prosperi, Maurizio/B-1105-2011; Giannoccaro, Giacomo/K-6489-2014","Prosperi, Maurizio/0000-0003-0836-766X; Giannoccaro, Giacomo/0000-0001-5958-2648",,,,,27,19,21,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

A numerical example, based on previously used data, reveals that converting two land types into ethanol in Brazil satisfies our biofuel emissions test, whereas in the United States no land type satisfies our criterion.","[de Gorter, Harry] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Tsur, Yacov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Cornell University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"de Gorter, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, 447 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hd15@cornell.edu,,"Tsur, Yacov/0000-0001-6374-3838","Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture [NYC-121-7438]","Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","We are grateful to the editor and three anonymous referees of this journal for constructive suggestions and comments on a previous draft.

Immigration reform that legalizes farm workers could speed exits from the farm workforce, thus putting upward pressure on farm wages. Better enforcement of existing immigration laws would reduce the supply of farm workers, also putting upward pressure on wages. Producer response to higher wages depends, in part, on the availability of guest workers and alternatives to hand labor such as labor-saving machinery.","[Martin, Philip] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Calvin, Linda] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Martin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",plmartin@ucdavis.edu,"Martin, Philip/V-3354-2019",,,,,,41,11,19,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

This paper is concerned with the development of a set of indicators to be used in analyzing the group consensus in evaluating Yes-or-No type's decision problems. The opinions of the experts are in the form of a real number between 0 and 10 expressing the degree of answers Yes or No (0 for sharp No and 10 for sharp Yes). Two methods for obtaining the consensus indicators are developed. The first of them is based on configuring the one previously developed by (Ngwenyama et al. 1996), which is reviewed in this paper. The other one is an improved one that does not rely on the existence of the known or desired similarity significance levels or thresholds. A new measure of consensus is introduced, the standard deviation. An experiment is conducted to get acquainted with the relationship between the standard deviation of group decisions and one of the developed group consensus indicators, which measures the agreement level within the group of decisions. This research is intended to develop more consistent indicators and measures group consensus and position of each individual relative to others for Yes-or-No type group decisions. This is aimed at the exploitation of such important and relevant consensus information for developing a new consensus-based heuristic algorithm to combine the multiple experts' judgments or to be able to select the adequate combining criteria. Finally, the presented approach could be usefully utilized in critical Yes-or-No GDM problems in business and industry.","[Aly, Shady; Vrana, Ivan] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Informat Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Vrana, I (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16951 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",vrana@pef.czu.cz,"Aly, Shady/C-4812-2013; Vrana, Ivan/C-5085-2013","Aly, Shady/0000-0002-3348-5185; Vrana, Ivan/0000-0001-5920-5631","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 604070904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 604070904 - Information and knowledge support of strategic management and 2C06004 - Intelligent instruments for assessment of relevance of content of data and knowledge resources).",,6,1,1,0,4,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - A simple numerical global general equilibrium (GE) model of two regions (China and the rest of the world) and three commodities (agriculture, manufacturing goods, and services) is used to assess the impacts of agricultural output changes on the overall economy price changes. The numerical GE model of this paper consists of production, final consumption, and market clear conditions. The results are generated with the GE model calibrated to aggregated China's input-output tables of 1987, 1997, and 2005. Findings - The results suggest that China witnessed a declining influence of agricultural output changes on general price changes. The contribution of given agricultural output change on the general price change in 2005 was merely less than 60 percent of that in 1987, which in turn implies that macro policies targeting to curb general inflation via boosting agricultural output will be less effective as those of 20 years ago. Practical implications - China's policy makers should rely less and less on promoting agricultural output policies to fight against general inflation and should resort to non-agricultural policies. Originality/value - The paper argues that the influence of agriculture on the China's general price indices has been weakening along with China's economic development with a numerical GE model calibrated to aggregated China's input-output tables of 1987, 1997, and 2005.","[Liu, Xiaoyun] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Luo, Wanchun] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mao, Xuefeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiuqing; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiuqing; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Renmin University of China; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Liu, XY (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",liuxy@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,,,,,10,2,3,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The main contribution of the study is to provide empirical evidence for the coexistence of financial constraints and soft budget constraints (SBCs). This is of particular importance because credit constraints and SBCs have completely different economic effects. The lack of differentiation between these forms of capital market imperfections yields overlapping effects of financing on investment and may therefore cause a misinterpretation of econometric results. Our empirical analyses are based on an econometric estimation of the Euler investment equations for 529 large farms from three Ukrainian regions between 2001 and 2005. The results confirm that financial variables significantly influence farms' investment, providing empirical evidence of an imperfect capital market in Ukrainian agriculture. It turns out that credit constraints in the Ukrainian agricultural sector are more important than SBCs. We show that the estimated level of financial constraints for profitable farms with access to loans is higher if both types of capital market imperfections are appropriately distinguished.","[Zinych, Nataliya] Leibnitz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Odening, Martin] Humboldt Univ, Farm Management Grp, Fac Agr & Hort, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Zinych, N (通讯作者)，Leibnitz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",zinychnataliya@johndeere.com,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641",Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS); German Research Foundation (DFG),Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Irrigation and water trading plans are modelled for the three seasons of the irrigation year (spring, summer and autumn) via discrete stochastic programming, and contrasted against a perfect information base case.

Many of the urban wetlands are groundwater-dependent and excessive groundwater extraction and climate change have resulted in a decline in water levels in the wetlands. In order to inform decisions on conserving existing urban wetlands, it is beneficial to be able to estimate the economic value of the urban wetlands. Applying the Hedonic Property Price approach to value urban wetlands, we found that distance to the nearest wetland and the number of wetlands within 1.5 km of a property significantly influence house sales price. For a property that is 943 m away from the nearest wetland, which is the average distance to the wetland in this study, reducing the wetland distance by 1 m will increase the property price by AU$42.40. Similarly, the existence of an additional wetland within 1.5 km of the property will increase the sales price by AU$6976. For a randomly selected wetland, assuming a 20 ha isolated circular wetland surrounded by uniform density housing, the total sales premium to surrounding properties was estimated to be around AU$140 million (AU$40 million and AU$230 million).","[Tapsuwan, Sorada] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Policy & Econ Res Unit, Floreat, WA, Australia; [Ingram, Gordon] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Perth, WA, Australia; [Burton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Curtin University; University of Western Australia,"Tapsuwan, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Policy & Econ Res Unit, Floreat, WA, Australia.",sorada.tapsuwan@csiro.au,"burton, michael/A-9541-2009; Tapsuwan, Sorada/G-5869-2010","Tapsuwan, Sorada/0000-0002-8160-3828; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093",CSIRO,CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),This work was funded by the CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship.

The EU has made a commitment to allow duty-free and quota-free access to rice imports originating in the LDCs from September 2009 onward. The purpose of this article is to answer two questions: (1) does the inclusion of import tariffs lead to different estimated Armington elasticities? (2) when a discriminating tariff is introduced, what happens to the market share of large rice exporters to the EU, especially of poor countries? We present the Armington model, derived from a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function, and a non-homothetic CES utility functional form, which is more flexible. We then estimate the Armington model, with and without the inclusion of a tariff, and we compare the elasticities. Lastly, we model five scenarios with different discriminated import tariff rates to calculate the changes in the market access of large rice exporters to the EU. Our empirical results show the importance of non-homothetic preferences and import tariffs. Ignoring import tariffs and the non-homothetic parameter may produce results which are biased and of uncertain validity. Furthermore, the simulation findings demonstrate that, in spite of a large difference between import tariff rate of Suriname and other countries (scenario V), its market access would not change greatly. This may be caused by supply side problems like poor infrastructures, weak technology and small capacity production in LDCs.","[Huchet-Bourdon, Marilyne; Pishbahar, Esmaeil] Agrocampus Ouest, UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Huchet-Bourdon, Marilyne; Pishbahar, Esmaeil] INRA, UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France",Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; INRAE; Universite de Rennes,"Huchet-Bourdon, M (通讯作者)，Agrocampus Ouest, UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France.",marilyne.huchet-bourdon@agrocampus-ouest.fr,", AGROCAMPUS OUEST/O-6651-2016",", AGROCAMPUS OUEST/0000-0002-1800-4558; Pishbahar, Esmaeil/0000-0001-7826-5437",,,,,17,2,2,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

A vertical merger may solve the credibility issue of the mixed bundling commitment through third party licensing agreements in the conventional seed market.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Shi, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics Research Grant; USDA Hatch Grant,Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics Research Grant; USDA Hatch Grant,"This research was initially supported by Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics Research Grant, and then by USDA Hatch Grant.

It is shown that when export prices are negotiated in the exporter's currency, menu costs cause threshold effects in the sense that there are bounds within (outside of) which price adjustments are not (are) observed. Conversely, the pass-through is not interrupted by menu costs when export prices are denominated in the importer's currency. The empirical model focuses on pork meat exports from two Canadian provinces to the U.S. and Japan. Hansen's (2000) threshold estimation procedure is used to jointly test for currency invoicing and incomplete pass-through in the presence of menu costs. Inference is conducted using the bootstrap with pre-pivoting methods to deal with nuisance parameters. The existence of menu cost is supported by the data in three of the four cases. It also appears that Quebec pork exporters have some market power and invoice in Japanese yen their exports to Japan. Manitoba exporters also seem to follow the same invoicing strategy, but their ability to increase their profit margin in response to large enough own-currency devaluations is questionable. Our currency invoicing results for sales to the U.S. are consistent with subsets of Canadian firms using either the Canadian or U.S. currency.","[Gervais, Jean-Philippe] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Gervais, Jean-Philippe] N Carolina State Univ, CREA, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Larue, Bruno] CREA, Canada Res Chair Int Agri Food Trade, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Studies, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; Laval University,"Gervais, JP (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 4336 Nelson Hall,Box 8109, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",JP_Gervais@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,37,4,4,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Over the past several years, per capita wine consumption in China has doubled. Although off a relatively low base, this still represents a significant sales volume. At the same time, the wine industry in the country has been undergoing restructuring with China now emerging as a major producer in world terms. These developments have been occurring at a time when the global wine industry has become increasingly globalised with so-called new world (NW) suppliers challenging established European companies in existing and emerging wine markets. In this context, the paper aims to look at the possible threats as well as opportunities presented by China as a relatively new player in the market. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews recent production and consumption trends in the world wine market. The changing patterns and growing volume of global wine trade is then assessed in light of the significant structural changes occurring in the industry in both importing and exporting countries. Recent developments in the wine market in China are identified and possible future implications for the world market are discussed. Findings - NW wine producers are increasingly encroaching on traditional wine consuming markets and gaining advantage in new and growing markets. One result has been an expanding and increasingly competitive global market place. China, meanwhile, is seen to have considerable potential for growth in terms of wine consumption, while at the same time posing a possible threat to existing exporters in third markets. Originality/value Knowledge - of emerging trends in wine markets and likely future developments are important for industry participants as well as policy makers in countries where wine is an increasingly important traded commodity. The paper provides an important contribution to the understanding of the global nature of the wine industry and the potential influence of China as both a major producer and consumer of wine.","Univ Wollongong, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Thorpe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",michaelthorpe@uowdubai.ac.ae,,,,,,,21,31,35,2,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The main purpose of the legislation was to ensure that the entity responsible for the damage pays all costs for rectifying its consequences. If it concerns damage to natural environment, the operator must undertake measures for rehabilitation, replacement and regeneration of the damaged natural resources. The primary replacement, which returns the damaged natural resources to their original state, may be differentiated from complementary replacement as compensation in the case in which the primary replacement has not provided an adequate reparation, and finally compensatory replacement - compensation for the temporary loss of natural conditions. This paper aims at an analysis of the possible means for eliminating risks due to the liability for environmental damage caused by the actions of an operator whose activities potentially threaten natural environment and may cause the biodiversity damage, Risks are assessed with regard to the risk insurability criteria for potential damage to the natural environment. The importance of risk management is stressed in the sophisticated form known as the Enterprise Risk Management. Risk management is becoming increasingly important as a part of the Solvency II concept, currently in preparation, whose first and second pillars accentuate risk management in financial institutions and the consistent quantification of the obvious, hidden and potential risks.","Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Vávrová, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vavrova@mendelu.cz,"Vavrova, Eva/D-9670-2014","Vavrova, Eva/0000-0003-1055-8035","Ministry of Agriculture of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Agriculture of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,8,0,0,1,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We test Engel functions, using generalized method of moments procedures, to analyze the dynamics of monthly beef expenditure shares of a sample of Canadian households during years 2002 through 2005. From microlevel panel data which followed meat expenditures by Canadian households before and after the first three BSE cases, which were discovered in 2003 and 2005, it is seen that households' reactions to these followed a similar general pattern: households reduced beef purchase expenditures following the discovery of BSE but expenditures subsequently recovered. Following the initial BSE event, we identify an immediate negative impact on beef expenditures. However, in the case of the second two BSE events, this negative impact was not evident until two months after the BSE announcements. The results suggest that habit persistence initially limited households' reductions of beef purchases following the first BSE event. However, households with higher beef expenditure shares reduced expenditure more than others following the second two BSE events, suggesting that habitual patterns of high levels of consumption tended to change with the recurrence of these food safety events.","[Ding, Yulian; Veeman, Michele M.; Adamowicz, Wiktor L.] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Ding, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",yulian@ualberta.ca; michele.veeman@ualberta.ca; vic.adamowicz@ualberta.ca,,"Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",Genome Canada; Genome Alberta; Alberta Prion Research Institute; Alberta Livestock Industry; Consumer and Market Demand Network; PrioNet Canada,Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome Alberta; Alberta Prion Research Institute; Alberta Livestock Industry; Consumer and Market Demand Network; PrioNet Canada,"Funding support for this study was received from Genome Canada and Genome Alberta; additional funding for the data came from Alberta Prion Research Institute, the Alberta Livestock Industry Development Fund, and the Consumer and Market Demand Network.

Model diagnostics reveal that serious selection bias exists, justifying the use of a sample selection framework in stochastic frontier models. Results revealed that modern variety selection decisions are influenced positively by the availability of irrigation and gross return from rice and negatively by a rise in the relative wage of labour. Adoption of modern rice is higher in underdeveloped regions. Seasonality and geography/location does matter in adoption decisions. Stochastic production frontier results reveal that land, labour and irrigation are the significant determinants of modern rice productivity. Decreasing returns to scale prevail in modern rice production. The mean level of technical efficiency (MTE) is estimated at 0.82. Results also demonstrate that the conventional stochastic frontier model significantly overestimates inefficiency by three points (MTE = 0.79). Policy implications include measures to increase access to irrigation, tenurial reform and keeping rice prices high to boost farm returns and offset the impact of a rise in the labour wage which will synergistically increase the adoption of modern rice as well as farm productivity.","Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Rahman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",srahman@plymouth.ac.uk,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191",,,,,31,19,20,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Understanding the level of technical efficiency of food processing helps to decide whether efforts are warranted to improve this efficiency. Studies on China's technical efficiency of flour and rice processing are scarce. This paper fills this gap. Design/methodology/approach - With a unique set of firm-level survey data collected by China's State Statistical Bureau, this study adopts a stochastic frontier model to investigate the technical efficiency of flour and rice processing. Findings - The technical efficiency for both flour and rice processing is low in China, being only about 50 per cent. On average, rice processing firms have slightly higher technical efficiency than flour processing firms. It is also found that a significant proportion of firms experienced negative growth of technical efficiency during the time period of investigation. Originality/value - Each year, some 300 million tonnes of wheat and paddy rice are processed in China. Any small improvement in technical efficiency is translated into huge economic gains. Further, a tiny improvement in flour or rice output rate is equivalent to an enormous increase in food supply, contributing to China's food security. The paper confirms the need and potential to raise technical efficiency in China for wheat and paddy rice processing.","[Fu, Wen-Ge] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Fu, Wen-Ge] China Agr Univ, MBA Program, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Sun, Sizhong; Zhou, Zhang-Yue] James Cook Univ, Sch Business, Econ Discipline, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Zhou, Zhang-Yue] James Cook Univ, AusAsia Business Studies Program, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Fu, WG (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",fuwenge@caumba.com,,"Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X; Zhou, Zhang-Yue/0000-0001-6328-4109",,,,,28,3,3,2,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Data on agricultural disaster loss are collected based on hectares covered by natural disasters, hectares affected by natural disasters, and hectares destroyed by natural disasters using the standard process. Peak over threshold (POT) approach based on the extreme value theory is used to model the distribution of agricultural catastrophic loss, and value at risk (VaR) is used to assess agricultural catastrophic risk. Findings - This paper provides an approach for collecting agricultural loss data and modelling probability distribution of agricultural catastrophic loss, which is promising for agricultural catastrophic risk evaluating. As the quantified measurement of agricultural catastrophic risk, VaR is observed to be appropriate and feasible. Results of empirical research demonstrate that drought catastrophe negatively affects grain-production in the northeast region of China; in particular, the drought catastrophic risk is severe within a 100-year scenario and thus is expected to recur.

Nonetheless, RCTs suffer important and underappreciated pitfalls, some of which are intrinsic to the method when applied to economic problems, others that are the result of methodological boosterism. Among the pitfalls are ethical dilemmas, uncontrollable treatments that result in a 'faux exogeneity,' distortion of the research agenda, and a tendency to estimate interventions' abstract efficacy rather than their effectiveness in practice. We illustrate these points through the literature on smallholder capital access and productivity growth.

Moreover, partnership farms that are characterized by the most extensive form of collaboration, that is, that share all machinery with one or several other farms, display the highest average efficiency. In a two-stage procedure in which efficiency determinants are analyzed in the second stage, the bootstrap procedures suggested by Simar and Wilson (2007) are applied in addition to the conventionally used Tobit regression.

This article investigates farmers' preferences for different design options in a specific AES aimed at encouraging nitrogen fixing crops in marginal dry-land areas in Spain. We use a choice experiment survey conducted in two regions (Aragon and Andalusia). The analysis employs an error component random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity and correlation amongst the non-status quo alternatives.

Migration and remittances play an important role in transforming the structure of rural household income. This article examines the impact of rural-to-urban migration on rural poverty and inequality in a mountainous area of Hubei province using the data of a 2002 household survey. Since migration income is a potential substitute for farm income, we present counterfactual scenarios of what rural income, poverty, and inequality would have been in the absence of migration. Our results show that, by providing alternatives to households with lower marginal labor productivity in agriculture, migration leads to an increase in rural income. In contrast to many studies that suggest that the increasing share of nonfarm income in total income widens inequality, this article offers support for the hypothesis that migration tends to have egalitarian effects on rural income for three reasons: (1) migration is rational self-selection-farmers with higher expected return in agricultural activities and/or in local nonfarm activities choose to remain in the countryside while those with higher expected return in urban nonfarm sectors migrate; (2) households facing binding constraints of land supply are more likely to migrate; (3) poorer households benefit disproportionately from migration.","[Zhu, Nong] Univ Quebec, INRS UCS, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada; [Luo, Xubei] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; The World Bank,"Zhu, N (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, INRS UCS, 385 Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",nong_zhu@ucs.inrs.ca,,,,,,,80,84,97,2,112,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The data required in this research have been collected through the field survey and document analysis. The results of the estimation of marketing margin functions was obtained through utilizing of the combination of models including the Price Increase Model, Relative Price and Marketing Margin. The data analysis indicates that the farm-gate price and the harvest margin of dates are among the highly influential factors on the entire marketing margin. The retail-margin function is influenced by the retail price and the retailer cost and the wholesale margin function is affected by the wholesale price and the wholesaler cost. Calculation of the market transparency determination criteria shows that due to the fact that the total of the farm-gate price and marketing costs are less than the retail sale, there is a lack of transparency in the studied marketing channels which in turn resulted in the declining market efficiency.","[Bidabadi, Farhad Shirani] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Fac Agr Sci, Gorgan, Iran; [Abassian, Mojtaba; Ebrahimzadeh, Hussein] Chabahar Maritime Univ, Fac Econ, Chabahr, Iran",Gorgan University of Agricultural Science & Natural Resources,"Bidabadi, FS (通讯作者)，Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Fac Agr Sci, Shahid Beheshti St,POB 386, Gorgan, Iran.",farhadshirani@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical model is a three-period overlapping generations model where individuals go through three stages in their lives, namely, young, adult, and old. The model extends existing theoretical models by allowing the probability of premature death to differ for individuals at different life stages, and by allowing for stochastic technological advances. The empirical investigation focuses on the effect of HIV/AIDS on life expectancy and on the role of health in educational investments and growth. Potential endogeneity is addressed by using various strategies, such as controlling for country-specific time-invariant unobservables and by using the male-circumcision rate as an instrumental variable for HIV/AIDS prevalence Findings - The paper shows theoretically that an increased probability of premature death leads to less investment in human capital, and consequently slower growth. Empirically, the paper finds that HIV/AIDS has resulted in a substantial decline in life expectancy in African countries and these falling life expectancies are indeed associated with lower educational attainment and slower economic growth world wide. Originality/value - The theoretical and empirical findings reveal a causal link flowing from health to growth, which has been largely overlooked by the existing literature. The main implication is that health investments that decrease the incidence of diseases like HIV/AIDS resulting in increases in life expectancy through their complementarity with human capital investments lead to long run growth.","[Huang, Rui] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Fulginiti, Lilyan E.; Peterson, E.

Through the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, this study first constructs the index of the total-factor cultivated land efficiency (TFCLE) by taking the ratio of the actual cultivated land input to target the cultivated land input. next, we examine the determinants of inefficiency on the cultivated land use. Based on a province-level panel data over 1997-2006, the empirical estimates indicate that the TFCLE is moderate and fluctuates during the sample period, ranging from 0.601 to 0.713, suggesting room for efficiency improvement in chinese farmland use. The coastal regions are found to experience a significantly higher degree of the TFCLE compared with non-coastal regions. overall, there is no significant competition effect brought on by the WTO entry on promoting TFCLE, though this effect differs between the coastal and non-coastal regions. The second-stage regression results show that the natural and artificial disasters, flood, drought, and pollution are the the main causes of inefficiency. innovative activity and the FDI are evidenced to have a significantly positive relation with the TFCLE in chinese agriculture. We also find the positive TFCLE-enhancing the effects of production diversification and import competition.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli 320, Taiwan; [Wu, Leah] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Lin, Hui-Lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Central University; Macau University of Science & Technology; National Taiwan University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 320, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,23,17,21,3,56,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Using discrete-time dynamic programming techniques, we model optimal phosphorus loadings under both uncertainty about natural loadings and uncertainty regarding the critical level of phosphorus concentrations beyond which nutrient recycling begins. Active management is modeled by including the anticipated value of information (or learning) in the structure of the problem, and thus the agent can perturb the system (experiment), update beliefs, and learn about the uncertain parameter. Using this formulation, we define and value optimal experimentation both ex ante and ex post. Our simulation results show that experimentation is optimal over a large range of phosphorus concentration and belief space, though ex ante benefits are small in our example. Furthermore, realized benefits may critically depend on the true underlying parameters of the problem.","[Bond, Craig A.; Loomis, John B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Bond, CA (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B311 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",craig.bond@colostate.edu; john.loomis@colostate.edu,,,National Science Foundation Biocomplexity program; Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station,National Science Foundation Biocomplexity program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation Biocomplexity program and the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station, and thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for numerous helpful comments that greatly improved the manuscript.",,36,13,15,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Prospect theory is utilized as the main analytical framework and a structural model approach is developed to simultaneously correlate the parameters of the utility function under prospect theory with other socioeconomic variables. The key finding is that working in fishing makes economic agents less risk averse than others. Fishermen also tend to be less sensitive to probability weighting changes in the experiment.

Our empirical analysis is based on a reduced-form application of the dual model of investment under uncertainty developed by Sckokai, which is extended to a consideration of irregularities in the capital stock adjustment cost function. To do so we adopt the threshold regression methods proposed by Hansen. The econometric results support the existence of three regimes characterised by different economic behaviour. Our analysis suggests that in a dynamic setting that allows for irregularities in the capital adjustment cost function, decoupled transfers can have a powerful influence on production decisions. The dynamics of the stock of capital cause this influence to grow over time.","[Serra, Teresa; Gil, Jose M.] CREDA, UPC, IRTA, Castelldefels 08860, Spain; [Stefanou, Spiro] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Featherstone, Allen] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; IRTA; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Kansas State University,"Gil, JM (通讯作者)，CREDA, UPC, IRTA, Parc Mediterrani Tecnol,Edifici ESAB,Av Canal Oli, Castelldefels 08860, Spain.",chema.gil@upc.edu,"GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012; Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017","GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052; Stefanou, Spiro/0000-0001-8366-6577",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [AGL2006-00949/AGR],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),"The authors thank the editor, Paolo Sckokai, and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

We find that improvements in rule of law, control of corruption and government effectiveness enhance agricultural productivity significantly if each indicator enters the inefficiency equation independently. When all six indicators are included in the equation, we find that an improvement in rule of law raises agricultural efficiency significantly, but increases in voice and accountability and political stability appear to significantly reduce agricultural efficiency. Grouping the six indicators into three dimensions, we find that an improvement in 'respect for institutional framework' raises agricultural efficiency significantly, but an enhancement in 'selection of authority' reduces agricultural efficiency significantly. Our results imply that poorer countries can enhance their agricultural efficiency substantially by strengthening the state and citizens' respect for institutional framework. However, our results show that greater democracy is associated with lower agricultural efficiency. This finding is consistent with interest group capture and political failure arguments of the political economy literature.","[Lio, Mon-Chi] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Polit Econ, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; [Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Lio, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Polit Econ, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",mclio@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,"Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935","Taiwan's National Science Council [NSC 95-2415-H-110-002, NSC-952415-H-009-001]",Taiwan's National Science Council,"Mon-Chi Lio is based in the Department of Political Economy, National Sun Yat-sen University, 70 Lien-hai Rd., Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.

Typical features of Czech agriculture, i.e. the fragmentation of ownership of the agricultural land fund and the high share of leased agricultural land, which is a direct consequence of the socialistic large-scale production, continue even despite extensive legal changes after 1989. The changes in the Czech land law after 1989 brought about not only the legal guarantees for owners but also new problems, which are still necessary to solve. An important tool of the solution of the present Czech agriculture problems is represented by land adjustments. The membership of the Czech Republic in the European Union on one hand led to the simplification of land acquisition for some foreigners, however; on the other hand it has not influenced in principle the structure of landowners. Still in 2008, the questions of the atonement of property injustices are finished yet regarding the churches concerning agricultural and forest land. A new civil code, currently in process, which can influence some legal relations to the land, has not been put forward to the Parliament yet.","[Bartuskova, J.; Homolka, J.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bartusková, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",bartuskova@pef.czu.cz; homolka@pef.czu.cz,"Homolka, Jaroslav/H-6666-2018","Homolka, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5349-082X","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 60460709]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 60460709).",,18,4,4,1,9,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, the direct effects of such a tax, or equivalently, an emissions trading scheme, will vary across countries and sectors according to the emissions intensity of the sector. We report, for the first time, estimates of such livestock emissions intensities for all regions of the world and decompose the intensities to understand the sources of regional variation. Our findings indicate that most of the variation is due to differences in the value of output per animal in different regions, which in turn is due to regional differences in output per animal (yield) and dollar per unit output (price). Animals with relatively low annual output values tend to be characterized by higher economic emissions intensities. We find this to be the case in many developing countries. Livestock activity in these high emissions intensity regions are hit especially hard by an emissions tax, resulting in disproportionate reductions in output and consumption in many regions already suffering from malnutrition.","[Avetisyan, Misak; Golub, Alla; Hertel, Thomas] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Indiana, PA USA; [Rose, Steven] Elect Power Res Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Henderson, Benjamin] United Nations Food & Agr Org FAO, Rome, Italy",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Avetisyan, M (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Indiana, PA USA.",mavetisy@purdue.edu,"Golub, Alla/HJZ-5092-2023",,Purdue University; EPA,Purdue University; EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"Funding for this work was provided internally at Purdue University, although it builds on earlier EPA funded work.

Our results show increases in the farmers' gross margins when decoupled support is maintained equal to the amount of direct aid previously attributed to agricultural production, assuming unchanged prices. Land used for pasture increases at the expense of land used for cereals and protein crops. The extent to which these effects materialize depends on the policy options selected by Member States when implementing the Luxembourg agreement.

Currently, less than 60% of all the water used for irrigation is effectively used by crops. Based on the new version of the GTAP-W model we analyze the effect of potential water savings and the welfare implications of improvements in irrigation efficiency worldwide. The results show that a water policy directed to improve irrigation efficiency led to global and regional water savings, but it is not beneficial for all regions. The final effect on regional welfare will depend on the interaction of several different causes. For instance, higher irrigation efficiency changes opportunity costs and reverses comparative advantages, modifying regional trade patterns and welfare. For water-stressed regions the effects on welfare are mostly positive. For nonwater scarce regions the results are more mixed and mostly negative. The results show that exports of virtual water are not exclusive of water abundant regions.","[Calzadilla, Alvaro; Rehdanz, Katrin] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Calzadilla, Alvaro] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Tol, Richard S.

This article investigates the impact of an expanding biofuels industry on the mix and location of global livestock production. Surprisingly, we find that growth in the U.S. and EU biofuels industries results in larger absolute reductions in livestock production overseas than in those regions, due to the international transmission of grains prices which is offset locally by the lower cost of by-products. We also find that nonruminant production is cut more than ruminant livestock, because it is less able to use biofuel by-products in its feed rations. Implementing biofuel mandates increases cropland area, a large portion of which is estimated to come from reduced grazing lands. The biofuel producing regions are expected to reduce their coarse grains exports and increase imports of oilseeds and vegetable oils, while they increase their exports of processed feed materials. In sum, biofuel mandates have important consequences for livestock as well as crops, with net effects influenced by the important role of by-products in substituting for feedstuffs.","[Taheripour, Farzad; Hertel, Thomas W.; Tyner, Wallace E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Taheripour, F (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",tfarzad@purdue.edu,,,U.S. Department of Energy; Argonne National Laboratory; Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Argonne National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations,"The research reported in this article was partially supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, and Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.",,29,36,46,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Land consolidations also ensure the conditions for improvement of the ecosystem, protection and reclamation of land resources, waterway management and the increase of the ecological stability of landscape. All mentioned measures are collectively called the Common Measures, rural roads being one of the most significant of these measures as far as the ground accessibility is concerned. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Central Land Office (MZe, UPU) statistics, for instance in 2008, over 707.4 million CZK was spent on the common measures projects from the public funds. Of this sum, 82 per cent was spent on financing of the land accessibility projects - rural roads and objects on them. The Cost & Benefit Analysis (CBA) method was applied. The analysis explains step by step what benefits the investment projects bring and to whom, as well as what and from whom it takes something away. Thus defined effects and impacts are aggregated, converted into financial flows and included in the calculation of criteria indicators. These calculations enable to make decision whether the concerned project is in its consequences generally contributive. There is a difficulty in the method - it is applied ex-ante, which usually leads to the exaggerated input parameters, which may be significantly affected by a number of variable effects (time factor, socio-economic impacts, inflation rate, etc.). The ex-post application of the method cannot be objectively used due to the absence of the statistically processed input data for the analysis. Such data must be collected during the operational period of the realized investments. This is caused by the fact that these analyses consider lifetime of these investments in terms of 25-30 years. The UPU statistics, however, say that the operational period of most of realized common measures has not reached one half of their lifetime yet. The ex-ante analysis enables to evaluate the possible difficulty and the general benefit of projects, including their impact on the broad spectrum of subjects.","Agroprojekt PSO, Brno 63800, Czech Republic",,"Papousek, J (通讯作者)，Agroprojekt PSO, Sro Slavickova 840-1B, Brno 63800, Czech Republic.",jiri.papousek@agroprojektpso.cz,,,,,,,7,6,6,1,34,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The development of the biofuel production is partly influenced by the government support programs and partly by the development of oil prices. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the statistical relationship between ethanol, gasoline and crude oil prices. We aim to check the correlation among these variables and to analyze the strength and direction of a possible linear relationship among the variables. We are interested in analyzing how each variable is related to another, so we evaluate the inter-relationship among the variables in the Vector Autoregression (VAR) and the Impulse Response Function (IRF). In order to achieve our goal, we first collected weekly data for each variable from January, 2000 to October, 2009. The results provide evidence of the cointegration relationship between oil and gasoline prices, but no cointegration between ethanol, gasoline and ethanol, oil prices. As a result, we used a VAR model on first differences. After running the Impulse Response Function, we found out that the impact of the oil price shock on the other variables is considerable larger than vice versa. The largest impact of oil price shock was observed on the price of gasoline.","[Pokrivcak, Jan; Rajcaniova, Miroslava] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Pokrivcak, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",Jan.Pokrivcak@fem.uniag.sk; Miroslava.Rajcaniova@fem.uniag.sk,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Rajcaniova, Miroslava/GNP-5216-2022","Rajcaniova, Miroslava/0000-0003-4688-7690",,,,,26,28,31,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a threshold autoregressive (TAR) model and momentum-TAR (M-TAR) model that test the prices of futures and spots in the special trading system. Findings - The paper indicates that during different stages of the economic cycle, agricultural futures and the agriculture index exhibit different correlations. During the initial stages of economic upturns and downturns, the addition of futures of agricultural products helps to diversify risk. In contrast, during the late stages of economic upturns and downturns, such additions do not really help to diversify risk. Soybean meal futures and the agriculture index are more strongly correlated with each other. If investors use soybean meal futures to predict the trends in the agriculture index, they will obtain more accurate conclusions. Practical implications - The soybean futures have leading effects in a single range and a lower correlation with the agriculture index. This paper provides a point of reference for investors devising investment strategies and for the Chinese, Government in its execution of macro-control policies. It provides a clear review about the estimation methods. It also provides information about China's soybean, soy meal industry. Originality/value - The paper contains updated information about China's soybean and soybean meal trading. It uses new estimation methods (TAR, M-TAR) to examine the co-integration between soybean, soybean meal and the agricultural index.","[Wang, Yu-Shan] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lin, Chung-Gee] Soochow Univ, Dept Financial Engn & Actuarial Math, Taipei, Taiwan; [Shih, Shih-Chieh] Jih Sun Secur Corp, Capital Market Div Trading Dept, Taipei, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Soochow University,"Wang, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",yushan@nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,13,3,3,4,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

J,"Biggar, D",,,,"Biggar, Darryl",,,Exit fees and termination fees revisited: funding irrigation infrastructure in a manner compatible with water trade,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,exit fees; irrigation infrastructure charges; sunk complementary investments; termination fees,,"It has long been recognised that the mechanism for funding irrigation infrastructure in Australia may be incompatible with efficient trade in the rural water market. If the revenue received by an irrigation operator is dependent on the volume of water entitlements held in the operator's region, out-of-region permanent water sales threaten the operator's revenue stream, potentially leading to higher charges on remaining irrigators, encouraging an inefficient 'rush for the exit'. In response, irrigation operators have imposed restrictions on permanent water trade, such as exit fees and termination fees, to protect their revenue stream. Previous economic analysis has suggested that exit fees, in particular, are a barrier to efficient trade in the water market and should be abolished. In contrast, this paper argues that allowing irrigators to cancel their water delivery rights without fees or charges leads to inefficient trade in the water market, hinders efficient on-farm investment in sunk complementary assets and leads to inefficient network rationalisation decisions. Instead, the revenue stream of irrigation operators should be insulated from water trade decisions, through high termination fees, tying irrigation charges to the land, or tagging the obligation to pay delivery charges to the new owner of the traded water.",,,,darryl.biggar@stanfordalumni.org,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The objective of this article is to identify existing and emerging supply sources for UK fresh produce importers and examine the extent to which they could provide invasion pathways. We tested the hypothesis that increased imports of fresh produce from new sources outside the European Union could increase the risks of non-indigenous insect pests. We use a bio-economic model approach in which the number of species arrivals is a function of the volume of imports, whereas the volume of imports itself is a function of gross domestic product, relative import prices and seasonality. The study has identified clear trends, which show import volumes of fresh produce and species detections increasing from new supply sources. If this trend continues in the future, then the UK inspection agency should expect to confront species from new suppliers in much greater numbers, given that import volumes of fresh produce are income elastic.","[Mwebaze, Paul; Monaghan, Jim; Hare, Martin] Harper Adams Univ Coll, Crop & Environm Res Ctr, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England; [Mwebaze, Paul; Spence, Nicola; MacLeod, Alan] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England",Harper Adams University; Food & Environment Research Agency,"Mwebaze, P (通讯作者)，Harper Adams Univ Coll, Crop & Environm Res Ctr, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England.",paul.mwebaze@fera.gsi.gov.uk,"MacLeod, Alan/AAO-7539-2020; Mwebaze, Paul/J-5905-2013","MacLeod, Alan/0000-0003-1606-5207; Monaghan, James/0000-0003-1784-4907",,,,,72,5,6,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The results of analysis have proved worsening of economic position of the second stage of processing (bakeries) in comparison with the first stage of processing (mills) within the commodity chain in the last time, especially as a result of increasing market power of retail.

Where landholders are unfamiliar with conservation tender processes and the supply of environmental services, they may find it very difficult to construct bids in this way. Bid values may be influenced by other factors, such as concerns about winner's curse, a desire to capture economic rent, and premiums for risk and uncertainty factors. Sealed, single round auctions may exacerbate information gaps and uncertainty factors because of the limited information flows compared to traditional market exchanges and open, ascending auctions. In this paper, the cost efficiencies of a multiple bidding round auction for landholder management actions are explored with the use of field experiments and a conservation auction. The case study application is improved grazing management in a rangeland area of Australia, where landholders are unfamiliar with supplying environmental services or conservation auctions. Results suggest that multiple round auctions may be associated with efficiency gains, particularly in initial rounds.","[Rolfe, John] CQUniv Australia, Fac Business & Informat, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [Windle, Jill] CQUniv Australia, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [McCosker, Juliana] Queensland Environm Protect Agcy, Emerald, Qld 4720, Australia",Central Queensland University; Central Queensland University,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，CQUniv Australia, Fac Business & Informat, Bruce Highway, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au; j.windle@cqu.edu.au; juliana.mccosker@epa.qld.gov.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040",Burdekin Dry Tropics regional natural resource management group.,Burdekin Dry Tropics regional natural resource management group.,"The design phase of the research reported in this paper is based on a research project funded by a partnership of the Australian and State Governments through round one of the National Market-Based Instruments Pilots program.

Based on a choice experiment on consumers' stated preferences for genetically modified food that provides for voluntary information access, this study allows information access decisions to be endogenous to the product choice decision-making process. Instead of assuming correlated error terms between these decisions, the approach used in this analysis builds upon structural correlations between two models that individually consider each of these two decisions. We find that the two types of decisions are related and that there is heterogeneity across individuals in the nature of this relationship.","[Hu, Wuyang] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Adamowicz, Wiktor L.; Veeman, Michele M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Kentucky; University of Alberta,"Hu, WY (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",wuyang.hu@uky.edu; vic.adamowicz@ualberta.ca; michele.veeman@ualberta.ca,,"Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",Genome Canada; Genome Alberta; Alberta Agricultural Research Institute,Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome Alberta; Alberta Agricultural Research Institute,"The authors appreciate helpful comments by two anonymous reviewers.

Economic analysis often overlooks the agreement's legally important distinctions. Few domestic support issues lead to dispute settlement proceedings. The Doha negotiations would result in more constraints on domestic support than the sole commitment on Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) in the present agreement: ceilings on overall trade-distorting support and blue box payments, and also product-specific caps. Some 18 members would reduce their Total AMS commitments, and 25 would reduce the de minimis percentages. Most members would not reduce their constraints at all or only little. If today's developing countries continue to grow as they did in recent decades, their capacity to support agriculture increases significantly. If they then choose to support agriculture as today's developed countries did at the same stage of economic development, the future WTO constraints on trade-distorting domestic support would allow them to provide considerably more such support than developed countries.","[Brink, Lars] Canadian Agr Econ Soc, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C5, Canada; [Brink, Lars] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C5, Canada",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Brink, L (通讯作者)，Canadian Agr Econ Soc, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C5, Canada.",Lars.Brink@agr.gc.ca,,,,,,,31,11,11,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The assessment of the impacts of the accession to the EU is based on an analysis of the commodity and territorial structure of Czech agricultural foreign trade. The comparison of agricultural balance before and after the accession to the EU for our major trading partners shows that the active balance of the CR with Slovakia increased to 12.0 billion CZK per year; on the contrary, in relation to Poland, the trade deficit of 6.4 billion CZK per year was recorded while Germany strengthened its position in relation to the CR by an increase in the negative balance to 5.4 billion CZK and in relation to Austria, our adverse balance is maintained at the level of 1.1 to 1.2 billion CZK per year for a long time.

Changes to the governance structures consistent with the increased interdependence within broad rural-urban regions will improve the region's competitiveness; adopting fad-based approaches and policies aimed at picking winners will be less fruitful.

It utilizes a new, and large, panel dataset collected from treatment and control households from 1997 to 2005. The data enables us to identify continuing participants in the program as well as newcomers and leavers. We employ different estimation strategies including difference-in-difference-in-difference and propensity score matching methods to control for selection bias. The impact estimates indicate that the benefits from microcredit vary more than proportionately with the duration of participation in a program. Larger benefits are realized from longer-term participation, and the benefits continue to accrue beyond departure from the program. The findings indicate the need to observe longer periods of participation to provide a reliable basis for assessing the effectiveness of microcredit lending.","Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield E Melbourne, Australia",Monash University,"Islam, A (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield E Melbourne, Australia.",,"de Groot, M/A-2025-2012","Islam, Asadul/0000-0002-0928-0454",,,,,35,29,32,3,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

By data analyzing and evaluating of the agricultural land purchases/sales, there was taken into consideration the fact that the average price of the sold estates is to a large extent influenced by their size, location and the purpose of further utilisation. The estates of small area characterized as agricultural land are selling for the highest prices, but they already figure in the development studies and the land-use plans of the villages or they are regarded as building estates in the future. Therefore, the sold estates were divided into two categories in accordance with the expected further land utilization. As the estates for further agricultural utilization, there were considered the estates with the area above 1 hectare of agricultural land. In the case of smaller estates, it is assumed that they will be of building, recreational, sporting or other utilization after the landowner change.","Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia",,"Buday, S (通讯作者)，Res Inst Agr & Food Econ, Trencianska 55, Bratislava 82480, Slovakia.",stefan.buday@vuepp.sk,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,8,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This research aim is to create a plan for a new development of such strategic alliances on the basis of results of the localization factors. The coefficient of localization is used for the identification of the cluster. The results are compared with the already operating associations for the appellation in Austria (DAC). There were traced changes in the consumer preferences in the Czech wine market. Consumers are placing more emphasis on the selection of wine on its descent from a particular area, the growing community and the individual grower. The dynamic development of the wine category, major changes in the market and the consumer demand are the main causes for the formation of associations of small and medium-sized wineries. This paper specifically introduces new associations for the appellation system VOC. This alliance is described in the context of the establishment, operation, development and expansion, respectively the possibility of the involvement of additional organizations suppliers and research institutions. The application of the results of research was a plan for the establishment of a new alliance VOC Modre Hory, where there are associated 30 wine producers of wine in 5 villages around the centre Velke Pavlovice. Based on the experience of the newly emerging VOC system of appellations, there was set up a plan of formation of the association with the proposed methodological approach. Open cooperation between the associations VOC appellation and other entities involving suppliers, customers, research institutions and universities has the possibility of creating an institutionalized wine cluster. The plan to create a wine cluster was proposed to establish the cooperation between the newly emerging associations of the VOC at three sub-regions of South Moravia, in order to achieve a competitive advantage.","[Tomsik, Pavel; Prokes, Martin] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Tomsík, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",tomsik@mendelu.cz; martin.prokes.umo@mendelu.cz,"Prokeš, Martin PROQIN/B-2063-2018",,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,19,5,6,0,20,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The increasing business activity in the period of interest is not accompanied by the appropriate financial effects. Food industry enterprises achieved a positive financial result for most of the years in the given period, but with modest profit rates (0.15-3.18%). Net working capital covers only 42.5% in average of the base stock, indicating an unfavourable financial structure and serious liquidity problems. An unacceptably high level of indebtness has been achieved (58.1%), which significantly reduces financial results due to the high financing expense.

More knowledge about the determinants of part-time farming and its effects on farm performance could help policymakers to introduce better targeted rural development policies. The aim in this article is to fill part of the above-mentioned gaps by analyzing factors that influence the choices of off-farm work by either the farmer alone or jointly by both the farmer and partner; and simultaneously examining how off-farm work influences farm performance. These analyses were based on an unbalanced panel data set from Norwegian grain farms during 1991 to 2005. Among the determinants of off-farm work hours, we found that, in addition to demographic, time trend, and some regional effects, there was a significant negative effect of farm output on farmers' off-farm work hours. The production function results revealed that off-farm work had a positive effect on farm output, at first increasing but then decreasing with increase in hours spent in off-farm work. Furthermore, our analysis revealed no systematic effect of off-farm work on farm technical efficiency.","[Lien, Gudbrand] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Lien, Gudbrand] Lillehammer Univ Coll, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Hardaker, J.

An econometric version of the model is estimated using a panel data set on Greek olive producers.

Across several meta-regression specifications, we find significant differences in income elasticities tied to the type of meat being studied, as well as a few functional forms, data aggregations, publication characteristics, and locations of demand.

Further, the relatedness of crop production and price responses among crops differs considerably across insurance products and strategies. As a result, insurance strategies that might provide the maximum risk reduction for an individual crop do not necessarily carry over to the multicrop case.","[Woodard, Joshua D.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Sherrick, Bruce J.; Schnitkey, Gary D.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Woodard, JD (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",jdwoodard@tamu.edu,,,,,,,23,7,9,2,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

In the case of food, this is often attributed to limited budgets. We investigate another possibility, motivated by the fact that smoking is more prevalent among those with low incomes, despite the cost. We develop a model in which income serves both as a budget constraint and as a source of future utility. We test the model by estimating logistic models of beginning and quitting smoking. We find support for the idea that low-income consumers make less healthy choices because they face lower costs in terms of forgone future utility.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Binkley, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,44,11,17,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Government mandates are superior to consumption subsidies, especially with suboptimal fuel taxes and the higher costs involved with raising tax revenues. But subsidies with mandates cause adverse interaction effects; oil consumption is subsidized instead. This unique result also applies to renewable electricity that faces similar policy combinations. Ethanol policy can have a significant impact on corn prices; if not, inefficiency costs rise sharply. Ethanol policy can increase the inefficiency of farm subsidies and vice-versa. Policies that discriminate against trade, such as production subsidies and tariffs, can more than offset any benefits of a mandate. Sustainability standards are ineffective and illegal according to the WTO, and so should be re-designed.","[de Gorter, Harry; Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"de Gorter, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",hd15@cornell.edu,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012",,"Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture [NYC-121-7438]","Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This research was supported by the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station federal formula funds, Project No. NYC-121-7438 received from Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Our study highlights the potential and the possible pitfalls of using nonmarket valuation techniques as an input into public decision making where traditional resource use interacts with public health and environmental concerns in complex ways.","[Weldesilassie, Alebel B.] EDRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Froer, Oliver] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany; [Boelee, Eline] Int Water Management Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Dabbert, Stephan] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Farm Management, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); University Hohenheim,"Weldesilassie, AB (通讯作者)，EDRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",,,"Boelee, Eline/0000-0001-7660-5602",,,,,32,25,28,1,15,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Riparian buffers impose a restriction on the use of private property limiting harvest and development, but buffers can also provide for aesthetic and recreational benefits that may accrue to property owners. With data from the Neuse River Basin in North Carolina, this study attempts to provide empirical evidence on the effect of a mandatory buffer rule on the value of riparian properties. Spatial autoregressive hedonic models are estimated within a quasi-experimental framework using the imposition of the buffer rule as the treatment and nonriparian properties as a control group. Results indicate that a riparian property generally commands a high premium. We find no evidence, however, that the mandatory buffer rule has had a significant impact on riparian property values when compared with the control group.","[Bin, Okmyung; Landry, Craig E.; Meyer, Gregory F.] E Carolina Univ, Coastal Resources Management Program, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,,,,,ECU,ECU,"Thanks are due to two anonymous reviewers, Erik Lichtenberg, Paul Chambers, Lynne Lewis, and seminar participants at University of Georgia, the Southern Economic Association 2007 Annual Meetings and the First Annual Meeting of the Society for Benefit Cost Analysis in 2008 for their helpful comments.

Using data from maize plots operated by small farmers in western Kenya, we find a von Liebig-type relationship between soil organic matter (SOM) and maize yield response to nitrogen application. Low SOM commonly limits the yield response to mineral fertilizer application. Although fertilizer is, on average, profitable in our sample, on roughly one-third of the plots degraded soils limit the marginal productivity of fertilizer such that it becomes unprofitable at prevailing prices. Moreover, because poorer farmers most commonly cultivate soils deficient in SOM, fertilizer interventions might be less pro-poor than is widely assumed and may instead reinforce ex ante income inequality.","[Marenya, Paswel P.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Nairobi; Cornell University,"Marenya, PP (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Dept Agr Econ, Nairobi, Kenya.",,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",National Science Foundation [BCS-0215890],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors acknowledge with gratitude support from the Rock-efeller Foundation, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Leadership Enhancement in Agriculture Program (LEAP), and the Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program of the Biocomplexity Initiative of the National Science Foundation, through grant BCS-0215890.

Biofuel tax credits always reduce fuel prices. Tax credits result in lower fuel prices than under a mandate for the same level of biofuel production. If tax credits are implemented alongside mandates, then tax credits subsidize fuel consumption instead of biofuels. This contradicts energy policy goals by increasing oil dependency, CO(2) emissions, and traffic congestion, while providing little benefit to either corn or ethanol producers.

A water balance model is used to predict reduced basin inflows for mild, moderate and severe climate change scenarios involving 1, 2 and 4 degrees C warming, and predict 13, 38 and 63% reduced inflows. Impact on irrigated agricultural production and profitability are estimated with a mathematical programming model using a two-stage approach that simultaneously estimates short and long-run adjustments. The model accounts for a range of adaptive responses including: deficit irrigation, temporarily following of some areas, permanently reducing the irrigated area and changing the mix of crops. The results suggest that relatively low cost adaptation strategies are available for a moderate reduction in water availability and thus costs of such a reduction are likely to be relatively small. In more severe climate change scenarios greater costs are estimated. Adaptations predicted include a reduction in total area irrigated and investments in efficient irrigation. A shift away from perennial to annual crops is also predicted as the latter can be managed more profitably when water allocations in some years are very low.","[Connor, Jeff; King, Darran; Kaczan, David] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, CSIRO Water Healthy Country Natl Res Flagship & P, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Connor, Jeff; King, Darran; Kaczan, David] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Econ Res Unit, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Schwabe, Kurt] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Kirby, Mac] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of California System; University of California Riverside; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Connor, J (通讯作者)，CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, CSIRO Water Healthy Country Natl Res Flagship & P, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",jeff.connor@csiro.au,"Connor, Jeff/T-7345-2019; King, Darran A/G-3996-2011; connor, jeffery/G-5466-2010; Kirby, John M/D-2249-2013","connor, jeffery/0000-0002-2313-8630; Schwabe, Kurt/0000-0002-3402-1411",,,,,32,62,65,0,24,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Model diagnostics reveal that serious selection bias exists, justifying use of a sample selection framework in stochastic frontier models. Results from the probit variety selection equation reveal that gross return (mainly powered by significantly higher Jasmine rice price), access to irrigation and education are the important determinants of choosing Jasmine rice. Results from the stochastic production frontier reveal that land, irrigation and fertilisers are the significant determinants of Jasmine rice productivity. Significantly lower productivity in Phitsanulok and Tung Gula Rong Hai provinces demonstrate the influence of biophysical and environmental factors on productivity performance. The mean level of technical efficiency is estimated at 0.63 suggesting that 59% [(100 - 63)/63] of the productivity is lost due to technical inefficiency. Policy implications include measures to keep Jasmine rice price high, increase access to irrigation and fertiliser availability, as well as investment in education targeted to farm households which will synergistically increase adoption of Jasmine rice as well as farm productivity.","[Rahman, Sanzidur] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Wiboonpongse, Aree; Chaovanapoonphol, Yaovarate] Chiang Mai Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand; [Sriboonchitta, Songsak] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand",University of Plymouth; Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University,"Rahman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",srahman@plymouth.ac.uk,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191","Leverhulme Study Abroad; Thailand Research Fund (TRF), Thailand.","Leverhulme Study Abroad(Leverhulme Trust); Thailand Research Fund (TRF), Thailand.(Thailand Research Fund (TRF))","Sanzidur Rahman is with the School of Geography, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.

Initial tests of the validity of the approach have either compared benefit estimates generated using CEs with those estimated using contingent valuation (CV) or used more sophisticated hypothesis tests of parameter equality. Although useful, existing tests have been restricted to testing consistency based on a single policy scenario (standard CV). We argue that, although these tests are informative, they fail to take full advantage of the richness of CE data. In particular, CE data allow for the calculation of benefit estimates over a range of policy scenarios (i.e. attribute combinations). A similar range of benefit estimates may be generated by pooling scenarios in a repeated CV study. In this paper, we explore this relationship between CV and CEs by conducting validity tests between a CE model and a repeated CV model over a range of three levels of improved water quality at Clear Lake, IA, USA. Evidence from this test suggests that the CE and CV data are consistent.","[Christie, Mike] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales; [Azevedo, Christopher D.] Cent Missouri State Univ, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA","UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Institute of Biological, Environmental, Rural & Sciences (IBERS); Aberystwyth University; University Central Missouri","Christie, M (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales.",mec@aber.ac.uk,"Christie, Michael/AAN-6021-2020","Christie, Michael/0000-0002-8346-9140",,,,,27,28,34,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

J,"Arnason, R",,,,"Arnason, Ragnar",,,Conflicting uses of marine resources: can ITQs promote an efficient solution?,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,commercial and recreational fishing conflicts; conflicting use of marine resources; conservation quotas; fishing and conservation conflicts; ITQs,,"This paper examines the allocation problem arising from conflicting demands for marine resource use by (i) commercial fishers, (ii) recreational fishers, and (iii) conservationists. It is shown that decentralised trading of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) is capable of an efficient allocation of resource use between the first two parties. In contrast, it is found that the standard ITQ system is not capable of performing the same ideal co-ordination between the conflicting interests of extractive users, that is, all fishers, and the non-extractive ones, that is, conservationists. The reason is that quota trades between individual fishers and conservationists are inevitably accompanied by (positive) externalities on both other fishers and conservationists. As a result, decentralised quota trades between these parties cannot be efficient. The fundamental economic observation is that quotas for conservation and for extraction constitute two different goods. It follows that a socially optimal market allocation of these two goods requires two prices instead of the single quota price in the standard ITQ system. Thus, to achieve efficiency, the ITQ system has to be extended to incorporate both types of goods. It is shown in the paper that if fishers and conservationists can organise themselves into groups, trades of conservation quotas between the two groups can in principle lead to fully efficient allocation. An interesting implication of this modified ITQ system is that the need for a fisheries authority to set the total allowable catch (TACs) disappears.","Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Arnason, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland.",Ragnara@hi.is,,,,,,,23,15,21,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1364-985X,,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Based on the brief review of policy changes since the new century, the purpose of this paper is to figure out the comprehensive policy framework, and analyze its background and reasons. Design/methodology/approach First, this paper offers a brief review of China's rural reform with focus on the policy framework and changes since the reform of rural tax and fee system in 2000. Next, the paper focuses on food security to discuss grain price increase and China's grain imports, then the current problems facing China's agricultural and rural development are discussed and countermeasures provided. Findings The paper finds that several policies have been implemented toward the coordination between urban and rural areas and toward the integration of urban and rural development. However, China's grain production is still facing big challenges, both from the increasing demand and the resource constraint. Therefore, food security should be given priority in future. China's current rural reform and development is also facing the problems such as slow growth of farmer's income, the impacts of migrant rural labourer on economy and society and the outflow of rural resources. Originality/value This paper reviews systematically major policies of China's agriculture and rural development, and analyzes the characteristics of and reasons for China's grain price increase. Meanwhile, the constraint of resources, especially land and water, is also studied in detail. The paper's analysis can provide important advice for future policy making.","China Agr Univ, CRDP, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Chen, XW (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, CRDP, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,46,49,4,109,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.

Assets aid in exiting poverty, not independent of one another, but rather in combination. We develop an approach to estimate the complementarities between education, farm size and infrastructure. Limited access to the three assets of interest here (susceptible to medium-and long-term interventions) might prevent moving a large number of small farmers out of poverty in the short-term (even with support programs). Increased land holding often has lower poverty-reducing potential, and when its potential is high, it is in countries where most land is divided among small operations (for example, Bangladesh). Education is confirmed as highly poverty-alleviating, and has a high complementarity with infrastructure.","[Foster, William; Valdes, Alberto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Davis, Benjamin; Anriquez, Gustavo] FAO, I-00100 Rome, Italy",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Foster, W (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile.",wfoster@uc.cl,"Foster, William/AGX-2381-2022; Anriquez, Gustavo/AGF-2067-2022","Foster, William/0000-0002-6164-4307; Anriquez, Gustavo/0000-0003-2968-8286",,,,,40,14,16,1,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Our research indicates that the development of a land rental market could serve as a substitute for administrative land reallocation in optimizing the distribution of land resources. The results from the stochastic frontier production function show that land reallocation does have effects on technical efficiency.

Although most governments legislate against outright animal cruelty, animal welfare organisations have actively lobbied for more stringent farm animal welfare regulations. Food retailers and restaurant chains have faced pressure from animal welfare organisations to implement more stringent animal welfare requirements for their suppliers. Is the demand for more stringent farm animal welfare protocols primarily determined by a subset of consumers with very strong preferences or does it signal a more fundamental underlying change in societal preferences? Given the credence nature of farm animal welfare, whom do consumers trust for credible quality assurances? This article analyses the role of quality verification in a market characterised by consumers with heterogeneous preferences for animal welfare. Of particular interest are the relative strength of preferences for humane animal treatment assurances and the credibility of these quality claims. Using data from a Canadian survey targeted at two distinct samples - a general population group and members of animal welfare organisations - a discrete choice experiment is used to assess consumer attitudes towards animal welfare assurances for pork products. The credibility of quality verification by public sector, private sector and third party agents is assessed. Evidence confirms that consumer preferences for farm animal welfare assurance and the source of verification are indeed heterogeneous. Although a portion of consumers remain largely indifferent to pork products with animal welfare assurances, a group of highly motivated consumers exist with an economic incentive to lobby for tougher animal welfare standards.","[Uzea, Adrian D.; Hobbs, Jill E.; Zhang, Jing] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Hobbs, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",jill.hobbs@usask.ca,,"Hobbs, Jill/0000-0003-0357-6817",Consumer and Market Demand Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Consumer and Market Demand Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),Funding for this research was provided by the Consumer and Market Demand Network (http://www.consumerdemand.re.ualberta.ca/) and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

In addition to health care costs, malaria causes loss of agricultural labor and slows adoption of improved practices in agriculture. Furthermore, some agricultural practices and development interventions are known to facilitate the spread of malaria, exacerbating its impacts. Given the importance of both agriculture and malaria in developing countries, especially in Africa, the interaction between them could be a significant factor in economic growth. The review identifies gaps in past research on this topic. A better understanding of malaria's impact on agricultural productivity, coupled with efforts to strengthen capacity to deal with malaria, would enhance policies and programs aimed at combating malaria and curbing its impacts on agricultural productivity.","[Asenso-Okyere, Kwadwo; Tarekegn, Jifar; Andam, Kwaw S.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Asante, Felix A.] Univ Ghana, Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, Legon, Ghana",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Ghana,"Asenso-Okyere, K (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",k.asenso-okyere@cgiar.org,,,,,,,75,29,31,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This article employs a general equilibrium approach to examine the economy-wide impacts of selected macro and water-related policy reforms on water use and allocation, rural livelihoods, and economy at large. The analyses reveal that implicit crop-level water quotas reduce the amount of irrigated land allocated to higher-value horticultural crops and create higher shadow rents for production of lower-value water-intensive field crops, such as sugarcane and fodder. Accordingly, liberalizing local water allocation within irrigation agriculture is found to work in favor of higher-value crops, and expand agricultural production and exports and farm employment. Allowing for water trade between irrigation and nonagricultural uses fuelled by higher competition for water from urbanization leads to greater water shadow prices for irrigation water with reduced income and employment benefits to rural households and higher gains for nonagricultural households. The analyses show difficult trade-offs between general economic gains and higher water prices, which place serious questions on subsidizing water supply to irrigated agriculture, i.e., making irrigation subsidies much harder to justify.","[Hassan, Rashid] Univ Pretoria, CEEPA, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Thurlow, James] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Helsinki 00160, Finland; [Thurlow, James] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Pretoria; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hassan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, CEEPA, Dept Agr Econ, Room 2-6 Agr Annex, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Rashid.hassan@up.ac.za,"Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023; Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022","Thurlow, James/0000-0003-3414-374X",,,,,23,27,36,1,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

With all land state-owned, the threat of land redistribution never appears far off the agenda. Land rental and leasing have been made legal, but transfer rights remain restricted and the perception of continuing tenure insecurity remains quite strong. Using a unique panel data set, this study investigates whether transfer rights and implied tenure insecurity affect household investment decisions, focusing on trees and shrubs. The panel data estimates suggest that limited perceived transfer rights negatively affects the long-term investment in Ethiopian agriculture, contributing to the low returns from land and perpetuating low growth and poverty.","[Ali, Daniel Ayalew] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dercon, Stefan] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Gautam, Madhur] DARWB, Tanzania Country Off, World Bank, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",The World Bank; University of Oxford; The World Bank,"Ali, DA (通讯作者)，World Bank, MC3-307,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dali1@worldbank.org,,,,,,,42,34,38,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Total allowable catches (TACs) are to be set with the objective of maximising economic efficiency in the fishery. Under ITQs, vessel owners have the ability to adjust their fishing activities to maximise profits and changes in fleet structure resulting from management changes need to be considered when determining TACs. A restricted profit function for the fishery was estimated to determine the optimal vessel characteristics and output levels as a guide to how the fleet may adjust under an ITQ system. Vessels were found to be currently close to their optimal size given average historic prices and current stock conditions. However, higher tiger prawn stocks are expected to result in the average size of vessels increasing, with rising fuel prices also likely to result in capital being substituted for fishing days. Optimal average vessel-level catches of the main species are lower than current average vessel catches for a wide range of input and output prices. These changes in vessel characteristics and behaviour need to be incorporated in the derivation of the optimal TACs if economic efficiency objectives are to be achieved.","[Pascoe, Sean; Dichmont, Catherine M.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Vieira, Simon] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ, Bur Rural Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Punt, Andre E.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Punt, Andre E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fisheries Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Pascoe, S (通讯作者)，CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",sean.pascoe@csiro.au,"Dichmont, Catherine M/A-9528-2008; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649; Punt, Andre/0000-0001-8489-2488",,,,,40,14,14,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach - The kernel density estimation method was used to investigate the distribution of agricultural growth in China using 1988-2008 panel data of the 29 provinces on the mainland. A nonparametric income distribution approach was employed to decompose China's agricultural output growth into farmland accumulation, capital deepening, labor-scale change, technical change, and efficiency change based on stochastic frontier function. A further investigation of the evolution of the decision mechanism for agricultural growth was then performed using counterfactual analysis. Findings - The results of this analysis indicate that: from 1996, the distribution of agricultural output per worker evolved from a unimodal into a bimodal distribution; technical change is the primary impetus to distribution shift; and capital deepening and efficiency change play a dominant role in the deformation of the distribution of agricultural output per worker from a unimodal to a bimodal distribution. Originality/value - The paper is an original work and its methodology makes a meaningful contribution to understanding China's agricultural growth. That is, the use of income distribution analysis method to analyze agricultural growth does not only allow a more in-depth understanding of the gap between regional agricultural growth rates, but also makes up for the existing lack of convergence in agricultural growth in China.","[Yu, Kang; Guo, Ping] Zheijiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xin, Xiangfei] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Nuetah, J.

We also explore the hypothesis that donor countries specifically coordinate their food aid shipments to recipient countries. Our findings show that food aid in aggregate and from each donor is significantly targeted at poorer countries and is highly persistent over time. Food aid responses to food availability shortfalls, natural disasters, and violent conflicts are common but more modest and uneven across donors. Finally, we find strong evidence of donor coordination in food aid allocation.","[Kuhlgatz, Christian; Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Kiel; Cornell University,"Kuhlgatz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",ckuhlga@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009; Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721; , Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,25,14,16,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

A GHG ETS has been a public policy issue in Australia for over a decade. The latest policy initiative on an ETS is the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS). A substantial share of Australia's total GHG reduction under the CPRS is expected to come from the electricity generation sector. This paper surveys the literature on investment behaviour under an ETS. It specifically focuses on the relationship between the design of an ETS and a generator's decisions to invest in low emissions plant and retire high emissions plant. The proposed CPRS provides the context for presenting key findings along with the implications for the electricity generation sector's transition to lower emissions plant. The literature shows that design features such as the method of allocating permits, the stringency of the emissions cap along with permit price uncertainty, provisions for banking, borrowing and internationally trading permits, and the credibility of emissions caps and policy uncertainty may all significantly impact on the investment and retirement behaviour of generators.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Lambie, NR (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ross.lambie@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,53,8,8,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This study adapts a GIS-based, hydrologic, and economic model to examine the trade-offs between agricultural interests and ecological benefits in the Eramosa Watershed, located in southwestern Ontario, Canada. While preserving a wetland enhances both water quality and wildlife habitat goals, and the costs of preservation increase at an increasing rate as expected, the ranking of wetlands, and so the choice of significant wetlands, varies considerably depending upon the wetland benefit chosen as the policy goal. The trade-off between wetland benefits and drainage is diminished if there is an alternative means to abate sediment. Since conservation tillage is a lower cost means of improving water quality than wetland preservation, its inclusion can achieve comparable environmental benefits at decreased agricultural cost.","[De Laporte, Aaron; Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Yang, Wanhong] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"De Laporte, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",adelapor@uoguelph.ca; aweersin@uoguelph.ca; wayang@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593","Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Ducks Unlimited Canada; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); Ducks Unlimited Canada; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Advancing Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food Program, Ducks Unlimited Canada, and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

The forcible methods applied in China and India cannot be accepted as they do not fulfil the human approach demands. The most important prerequisite of the gradual population stabilisation is the attitude of the families themselves. To decrease the population considerably, it is necessary to abolish the family as the base of the patriarchal structures in developing countries, to give women completely equal rights. It is important that both man and woman participated equally in the upbringing and nutrition of children. Woman should have the possibility to decide on the number of her children. They should be able to make their own decisions regarding marriage, job, as well as the way of spending money. However, many women lack this possibility; they are slaves of their fathers and husbands.

The paper aims to provide a framework through which this strategy can be understood and refined into the future. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a typology of grassland policies technical, administrative, and management and a discussion of the emphasis that China has and should place on each policy category. Data are drawn from policy documents and interview material collected through extensive fieldwork in large tracts of China's western pastoral region. Findings - China has appropriately pursued top-down technical and administrative policies to address major and immediate degradation-livelihoods problems. However, longer term solutions to the problems require the strengthening of management structures from the bottom-up, especially amongst herders themselves and other economic factors. Practical implications - The paper proposes a series of concrete recommendations that may be considered as China refines its grasslands strategy into the future. The emphasis in the paper on the relationships between multi-dimensional policies is of particular value in addressing multi-dimensional grasslands-livelihood problems. Originality/value - Despite the magnitude and implications of China's recent grasslands strategy, there is a dearth of English language studies on the subject, which this paper aims to fill. The paper includes numerous micro-level insights gained from extensive fieldwork in the western pastoral region that are not evident in more macro-level studies.","[Waldron, Scott; Brown, Colin; Longworth, John] Univ Queensland, China Agr Econ Grp, Sch Integrat Syst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Waldron, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, China Agr Econ Grp, Sch Integrat Syst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",Scott.Waldron@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,39,59,64,1,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Through the use of point score analysis, research was conducted in the Kibamba Ward located in the peri-urban zone of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The main aims were to investigate the key factors underlying farmers' choice of crop as well as to assess the differences in the decision-making process between commercial and subsistence farmers. Vegetable cultivation was observed as the main practice, influenced particularly by the physical environment, the availability of machinery as well as certain economic factors. A significant difference in decision making among subsistence and commercial farmers was found. Subsistence farmers placed greater emphasis on the taste of the crop, whereas commercial farmers were predictably more influenced by the market. In addition, this study highlights several practical areas of concern regarding water resources, basic machinery and the lack of formal extension provision in the area.

The productivity growth estimates are decomposed econometrically using a translog cost function to indicate the relative roles of technical change and scale effects.

Stated preference approaches are often used for such estimations, with an increasing reliance placed on discrete choice models such as mixed logit, in which results can be sensitive to minor specification changes. This paper evaluates how and to what extent this sensitivity is policy relevant. Drawing from a case study of agricultural conservation easements in Georgia, we characterize the sensitivity of choice experiment welfare estimates to common variations in mixed logit specification. Results suggest that practitioners should provide greater attention to the potential implications of often unnoticed modeling choices in discrete choice welfare estimation.","[Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Bergstrom, John C.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Clark University; Clark University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Johnston, RJ (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",rjohnston@clarku.edu,,"Johnston, Robert/0000-0001-7523-2701",USDA/CSREES/NRI; Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station,USDA/CSREES/NRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station,"Support provided by USDA/CSREES/NRI Grant Improved Information in Support of a National Strategy for Open Land Policies, and the Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station.

Based on an ability to reflect simulated data from Roll's spread model, we assess the effectiveness of conventional and Bayesian bid-ask spread estimators under different market conditions. Conventional serial covariance and absolute price change spread estimators appear to be biased. Hasbrouck's Bayesian estimator generates small costs of liquidity whose values depend on the correlation and noise in the data. The absolute value Bayesian estimator is precise and works well under conditions of high levels of noise and correlation usually found in agricultural futures markets. Using data from live cattle (LC) and lean hog (LH) contracts, we find similar patterns of performance that produce economically meaningful cost of liquidity differences.","[Frank, Julieta] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Manitoba; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Frank, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 376 Agr Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",Julieta_Frank@umanitoba.ca,"Frank, Julieta/A-1495-2012","Frank, Julieta/0000-0002-2646-4001",Office of Futures and Options Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [SES060005N],Office of Futures and Options Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,The authors would like to acknowledge funding by the Office of Futures and Options Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

To date, experimental comparisons of these auction mechanisms have been based on balanced, single unit designs with defined buyers and sellers. However, many resource markets involve trade in multiple unit, often thin, double auction markets.

The analysis is run using Bayesian stochastic frontier estimation with an exponential hierarchical prior on the efficiency term. Our results indicate that the average efficiency of the borrowing groups analyzed was approximately 75% and that having a higher percentage of agricultural loans increased borrowing group efficiency while gains in efficiency also rose as the size of the borrowing group increases.","[Raghunathan, Uthra K.; Escalante, Cesar L.; Dorfman, Jeffrey H.; Ames, Glenn C.

Environmental pressures and high oil prices affect demand for biofuels and have reignited the discussion about effects on food prices. Suppliers in the sugar-alcohol sector need to decide the ideal proportion of ethanol and sugar to optimise their financial strategy. Prices can be affected by exogenous factors, such as exchange rates and interest rates, as well as non-observable variables like the convenience yield, which is related to supply shortages. The literature generally uses two approaches: artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are recognised as being in the forefront of exogenous-variable analysis, and stochastic models such as the Kalman filter, which is able to account for non-observable variables. This article proposes a hybrid model for forecasting the prices of agricultural commodities that is built upon both approaches and is applied to forecast the price of sugar. The Kalman filter considers the structure of the stochastic process that describes the evolution of prices. Neural networks allow variables that can impact asset prices in an indirect, nonlinear way, what cannot be incorporated easily into traditional econometric models.","[Ribeiro, Celma O.; Oliveira, Sydnei M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Politecn, Dept Prod Engn, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Ribeiro, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Politecn, Dept Prod Engn, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",sydneim@gmail.com,"de Oliveira Ribeiro, Celma/N-7055-2016","de Oliveira Ribeiro, Celma/0000-0003-0288-2644",,,,,51,24,25,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We develop a model for livestock management based on a detailed analysis of ecosystem dynamics, and we apply it to calculate optimal and sustainable livestock stocking rates in a Sahelian rangeland. The general model accounts for stochastic rainfall and the long-term impact of grazing on rangeland productivity. For the case study area, the model shows that the optimal stocking rate is higher than the sustainable stocking rate. Hence, with current prices, it is optimal for the pastoralist society to deplete their resource base. In our case study, we also find that the current stocking rate exceeds the optimal stocking rate, which adds to soil depletion.","[Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hein, Lars] Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Weikard, HP (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",hans-peter.weikard@wur.nl; lars.hein@wur.nl,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845",,,,,54,15,17,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Then, some problems of rural development can be found and corresponding measures can be proposed, which could provide references for policymaking. Design/methodology/approach - First, from agricultural, rural and farmers' perspective, a preliminary index system which containing 94 indicators was put forward. Then, combining with a series of subjective and objective indicator screening methods, such as fuzzy synthetic evaluation, clustering analysis, correlation and variation coefficient analysis, the final index system containing 22 indicators was established. Third, combining with factor analysis, the final index system was used to evaluate the level of NSC construction in 28 counties of China in 2007. Finally, we calculated district factor scores by a model and gave an aggregate index ranking of different regions. Findings - NSC construction at county level is not well developed in China and there are significant geographical differences among different districts. First, NSC construction in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou is relatively better. Second, NSC construction of East China is better than that of North China and Central China. Northeast of China is better than Southwest and Northwest. Third, NSC construction in municipalities is higher than non-municipalities. Rural development in Western regions of China needs to be paid special attention. Originality/value - A final evaluation index system including 22 indicators was designed. These indicators are complete, independent, weakly correlative and stable. The index system can be further applied to evaluate other regions' NSC development. The evaluation results can provide useful references for NSC reform in the whole nation.","[Liu, Hongman] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanqi] NE Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiangyu] NE Agr Univ, Party Comm, Harbin, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Northeast Agricultural University - China; Northeast Agricultural University - China,"Liu, HM (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",mm-hong@sohu.com,,"LIU, Hongman/0000-0002-0850-2131",Chinese Universities.

The extent of reputation's impact on prices varies substantially depending on the model specification and estimation technique. The article highlights the effectiveness of a nonlinear specification for both measuring and interpreting the underlying reputation variables. The use of a Buy It Now option, size, and country of the origin is correlated with prices at statistically significant levels.

Compliance costs are heterogeneous and difficult to measure. We proxy their influence and specify a model that allows for a different preferential margin impact according to the proxy costs. Adopting the gravity framework and using a sample of 554 lines of agricultural products for 131 developing countries in 2002, we find that the costs of compliance play a role in making the schemes work: the lower the costs, the greater the impact of the preferential margins. Moreover, the estimated margin effect differs between different regimes.","[Agostino, Mariarosaria; Demaria, Federica; Trivieri, Francesco] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Agostino, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Cubo 1-C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",m.agostino@unical.it,"Trivieri, Francesco/H-3818-2019; DeMaria, Federica/P-9204-2019","DeMaria, Federica/0000-0002-1718-1894","European Commission [212036]; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research","European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Mariarosaria Agostino, Federica Demaria and Francesco Trivieri are based in the Department of Economics and Statistics, University of Calabria, Cubo 1-C, Ponte P.

Supporting the biofuel industry raises the price of the agricultural feedstock, and hence increases the farmer revenue and reduces the need for direct income support. Thus, for a given objective of agricultural income, the regulator is able to operate a partial substitution between agricultural decoupled payments and the support to the biofuel industry (subsidies or mandatory blending). We detail these effects and derive the biofuel and the environmental policies that maximise social welfare. We also show that for high levels of biofuel production, cross-compliance provisions are a more expensive way of enforcing the environmental policy than fining farmers.","[Bourgeon, Jean-Marc; Treguer, David] INRA, Paris, France; [Bourgeon, Jean-Marc] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France",INRAE; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Tréguer, D (通讯作者)，16 Rue Claude Bernard, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",treguer@grignon.inra.fr,,,European Commission [212036],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Financial support received by the 'New Issues in Agricultural, Food and Bio-energy Trade (AGFOODTRADE)' (Grant Agreement no. 212036) research project, funded by the European Commission, is gratefully acknowledged.

This study divides the determinants of the Japanese demand for beef imports into two factors: (i) substitution elasticity and (ii) country-of-origin bias, and demonstrate how these measurements are associated with trade policy and food scare events. The Japanese beef industry serves as a case study to evaluate the multifold impact of import liberalisation and a series of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreaks. A time-varying parameter model is used to shed light on the dynamic effects of the import liberalisation and BSE outbreaks on the measurements. The estimation results reveal that the estimated substitutability and country-of-origin bias are very sensitive to the BSE cases, but not to the process of trade liberalisation. The results also confirm that as a result of the BSE outbreaks, the major factor of the Japanese demand for beef imports has changed from relative prices to the country-of-origin effect, thereby emphasising the importance of a traceability system and promotional activities, which would help in the formation of the country-of-origin effect.","[Kawashima, Shigekazu; Sari, Deffi Ayu Puspito] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan",Tohoku University,"Kawashima, S (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan.",kawashima@bios.tohoku.ac.jp; deffi_sari@bios.tohoku.ac.jp,"Sari, D./AFR-0047-2022","Sari, D./0000-0002-7679-7496",,,,,17,19,24,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Findings - The results Indicate that changes in land use and output supply response are marginal. The highest effects are observed on irrigated areas of sunflower seed (0 23 percent) and wheat (0 17 percent) This results to declines in supply of 007 percent for sunflower seeds, 0.06 percent for wheat; 004 percent for soya beans; 0.03 percent for each of white maize and sorghum; and 0 02 percent for yellow maize production Therefore, levying a land tax may discourage investment on irrigation facilities and consequently irrigated farming Originality/value - The programming modeling approach captures the significant differences in the farm characteristics and the overarching profit-maximizing behaviour of farmers, which an econometric approach may not easily capture.","AgResearch Ltd, Grasslands Res Ctr, Palmerston North, New Zealand",AgResearch - New Zealand,"Olubode-Awosola, F (通讯作者)，AgResearch Ltd, Grasslands Res Ctr, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",Femi.Olubode-Awosola@agresearch.co.nz,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.

The main changes to have caused most of the changes to the individual characteristics of agricultural foreign trade in the particular countries under analysis are the process of the EU enlargementy, the adoption of obligations to ensue from the EU membership and the concentration in the internal market of the EU countries.

Design/methodology/approach - A parametric approach is used to model wheat-yield distribution for samples and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to choose the most appropriate yield distribution: Parameters of the special yield distribution are estimated through the maximum likelihood estimation approach. Findings - The Burr distribution is found to be the most appropriate parametric distribution to model winter wheat-production risks for the districts of Beijing, except in the districts of Fengtai and Shunyi. Findings also show that the Johnson family distribution is the most appropriate model for these two districts (SB for the Fengtai District and SU for the Shunyi District). The wheat-production loss ratios of the Beijing districts are between 6 and 15 percent, which is considered medium range in most regions. The highest production risks are located in the Western regions of Beijing (Mentougou and Fengtai) while the lowest production risk is located in the Southeastern region of Beijing (Daxing District). Originality/value - To generate an objective yield trend and an accurate production risk assessment, linear moving average, instead of linear (or quadratic) regression, is used in this paper.","[Zhang, Qiao; Wang, Ke] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS","Zhang, QA (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhqiao@mail.caas.net.cn,"wang, ke/AAG-2114-2019","wang, ke/0000-0001-5875-0013",,,,,21,10,13,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.

We investigate the hypothesis for contemporary U.S. rural development by estimating the influence of export sector employment on subsequent rural development outcomes. The results reject the hypothesis that emphasizing traditional export employment results in rural growth, reject the assumption of perfectly elastic factor supply, and support alternative explanations.","[Kilkenny, Maureen] Univ Nevada, Dept Resource Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Kilkenny, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Resource Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",,,,Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station; Ohio Agriculture Research and Development Center,Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station; Ohio Agriculture Research and Development Center,"Senior authorship is shared.

Complexity in each choice set was characterized as the number of single and multiple changes in levels of attributes from the current situation and the order of the choice task in the sequence of multiple tasks provided to respondents. We show that increasing complexity leads to increased choice of the SQ and that a respondent's age and level of education also influenced this choice. We outline the effects of the alternate approaches for incorporating the SQ into welfare measurement. These findings have implications for the design of stated preference experiments, examining passive use values and for empirical analysis leading to welfare measurement.","[Boxall, Peter; Adamowicz, W.

A new economic geography model is used to compare coupled subsidies to 'single farm payments' effects on the location of farming, agro-industry and non-farm activity between rural and urban areas. This abstract model features a majority of employment in service sectors, farming vertically linked to manufacturing, and strong preferences for geo-varieties. It appears that both coupled subsidies and single farm payments can decrease spatial agglomeration.

Using a moment-based approach, the analysis uses a stochastic production function capturing mean, variance, and skewness effects. Welfare implications of diversity are evaluated using a certainty equivalent, measured as expected income minus a risk premium (reflecting the cost of risk). We find that the effect of diversity on skewness dominates its effect on variance, meaning that diversity reduces the cost of risk. The analysis also shows that the beneficial effects of diversity become of greater value in degraded land.","[Di Falco, Salvatore] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Di Falco, Salvatore] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Chavas, Jean-Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Kent; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Di Falco, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,45,221,245,4,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Ethanol prices rise above the gasoline price by the amount of the tax credit. Corn farmers gain directly while gasoline consumers only gain from any reduction in world oil prices due to the extra ethanol production. Domestic oil producers lose. Historically, the intercept of the ethanol supply curve is above the gasoline price. Hence, part of the tax credit is redundant and represents rectangular deadweight costs that dwarf triangular deadweight cost measures of traditional farm subsidies.","[de Gorter, Harry; Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"de Gorter, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012",,,,,,24,71,84,0,23,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

An abductive approach, based on a secondary analysis of quantitative data and the authors' own empirical survey, identifies a set of hypotheses about the relationship between agricultural labour market and the age structure of agricultural workforce.","[Spesna, D.; Pospech, P.; Nohel, F.; Drlik, J.; Delin, M.] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Spesná, D (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Workpl Kotlarska 53, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",spesna.daniela@uzei.cz; pospech.pavel@uzei.cz,"Pospech, Pavel/U-1366-2019","Pospech, Pavel/0000-0002-4048-683X",Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [MZe 0002725101],"Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)",Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (Project No. MZe 0002725101 - Analyza a vyhodnocovani moznosti trvale udrzitelnosti zemedelstvi a venkova CR v podminkach EU a Evropskeho modelu).,,15,11,12,3,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the endogenous growth theory, the paper establishes a regional human capital spillover model to examine the spillover effects of human capital coming along with the regional labor mobility and the changes of public education investment decision brought by the spillover effects in China. Findings - It has been found that the regional mobility of labor has made the developed areas gain the spillover benefits of human capital investment from the underdeveloped areas with their superiority of social and economic environment and restrained the incentives for public education investment in the underdeveloped areas, thus the different areas walk on a different growth path, with the expansion of the difference in the economic and education investment growth. Originality/value - This paper analyzes the possible influences from the spillover of human capital on the economic growth and educational investment and finds a high possibility for the underdeveloped areas to get into a low development trap of education investment. The key to solving the problem is to internalize the externalities by the active public policy, in order to realize equal education, rational investment and balanced development.","[Zhang, Jinghua; Wu, Fangwei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Deyuan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yongmin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Plant Protect Coll, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Wu, FW (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wfangwei@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"zhang, yuanyuan/GYA-4428-2022",,National Social Science Funding [CAA080215]; Project of Shanghai Educational Science [B08021],National Social Science Funding; Project of Shanghai Educational Science,The authors would like to thank the Special Project on Education of National Social Science Funding (CAA080215) and the Project of Shanghai Educational Science (B08021) for financial support.,,20,2,3,4,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Using a panel of Belgian dairy farms, we first estimate a multi-output multi-input flexible cost function that generates a U-shaped marginal cost curve for each farm of the sample. We then embed each farm cost function in a profit-maximisation programming model that is built and calibrated for each farm in the sample. Accounting for farm heterogeneity, the simulations show how dairy farms without quotas may respond differently to changes in prices and structural changes that may take place within the dairy sector. A quota removal with a 20 per cent reduction in milk prices keeps aggregate milk supply and farm income at about the same level of the 2006 reference year.","[de Frahan, Bruno Henry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Rurale Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Polome, Philippe] Univ Lyon 2, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Howitt, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Lyon 2; University of California System; University of California Davis,"de Frahan, BH (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Rurale Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",bruno.henrydefrahan@uclouvain.be,"De Blander, Rembert/HGE-6452-2022","De Blander, Rembert/0000-0003-2146-1618",Belgian Ministry of Wallonia,Belgian Ministry of Wallonia,"The authors wish to thank the financing support from the Belgian Ministry of Wallonia (ADAGE Research Project) and the Direction Generale de l'Agriculture, des Ressources Naturelles et de l'Environnement of the same Ministry for technical and scientific support and the FADN database.

S. exchange rate could have an influence on cash rental rates for farmland in five U. S. cornbelt states. We find that farmland cash rents have a fairly strong, positive correlation with the U. S. dollar, in terms of its real value relative to major agricultural trading partners. One explanation for the correlation is that a strong dollar lowers the price of key inputs and thus has purchasing power effects. A strong dollar may therefore be associated with higher net returns, and the payment of higher cash rents by farmers. We find support for this hypothesis through a series of econometric models.","[Reimer, Jeffrey J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Nag, Sharmistha] Natl Council Appl Econ Res, New Delhi 110002, India",Oregon State University,"Reimer, JJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jeff.reimer@oregonstate.edu,"Reimer, Jeffrey/G-7015-2016","Reimer, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4434-174X","Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service","Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","The authors appreciate financial support from the Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station and the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service.

Since Polish agriculture was above all private in nature throughout the period of communism, the changes in question were actually more limited than in other Central and East European Countries (CEEC). Those that have taken place have first and foremost involved the privatisation of the old State Farms, whose assets were taken over by individually-owned farms or commercial-law companies, with the intermediation of the Treasury Agricultural Property Agency established for the purpose. A major element of the assets undergoing privatisation was agricultural land. The size of the ownership change has varied from region to region. In the West and North, where more than half of all farmland was in the State Farm hands to 1989, there was a marked increase in the share of land under private ownership. On the other hand, in Central and Eastern Poland, the changes were very limited, concerning only the transfer of land between private farms. Important reasons accounting for the limited activity on the market for land in this part of Poland include the agrarian overpopulation and the widespread treatment of land as a form of the insurance policy against job losses. The ownership changes have further encouraged polarisation where farm size structure is concerned. Farms increased in size in the regions where the large average area has long been a typical feature. In turn, the areas characterised by the excessive agrarian fragmentation have not seen any more major changes in the size structure over the recent period. A detailed analysis of the changes in ownership over the market economy period is preceded by a discussion of the history of land ownership in Polish agriculture, with a particular emphasis being placed on the Communist era. The legal and social bases conditioning ownership change are also discussed.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences,"Banski, J (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Ul Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland.",jbanski@twarda.pan.pl,,"Banski, Jerzy/0000-0001-9056-0404",,,,,28,32,33,1,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Their importance has increased with time owing to globalisation, as the spread of invasive species is facilitated by the increased movement of people, cargo and genetic material around the world. There is a vast literature on the economics of invasive species and their management. Here, we contribute to this literature by applying a spatio-temporal model to the allocation of surveillance resources. We focus on three questions regarding resource allocation to control a newly discovered invasion: the budget, which determines the amount of search effort available; the duration of the control program; and the allocation of surveillance and control in time and space. We also explore the complementary role of passive surveillance by members of the public. We derive efficient frontiers for effort allocation that represent the trade-off between cost and probability of eradication after inefficient strategies have been eliminated. We use the results to illustrate how to evaluate whether introduction of passive surveillance is desirable based on cost and eradication probability. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings in the design of control programs.","[Cacho, Oscar J.; Hester, Susan M.] Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, SW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Cacho, OJ (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, SW 2351, Australia.",ocacho@une.edu.au,"Hester, Susan M/E-1191-2013; Cacho, Oscar/F-3012-2011","Hester, Susan M/0000-0001-6046-9984; Cacho, Oscar/0000-0002-1542-4442",Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis [0806],Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis,This research was undertaken with funding from the Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis under ACERA project 0806.,,36,28,28,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach - A systematic, quantitative analysis is applied to address whether China's recent trade and production policies distort China's domestic and international commodity markets. The paper provides a clear picture of how trade-restricting policies affect markets using a 42-country partial equilibrium global dynamic agricultural simulation model. Findings - The paper shows that recent agricultural policy reforms increase China's production slightly, causing imports to decrease while exports decline because of input subsidies, export taxes and the reduction of export value added tax rebates. Domestic prices to consumers decrease in real terms. The effects on world markets are small as the set of policies adopted partially offset each other in the international arena. Research limitations/implications - The paper indicates that the adoption of the policy reforms lower price levels domestically and benefit lower income urban and rural households, whose diets are largely based on rice and wheat as staple foods. Future model enhancements should include measures of producer and consumer welfare in order to capture the total impacts of policies and policy changes in China. Originality/value - The paper quantifies the potential implications of the recent agricultural policy reforms in China. This contributes to the investigation of the effects of these policies implemented by the Chinese Government to achieve the country's policy objectives. Owing to the dynamics of China's policy implementation an in-depth analysis sheds light and contributes to capturing the impacts of policy reforms on the domestic and international markets.","[Hansen, Jim; Tuan, Francis; Somwaru, Agapi] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Hansen, J (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",jhansen@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,32,14,14,1,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We use the perspective of multifunctional agriculture and contribute to the research on the contemporary trends in Czech agriculture by using the data collected through surveys in 2000 and 2006, as well as 2008 comparative statistical support, to ask if there have been significant changes and improvements in farmers' evaluations of these programs. The empirical case study results show some positive changes connected with the participation in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). In spite of improvements, farmers continue to cite two primary weaknesses and constraints - administrative procedures and shifting program guidelines - that were evident prior to joining the EU. It can be assumed that the environmental subsidies in the Horizontal Rural Development Plan 2004-2006 have had an effect on the stabilization of the livelihoods of rural inhabitants.

The model maximizes the net present value (NPV) of a facility over its economic life. Model inputs include biomass availability, biomass handling system type, plant investment and capacity, transportation logistics, feedstock and product pricing, project financing, and taxes. Four alternative woody biomass handling systems, which include all processes from stand to plant, are considered. Eleven possible plant locations were identified based on site selection requirements. Results showed that the optimal plant location was in Buckhannon, West Virginia. The NPV of the plant with a demand of 2,000 dry tons of woody biomass per day varied from $68.11 million to $84.51 million among the systems over a 20-year plant life. Internal rate of return (IRR) of the facility averaged 18.67% for the base case scenario. Average ethanol production costs were approximately $2.02 to $2.08 per gallon. Production costs were most impacted by biomass availability, mill residue purchase price, plant investment and capacity, ethanol yield, and financing. Findings suggest that a woody biomass-based ethanol facility in central Appalachia could be economically feasible under certain operational scenarios.","[Wu, Jinzhuo; Wang, Jingxin] W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Sperow, Mark] W Virginia Univ, Div Resource Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Wang, JX (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",,"wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; yang, qing/JBR-8440-2023; zhang, weijie/JQX-1450-2023; Wu, Jinzhuo/HLH-5139-2023",,,,,,56,23,31,0,14,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Representative farm account data for 1985-2006 are used, and the study applies stochastic frontier analysis using an input distance-function approach. The results show that pig farms have improved their input scale efficiency significantly over time, as have dairy farms during the last few years after a period of constant scale efficiency. Crop farms have the lowest scale efficiency, and there is a considerable potential for improving productivity in the cash crop sector by increasing the size of the farms. It is shown that a change in scale efficiency and technological change are the major components of aggregate productivity changes for all farm types.","Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Rasmussen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",sr@life.ku.dk,,,,,,,36,51,56,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

MPAs limit harvest to certain areas, but may enhance profits outside via spillover. TURFs incentivize local stewardship but may be plagued by spatial externalities when the TURF size is insufficient to capture all dispersal. Within a numerical model parameterized to a California marine species, we explore the economic and ecological effects of imposing MPAs on a TURF-regulated fishery. Whether MPAs can enhance or diminish profits (or fish abundance) hinges critically on the level of coordination already occurring between TURF owners. If coordination is complete, private MPAs may already emerge in some TURFs; implementing additional MPAs reduces profits. However, to the extent that coordination is incomplete, strategically sited MPAs may be an effective complement to spatial property rights-based fisheries, increasing both fishery profits and abundance.","[Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kaffine, Daniel T.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Colorado School of Mines,"Costello, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",Costello@bren.ucsb.edu,"Kaffine, Daniel/V-9996-2019",,Paul G.

We find that participants in a stated preference willingness-to-pay study, when told that a nonhypothetical study of similar goods would follow, state significantly lower willingness to pay (WTP) than participants not so informed. In other words, participants adjust their stated WTP to avoid cognitive dissonance, that is, taking inconsistent stands on their WTP for the good being offered.","[Alfnes, Frode] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resources Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Yue, Chengyan] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Jensen, Helen H.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Iowa State University,"Alfnes, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Resources Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",frode.alfnes@umb.no,"Gusewelle, Cameron/HKW-1008-2023; Alfnes, Frode/I-8970-2016","Alfnes, Frode/0000-0002-3072-9308; Jensen, Helen/0000-0001-6878-1729",USDA Risk Management Agency,USDA Risk Management Agency,The authors thank Ariun Ishdorj and S.

The proposed model is of a partial equilibrium nature and takes seasonality into account. We have applied the model to imports of tomatoes, cucumbers, clementines, and table grapes.

This article develops a differentiation measure based on the cross-entropy of two distributions for speciality coffees. It examines whether quality ratings achieve their objectives for speciality coffee supply chains. The estimation, using e-auctions data, indicates that the quality rating is more informative in the Cup of Excellence (CofE) relative to the Q auction. To determine significance, a statistical test for comparing the information measure across different e-auctions and segments of the quality rating was developed. The significant difference between the two auctions is not a surprise as the auctions trade coffee lots of different volumes and the quality evaluation is more important in the case of the CofE, with its jury of renowned coffee experts. The total cross-entropy measure of product differentiation shows that the 100-point quality rating does not carry the same information content and meaning in the two different e-auctions and their respective supply chains. The cross-entropy measure of product differentiation is shown to be a good indicator of the information and the value created throughout the speciality food supply chain.","[Laura Donnet, M.] Univ Austral, Dept Agribusiness, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Weatherspoon, Dave D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Moss, Charles B.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Austral University; Michigan State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Donnet, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Austral, Dept Agribusiness, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.",donnetma@msu.edu; weathe42@msu.edu; cbmoss@ufl.edu,"Brain, Joshua/B-8769-2012; Moss, Charles/U-5254-2017","Moss, Charles/0000-0002-1172-7112",,,,,39,9,12,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

A total of 1,025 northern Italian consumers were surveyed. We estimate one binary logit model to investigate the use of nutrition labelling, and seven other ordinal regression models to analyse consumer interest towards nutrition claims and labelling. Consumers who use nutrition labelling have characteristics different from those who use nutrition claims. Consumers using nutrition labelling show a marked interest in food safety concerns, use experts as their source of information and have specific dietary habits. For consumers concerned about nutrition claims, the survey shows significant links with attributes influencing purchasing behaviour, such as price, brand, certification, etc. Socio-demographic characteristics are statistically significant and show a positive link with age, gender and a negative linkage with income.","[Stranieri, Stefanella; Baldi, Lucia; Banterle, Alessandro] Univ Milan, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Banterle, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.banterle@unimi.it,"Baldi, Lucia/ABE-5562-2021; Banterle, Alessandro/ACT-7678-2022","BALDI, LUCIA/0000-0002-2791-9127; BANTERLE, ALESSANDRO/0000-0003-2301-5646; Stranieri, Stefanella/0000-0002-9936-8942",,,,,68,24,29,3,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

If contracting frictions exist, then PPLD would have efficiency and redistributive effects, though the direction and magnitude depends on the size of PPL damages vis-a-vis expected damages under existing contract law.

We also propose a two-step estimation method that allows endogenous regressors in stochastic frontier models. The first step uses generalized method of moments to get consistent estimates of the frontier parameters in the presence of endogenous regressors.

Recent theoretical and empirical findings challenge this view arguing that when markets for insurance are missing, risk homogeneity may not hold any more and risk heterogeneity can be the optimal outcome. Using data from an MFI in Tigray (Ethiopia), this article examines the homogeneity hypothesis and reflects on implications for repayment. No evidence is found that supports risk homogeneity, even accounting for matching frictions. However, we also do not find an explicit link between the presence of risk heterogeneity and side-payments due to missing insurance as suggested in the literature. Instead, other trust-based social networks seem to underlie heterogeneity. Such social networks are often synchronized with credit groups and influence the probability of repayment under heterogeneity. The implication is that successful repayment rates in group lending need not arise only under risk homogeneity but can also arise under risk heterogeneity. Heterogeneity may also serve to bridge missing insurance markets in poor rural environments. MFIs therefore need to consider such local conditions when designing their lending schemes.","[Berhane, Guush; Gardebroek, Cornelis] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Moll, Henk A.

The average annual wine consumption per capita is the basic factor of the wine demand. The average annual wine consumption, one of the wine demand factors, grew between 2003 and 2007 from 16.31 to 18.51 per capita. Following this trend, we can expect the average annual wine consumption 19.01 per capita in year 2010. A positive feature of this development is also the fact, that there grows the demand after the quality wines. At the same time, there grows also the consumption of the lower quality, cheap wines packed in boxes or PET bottles. A continuously growing tendency can be also noticed in the red-wine consumption. This change of consumer preferences has significantly influenced the growth of the share of the red varieties in the new-planted vineyards. However, there are critical factors in the development of the demand for wine demand here. Specifically, it is the daily feasible ration of alcohol in wine and other alcoholic drinks, especially beer that we can treat as the substitute of wine. The average annual beer consumption moves about 160 1 per capita in the Czech Republic. The continuously growing tendency of wine consumption is reduced by the lower price of beer too, because beer is the cheapest alcoholic drink in the Czech Republic. The taste and preferences of consumers have been changing, that means, that the consumers are the ones who decide about the wine quality, and not producers. That is why this paper includes the partial results of the research oriented on the habits and behaviour of consumers in the wine market in the Czech Republic. It is concentrated on the wine sellers opinions on demand development in the wine market.","[Chladkova, H.; Tomsik, P.; Gurska, S.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Chládková, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",chlad@mendelu.cz,"Formánková, Sylvie/L-7260-2017; Formánková, Sylvie/S-2297-2019; Chladkova, Helena/Q-5643-2016","Formánková, Sylvie/0000-0003-0269-4723; Formánková, Sylvie/0000-0003-0269-4723; Chladkova, Helena/0000-0002-9037-2689","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904).",,8,9,9,2,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Given the heterogeneity in adoption patterns, the analysis differentiates the impact estimates based on a classification of households that takes into account the timing and duration of nontraditional agricultural export adoption. The results show that while, on average, welfare levels have improved for all households irrespective of adoption status and duration, the extent of improvement has varied across groups. Long-term adopters exhibit the smallest increase in the lapse of two decades, in spite of some early gains. Conversely, early adopters who withdrew from nontraditional agricultural export production after reaping the benefits of the boom period of the 1980s are found to have fared better and shown greater improvements in durable asset position and housing conditions than any other category.","[Carletto, Calogero; Kilic, Talip] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kirk, Angeli] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",The World Bank; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Carletto, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Mail Stop MC3-306,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gcarletto@worlbank.org,,"Kilic, Talip/0000-0002-3642-3123",,,,,44,28,36,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Crop failure due to erratic and unpredictable rainfall occurs frequently and leads to food shortages and income shocks. The renting out of land may be one of the coping responses of households exposed to shocks. We developed a theoretical household model for poor landlord households capturing their contract choice response to downside production shocks. We tested econometrically whether contract choice may depend on poverty, capital constraints, production risk and random shocks. The multinomial logit model estimates show that poor households experiencing random shocks are more likely to choose fixed-rent contracts as a distress response to shocks, suggesting that fixed-rent contracts may be used to meet immediate needs, but at the expense of future incomes. We also found that fixed-rent contracts are preferred when ex ante production risk is low, while sharecropping is more likely where production risk is high. Finally, we found an indication that the choice of a fixed-rent contract as a coping response to shocks comes as a last resort after all other means of coping are exhausted.","[Gebregziabher, Gebrehaweria; Holden, Stein T.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Econ & Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Gebregziabher, Gebrehaweria] Ethiopia, Sub Reg Off Nile Basin & Eastern Africa, Int Water Management Inst, ILRI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Holden, ST (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Econ & Resource Management, POB 5033, N-1432 As, Norway.",stein.holden@umb.no,"Holden, Stein/AAD-4502-2019","Holden, Stein T./0000-0001-7502-2392",,,,,33,33,35,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Using dichotomous choice contingent valuation mail surveys, households in NB and SK were asked to indicate their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for controlling future SBW and FTC outbreaks. A majority of respondents (over 80% in each province) favored controlling outbreaks of these insects. In both provinces, respondents were on average willing to pay more for controlling SBW outbreaks compared to FTC outbreaks. Aggregate social benefits (measured via compensating surplus) associated with proposed insect control programs in NB resulted in annual social benefits of $14.3-20.8 million for SBW control, and $7.9-14.5 million for FTC control. Comparable net benefits in SK were $22.2-32.4 million for SBW control, and $11.7-22.0 million for FTC control. These results highlight the significance and uniqueness of social benefits generated from controlling outbreaks of these insects, and provide a foundation for incorporating them into a full benefit-cost analysis used to help make more informed and efficient policy decisions.","[Chang, Wei-Yew; Lantz, Van A.; MacLean, David A.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, Fredericton, NB E3B 6C2, Canada",University of New Brunswick,"Lantz, VA (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 6C2, Canada.",wy.chang@unb.ca; vlantz@unb.ca; macleand@unb.ca,"MacLean, David A/G-6011-2011","MacLean, David/0000-0002-0314-4435",Canadian Sustainable Forest Management Network Center of Excellence; Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency,Canadian Sustainable Forest Management Network Center of Excellence; Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency,"The authors thank Dave Davies from Forest Protection Limited, Kevin Porter and Ed Kettela from the Canadian Forest Service Atlantic Forestry Centre, Nelson Carter from the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources, Jeff Wilson from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Ryan Trenholm from Simon Fraser University, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful input.

Survey-based journal rankings may overcome these problems. We report on such a survey-based ranking initiated by the Agricultural Economics Associations of Germany and Austria. Results of the ranking and a classification of journals, i. e. a rating, are provided for 160 selected journals. Scientific quality is assessed by an index based on the researchers' perception of the quality standards of each journal and of the quality of its published articles. The survey-based ranking allows a much more comprehensive and consistent ranking than the impact factor, as specific agricultural economics journals can be directly compared with neighbouring economic and interdisciplinary journals to which agricultural economists submit their work. The low impact factors of core agricultural economics journals are put into perspective. The scientific quality of the top agricultural economics journals is assessed as being rather high and above most of the relevant interdisciplinary journals from agricultural and food sciences that are typically characterised by higher impact factors. Agricultural economists' perceptions on the scientific quality of the journals vary more across journals than perceptions of their relevance.","[Herrmann, Roland] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Berg, Ernst] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Dabbert, Stephan] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Farm Management, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany; [Poechtrager, Siegfried] BOKU, Inst Mkt & Innovat, Vienna, Austria; [Salhofer, Klaus] Tech Univ Munich, Enviromental & Agr Policy Grp, Munich, Germany","Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Bonn; University Hohenheim; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Technical University of Munich","Herrmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Roland.Herrmann@agrar.uni-giessen.de,"Salhofer, Klaus/ACN-4362-2022","Salhofer, Klaus/0000-0002-4119-648X",Gesellschaft fur Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften des Landbaues e.

Although these MV may represent an effective means of coping with droughts, given their early maturing traits, landraces could prove to be more drought-tolerant and better adapted to marginal production conditions. Whether MV adoption is a risk reducing technology is very much an empirical question which this article investigates using a unique dataset from eastern Ethiopia in a year of extreme weather conditions. Results show that risk-factors coupled with access to markets and social capital drive farmers' decisions to adopt MVs. On the one hand, it appears that farmers use MVs to mitigate moderate risks. On the other hand, farmers who have been most vulnerable to extreme weather events are less likely to use MVs suggesting that MV adoption does not necessarily represent an effective means of coping with drought. Finally, findings show that MV growers are more likely to be affected by sorghum failure once controlling for exogenous production factors.","[Cavatassi, Romina] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cavatassi, Romina; Lipper, Leslie] Food & Agr Org, Agr & Dev Econ Div, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Narloch, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Wageningen University & Research; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Cambridge,"Cavatassi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands.",romina.cavatassi@fao.org,"Cavatassi, Romina/IQX-1116-2023; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020","Cavatassi, Romina/0000-0002-8600-5691;",FAO-Netherlands Partnership Program,FAO-Netherlands Partnership Program,"This article is a result of a project funded by the FAO-Netherlands Partnership Program Seed System Impact on Household Welfare and Agricultural Biodiversity in Hararghe-Ethiopia.

This approach allows the incorporation of price volatility as a risk factor into the supply response of a primary commodity sector that is composed of several markets of homogenous products. The model is applied to the Greek meat sector, which is composed of four major meat categories, that is, beef, lamb, pork, and broiler, and thus the model for the entire market includes supply and demand equations for all the four meat markets, which are estimated simultaneously. The empirical results confirm that price volatility is a significant risk factor in Greek meat production and also provide useful implications about the cost factors of production. Furthermore, the empirical findings show that the last reform of the Common Agricultural Policy seems to have had a negative effect on beef and lamb production in Greece.","[Rezitis, Anthony N.; Stavropoulos, Konstantinos S.] Univ Western Greece, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion 30100, Greece",,"Rezitis, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Western Greece, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, 2 G Seferi Str, Agrinion 30100, Greece.",arezitis@cc.uoi.gr,"Rezitis, Anthony N./AAO-4276-2021","Rezitis, Anthony N./0000-0002-2226-2269",,,,,40,3,4,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

During these periods farmers' crops are at risk and for a largely poor population few can afford the turmoil to livelihoods that goes along with drought. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the willingness of Shaanxi and Gansu farmers to purchase weather insurance. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on surveyed results of 890 farm households in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. The survey was designed specifically to extract willingness to pay for weather insurance. Factor affecting willingness to pay are explained using linear regression. Findings - The authors find strong evidence that the demand for drought insurance is downward sloping and also believe from the analysis that the demand is fairly elastic. This suggests that price matters and the results suggest that in order for wide spread adoption of weather insurance farmers will require a substantial premium, perhaps in the order of 80 per cent, as is being applied to current crop insurance initiatives. The authors find, as expected, that crop producers would be willing to pay more for insurance than livestock producers, but also find, as one would expect, that the key indicator is risk. Using a Pert distribution, the authors constructed from information gathered from farmers the expected values and standard deviations of gross revenues and yields of the most prominent crop and constructed the coefficient of variation. It was found in both cases that the higher the CV the greater the willingness to pay. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first willingness-to-pay study of weather insurance uptake in China. The authors used a unique experimental design and investigation technique to determine weather insurance demand.","[Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kong, Rong] NW A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China; [He, Guangwen] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jiujie] Renmin Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Meagher, Patrick] Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",Cornell University; Northwest A&F University - China; China Agricultural University; Renmin University of China; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Turvey, CG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cgt6@cornell.edu,,"Turvey, Calum/0000-0001-5812-2957",,,,,31,9,14,4,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - A time allocation model is developed and tested with Tobit and Heckman's sample selection models using the 2003-2007 American Time Use Survey data. Findings - Individuals concerned more with nutrition or price than luxury devote more time to preparing food-cooked-at-home. High family income and long hours worked increase time allocated to food-away-from-home, indicating that a preference for luxury and the opportunity cost of time outweigh nutritional concerns. High education reduces time spent preparing food-cooked-at-home, yet increases both participation in this activity and time spent obtaining food-away-from-home, suggesting that a preference for luxury and the opportunity cost of time dominate nutritional preference. Time allocation decisions on food preparation vary greatly by race and ethnicity. Originality/value - The results of this study confirm that the time allocation decisions regarding food preparation are largely affected by an individual's luxury preference, nutritional consciousness, and the value of time, all of which are influenced by education. The findings from this study indicate factors that influence consumers' time allocation decisions regarding food choice and their current food preparation behavior, and thus provide useful insights to nutritionists, dietitians, health practitioners, and policy makers for finding better ways to improve nutritional education, food choices and dietary habits that promote healthier diets and eating habits.","[Lo, Chu-Ping] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Tashiro, Sanae] Rhode Isl Coll, Providence, RI 02908 USA",National Taiwan University,"Lo, CP (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",cplo@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,48,8,11,3,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Analytical results show that the involvement of the member welfare-maximising co-op in innovation activity can change the nature of product differentiation and the structure of the market, and be quality and welfare enhancing by increasing innovation activity and reducing the prices of food products. The effects of co-operative involvement are shown to depend on the degree of consumer heterogeneity and the size of innovation costs.","[Giannakas, Konstantinos] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Drivas, Kyriakos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Giannakas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, 217 HC Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",kdrivas@are.berkeley.edu; kgiannakas@unl.edu,"Drivas, Kyriakos/AAP-5221-2021","Drivas, Kyriakos/0000-0002-9567-6083; Giannakas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3628-2869",,,,,30,12,13,3,44,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-857X,,,J AGR ECON,J.

However, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach used to estimate this index still uses implicit price information. This entails potential problems because these methods are susceptible to the effect of data noise, and shadow prices can prove to be inconsistent with prior knowledge on cost shares. In this article, we analyze implicit input shadow shares used in the DEA approach to estimate agricultural productivity using the Malmquist index for 63 developing countries. We then set bounds to the implicit input shares by introducing information on their likely value and compare constrained and unconstrained input shares. We conclude that the incidence of zero shadow prices justifies the introduction of constraints in the estimation of the Malmquist index. The article also presents detailed results of TFP growth in developing countries using constrained shadow shares for their estimation. We find that agricultural TFP has been growing steadily in the past 20 years even if countries like China, Brazil, and India are not considered. Remarkably, we find a clear improvement in the performance of Sub-Saharan Africa since the mid 1980s.","[Nin-Pratt, Alejandro; Yu, Bingxin] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Nin-Pratt, A (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.ninpratt@cgiar.org,,,,,,,17,16,16,0,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The mean and variance of yield are estimated for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat for eight counties in Ontario over a 26-year period. The predicted parameters of the yield distribution are then used along with expectations on the distribution of crop price to estimate area response functions. A principal contribution of the paper is the decomposition of the revenue impact on crop area allocation into separate average and variance contributions for both price and yield. This decomposition illustrates the importance of expected yield in the area allocation decisions. Crop yield is especially influenced by the length of the growing season and this has a significant impact on acreage allocations. This implies that crop area will be altered in response to expected changes in climate, even without shifts in crop prices.","[Weersink, Alfons; Olale, Edward] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Cabas, Juan H.] Univ Bio Bio, Fac Ciencias Empresariales, Dept Auditoria & Informat, Chillan, Chile",University of Guelph; Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Room 222,JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",aweersin@uoguelph.ca; jcabas@pehuen.chillan.ubiobio.cl; eolale@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593; CABAS-MONJE, JUAN/0000-0003-0734-9515",,,,,18,18,26,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Findings - This model helps explain why vertical integration dominates the US egg industry, why product contracts are prevalent in the turkey industry, and why marketing contracts have become common in the pork industry. The implications from this model are also applicable to other sectors and other countries, including China's agricultural sectors Originality/value - This paper Illustrates that perishable products are more vulnerable to opportunism, because the incomplete contract distortion is exaggerated by the perishable nature of the products However, a load government can reshape firms' choices of vertical coordination by improving its legal infrastructure to reduce the incomplete contract distortions and then weaken the role of the perishable nature of products, so that contracting (product or marketing) may take place Note that agricultural producers benefit more in selling their products through product/marketing contracts than spot markets.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lo, CP (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",cplo@ntu.edu,,,National Taiwan University,National Taiwan University(National Taiwan University),The financial support provided by the National Taiwan University is gratefully acknowledged All errors are the author's responsibility,,25,4,4,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

J,"Neves, MF",,,,"Neves, Marcos Fava",,,Clean energy policies for China: the case of ethanol,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewable energy; Economic sustainability; China; Natural resources; Brazil,,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the need of sustainability in its three major pillars for the future: profit, planet and people. Actions for companies and governments are listed, and a more in-depth discussion is performed towards one of the most viable clean and renewable fuels used by society until nowadays, ethanol. The basics of this industry, the experience of Brazil in 40 years of usage of this fuel to the car fleet and recent developments are raised. Design/methodology/approach - Traditional case study methodology is used to focus the analysis on the sugarcane industry in Brazil. This case study of this industry, together with previous projects done in 15 years of experience in this industry, is used to reach the objective of showing how this integrated chain works and addressing the importance of ethanol as an energy alternative for China Findings - China can start adopting an E10 policy (10 percent of anhydrous ethanol blended to gasoline) to contribute to reduce transport pollution in major cities. In order to have ethanol, China may invest more in the country to produce ethanol from cane and from cellulosic sources. Instead of importing oil, substitute part of its imports and consumption towards ethanol, bringing a clean fuel to the country to be blended with gasoline. China can also develop second generation ethanol to be used and generate jobs and invest in producing ethanol in some African countries and even invest in ethanol production in Brazil and import to China. Research limitations/implications - The paper is a suggestion of policies, based on the experience of Brazil. Further debate should be done to deepen the analysis of all possible points listed. It is based on a case study of one industry. Practical implications - There is a preliminary suggestion of policies and strategies for the Chinese Government, together with possible partnership models and benefits to society. Social implications - China can reduce dependencies on oil and on some unstable environments; generate jobs ana employment increase relationship with Brazil and African nations, which will be future suppliers of food also to China; reduce pollution in large cities, improving the quality of the air, possibilities of international investments for Chinese people and companies, making profits outside China and repatriating this resources and contribution to mitigate climate change over the world. Originality/value - The paper brings to Chinese community information about one of the most competitive bioenergy programs on the world and suggests possible ways of partnering towards sustainable development","[Neves, Marcos Fava] Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Neves, Marcos Fava] ESALQ USP, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Neves, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",favaneves@gmail.com,"Neves, Marcos/J-8190-2012","Neves, Marcos/0000-0002-5693-7543",,,,,17,3,3,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In a model with land as fixed factor and credit market imperfections, when an area payment is given, land rents go up by more than the subsidy. On aggregate farms may lose from the subsidy. The results depend on the extent to which subsidies have direct and indirect effects on the credit constraints, on whether farms rent or own land, and on farm heterogeneity.","[Ciaian, Pavel; Swinnen, Johan F.

While these labels may convey positive messages to consumers about the new product, they may simultaneously stigmatize the conventionally produced product by highlighting perceived problems. The net economic result for producers can be negative since consumers may decrease their willingness to pay for the conventional product that dominates the market, while the new product has a relatively small market share. This experimental research identifies this stigma effect in the case of milk, where the introduction of rBST-free and organic milk reduces consumers' willingness to purchase conventional milk.","[Kanter, Christopher] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Kaiser, Harry M.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Delaware; Cornell University,"Kanter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,National Science Foundation [SES-0551289]; New York Milk Promotion Order Advisory Board,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); New York Milk Promotion Order Advisory Board,The authors thank Deborah Kerley and Bill Schulze for comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of the article.

We estimate two systems of inverse demands for Japanese quarterly fish consumption. Results indicate that the procedures and methods employed here appear promising, and may prove beneficial for quantity and welfare analysis when modeling systems of inverse demand functions.","[McLaren, Keith R.] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Wong, K.

We find a pronounced and significant reduction in beef sales following the first discovery of an infected cow in a product-level scanner data set of a national grocery chain. Cattle futures show a pattern of abnormal price drops comparable to the scanner data. Contracts with longer maturity show smaller drops, suggesting that the market anticipated the impact to be transitory.

What is driving these price cycles has been the subject of academic studies and government investigations. The existing explanations for these price cycles all rely on the presumption that drivers are intensively sensitive to gasoline price differentials at the station level. However, no empirical evidence exists in the literature to support this presumption. This paper provides the first piece of empirical evidence. This paper uses a unique price and quantity data set and novel instruments to estimate the station level gasoline demand in the cycling market of Perth, Australia.

We find that the path of liberalization is quite different, depending on the reform approach undertaken, particularly if the United States adopted an MFN quota administration mechanism for specialty cheese imports.","[Grant, Jason H.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Rutherford, Thomas F.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Grant, JH (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,,32,10,10,2,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9092,,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This paper explores the link between trade openness, agricultural productivity growth and poverty reduction in a panel of Mediterranean countries. Technical efficiency scores and total factor productivity indexes are computed using the latent class stochastic frontier model to account for cross-country heterogeneity in farming production technologies. The relevance of agricultural productivity gains for poverty reduction is investigated through joint estimation of real per capita GDP growth and inequality changes in a dynamic panel setting. The findings illustrate the positive effects of openness on farming efficiency and productivity and give strong support to the view that agricultural productivity growth is a channel for poverty alleviation.","[Kandil, Magda] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Hassine, NB (通讯作者)，Econ Res Forum, 7 Boulos Hanna St, Cairo 12311, Egypt.",nbelhaj@erf.org.eg,,,"Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA); Economic Research Forum for the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey","Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)(Australian Aid (AusAID)); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Centre (IDRC); Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA); Economic Research Forum for the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey","The authors would like to thank the journal editor, Paolo Sckokai, and the three anonymous referees for several very constructive comments on a previous version.

Investigating the effects of population and income growth processes, we find that, contrary to market outcomes, the socially optimal allocation may call for more farmland preservation under both processes.

The database of the analysis comes from 12 selected demographic indicators related to the ageing process in the period 1998-2007. Based on the factor analysis, out of 12 indicators, we chose the ageing index and the ratio of productive population, where by the means of cluster analysis, we created groups of regions with the similar age of population as of 1(st) December 2007 and the similar rapidity of ageing process in the period 1998-2007. The graphs showing the regions by the level reached by the indicator and the respective average growth coefficient are included in the contribution.

Findings - Comparing TIT growth in China and India it is found that efficiency improvement played a dominant role in promoting TFP growth in China, while technical change has also contributed positively. In India, the major source of productivity improvement came from technical change, as efficiency barely changed over the last three decades, which explains lower TFP growth than in China. Agricultural research has significantly contributed to improve agricultural productivity in both China and India. Even today, returns to agricultural R&D investments are very high, with benefit/cost ratios ranging from 207 to 96 in China and from 296 to 14 8 in India. Originality/value - The applied methodology and the comparison between TFP growth patterns contribute to a better understanding of the consequences that the different approaches to agricultural reform followed by China and India had on the performance of agriculture in both countries.","[Pratt, Alejandro Nin; Yu, Bingxin; Fan, Shenggen] Int Food Policy Res Inst, DSGD, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Pratt, AN (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, DSGD, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,"Fan, Shenggen/0000-0002-2658-4863",,,,,17,18,18,2,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.

A version of the model is publicly available and will be useful to CGE modelers studying Chinese agricultural issues (www.monash.edu.au/policy/sinoterm.htm). Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines data sources for building SinoTERM. It contains a CGE application to agriculture in China. Unlike the national input-output table published by the National Bureau of Statistics, the master database of SinoTERM contains many agricultural sectors. Findings - CGE models that represent a nation as a single economy may offer rich insights into winners and losers from particular policy scenarios. Multi-regional analysis takes this a step further by comparing outcomes for regions in which particular industries are a relatively large part of the economy. Research limitations/implications - This paper builds on the first SinoTERM paper in several ways. First, the database is disaggregated further to represent tea, sugar cane and silkworms as individual sectors in the CGE database. Second, given the extraordinary economic growth in China, the national and regional database has been updated to 2006 using data from the 2007 yearbook. Third, the paper contains an application to agriculture: it examines the impacts of productivity growth in different agricultural sectors in China. Originality/value - The regional CGE model used in this application could be used to explore many other policy issues concerning agriculture in China.","[Wittwer, Glyn; Horridge, Mark] Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Wittwer, G (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",glyn.wittwer@buseco.monash.edu.au,"Horridge, Jonathan Mark/A-6008-2008","Horridge, Jonathan Mark/0000-0002-1070-5763",,,,,22,8,10,4,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,,,CHINA AGRIC ECON REV,China Agric.

The data of production costs were recorded in books and transported to a spreadsheet for further analysis and organization of information. The results showed significant differences in costs between the two production systems. The SISCAL had lower fixed and variable costs, but higher production cycle and less control of fattening animals. The SISCON had higher fixed and variable costs but lower production cycle and greater control in animal development.

When the tenant's expected punishment is smaller than or equal to a critical value, an increase in the tenant's expected punishment will enhance the landlord's probability to choose monitoring. However, when the tenant's expected punishment is bigger than a critical value, an increase in the tenant's expected punishment will reduce the landlord's probability to choose monitoring.

The collection, the projection and the analysis of data were verified as to their viability, payback and return internal tax and a positive result was found; the investment returning in 5 years and 9 months (simple payback) and 7 years and six months (discounted payback) and the return internal tax was 13,07% per year, which meant gains for the investor. Furthermore, the gain for the environment is highlighted for the proposed investment eliminates the methane gas by liberating the carbonic gas, which is less harmful.","[Zanin, Antonio; Bagatini, Fabiano Marcos; Pessatto, Camila Batista] Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco UNOCHAPECO, BR-89809000 Chapeco, SC, Brazil",Universidade Comunitaria Regional de Chapeco,"Zanin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco UNOCHAPECO, Senador Attilio Fontana 591-E, BR-89809000 Chapeco, SC, Brazil.",zanin@unochapeco.edu.br; bagatini@unochapeco.edu.br; camila-pessatto@auroraalimentos.com.br,"Zanin, Antonio/GYJ-7908-2022",,,,,,11,2,2,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUSTOS AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,JAN-APR,2010,6.0,1,,,,,121,139,,,,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,630RZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280292100007,0

All cohorts diversify but the largest farms do not diversify as rapidly as medium-sized farms. New entrants are generally large, and they diversify more rapidly than comparably sized incumbents do.

It is felt that this study enables such an evaluation by setting out the costs, profitability and efficiency of the cotton ginning industry in Turkey and other major cotton-producing countries. The results obtained from the study show that unit production costs of ginning factories are high and that they have low operating profits. In particular, it was found that ginning factories do not operate efficiently with regard to the labour force employed and the amount of capital invested. At the same time, some suggestions have been made for the improvement of ginning factories. In this regard, attention was drawn to measures to increase the capacity of ginning factories and to raise the level of technology used, and ways of getting government supports, and to the topic of education.","[Adanacioglu, Hakan; Olgun, F.

In general, crops of cassava and sugar cane production value presented above the opportunity cost, and therefore more attractive in economic terms.","[Grzebieluckas, Cleci] Univ Estado Mato Grosso UNEMAT, BR-88037000 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Bornia, Antonio Cezar; de Souza Campos, Lucila Maria; Selig, Paulo Mauricio] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040970 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Grzebieluckas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Estado Mato Grosso UNEMAT, Rua Joao Pio Duarte Silva 602,Bloco D Apto 103, BR-88037000 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",cleci@unemat.br; cezar@inf.ufsc.br; lucila.campos@terra.com.br; pauloselig@gmail.com,"SELIG, PAULO/AAT-7871-2020; de Souza Campos, Lucila M./D-4322-2012; Bornia, Antonio Cezar/N-3925-2014","de Souza Campos, Lucila M./0000-0002-1610-7617; Bornia, Antonio Cezar/0000-0003-3468-7536",,,,,17,3,3,2,8,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-APR,2010,6.0,1,,,,,104,120,,,,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,630RZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280292100006,0

The empirical results indicate that though written contracts are sparingly used in the milk transactions, milk producers are more likely to adopt such contracts compared to traders. The results also show that location of producer, source of market information, distance to markets, travel time to buyers or suppliers, gender of operator, and presence or absence of enforceable contracts significantly influence the type of coordination mechanism used in both producer-buyer and retailer-seller transactions and travel time to milk suppliers.","[Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Birachi, Eliud A.] Egerton Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Business Management, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Kiel; Egerton University,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",German Academic Exchange Services (DAAD),German Academic Exchange Services (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the German Academic Exchange Services (DAAD) for collecting the data used in this study.

The strategy used by organizations to minimize the risks is the agricultural insurance, which is mandatory to rural producers in order to be able to access credit. It is important to pick out that this credit is private, facing the absence of the public sector in the financing of agriculture in the country. Based on the results, one can say that organizations operating in Agro-industrial Complex of Soybeans in the region of Alto Parana-Paraguay have well-defined strategies and that they organize themselves efficiently, both agricultural production as the flow of goods and services.","[da Costa, Maykell Leite; dos Reys, Marcos Alves] Univ Fed Santa Maria, BR-97015900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Dorr, Andrea Cristina] Univ Fed Santa Maria, BR-97050140 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Strassburger, Rubia] Univ Fed Santa Maria, BR-97015000 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"da Costa, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Maria, Av Roraima,1000 Camobi, BR-97015900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",maykellcosta@gmail.com; andreadoerr@yahoo.com.br; m_reys@hotmail.com; rubiast@hotmail.com,,"Dorr, Andrea Cristina/0000-0003-0219-7380",,,,,14,0,0,0,12,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,MAY-AUG,2011,7.0,2,,,,,107,119,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,885ZQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299820400006,0

Yet Cooxupe leaders face increasing challenges ahead. The world coffee industry has evolved in such a way that growth is deemed essential for survival. The growth imperative poses additional challenges to Cooxupe. First, it becomes more difficult to originate coffees with the quality consistency expected by clients. Second, the increased size and heterogeneity of the membership may have negative impacts on cohesion.

About 90% of wheat consumed in Brazil is of external origin, and because it is a commodity is priced in U.S. dollars. Because of this exposure, it is mister, that the industry adopt a stance of protection (hedging) in order to eliminate possible fluctuations in the price of exchange upon payment of purchases. We analyzed the behavior of the price of wheat versus the dollar over the past four years. It was found that, due to oscillation of the price of wheat, it should be hedge to protect such oscillation. There are several tools available in the market to perform the hedges, but they all lead to additional costs for the company you want to buy these hedges. Firms may have hedged by buying dollars or through investments backed by U.S. dollars. However, these tools require a great availability of resources. If the company does not have these available, you can use the derivatives market hedge and seek cheaper.

We apply the real option theory of investment to the pasture investment decision facing livestock producers in southwest Western Australia. In 2006, livestock producers thinned their herds as pasture availability dwindled due to extreme drought conditions. This left producers with a unique opportunity to either establish new perennial pastures for their cattle or utilize volunteer annual pasture and invest in more sheep breeders. In either case, large and irreversible investments fraught with multiple sources of uncertainty implies that one can gain useful insights by casting the investment problem in a real option context. The results suggest that required rates of return for each investment alternative are about 1% to 1.5% higher than standard NPV would suggest with sheep production having the lower required rate of return.","[Tozer, Peter R.] Curtin Univ Technol, Muresk Inst Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Stokes, Jeffrey R.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Curtin University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Tozer, PR (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Muresk Inst Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",,"Tozer, Peter/AEW-0894-2022","Tozer, Peter/0000-0002-2429-7414",,,,,17,7,8,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-7195,,,REV AGR ECON,Rev.

For this, we used the cost data and gross receipts of Agrianual - Brazilian Yearbook of Agriculture, in the period from 1999 to 2008. We analyzed the cost variables using the Kolmogorov- Smirnov (Lilliefors) to verify the normality of the data. Subsequently, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient for data said not normal and Pearson correlation coefficient, when the data had normal distribution. The purpose of calculating these coefficients was to examine whether the cost variables were correlated linearly. After calculating the coefficient of determination, was defined how much of a cost variable is explained by the variable gross revenue. Moreover, we obtained the linear regression equation to ascertain the dependence between variables, along with the estimate standard error. The results shown were that certain variable cost of soybean production, presented linear and predicted correlation with gross revenue and other variables showed no linear correlation, therefore, were excluded from the analysis.","[Duarte, Sergio Lemos] Fac Presidente Antonio Carlos Uberlandia UNIPAC, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Pereira, Carlos Antonio] Univ Fed Uberlandia FAGEN UFU, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Tavares, Marcelo] Univ Fed Uberlandia FAMAT UFU, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [dos Reis, Ernando Antonio] Univ Fed Uberlandia FACIC UFU, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil",Universidade Presidente Antonio Carlos; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Universidade Federal de Uberlandia,"Duarte, SL (通讯作者)，Fac Presidente Antonio Carlos Uberlandia UNIPAC, Rua Barao de Camargos,695 Fundinho, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",sergioufu@gmail.com; carlos_ctb@hotmail.com; mtavares@ufu.br; eareis@ufu.br,"Reis, Ernando/R-6791-2019",,,,,,33,4,4,0,10,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,JAN-APR,2011,7.0,1,,,,,78,100,,,,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,858ZW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297844300005,0

The cost control is an indispensable source of information because the costs directly influence the results. The management in agriculture, particularly in family farm agriculture is characterized by a large shortage of formal decision-making and use of information technology. The decisions in this sector are often based solely on experience and intuition. The aim of this paper is to examine the cost controls in family agriculture of the South-Central Region of Parana and seek relationships that may exist between the socio-economic profiles of the properties and the control of different costs. Statistical analysis is based on a sample of 235 (two hundred and thirty-five) properties for which information was raised by means of a questionnaire. Cultures widely prevalent in the region are tobacco, corn, beans and soybeans. The results show that family farm agriculture of the South-Central Region of Parana is very homogeneous, the cost controls are weak and the variables that make up the socio-economic profile of the properties are not differentiating factors of the cost controls adopted.","[Clemente, Ademir] Univ Fed Parana, UFPR Campus III Setor Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, BR-80210070 Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Souza, Alceu] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, BR-80215901 Curitiba, PR, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana,"Clemente, A (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, UFPR Campus III Setor Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, 1 Andar,Av Prefeito Lothario Meissner,632 Jardim, BR-80210070 Curitiba, PR, Brazil.",ademir@ufpr.br; alceu.souza@pucpr.br; marinestaffarel@yahoo.com.br; gerigkw@yahoo.com.br,"Taffarel, Marines/HGA-3922-2022",,,,,,15,4,4,1,13,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,SEP-DEC,2010,6.0,3,,,,,21,43,,,,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,858ZR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297843600002,0

The largest degrees of discrepancies across datasets occur for food categories containing more random-weight foods without universal product codes.","[Zhen, Chen; Muth, Mary K.] RTI Int, Food & Agr Policy Res Program, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Taylor, Justin L.] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Leibtag, Ephraim] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Research Triangle Institute; Washington State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zhen, C (通讯作者)，RTI Int, Food & Agr Policy Res Program, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA.",,"Muth, John F/E-9027-2012","Muth, Mary/0000-0001-7879-0469",USDA ERS [53-3K06-06-1302],USDA ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Funded by Contract 53-3K06-06-1302 with USDA ERS.

We extend the literature by investigating the economic effectiveness of some previously unaddressed strategies. These include early detection, enhanced vaccine availability, and enhanced surveillance under various combinations of slaughter, surveillance, and vaccination. We also consider disease introduction points at a large feedlot, a backgrounder feedlot, a large grazing herd, and a backyard herd all in the Texas High Plains. To examine the economic implications of these strategies, we use a two-component stochastic framework. The first component is the epidemiologic model that simulates the spread of FMD as affected by control policies and introduction scenarios. The second component is an economic module, which calculates cattle industry losses and costs of disease control strategy implementation, and processes the results in a stochastic framework. The results show that early detection of the disease is the most effective mechanism for minimizing the costs of outbreak. Under some circumstances, enhanced surveillance also proved an effective strategy.","[Elbakidze, Levan] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Highfield, Linda; McCarl, Bruce A.; Norby, Bo] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ward, Michael] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Idaho; University of Idaho; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Sydney,"Elbakidze, L (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",,"Ward, Michael Patrick/GRX-1851-2022; McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011; Ward, Michael Patrick/W-1897-2019; Highfield, L/HKN-4504-2023; Ward, Michael Patrick/C-5758-2009","Ward, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-9921-4986; Highfield, L/0000-0001-6958-9333; Ward, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-9921-4986",National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Diseases,National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Diseases,Funding for this research was provided by the National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Diseases established at Texas A&M University.

It is a descriptive study about the production practices through the application of semi-structured questionnaire with the farmer. Additionally, the construction of the study made use of secondary data and documents. Data analysis and the results from this qualitative research generated a detailed explanation of the CVP application in the silkworm production process. By applying the analysis of the CVP we can recognize the enterprise profitability in sericulture. Therefore, it is evident the importance of using management accounting practices in the management of rural organizations, specifically related to the silkworm producers, supporting an effective control on the resources used and outcomes.","[do Nascimento, Cristiano] Univ Fed Parana, BR-88048416 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [dos Santos Bortolocci Espejo, Marcia Maria] Univ Fed Parana, BR-80210170 Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Panucci-Filho, Laurindo] Univ Fed Parana, BR-87600970 Nova Esperanca, PR, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana,"do Nascimento, C (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, Isaltina Assuncao Farias 331, BR-88048416 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",cristiano.nascimento.cont@gmail.com; marciabortolocci@ufpr.br; laurindopanucci@hotmail.com,"Panucci-Filho, Laurindo Ms./L-6891-2015; Espejo, Marcia MSB/K-1300-2014","Espejo, Marcia MSB/0000-0002-9081-781X",,,,,24,0,0,0,16,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio,MAY-AUG,2010,6.0,2,,,,,131,162,,,,,,32,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,858ZO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297843000007,0

An examination of the threat type carried out by combining the changes of market share found that the direct threat was the most frequent. Moreover, Korean companies utilized the US Japan Semiconductor Agreement as a window of opportunity. And it is more persuasive to emphasize the firm's own initiative rather than to overstate the role of government. Korean overtaking in the semiconductor industry was possible because of a combination of these various factors.","Hongik Univ, Dept Int Business, Yongi Gun 339701, Chungnam, South Korea",Hongik University,"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Hongik Univ, Dept Int Business, Yongi Gun 339701, Chungnam, South Korea.",yykim@wow.hongik.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,14,14,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The central questions focus on whether increases in disposable income outweigh the associated changes in housing costs, especially with movements up (and down) the urban hierarchy, to (and from) larger and more expensive population-growth regions. The questions are addressed using Swedish Census data for 3.5 million individuals and two fixed-effect panel models are estimated for four consecutive time-periods, 1993-2002. The results consistently show relatively higher increases in disposable income moving up the urban hierarchy. Taking changes in housing expenditure into account, this pattern is however reversed; the largest gains are made by households moving from larger to smaller labour markets, a significantly smaller share of total domestic migration. The results point to factors beyond short-term nominal income gains as important in explaining the bulk of domestic migration.","[Korpi, Martin] Stockholm Sch Econ, EHFF, Stockholm, Sweden; [Korpi, Martin] Inst Futures Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Clark, William A.

The role of traffic law enforcement in the reduction of accidents has been studied by relatively few papers and with mixed results that may be due to a simultaneity problem. Traffic law enforcement may reduce the number of accidents, but police are also likely to be stricter in accident-prone areas. We use municipal budgetary shortfalls as an instrumental variable to identify the effect of traffic citations on traffic safety and show that budgetary shortfalls lead to more frequent issuance of tickets to drivers. Using a panel of municipalities in Massachusetts, we show that increases in the numbers of tickets written reduce the number of motor vehicle accidents and accident-related injuries. The findings show that failure to control for endogeneity results in a significant underestimation of the positive effect of law enforcement on traffic safety.","[Makowsky, Michael D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Johns Hopkins University; George Mason University,"Makowsky, MD (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,"Makowsky, Michael/K-9641-2013","Makowsky, Michael/0000-0002-5558-0490",,,,,36,58,75,1,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The derivation assumes a three sector economy and consists of a set of discrete operations applied to conventional national aggregates. It demonstrates that the Marxian aggregates are fully consistent at the economy-wide level, and that the mapping from conventional to Marxian aggregates is well-defined. This mapping relies on Marxian class theory, and it is this class theory that distinguishes the Marxian aggregates from the conventional and Sraffian alternatives. It is shown that the Marxian surplus has no necessary relation to the conventional measures of either net operating surplus or net product, and hence that neither of these serve as useful proxies for the Marxian aggregates.","Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Olsen, EK (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 5100 Rockhill Rd, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",olsenek@umkc.edu,,,,,,,24,2,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

However, based typically on evaluation at the macroeconomic level, doubts persist about the utility of these data. This paper evaluates the ability of the underlying firm-level expectations to anticipate subsequent outcomes. Importantly, this evaluation is not hampered by only having access to qualitative outcome data obtained from subsequent business surveys. Quantitative outcome data are also exploited. This required access to a unique panel dataset which matches firms' responses from the qualitative business survey with the same firms' quantitative replies to a different survey carried out by the national statistical office. Nonparametric tests then reveal an apparent paradox. Despite evidence that the qualitative and quantitative outcome data are related, we find that the expectational data offer rational forecasts of the qualitative but not the quantitative outcomes. We discuss the role of discretisation errors and the loss function in explaining this paradox. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the mode and activity stop dimensions of weekday commute travel is important since the highest level of weekday traffic congestion in urban areas occurs during the commute periods. The paper employs a copula-based joint multinomial logit - ordered modeling framework in which commute mode choice is modeled using a multinomial logit formulation and the number of commute stops is modeled using an ordered response formulation. The data used in this study are drawn from the Time use multipurpose survey conducted between 2002 and 2003 by the Turin Town Council and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in the Greater Turin metropolitan area of Italy. The results highlight the importance of accommodating the inter-relationship between commute mode choice and commute stops behavior.

The differences among the types of projects and the effects of project size, time and demand ramp-up are also examined. Our study finds that traffic forecasts for Norwegian toll projects are fairly accurate, on average. However, a majority of the investigated projects experienced overestimation, and a huge general error in the forecasts suggests that this is also a source of risk that merits greater scrutiny. Inaccuracies are common among all project types and sizes. Operating costs are frequently underestimated; on average, these costs are about 30% higher than estimated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different disaggregation procedures are evaluated: the historical and daily top-down approaches. Data pre-processing and input selection are carried out prior to the model adjustment. The prediction results are validated using multiple time series, as well as rolling origin evaluations with model re-calibration, and the results are compared with those obtained using daily models, allowing us to analyze the effectiveness of the top-down approach for longer forecast horizons.

These interpret the normality of informality either through a structuralist lens as arising out of exclusion from state benefits and the circuits of the modern economy or through a neoliberal and/or post-structuralist lens as driven by the voluntary exit of workers out of formal institutions and into this alternative realm. To evaluate critically the validity of these competing explanations, this article reports a 2005/6 survey of informal employment in post-socialist Ukraine. Analyzing the results of 600 face-to-face interviews, the finding is that either/or explanations need to be transcended. Informal employment is neither universally driven by exclusion nor exit. Instead, some participate mostly due to exclusion, others mostly for exit rationales, and some for a combination of the two, with different mixtures across different populations and types of informal employment. The outcome is a call to move towards more context-bound understandings of the pervasiveness of informality through greater appreciation of the heterogeneity of this sphere and how both exit and exclusion are variously entwined in different settings.","[Williams, Colin C.] Sch Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Round, John] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Rodgers, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Birmingham; University of Sheffield,"Williams, CC (通讯作者)，Sch Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",C.C.Williams@sheffield.ac.uk; J.Round@bham.ac.uk; P.Rodgers@sheffield.ac.uk,"Williams, Colin C/B-1198-2016","Williams, Colin C/0000-0002-3610-1933; Round, John/0000-0003-0005-2348",,,,,93,20,21,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The case shows that two different approaches get the same result, but TOPSIS is simpler apparently.","Shandong Econ Univ, Informat Management Sch, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, PD (通讯作者)，Shandong Econ Univ, Informat Management Sch, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China.",peide.liu@gmail.com,"Liu, Peide/D-3392-2013; Liu, Pei/JFS-0950-2023",,,,,,31,11,11,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This is illustrated through a review of 43 transport strategies published for the five largest cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide) in Australia between 1965 and 2010. The review is complemented with observations from a survey of public servants in the policy and strategy divisions of state and territory transport agencies. The results of this research are examined using the Dolowitz-Marsh framework, considering the need to seek policy transfer, who is involved, what is transferred, from where policy lessons are learnt, the degree of transfer, constraints to policy learning and demonstration that transfer has occurred. The evidence for policy transfer and learning is mixed. Transport policy adopted by the states of Australia for their respective capital cities has been remarkably similar between the cities and has changed in a similar way over time, indicating the almost seamless transfer of concepts. Less positively, there is little published evidence that the performance of previous strategies has been critically examined and lessons learned, and that the approaches adopted in strategies are superior to alternative approaches and are able to achieve the objectives set for them.

This criticism is also frequently levelled at professional forecast probabilities of contractions. This paper addresses the problem of incorporating the entire distribution of professional forecasts into an econometric model for forecasting contractions and expansions. A new augmented probit approach is proposed, involving the transformation of the distribution of professional forecasts into a 'professional forecast' prior for the economic data underlying the probit model. Since the object of interest is the relationship between the distribution of professional forecasts and the probit model's economic-data dependent parameters, the solution avoids criticisms levelled at the accuracy of professional forecast based point estimates of contractions. An application to US real GDP data shows that the model yields significant forecast improvements relative to alternative approaches. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters.

It became the governing standard following the 1978 publication of Robert Bork's The Antitrust Paradox. The consumer welfare standard has been instrumental to the implementation and enforcement of antitrust laws. Courts believe they understand this standard, although they do not bother to analyze it. Scholars hold various views about the desirable interpretations of the standard and they selectively use random judicial statements to substantiate opposite views. This article introduces the antitrust consumer welfare paradox: it shows that, under all present interpretations of the term consumer welfare, there are several sets of circumstances in which the application of antitrust laws may hurt consumers and reduce total social welfare. This article shows that, when Bork used the term consumer welfare, he obscured basic concepts in economics. This article clarifies that the antitrust methodology permits only surplus analysis and does not accommodate welfare analysis. It explains the conceptual differences between the terms surplus and welfare and the relevant implications. This article further explains the differences between two other competing standards-consumer surplus and total surplus-that presently serve as proposed interpretations for the term consumer welfare. Each interpretation has some limitations and the necessary analytical progress calls first for conceptual clarity. This article argues that whatever good ends the consumer welfare phrase may have once served, antitrust law should now lay it to rest.","Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Orbach, BY (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",barak@orbach.org,,,,,,,116,75,80,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Like previous empirical studies, this study employs an instrumental variable method in a system of two equations, where child quantity is instrumented by an exogenous variation in fertility, namely gender sameness of the first two-born children. In the baseline estimation as well as in a series of robustness check, our key findings are that there is a positive yet insignificant impact of child quantity on child quality.

The cultural part involves the understanding of combined meanings generated from the place-making process by sex workers, clients and facilitators. We base this paper on triangulated information from key informants, observations, interviews with clients and media reports. Urban places in Goa where sex work is negotiated and conducted are contested, gendered and veiled. Sex work is not merely about sex workers and their clients; it is much broader and intermeshed with different people playing the role of facilitators.

After situating the programme in the context of the welfare reform of 1996 and the 'new paternalism' (Lawrence Mead) built into it, the paper proceeds to introduce and discuss Michel Foucault's concept of 'pastoral power' as it is developed in his lectures on the history of governmentality. Using this concept as a critical heuristic device the paper analyses and problematizes the relations of care and concomitant processes of subjectification prevalent in faith-based organizations and, particularly, their mentoring programmes.

The values of the net year household income per capita (in CZK) are evaluated from data based on the Results of the Living Conditions Survey (a national module of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)) that has been organized yearly by the Czech Statistical Office since 2005. Data for the whole sample are analyzed and the comparison with the group of professionals in informatics is given. In the survey Czech households are taken as statistical units and we will analyze an occupation of a head of a household. The group of occupations in informatics is not included in the questionnaire the closest groups are scientists and experts in physics and related sciences, architects and engineers (the creative workers). This paper focuses on the use of lognormal distribution. In this paper moment and quantile methods, maximum likelihood or L-moment methods are used to estimate parameters of lognormal distribution. Using various methods we obtain different estimates of parameters of the theoretical distribution. The magnitude of these differences is shown in the paper together with the impact of these differences on characteristics of income.","[Bilkova, Diana; Mala, Ivana] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,bilkova@vse.cz; malai@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,,,,,15,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,51,60,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200006,0

Theoretical analysis of the model enabled us to distinguish 28 factors as potentially influencing the entrepreneurship of the Born Global companies. Fifty Born Global companies were surveyed in Lithuania and it was determined that almost all external business factors, that were considered in theoretical framework as promoting entrepreneurship, really promote the entrepreneurship in Lithuania.

A deep evaluation of energy consumption and accurate prediction of lifetime is significant before deployment. Once sensor nodes are deployed, it is impossible to change batteries when nodes run out of energy. As a result, nodes may fail and not perform their purpose long before the expected lifetime is performed. Since erroneous prediction of battery lifetime causes high costs making a network of small devices useless, is necessary an accurate energy analysis and precise lifetime prediction. This paper brings contributions by presenting an evaluation algorithm to predict power consumption and battery life for a Gumstix Verdex device. In order to give some recommendations to users and optimize the energy spent on the Gumstix device, it is important to know how much power is consumed.

The empirical evidence is based on two quantitative datasets describing innovation performance, innovation capacity and growth in small enterprises. The first dataset consists of the self-reported data of the innovation capacity and innovation performance of small enterprises. The second dataset covering the period of four years comprises the annual key figures of enterprises. After removing the cases with missing and extreme values, the total number of enterprises is 296. The descriptive statistics and non-parametric methods are used in the analysis. The results suggest that the age of the enterprise and the degree of innovation capacity is associated with innovation performance. The enterprises characterised by radical and diversified innovation development are younger than the non-innovators or the incremental innovators. As regards innovation capacity, the degree of capacity increases while the innovation performance profile shifts from the non-innovator characterised by low innovation performance towards the diversified innovator characterised by high innovation performance. Instead, the findings of this study reveal only a weak, statistically insignificant relationship between growth and innovation performance. In summary, this study provides two contributions to academic literature. First, it crystallises the relationship between innovation performance, innovation capacity and growth in small enterprises. Second, the results deepen the existing literature by providing a detailed view of the characteristics of different kinds of innovation performers.

Based on a relational perspective this paper analyses the case of the Mechatronics Cluster in Southern Jutland, Denmark. We found that cluster managers are not aware of the importance of social and symbolic capital. Cluster managers could have access to both but they are not aware of this resource and they don't have any knowledge how to manage social and symbolic capital. Just to integrate social-capital-supporting initiatives in the day to day business would help to develop and to foster social and symbolic capital on a low cost level.

However, clients cannot always be sure that an advisor is actually using a knowledge advantage to act in the client's best interests. In two studies we investigated the influence of an advisor's perceived degree of self-interested intention on the client's intention to accept and use their advice. We report two experiments in which clients received the same advice from a supposed representative of either a profit or a non-profit organization. The results of our first study suggest that clients who were confronted with an advisor from an organization with a profit-oriented background ascribed higher levels of self-interested intentions to the advisor and perceived the advisor to be less trustworthy. Furthermore, clients were less willing to rely on the advisor's recommendation, and this effect was mediated by the perceived trustworthiness of the advisor. In our second study we conceptually replicated the findings of Study 1 using behavioral measures, and also differentiated three different facets of trustworthiness (competence, benevolence and integrity) in the interaction between advisor and client.

Unlike past studies that have viewed entry mode choices narrowly, we use a broader set of factors that influence entry mode choices as well as consider more entry modes. Specifically, we study the impact of determinants, such as a host country's experience, cultural distance, industry asset intensity, resource commitment and location, and how they affect the following entry modes choices: wholly owned enterprises, equity joint ventures, contractual joint ventures and joint stock companies. Furthermore, we examine how the fit between these determinants and entry modes affect firm performance.

This paper provides an interim assessment of Taiwan's early entry strategies, involving a focus on mainstream crystalline silicon solar cells, as well as entry into emerging niche sectors such as thin-film second-generation cells and concentrated solar cells utilizing novel semiconductor materials. Taiwan firms' fast-follower strategies are highlighted and assessed in light of the literature on industrial dynamics and catch-up processes generally. The paper makes a contribution to theory in building nine propositions regarding fast followership, based on prior industrial experiences and this latest episode in the solar PV industry.

Two independent variables from the entrepreneurial potential model, perceived desirability and perceived feasibility, were employed to examine entrepreneurial intention toward technology adoption. Performance expectancy was added as a new independent variable to investigate entrepreneur's intention to adopt and use IT innovation in their companies. We also hypothesized that age and gender moderates the relationship between the determinants and dependent variable. This study used real entrepreneurs as samples to collect data. The survey data was collected from 1000 Malaysian entrepreneurs in Kuala Lumpur. This paper used the structural equation model to test the proposed model. The results found that perceived desirability and perceived feasibility are significantly and positively related to entrepreneurial intention to adopt and use IT innovation, whereas the direct effect of performance expectancy on an entrepreneur's intention is not. The moderating variables (age and gender) revealed that performance expectancy was positive and significant toward behavior intention for men and young entrepreneurs compared to female and aged entrepreneurs. Results also showed that younger women are more interested compared to men to use IT innovation if they feel they have enough skill and ability to use it.","[Moghavvemi, Sedigheh; Salleh, Noor A.

However, they have some quality problems and decided to work with a logistics firm by using the most convenient port alternative. A number of conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria exist for evaluating alternative ports. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by ambiguities and vagueness. To cope with this problem, the fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) method is used in this study. First, we defined the region specific criteria consisting of the twenty sub-criteria under the six main criteria clusters that influence the selection of container port. Then seven alternative container ports located in the Marmara Sea were determined. The results showed that the most convenient district for the container port is Istanbul District, which is one of the biggest economical centers in Eastern Europe.

All these inputs were strictly classified, synthesized and operated. We reached some interesting conclusions, aspiring to improve the general approach of mathematics in the study programmes of the engineering faculties, seen as essential clusters between the high school graduates and the dynamic labour market of nowadays.","[Salceanu, A.; Pletea, A.; Crainiceanu, F.

During this period, the colonial regime has actively encouraged commercialisation of forest resources while several restrictions were clamped up on the tribals and other forest users. Here it is argued that the initiatives of the state towards conservation were primarily intended to curtail the access enjoyed by tribals and other forest users to facilitate commercial exploitation. Plunder of forest wealth continued unhindered in a systematic manner leading to denudation of vast stretches of green cover and a drastic decline in the living conditions of the tribals in Madras Presidency.

Little attention has been paid to this evidence in the economic growth literature, where the recent focus is on technological change. We extend the idea of agglomeration and congestion effects to the area of innovation by empirically looking for a nonlinear link between population density and patent activity. A panel data set consisting of observations on 302 USA metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) over a 10-year period from 1990 to 1999 is utilized. Following the patent and R&D literature, models that account for the discreet nature of the dependent variable are employed. Strong evidence is found that agglomeration and congestion are important in explaining the vast differences in patent rates across US cities. The most important reason cities continue to exist, given the dramatic drop in transportation costs for physical goods over the last century, is probably related to the forces of agglomeration as they apply to knowledge spillovers. Therefore, the empirical investigation proposed here is an important part of understanding the viability of urban areas in the future.","[Sedgley, Norman] Loyola Univ Maryland, Sellinger Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA; [Elmslie, Bruce] Univ New Hampshire, Whittemore Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Loyola University Maryland; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Sedgley, N (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Sellinger Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",nsedgley@loyola.edu; bte@cisunix.unh.edu,,,,,,,50,22,24,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Two sets of factors are tested with conditional logit model: characteristics of mobile operators and characteristics of users. Following theoretical and empirical literature suggesting that in addition to common factors of demand, network effects can also have an important role in consumers' choice we included them into the model assuming that they were present in Slovenia. Data on the characteristics of mobile users were gathered through a telephone survey, while data for attributes of mobile operators directly from the operators. We find that two characteristics of operators, the number of their subscribers and their market shares, have a positive impact on the probability of choosing a mobile operator. This implies that network effects, which are present when the value of network increases with the number of users, had an influence on user's choice. These results reflect market developments in the observed period, when the 'battle' for new customers resulted in a continuous fall in prices while the Slovenian mobile market, contrary to the foreseen trends, remained highly concentrated. Among characteristics of users monthly income has a significant impact on the choice of a mobile operator. Users with higher income were more likely to select the mobile operator Debitel, while those with lower income its rivals Mobitel and Si.mobil. Unlike Debitel the latter two provided pre-paid packages which are supposed to be more often chosen by low-income users.","[Svigelj, Matej; Hrovatin, Nevenka] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theory & Policy, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Svigelj, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theory & Policy, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",matej.svigelj@ef.uni-lj.si; nevenka.hrovatin@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Yet, in spite of the near-death experience of the markets, the economies of the world now seem to be on the path to a slow, albeit wobbly, recovery. Moreover, even though for many countries productive output is lower and unemployment is higher than in earlier boom periods, one important and pleasant reality remains: Income per capita for the world is near an all-time high and many countries boast a per capita income that could only be dreamed about in previous centuries. In the past several decades many countries, through the hard work of their citizens, favorable business climate of their governments, and judicious management of technological change, have experienced both above average growth and higher levels of GDP and per capita income. On the other hand, the citizens of many other countries have not been so fortunate and have continued to experience both low income and flat or even declining real income growth.

This study aim is to investigate the most important tools of ERR systems that help in supply chain information sharing, cooperation and cost optimization to reduce the environmental impact of firm's activity. The results show that the emissions to air and water, and energy consumption are the main logistics impacts to the environment. These results can be used to measure the potential monetary value of such issues, and minimize logistic system influence on environmental performance.

This study will discuss these issues by constructing a structural equation model on the base of related literatures analyzing according to the restaurant industry surveying data. It is founded that there is no a direct relationship between the internal service quality and customer satisfaction degree, but the former can affect employee's royalty, organizational commitment and job performance. Employee's loyalty and organizational commitment can directly impact the job performance; further affect the customer satisfaction degree.

If properly developed such a metric could also be used to produce a single overall quality-equality ranking of mainstream and heterodox journals. Utilizing citation data and peer evaluations of 62 heterodox economics journals, a research quality measure is developed and then used to rank the journals.

Ordered logit and probit models are well known, including extensions to accommodate random parameters and heteroscedasticity in unobserved variance. This paper extends the ordered choice random parameter model to permit random parameterisation of thresholds and decomposition to establish observed sources of systematic variation in the threshold parameter distribution. We illustrate the empirical gains of this model, over the traditional ordered choice model, by identifying candidate influences on the role that specific attributes play, in the sense of being ignored or not (including being aggregated where they are in common-metric units), in an individual's choice amongst unlabelled attribute packages of alternative tolled and non-tolled routes for the commuting trip. The empirical ordering represents the number of attributes attended to from the full fixed set. The evidence suggests that there is significant heterogeneity associated with the thresholds, that can be connected to systematic sources associated with the respondent (that is, gender) and the choice experiment, and hence the generalised extension of the ordered choice model is an improvement, behaviourally, over the simpler model.","[Greene, William H.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Fac Econ & Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",New York University; University of Sydney,"Greene, WH (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA.",wgreene@stern.nyu.edu; D.Hensher@itls.usyd.edu.au,,"Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,45,41,52,0,10,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Four Norwegian railway projects are analysed ex post. We have found that the choice of reference points that are chosen to represent the situation before and after a project, respectively, will often have a major impact on the result of an evaluation. In fact, the studied projects can be presented as either successes or failures, depending on the choice of reference years. The parameters used in this comparison are punctuality, frequency, travel time, and number of travellers. Four projects have been studied. Four parameters for each project generate a total of 16 indicators. By selecting certain years as reference years, 11 of the 16 indicators can be presented as either an increase or decrease. Stakeholders with a biased agenda towards certain projects can actually pick reference years to present the outcome of projects in a way that that fit their agenda.

Not only is this notion counterintuitive, our empirical analysis yields the contrary conclusion: overall donations would increase. In rationalizing this donation-decline outcome, investigators have pointed to the tax deductibility of donations in assessing estate-tax liability. These efforts, we show, are dubious. The view that donations will decline is also shown to be inconsistent with axioms of generally accepted economic theory. Two distinct sets of indifference curves that imply these two antithetical views are suggested, their observable predictions derived and compared to the relevant evidence, showing that the increasing-donation hypothesis is confirmed, offering overall a clear challenge to the decline-in-donation position. Our empirical results suggest that most estate-tax payers possess indifference curves consistent with those that embody the increasing-donation hypothesis.","[Beranek, William; Kamerschen, David R.; Timberlake, Richard H.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Beranek, W (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",billberanek@gforcecable.com; davidk@terry.uga.edu; rightim@earthlink.net,,,,,,,20,4,6,1,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Competition law and industry-specific regulation provide two competing means of intervention whereby the pursuit of efficiency can be enhanced. Ultimately, legislators decide how governance of industry interaction will be allocated between these two institutional forms. Whereas competition law can govern interaction in most industries, where the underlying economic conditions are sufficiently different, industry-specific regulation offers advantages. However, its weakness is the risk of capture, leading to the subjugation of the efficiency end to the pursuit of other objectives. But if the regulatory institution could be bound in some way to pursue an efficiency objective, could the risk of capture be averted? New Zealand's light-handed regulation, instituted in 1987, attempted to enshrine the pursuit of efficiency into statute, first by relying solely upon competition law and contractual undertakings and subsequently creating a regulatory body with an explicit legislated efficiency directive. In practice, however, the inability of a government prioritizing efficiency to bind its successors to pursue the same objective renders sector strategy, and hence the efficiency objective, subject to political capture. Consequently, inherent systemic instability attends the pursuit of the efficiency objective and the institutions overseeing its enforcement.","[Howell, Bronwyn] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Inst Study Competit & Regulat Inc, Wellington, New Zealand; [Howell, Bronwyn] Victoria Univ Wellington, Victoria Management Sch, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Howell, B (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Inst Study Competit & Regulat Inc, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",bronwyn.howell@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,47,5,5,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This paper points out the methods of working and the strategies used by the European Commission (Directorate General for Competition) and various national competition authorities to promote deregulation of the professions throughout the European Union. Central to this discussion are the so-called public interest and private interest approaches to regulation. On the one hand, the European Commission seems to have been influenced by developments in particular Member States (bottom-up effects), whereas on the other hand, there have been top-down effects in recent years, at least in some Member States. The European experience is used to study the recent developments in China, and in particular the regulation of lawyers. I find that the argument of information asymmetry may have more relevance in China than in Europe. In addition, the fact that liability rules may not yet be a good alternative for (or supplement to) quality regulation may also make a stronger case for regulation in China. However, economic theory and European practice have taught us that there is a general risk of disproportional regulation.","Maastricht Univ, METRO Inst Transnat Legal Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Philipsen, NJ (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, METRO Inst Transnat Legal Res, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",niels.philipsen@facburfdr.unimaas.nl,,"Philipsen, Niels/0000-0002-2101-6840",,,,,55,18,19,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We show that this argument is correct, but that the formula proposed by Daljord, Sorgard, and Thomassen does not capture the essence of what critical loss really is. We propose another formula that does. Daljord, Sorgard, and Thomassen also modify the Katz-Shapiro aggregate diversion ratio rule for deciding whether a candidate market is an antitrust market. We show that their rule happens to be correct for the single-price-increase case and that the Katz-Shapiro rule remains valid for uniform price increases, but that in both cases this is for different reasons than mentioned by the authors. We believe that the confusion is due to the fact that the critical-loss concept, which was originally designed for a single homogeneous product, needs some further explanation before it can be applied in a setting of multiple differentiated products.

Within the context of starting a market for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), we explore two aspects of the purported problem: (1) PHEV performance goals and (2) the abilities of present and near-term battery chemistries to meet the resulting technological requirements. We summarize evidence stating that battery technologies do not meet the requirements that flow from three sets of influential PHEV goals due to inherent trade-offs among power, energy, longevity, cost, and safety. However, we also show that part of this battery problem is that those influential goals are overly ambitious compared to goals derived from consumers' PHEV designs. We elicited PHEV designs from potential early buyers among U.S. new car buyers; most of those who are interested in a PHEV are interested in less technologically advanced PHEVs than assumed by experts. Using respondents' PHEV designs, we derive peak power density and energy density requirements and show that current battery chemistries can meet them. By assuming too aggressive PHEV goals, existing policy initiatives, battery research, and vehicle development programs mischaracterize the batteries needed to start commercializing PHEVs. To answer the question whether batteries are ready for PHEVs, we must first answer the question, whose PHEVs? (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We exploit variation in the timing of consolidation across states to estimate the effects of changing school and district size on student outcomes using data from the Public-Use Micro-Sample of the 1980 US census. Students educated in states with smaller schools obtained higher returns to education and completed more years of schooling.

Although larger districts were associated with modestly higher returns to education and increased educational attainment in most specifications, any gains from the consolidation of districts were far outweighed by the harmful effects of larger schools.

This paper examines the devolution of transport powers to the existing Local Traffic Authorities in England via the 2004 Traffic Management Act. The paper first presents a summary of how several different nations have undertaken this process of devolving transport powers and responsibilities to either new or existing bodies. It then presents research from an electronic survey concerning how English Local Traffic Authorities are choosing to use some of the new powers available to them and their opinion on complementary areas of transport policy. Research is also presented from structured telephone interviews, concerning how individual Local Authorities perceive the efficacy and equity of the new legislation. Overall, the results show that only some of these new powers are likely to be used by English Local Authorities, with limited variation in how different types of LTA are choosing to implement these new powers. The structured telephone interviews provided some evidence that rural Authorities in particular are more dissatisfied with the legislation and consider some of the measures unhelpful. The results provide some insights on the formulation of devolved policy applicable to existing Local Government bodies and the varying benefits that can be perceived to apply to different types of Local Authority. Conclusions are drawn on some of the practical difficulties arising from the English experience, and lessons of relevance are drawn for other nations considering a similar devolution of transport powers.

The paper also shows that a change in the level of judicial deference may result in a shift from the risky strategy to the safe one, or vice versa.

We propose and test a model in which customer competitive advantage and satisfaction are conceived as mediating the relationship between product- and relationship-based value, and attitudinal and behavioural customer loyalty. The empirical analysis uses SEM and is based on 477 customer-supplier relationships in a manufacturing context in a Central and Eastern European environment. The results show that product-based value positively influences customer competitive advantage, while relationship-based value positively influences customer competitive advantage, satisfaction and attitudinal loyalty. On the other hand, behavioural loyalty is affected by customer competitive advantage and satisfaction, whereas attitudinal loyalty is affected by customer satisfaction and relationship-based value. The results indicate that Central and Eastern European industrial customers are becoming very similar to Western firms in that they are demanding much more than just low price and acceptable product quality.","[Cater, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Cater, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Org, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",tomaz.cater@ef.uni-lj.si; barbara.cater@ef.uni-lj.si,"Cater, Babara/V-4803-2019",,,,,,63,0,0,0,18,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

City regions are not just homogenous growth machines but complex urban landscapes. The economic growth and revitalisation of the city region and the rise of the knowledge economy, including the growth of advanced business services, have produced new location dynamics that have changed the spatial division of labour. The rise of the knowledge economy has lead to an increasing focus on labour and labour qualification as an important location factor, including the recent focus on the creative class and human capital. Based on an analysis of Copenhagen, we examine the spatial division of talent within industries to provide evidence that new uneven economic geographies of city regions are currently being produced as a result of the new location dynamics of the knowledge economy. Further, it is argued that the intraregional division of talent differs considerably even within knowledge intensive industries.","[Hansen, Hogni Kalso] Lund Univ, CIRCLE Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Winther, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark",Lund University; University of Copenhagen,"Hansen, HK (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, POB 117, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Hogni.Kalso_Hansen@circle.lu.se; lw@geogr.ku.dk,"Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/ABB-2367-2020; Winther, Lars/N-9847-2014","Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/0000-0001-6174-1417; Winther, Lars/0000-0002-6939-0903",,,,,64,31,34,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The model forecasts the vote share of the governing parties (typically two, such as Social Democrats and Greens, or Christian Democrats and Free Democrats), except for instances of a grand coalition. The coefficients of the predictors are estimated based on elections since 1949, the beginning of the Federal Republic. The out-of-sample forecasts of the model deviate from the actual results by just over one percentage point, on average. The first real-time test of the model came in 2002. The forecast issued three months before Election Day picked the incumbent vote share to the decimal (47.1% for the SPD-Greens coalition); for the 2005 election, called a year early, our forecast three weeks before Election Day was just three-tenths of a percentage off the mark. For the upcoming election, we offer separate forecasts, conditional at this moment, for each of the two parties in the grand coalition. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters.

It is well known that IPOs are underpriced in virtually all countries and that the number of companies going public and the extent of underpricing fluctuate over time. There is a large body of theoretical work explaining IPO underpricing, and most theories have been subjected to rigorous empirical testing.

Some countries have proposed scales for measuring the quality of services at their Universities. Due to characteristics of the higher education market in Chile, a scale should be constructed with a sufficient degree of reliability, validity and dimensionality to measure the quality of services offered by universities in this country. Results show that the scale for quality of services offered by universities from the students' viewpoint, created in this study and called U-CalS, is a multidimensional construct that differs from all previously proposed scales. It examines the concept of service quality from a wider perspective and does not focus only on certain criteria in defining the quality of higher education services. The importance of these results lies in that the scale provides a tool for Chilean universities to measure and manage the quality of services as perceived by their students.","[Torres Moraga, Eduardo] Univ Chile, Acad Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile; [Araya Castillo, Luis] Univ Diego Portales, Acad Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; University Diego Portales,"Moraga, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Acad Fac Econ & Negocios, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.",eduardot@unegocios.cl; luis.araya@udp.cl,,"Araya-Castillo, Luis/0000-0001-7574-3907",,,,,34,2,3,1,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In this paper, a game model is built to analyze the influence of the formalization of corporate governance on earnings management. It is believed that there is obvious correlation between the degree of the formalization of corporate governance and the degree of earnings management in this paper. The greater the corporate governance is formalized, the bigger the difference in degree of managerial opportunism between reputation and reality will be, and the less the regulators and investors will suspect managerial opportunism. Thus, the more difficultly supervisors and investors understand the behavior of earnings management, the higher the degree of manager's earnings management will be. Managers have incentive to formalize corporate governance actively, because, besides the demand of supervisors and investors, the greater the formalization of corporate governance is, the higher utility the earnings management will bring to managers. The conclusion in this paper can provide some policy recommendations for strengthening and improving supervision in the post-Enron era: 1. Besides promulgating relevant laws and regulations, proactive supervision shall be strengthened; 2. Supervision on the so-called Star Enterprises shall be strengthened in times of prosperity; 3. News and public opinion shall play a proper role in corporate governance.","[Zhuang Zhihua] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Management, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University,,zzhhhy@sohu.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54649-0,,,,2010,,,,,,,337,344,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZQ34,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302388300056,0

To evaluate ex ante forecasting performance for particular rates, distinct forecast features, such as mean squared errors, directional accuracy and directional forecast value, are considered.

We provide a theoretical explanation for these trends. Deterrence policies that make robbery more costly for offenders result in a decline in the incidence of robbery through the exit of those with the best outside options. The group of robbers who exit consists disproportionately of those who would have fled in the face of victim resistance, and hence, the pool of remaining robbers is more likely to respond violently to noncompliance by victims. This effect is reinforced by what we call victim hardening: a change in the distribution of attributes in the victim pool that makes resistance more likely. This can arise, for instance, through an increase in crime avoidance by the most compliant victims. Deterrence and victim hardening both result in lower robbery rates and greater violence conditional on resistance but have opposing effects on the rate of resistance, thus accounting for its relative stability over time.

To this end a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model, previously estimated by Dees, di Mauro, Pesaran, and Smith (2007) and Dees, Holly, Pesaran, and Smith (2007) over the period 1979Q1-2003Q4, is used to generate out-of-sample forecasts one and four quarters ahead for real output, inflation, real equity prices, exchange rates and interest rates over the period 2004Q1-2005Q4. Forecasts are obtained for 134 variables from 26 regions, which are made up of 33 countries and cover about 90% of the world output. The forecasts are compared to typical benchmarks: univariate autoregressive and random walk models. Building on the forecast combination literature, the effects of model and estimation uncertainty on forecast outcomes are examined by pooling forecasts obtained from different GVAR models estimated over alternative sample periods. Given the size of the modelling problem, and the heterogeneity of the economies considered - industrialised, emerging, and less developed countries - as well as the very real likelihood of possibly multiple structural breaks, averaging forecasts across both models and windows makes a significant difference. Indeed, the double-averaged GVAR forecasts perform better than the benchmark competitors, especially for output, inflation and real equity prices. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters.

Georgia has permitted researchers to employ state-level heterogeneity in the use of capital punishment to study deterrent effects. However, no scholarly consensus exists as to their magnitude. A key reason that this has occurred is that the use of alternative models across studies produces differing estimates of the deterrent effect. Because differences across models are not well motivated by theory, the deterrence literature is plagued by model uncertainty. We argue that the analysis of deterrent effects should explicitly recognize the presence of model uncertainty in drawing inferences. We describe methods for addressing model uncertainty and apply them to understand the disparate findings between two major studies in the deterrence literature, finding that evidence of deterrent effects appears, while not nonexistent, weak.","[Durlauf, Steven] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Cohen-Cole, Ethan] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA USA; [Fagan, Jeffrey] Columbia Univ, Sch Law, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Nagin, Daniel] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Columbia University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Durlauf, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sdurlauf@ssc.wisc.edu,"DURLAUF, Steven/H-4965-2016",,,,,,46,35,39,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Although entrepreneurship is a process that is marked by deep stereotypical gender divisions, it is also one through which people can change the meaning of gender and the way in which gender is lived. In addition, entrepreneurship links people and place in a number of ways, most notably through networks of social relations in place. I discuss four geographic studies of women's entrepreneurship, each undertaken in a different country-Botswana, India, Peru, and the United States. These studies demonstrate that whereas entrepreneurship per se or access to microcredit alone is seldom sufficient to change the position of women or gender relations in a place, women are using entrepreneurship to change their lives and those of others and, in the process, are changing the places where they live. Key to this transformative process are programs of governmental and nongovernmental organizations and women's grassroots actions that are aimed at building women's skills, confidence, and business networks.","Clark Univ, Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Hanson, S (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",shanson@clarku.edu,,,,,,,96,100,134,0,83,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

This finding indicates that in the higher volatility of the Taiwan stock market incorporating stochastic market volatility into the pricing model helps in predicting the prices of these two futures. Furthermore, the comparison results of different volatility estimators Support the Conclusion that the power EWMA and the GARCH(1,1) estimators can enhance the forecasting performance of the general equilibrium model compared to the other estimators. Additionally, the relaxation of the up-tick rule helps reduce the degree of mispricing.

When the results are compared to welfare cost estimates obtained recently by Gupta and Uwilingiye (2008), using the same data set, but basing it on Johansen's (1991, 1995) cointegration technique, the values are less than half of those obtained in the latter study. These range from 0.16 percent to 0.36 percent of GDP for the target-band of three percent to six percent of inflation. The paper thus highlights the fact that welfare cost estimates of inflation are sensitive to the methodology used to estimate the long-run equilibrium money demand relationships.","[Gupta, Rangan; Uwilingye, Josine] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,5,UNIV PRETORIA,PRETORIA,"TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE ASSOC, FAC ECONOMIC & MANAGEMENT SCIENCES, GW-HSB 15-28 HUMANITIES BLDG, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This often leads to decisions that stimulate wetland conversion and degradation. An important step towards correcting this situation and countering this neglect is to establish the true values of a wetland's ecosystem goods and services. This study attempts to estimate the direct use values of native plants, such as palm leaves for basketry, grass for thatching, fuelwood, edible fruits and plant parts used by three villages adjacent to the Okavango Delta during the 2003 calendar year. Other sources of ecosystem goods and services, such as fishing, floodplain farming and tourism, were not considered in this study. The average annual value per household of these harvested resources is generally higher than that of similar resources found in other southern African wetlands, owing to higher consumption rates. The overall total direct use value of plant resources, including household income contributions in kind, was estimated at US$1 434 per household for 2003 (or US$43.41/ha). This value is almost equal to the average household financial income of US$1 416/year. The net present value of the overall benefit from the direct use of the vegetative resources is estimated at US$101.9 million. This clearly indicates the value of the use of natural resources and their contribution to livelihoods and quality of life. This value is so significant that economic development planners ought to incorporate it into development planning. They should not conceive infrastructure development that would jeopardise the communities' access to these natural resources without any well-developed mitigation strategy.","[Mmopelwa, G.; Blignaut, J.

The revised model is, therefore, more general and corresponds better to various situations. A resulting trait of the generalized model is its account for the interaction between the injurer's care and activity levels, which was implicitly assumed away so far. The revised model is examined using a few standard issues in tort and the analysis brings new results and insights for the unilateral accident case. For example, the view that, under a negligence regime, due care can be defined regardless of the optimal level of activity holds under very restrictive assumptions. In general, due care must be defined simultaneously with the optimal activity level. In addition, the common view suggests that underestimation of the level of actual damages under strict liability would induce injurers to take insufficient care and to engage excessively in a risky activity (and vice versa, for overestimation). This paper shows that underestimation of actual damages may counter-intuitively lead to insufficient activity or excessive care levels. Similarly, the results of underestimating harm under a negligence regime prove to be different than commonly thought. in addition, the revised model questions the intuitive similarity between the underestimation of harm and the judgment-proof problem, and provides some new results for the latter problem.

In this paper, a beer (or soju) manufacturer's ability to push the sales of soju (or beer) products via the common regional liquor distribution network is measured by the beer (or soju) firm market share in the region. If the leverage effect is significant, we expect consumer choices to be significantly affected by the merged firm's ability to push. For a consistent estimation of the leverage effect on consumer demands, this paper adapts a logistic demand function for Yellow Pages in Rysman [Rysman, M. (2004). Competition between networks: A study of the market for yellow pages. Review of Economic Studies, 71, 483-512], controlling other demand-side variables such as prices, consumer loyalty, quality and the introduction of new products. The hypothesis test results indicate that the leverage effects via the common distribution network were not significant at the significance level of 0.1. This conclusion is robust to different specifications of leverage effects and the number of potential drinking. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We apply this theory to the case of public education and pensions, where public education is interpreted as a loan from middle age to young, and pensions are the repayment of this loan, plus interest, from middle age to old. We use micro- and macrodata from Spain to estimate how far actual arrangements are from the normative goal. When demographic stationarity is assumed, efficiency appears reachable. When demographic change is accounted for, efficiency is far from being achieved. Nevertheless, and contrary to earlier predictions in the generational accounting literature, our findings suggest that future generations may not necessarily be worse off than current ones.","[Montes, Ana] Univ Murcia, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Boldrin, Michele] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Boldrin, Michele] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Boldrin, Michele] CEPR, London, England",University of Murcia; Washington University (WUSTL); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Montes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",mboldrin@artsci.wustl.edu; anmontes@um.es,"Montes, Ana/L-2091-2014",,,,,,21,11,11,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

J,"Barry, F",,,,"Barry, Frank",,,"Social Partnership, Competitiveness and Exit from Fiscal Crisis",ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The contribution of social partnership to Ireland's economic boom remains the subject of controversy. This paper analyses at a theoretical level how a multi-period deal on wages and taxation of the type struck in the late 1980s could enhance competitiveness and facilitate an economy in escaping from fiscal crisis. Such a deal would not be possible in a spot labour market. The high unemployment rates of the late 1980s suggest that the Irish labour market of the time cannot be characterised as a spot labour market, however, and such a deal could be struck under these circumstances. Short-term tax reductions would have worsened the short-term budgetary position and hence would have been politically unacceptable. An agreement entailing a commitment by government to future tax reductions in exchange for current wage moderation on the part of organised labour imparts a supply-side stimulus to the economy and improves the immediate fiscal position. The concluding comments provide a gloomy assessment of whether partnership could play an equivalent role in the current recessionary environment.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Barry, F (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,"barry, frank/Y-6289-2019","barry, frank/0000-0002-4226-5299",,,,,25,2,2,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Using rewards in the context of congestion is novel compared to the attention received by road pricing. Psychological research emphasizes the importance of incentives such as rewards in promoting long term behavior changes. In the Netherlands, reward schemes have been tested as part of the 'Spitsmijden' project. This study analyses participation based on a survey of non-participants. Ordered Logit (OL) and mixed ordered logit discrete choice models were specified. The results show that participation is linked to working time flexibility, constraints in the household and the workplace and especially to personal motivations.

When firms downstream in the supply chain seek to achieve such improvements themselves, they frequently request that their suppliers adopt greener practices. This paper investigates the rationale for suppliers to comply with or resist the mandate of their customers to adopt the international environmental management standard ISO 14001 in the North American automotive industry. We argue that the effectiveness of such a mandate will vary according to the characteristics of the relationship between suppliers and customers. We contrast and test hypotheses based on both transaction cost and information theories to suggest that suppliers, whether in a dependent or distant relationship with their customers, have incentives to comply with the requests of their customers but through different mechanisms. Our study analyzed the characteristics of 3,152 automotive suppliers located in the United States, Canada, and Mexico over the 2000-2003 period. Findings indicate that suppliers with highly specialized assets, as well as younger suppliers, suppliers headquartered in Japan, and those reporting to the Toxic Release Inventory, are more likely to respond to their customers' pressures to adopt the certified management standard ISO 14001.","[Delmas, Magali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Montiel, Ivan] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Management, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles,"Delmas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",delmas@ioe.ucla.edu; ivanmontiel@gmail.com,"Delmas, Magali/G-2268-2011","Montiel, Ivan/0000-0002-2933-099X",,,,,87,159,185,2,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The main economic points are the following: A-la-carte pricing may populate economic models, but most products are bundles. They are bundles because bundles are generally more efficient. Tie-in sales are much less common and often not properly understood in textbook discussions. Market foreclosure, the principal efficiency concern with tying and bundling, is likely to be exceedingly rare.

But an analysis of residential mobility that would reveal the mechanisms of change has rarely been included. In this paper such household mobility is studied against the background of the current urban restructuring policy. This policy consists of the selective demolition of inexpensive rented housing and the construction of homeowner dwellings in its stead, leading to changes in the social make-up of neighbourhoods. The change is caused by the displacement of ethnic and other low-income households, the result of their decisions how to use the incentives to move offered by the policy. Thus, this paper deals with the question how urban restructuring affects segregation patterns. Ethnic and socio-economic variables are at the core of the analysis. The outcome is that while the social make-up of neighbourhoods is altered, and low-income households shift in space, the displacement does not contribute to desegregation.","[Bolt, Gideon; Van Kempen, Ronald; Van Weesep, Jan] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban Geog Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Bolt, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban Geog Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",G.Bolt@geo.uu.nl; R.vanKempen@geo.uu.nl; J.vanWeesep@geo.uu.nl,,,,,,,59,42,45,1,52,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0040-747X,,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The aim of the paper at hand is to examine the significance of the integration of financial and real estate markets for urban property markets. It is argued that the integration of both markets has increased the volatility of urban property markets and in particular of the office market of financial cities as London and Frankfurt am Main. International property consultants play a key role in it as knowledge brokers. Through their global office networks they produce and offer information about the outlook of investment possibilities, i.e. urban property markets. In that sense they channel capital which contributes to increased volatility of capital flows into and out of the built environment. Thus, the liberalisation and globalisation of the financial markets as well as modern investment products transformed the urban real estate markets to a great extent.

Forecasts of large changes or extreme values in product or service demand are potential triggers for such reporting. Seasonality estimates in univariate forecast models and leading independent variables in multivariate forecast models are among the approaches to forecasting exceptional demand, a forecast activity that this paper identifies as requiring new accuracy measures based on the tails of sampled forecast error distributions, rather than conventional measures which use the central tendency. For this purpose, the paper introduces the application of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) framework, which has been used for the assessment of exceptional behavior in many fields. In a case study on serious violent crime in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the simplest, non-naive univariate forecast method is best for forecasting ordinary conditions using conventional forecast accuracy measures, but the most complex multivariate model is best for forecasting exceptional conditions using ROC forecast accuracy measures.

It is a quantitative study that was conducted on 592 French students and 379 Venezuelan students during summer 2008. After analysis, factors that have an influence on students' intentions are the same for both countries: Attitude toward Entrepreneurship and Perceived Feasibility to become an Entrepreneur. This means that these students, even though they are from very different countries, want to become an entrepreneur if they have a positive image of what an entrepreneur is and if they are self-confident enough to become an entrepreneur. This investigation not only compares a developing country to a developed one but it gives new information on entrepreneurial intentions of Venezuelan Students and analyze the impact that can both have the internal as external environments.","[Malinge, Myriam] Int Business Sch Rennes, Rennes, France",,,myriam.malinge@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,7,CHINA WATERPOWER PRESS-CWPP,BEIJING,"6 SANLIHELU, FUXINGMENWAI, BEIJING, 100044, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5084-6533-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,414,419,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNO72,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275143800049,0

Firstly, an application of solely economic indicators cannot reflect prosperity of the inhabitants of a country due to failure of these indicators to grasp vital factors defining the happiness of people. Secondly, economic indicators cannot be used alone when defining the success or failure of the resource allocation due to incompleteness of these measures to cover nonmonetary benefits to the inhabitants of a country. Thirdly, application of the happiness indexes (or other social sustainability indexes) along with economic indicators might result in more objective judgment over development of a country and further policy of investment allocation.","[Nikulina, Anna] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),,suqi@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,4,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-072-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,40,44,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQE61,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280792600010,0

Strong support for hypotheses derived from transaction cost theory is provided by analysis of a large sample of interfirm alliances. More hierarchical alliances are chosen when appropriability hazards are severe because technology is difficult to specify or because the scope of activities is wider, so that monitoring is hampered.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Oxley, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,53,0,0,3,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0742-3322,,978-1-84855-486-3,ADV STRATEG MANAGE,Adv.

A few years ago, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency concluded that there is a need for tools that enable assessments of the quality of valuation studies and initiated the development Of a quality assessment instrument (QAI). The result was a QAI that aims at being based on objectively observable study characteristics as far as possible. The QAI is based on the identification of a number of quality factors, each of which is in turn made concrete by at least one check question to be answered by yes, no, *'don't know'* or by a piece of information about the study being assessed. The paper presents the QAI by applying it to two Swedish valuation studies on forest issues. It also discusses some of the difficulties associated with quality assessments. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Existing research narrowly focuses on the quantification of damages, but proving causation goes far beyond quantification. Strict legal requirements must be observed. To address causation adequately, an integrated legal and economic approach is necessary. Traditional tort law examines for each transaction whether an antitrust violation caused damages with near certainty. This quasi-deterministic approach offers a seemingly unequivocal solution for assessing causation. However, complicated cases such as private antitrust damages cannot be decided by this methodological approach. In contrast, economic methods for proving causation use statistical tools. Such an analysis goes beyond individual transactions and provides insights on a coherent group of similar instances. Newer concepts of stochastic causation in tort law can mend the conflict to obtain a consistent assessment of causation. Law and economics pose the same questions about causation, but they differ in their methodological approaches. To provide common ground, we develop a novel analytical framework, drawing upon research in industrial organization. This framework provides a thorough explanation of market structures' underlying antitrust violations. Thereby, statistical analyses of damages and qualitative legal analyses of causation can be put on firm, internally consistent footing.","[Abele, Hanns A.; Schaefer, Guido K.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Kodek, Georg E.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Business Law, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Abele, HA (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.",Hanns.Abele@wu.ac.at; georg.kodek@wu.ac.at; Guido.Schaefer@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Unlike standard ideal point models, which assume that judges vote sincerely for their preferred outcomes, the consensus model accounts for the norm of consensus in the courts of appeals by including a cost of dissent in the judicial utility function. A test of the consensus voting model on a data set of asylum appeals demonstrates that it provides a substantially better fit than a comparable sincere voting model and also generates more accurate predictions of voting probabilities. The model generates credible estimates of the impact of panel composition on case outcomes, which is surprisingly large in the asylum cases. Even though 95 percent of these decisions were unanimous, roughly half of the cases could have been decided differently if assigned to different panels.","Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Fischman, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,"Fischman, Joshua/0000-0001-8912-7662",,,,,47,39,43,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Economics as the science of social provisioning felicitously describes the heterodox view that the economy is part of the evolving social order; social agency is embedded in the social and cultural context; a socio-economic change is driven by technical and cultural changes; and the provisioning process is open-ended. Such a perspective on the economy offers ample methodological and theoretical implications for modeling the capitalist economy in a realistic manner. It lends itself especially to the micro-macro synthetic approach. Thus the objective of this article is twofold: 1) to examine how the concept of the social provisioning process can be clarified and expanded by virtue of recent development in heterodox methodology and 2) to discuss how methodological development would nourish the heterodox modeling and theorizing of the capitalist social provisioning process.,"SUNY Coll Buffalo, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Buffalo State College,"Jo, TH (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Buffalo, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",taeheejo@gmail.com,"Jo, Tae-Hee/A-7828-2018","Jo, Tae-Hee/0000-0002-0242-024X",,,,,61,25,26,18,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Results indicate that the strategies are fairly robust over a wide range of linear and nonlinear processes (including structural break processes), and deliver forecasts of transitory, core and total inflation that require less effort to generate and are as accurate as (that is, are insignificantly different from) those produced with maximum effort.

We propose a theoretical model where production decisions and corrupt behavior are endogenously determined. We model corruption assuming production in the formal sector is regulated by public officials who can use their public power for private gain. In this context, the underground economy emerges as an outside option that allows entrepreneurs to avoid dealing with bureaucrats. The fact that investments in the informal sector may influence public finances, introduces the possibility of multiple equilibria with different levels of corruption. Consistent with previous theoretical works and recent empirical evidence, we find out that corruption and the shadow economy are complements as they positively correlate across equilibria, which implies that corruption may limit the size of the public sector.","[Azpitarte, Francisco] STICERD London Sch Econ, London, England; [Azpitarte, Francisco] Univ Vigo, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Azpitarte, F (通讯作者)，STICERD London Sch Econ, London, England.",azpitarte@uvigo.es,"Azpitarte, Francisco/F-2170-2016","Azpitarte, Francisco/0000-0002-2688-6933",,,,,14,1,1,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Although a number of parametric specification tests have been introduced for the DF evaluation (DFE) in the parameter-free context, econometric DF models are typically parameter-dependent. In this paper, we first use a generalized probability integral transformation-based moment test to unify these existing tests, and then apply the Newey-Tauchen method (the West-McCracken method) to correct this unified test as a generalized full-sample (out-of-sample) test in the parameter-dependent context. Unlike the corrected tests, the uncorrected tests could be substantially undersized (oversized) when they are directly applied to the full-sample (out-of-sample) DFE in the presence of parameter estimation uncertainty. We also use a simulation to show the usefulness of the corrected tests in rectifying the size distortion problem, and apply the corrected tests to an empirical study of stock index returns.

Two masked subsets of the M3 monthly industry data, containing 111 and 11 empirical time series respectively, were chosen, controlling for multiple data conditions of time series length (short/long), data patterns (seasonal/non-seasonal) and forecasting horizons (short/medium/long). The relative forecasting accuracy was assessed using the metrics from the M3, together with later extensions of scaled measures, and non-parametric statistical tests. The NN3 competition attracted 59 submissions from NN, CI and statistics, making it the largest CI competition on time series data. Its main findings include: (a) only one NN outperformed the damped trend using the sMAPE, but more contenders outperformed the AutomatANN of the M3; (b) ensembles of CI approaches performed very well, better than combinations of statistical methods; (c) a novel, complex statistical method outperformed all statistical and Cl benchmarks; and (d) for the most difficult subset of short and seasonal series, a methodology employing echo state neural networks outperformed all others. The NN3 results highlight the ability of NN to handle complex data, including short and seasonal time series, beyond prior expectations, and thus identify multiple avenues for future research.

Since then, the 'Inequality' of poverty has become the third 'I' of poverty, which together with the 'Incidence' and the 'Intensity' of it constitute the dimensions deemed relevant for poverty evaluation. In this paper, we first argue that the interest in the third 'I' of poverty actually originates from a prioritarian (Parfit 1995) rather than an egalitarian attitude. Further, we illustrate the inability of the three 'I's to fully comprise the criteria for the assessment of poverty which are de facto adopted by existing poverty indices. Some of them resolve distributional conflicts by following leximin, hence assigning a pivotal role to the worst off. We question the desirability of leximin, and conclude that giving absolute priority to the worst off is plausible only in cases where the latter has been identified by an exogenous threshold demarcating a significant difference in human suffering. Finally, we explore to what extent prioritarianism and the sufficiency argument of Frankfurt (1987), Crisp (2003) and Casal (2007) can help conceptualize giving absolute priority to individuals or groups indentified by exogenous (poverty and ultra-poverty) thresholds.","[Esposito, Lucio] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lambert, Peter J.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of East Anglia; University of Oregon,"Esposito, L (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,,,,,,,40,4,4,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

This new model, the TVP-STSM, is employed for modelling and forecasting quarterly tourist arrivals to Hong Kong from four key source markets: China, South Korea, the UK and the USA.

As a consequence, neither question is answered, or even directly illuminated. Furthermore, because market shares are not themselves measures of market power but instead merely a factor that bears on its magnitude in a given setting, they are inapt answers to both inquiries.

The evidence shows that the effect exhibits an asymmetrical pattern depending on the stage of development of each country. For the poor less developed countries (LDCs) whose institutional frameworks cannot exceed a threshold level, competition law has a very limited effect on changing economic activity, and its legislation is neither harmful nor helpful in terms of market competition or economic growth. As to the developed countries (DCs) and middle-income LDCs, although their institutional frameworks have passed the threshold level, the effect of competition law on growth still depends on the law enforcement efficiency of the government. Without an efficient enforcement scheme, a stronger competition law not only cannot support productivity growth, but might also slow down the potential path of growth.","Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Ma, TC (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",tcma1234@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,13,16,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This paper explores the government's theory that Standard's rebates to the Pennsylvania RR represented price discrimination. Standard's defense was an assertion that the lubrication contracts were relational contracts involving a service and that the behavior which the government labeled discriminatory represented persistent inefficient behavior on the part of the Pennsylvania system. Data from the trial and other sources are used to attempt to determine if the evidence presented at trial favors price discrimination or Standard's inefficiency defense. This is done using data envelopment analysis to determine the inefficiency the Pennsylvania RR.

We estimate a proportional hazards model with competing risks, distinguishing factors that increase the risk of death by antitrust from those that affect natural death, including defection, dissension, and entry. Our analysis indicates that the probability of cartel death from any cause increased significantly after 1995, when competition authorities expanded enforcement efforts toward international cartels. We find that fluctuations in firm-specific discount rates have a significant effect on cartel duration, whereas market interest rates do not. Cartels with a compensation scheme-a plan for how the cartel will handle variations in demand-are significantly less likely to break up. In contrast, retaliatory punishments in response to perceived cheating significantly increase the likelihood of natural death. Cartels that have to punish are not stable cartels.","[Levenstein, Margaret C.; Suslow, Valerie Y.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Levenstein, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,76,79,89,1,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

More specifically, I aim to consider to what extent the blackboard economics that Coase himself derided have been avoided in a Coasean world, taking that expression to refer in some sense to a world where Coasean insights can flourish, and as such to be a world not simply of Coase's own making but a world that has been developed by others in applying the Coase Theorem. My strategy is to interrogate the nature of a Coasean world through developing a framework that can look more closely at different approaches to theoretical modelling, the different worlds involved in these models, and the different positive and normative applications that can be derived from them. I shall further consider whether the understanding of the law that inhabits a Coasean world reflects a real-world legal environment. Finally, I shall seek to assess the impact of Coase's work on our understanding of the relationship between law and economics, in our world.","Swansea Univ, Sch Law, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Halpin, A (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Sch Law, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",a.k.w.halpin@swansea.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The aim of this paper is to analyse how NTBFs strategize in networks in terms of how the early networking of NTBFs interplays with the ideas for their future network. Strategy or strategizing is understood in relation to the activities, resources and actors embedded into a network. Strategizing is thus related to the interdependence of a business network, which gives both opportunities and limitations. Furthermore, studies of strategising assume that the development is a movement towards a desired end state or goal. However, we observe that the desired end state also undergoes changes when the NTBFs develop, which in turn cause the strategising to change in a new direction. The basis of the study was ten Swedish NTBFs that in addition to exploiting a new technology all had at least one paying customer. When analyzing the case material we made incase analyses where we first wrote descriptions of the individual cases based on all material collected in relation to it. We noticed that the business networks fast started to become rather complex while the goalnetworks tended to be organized in a rather orderly fashion and that the goalnetworks changed when the NTBF realized that the strategy they had used so far did not work anymore. Based on these sketches and the descriptions we were able to choose the three illustrations of development patterns used in the present paper. Three rather different patterns were visible in the cases. NTBF1 wanted to grow but due to their lack of resources they needed to utilize their network in different ways in order to grow further and satisfy their customers. NTBF2 realizes that a large obstacle in forming customer relationships is their lack of legitimacy and therefore starts to borrow legitimacy from their other relationships and find ways to increase sales to their present relationships better instead of only focusing on forming new ones. NTBF3 finds ways to utilize knowledge between different customer relationships. The different customers were therefore kept unaware of each other.","[Aaboen, Lise; Lind, Frida; Dubois, Anna] Chalmers Univ Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,,lise.aaboen@chalmers.se; frida.lind@chalmers.se; anna.dubois@chalmers.se,"Lind, Frida/AAW-3629-2020","Lind, Frida/0000-0002-0225-1589",,,,,18,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1,7,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800001,0

A case study is presented, where the harmonic distortion of the current wave-shape is analysed for an office building, based on individual equipment measurements and 24-hour load operation profile. Two scenarios are discussed: with and without the implement of occupancy sensors in office rooms. It can be seen in both scenarios that the harmonic current distortions closely correlate with the fundamental current (power demand) of the office load.

Two mechanisms that explain persistence in start-up rates are distinguished: (i) determinants of start-ups that are spatially 'sticky' and durable and (ii) path dependence in start-up activities in the form of a response mechanism between previous and current start-up activities. A dynamic panel analysis of the relationship between lagged start-up rates and current start-up rates confirms that both effects are important in explaining persistence. The second mechanism implies a regional dimension in persistence, such that regions with high levels of start-up rates will exhibit stronger persistence. We find empirical evidence of this using quantile regression techniques.","[Andersson, Martin] JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Koster, Sierdjan] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Urban & Reg Studies Inst, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; University of Groningen,"Andersson, M (通讯作者)，JIBS, Jonkoping, Sweden.",martin.andersson@jibs.hj.se; sierdjan.koster@rug.nl,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021","koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X",,,,,59,165,175,3,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Although the key to a successful entrepreneurship education is to find the most effective way to manage the teachable skills and identify the best match between student needs and teaching techniques, there is no universal pedagogical recipe to teach entrepreneurship and the choice of techniques and modalities depends mainly on the objectives, contents and constraints imposed by the institutional context. Entrepreneurship education is a new phenomenon in Iran. These programs vary widely in terms of short term objectives, target audiences, format and pedagogical approach. The first post-graduate entrepreneurship management program has been initiated in the University of Tehran in 2005. Purpose of this paper is to investigate on different teaching methods of entrepreneurship education in this master program. This is a qualitative study and data was gathered through the semi structured interviews with six experts on teaching methods by taking the experts opinion about teaching methods of entrepreneurship education for business students. The results point out passive methods could be used to teach the basic and theoretical contents, but active methods like group discussion, role play or simulation are needed to teach in advanced learning level.

Its focus is the expansion of wildlife-based tourism and related forms of commodified wilderness consumption in KwaZulu-Natal province. The article explores the social and economic processes occurring on game farms in a region known as the Midlands. Here nature is being culturally (re)constructed on former farmlands to create new landscapes shaped by the demands of wildlife-based tourism. In pursuit of these 'third nature' dreams, spaces often need to be physically changed as well as discursively repositioned through marketing. Yet this is not an unchallenged process: the presence of 'farm dwellers' living on privately owned land disrupts smooth progress to a refashioned wilderness landscape. The article identifies various strategies employed by landowners in order to minimise the presence of farm dwellers on their land. In the current context, the involvement of the state on private land adds a further layer of complexity. Land reform policies and programmes serve as a mesh through which these contestations are filtered. While their effects are often ambiguous, land claims in particular serve to challenge the 'third nature' dream of landowners.","[Brooks, Shirley] Univ Orange Free State, Dept Geog, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Spierenburg, Marja] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Spierenburg, Marja; Van Brakel, Lot; Kolk, Annemarie] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Org Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lukhozi, Khethabakhe B.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Environm Sci, Durban, South Africa",University of the Free State; Stellenbosch University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Brooks, S (通讯作者)，Univ Orange Free State, Dept Geog, Bloemfontein Campus, ZA-9301 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",brookssj@ufs.ac.za; m.j.spierenburg@vu.nl; lotvanbrakel@gmail.com; annemariekolk@hotmail.com; bruce29lu@yahoo.com,"Spierenburg, Marja/J-2437-2019; Spierenburg, Marja/F-8812-2013","Spierenburg, Marja/0000-0003-0128-1900; Brooks, Shirley/0000-0002-5926-3812",,,,,48,40,45,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Resource based view suggests that developing, deploying and protecting intangible assets are crucial to gain and sustain competitive advantage. Internal corporate entrepreneurship (intrapreneurship) plays the key role for sustainable rejuvenation of ultimate organizational performance. The literature on intrapreneurship and organizational innovativeness has focused on the managerial competencies and managerial tools to achieve effective intrapreneurship rather than the role of employees who are the essence of organizations. In the literature there are five managerial tools that are needed to support an innovation oriented entrepreneurial climate within the large organizations to orient employees to be more entrepreneurial and thereby innovative; namely (1) management support, (2) time availability, (3) individual freedom and autonomy, (4) reward availability/reinforcement (5) management's and employees' absorption capacity of risk. Innovation is the process of discovery, diffusion, action. In this multi stage process, ideas are captured; filtered, funded, developed, modified, clarified and eventually commercialized. Therefore this study complements the literature by taking into account the innovative work behavior of employee as a mediator factor with a multi-dimensional structure between intrapreneurial climatic factors and innovative performance. Management support, reward system, autonomy, tolerance for failure and allocation of free time have been employed as the compounds of innovative work behavior where idea generation, idea promotion and idea realization have been employed as innovative work behavior. Survey method was used to conduct the data of this study. All scales have been adopted from existing literature. 65 manufacturing firms without any industrial limitations were chosen randomly for the field study. The final sample includes 199 respondents from 45 different firms mostly located in Izmir Ataturk Organized Industrial Zone and ITOB Organized Industrial Zone. The respondents of this study were the employees' of manufacturing firms from all hierarchical levels. After collecting the surveys and processing survey data into SPSS 17.0 statistical software, Exploratory Factor Analysis was used to test the validity of the scales. Reliability tests of each factor structure and their Pearson correlations scores were calculated and presented with descriptive statistics. Finally multiple regression analysis was utilized to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate that intrapreneurial climate dimensions of management support and reward availability together with civic virtue are strong drivers of Innovative Work Behaviors (IWBs), these types of behaviors are also effective instruments for the Innovative Performance of the firms which lead to effective functioning of the organization in terms of manufacturing, new product and financial performance.","[Bulut, Cagri; Samur, Seray Begum; Halac, Duygu Seckin] Yasar Univ, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,,cagri.bulut@yasar.edu.tr; begum_samur@yahoo.com; duygu.seckin@yasar.edu.tr,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014; Bulut, Cagri/E-5860-2017; halac, Duygu seckin/AAB-7654-2019","Bulut, Cagri/0000-0002-3291-673X; halac, Duygu seckin/0000-0002-1956-7563",,,,,40,1,1,4,37,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,173,182,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800023,0

Buongiorno (Forest Science 47(4) 2001) presents a dynamic programming and a linear programming formulation of the MOP model with a fixed interest rate. Both formulations are generalized here to account for a stochastic interest rate. The objective function is the expected present value of returns over an infinite horizon. It gives, like Faustmann's formula, the value of the land and the eventual standing trees. The changes between stand states, prices, and interest rate, are represented by Markov chains. Faustmann's formula is a special case where the change from one state to another has 0 or 1 probability, and the interest rate is constant. The MDP model applies to any stand state, even- or uneven-aged, and the best decisions are tied uniquely to the current system state. An example shows the effects of recognizing variations in interest rate on the land expectation value, and the cost of ignoring them. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden.

Nowadays, most economists agree that there is competitiveness, both at macro- and microeconomic level. Company competitiveness is a relatively cogent concept of competitiveness in microeconomic concept. The macroeconomic concept of competitiveness can not be fully applied to the regional level. The process of globalization leads to search for different organizational forms. These new forms can adequately adapt from tight organizational forms to global market environment such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or clusters. The links between institutional sectors are emphasized by the Triple Helix model. The role of the triad results from the principle of cooperation and coordination of the three basic areas of social progress: education, business and politico-public. The evaluation of the success of the Zlin Region in competitive global investment flows according to the index inflows of foreign direct investment (inward FDI Performance Index - IPEI) shows the depletion of existing localization benefits resulting from lower production costs.

On the other hand, price promotions can bring negative effects that increase consumers' conditional risks over quality, so that the results expected by retailers may not be achieved. This study investigates whether manufacturer advertising can mitigate the negative effects caused by retailer price promotions. A rational expectation model shows that the relation between advertising and price promotions is not unidirectional. A threshold exists that can ensure whether an increase in advertising expenditures reduces negative effects from price promotions. When advertising coverage exceeds this threshold, an increase in advertising expenditures mitigates negative effects and makes price promotions an effective way to build store traffic. Below the threshold, an increase in advertising expenditures might aggravate the negative effects from price promotions and decrease price sensitivity. Accordingly, marketing practitioners can design product pricing decisions depending on whether advertising information crosses this threshold.","I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Chen, GR (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, 1,Sec 1,Syuecheng Rd, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan.",dionysiac@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

This paper explores how this politically potent perception of productiveness has come to achieve the hegemony that it now enjoys. A principal forum for the 'making' of finance sector productiveness, it shows, has been the tradition of national accounting and its reporting of key economic metrics such as gross domestic product. By placing different activities on different sides of a pivotal 'production boundary', national income statisticians effectively dictate what counts as productive - as adding value to the economy - and what does not. Finance's contemporary representation as productive is predicated, the paper shows, on a long and contested history of boundary negotiation.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Christophers, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",brett.christophers@kultgeog.uu.se,,,,,,,57,55,62,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Results show that the company's organisational legitimacy is affected by a number of political, economic, social, environmental and legislative factors which are often interrelated and complex. It is concluded that on the one hand, most of the issues are controllable and that companies are able, to a great extent, influence their organisational legitimacy. On the other hand, managing organisational legitimacy is a complex process as companies do not always have control over issues affecting their legitimacy. The data also shows that most issues affecting organisational legitimacy are moral and to a lesser extent pragmatic and cognitive. In order to garner organisational legitimacy, managers are advised to address issues individually and not to invest only in an overall communication strategy as stakeholders expect appropriate and effective action, for example in cases where the rights of stakeholders are violated and where issues of corruption are evident.","[Claasen, Cyrlene] ESC Rennes Business Sch, Rennes, France",ESC Rennes School of Business; Universite de Rennes,,cyrlene.claasen@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,92,104,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200010,0

Unlike the train traffic problem, vehicles are not strictly bound to deadlines, hence the management and control problem is more flexible. Much more resources are available, and the problem comprises a lot more agents. This paper presents a novel method for vehicle traffic management and control. Each vehicle has a scheduling agent that communicates with the intersections' agents in order to find the shortest route available, while also not loading any resource more than a specified degree. Such a schedule can be discarded and recalculated, should the behaviour of the vehicle differ from the schedule to a certain amount. Agents that do not use scheduling are also introduced in the system, as a perturbation. The green phases of traffic lights are adjusted according to the number of waiting vehicles. The tests show that route scheduling is more effective than using minimum distance path.","[Cuibus, Octavian; Santa, Maria-Magdalena; Letia, Tiberiu] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,Octavian.CUIBUS@aut.utcluj.ro; Maria.SANTA@aut.utcluj.ro; Tiberiu.LETIA@aut.utcluj.ro,"Cuibus, Octavian/GSE-6480-2022; Santa, Maria Magdalena/GVS-7002-2022",,,,,,16,1,1,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIV CLUJ-NAPOCA,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"28 MEMORANDUMULUI STREET, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400114, ROMANIA",,,978-973-662-614-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,405,410,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDA57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312344600088,0

The main objective of this paper is to identify the key criteria that influence the selection of the most appropriate methodology for a project and to determine the extent to which the methodologies fulfill these criteria. A review of the extant literature reveals that most of the works in the field of information systems development contain only a description of the development methodologies, without comparing the different solutions. Few authors compare development methodologies but, either using a limited number of general criteria, or evaluating only the categories of methodologies, not specific development methodologies. The research is based on a detailed study of the main development methodologies and on an analysis of a series of surveys, published by different researchers, exploring the state of practices in the field of methodologies for information systems development. There were identified the advantages and disadvantages of the main development methodologies and was elaborated a list of criteria that is used to build a decision matrix useful in the process of selecting the right methodology. One of research results consists in a synthesis of the advantages and disadvantages of the main development methodologies. Another important result consists in the elaboration of a decision matrix that will help the users to evaluate, rate and compare different development methodologies. The use of an inappropriate methodology may increase the costs of the development process, lead to exceeding the deadline for completion of the system and to the inability to achieve some of the project's objectives. For these reasons, the results obtained in this paper are valuable for the practitioners in the field of information systems development (especially for project managers) by helping them in the process of selecting the most adequate development methodology. The decision matrix elaborated as a result of this research is a very useful tool to the project managers because it helps them compare different development methodologies and select the best solution for their project. The criteria used in the decision matrix have been identified as a result of an extensive literature review on theoretical aspects regarding development methodologies and on the results of their use in practice.","[Geambasu, C.

Benchmarking has been for a longer time one of the phenomena, what contemporary modern management is consistently engaged to. Competitive comparing is nothing new, but benchmarking has brought scientific principles to this area, developed a reliable methodology and enabled a wide comparability. Benchmarking is a continuous process of measuring systems, processes and products within the company and comparing them with competitors or other companies that are successful in same field. It is very important for all companies to constantly monitor their competitors, because it is one of the basic conditions of increasing their efficiency and market share. The aim of such comparing is to adopt the new practices and procedures and in particular to obtain information which leads to improve business performance. The article describes both the theory of benchmarking as well as its practical approach. Accomplishment of examined method and its practical application is the formulation of the phased steps that are part of the four basic phases in business practices of benchmarking. Subsequently the paper identifies risks that may threaten the successful implementation of benchmarking. There are set out measures to be followed to maintain the reliability of benchmarking for the most significant risks in the paper. These measures have the character of recommendations for management employees. Identification of the risks and proposition solution which leads to their elimination is the most important contribution of this article.","Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekonomicko Spravni, Ustav Ekonomiky & Managementu, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Jetmarová, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekonomicko Spravni, Ustav Ekonomiky & Managementu, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",barbora.jetmarova@upce.cz,,,,,,,9,5,7,0,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The organizations that did not implement COQ reporting as part of their quality management system cited lack of understanding of COQ principles and lack of management support as the main reasons for not implementing COQ reporting.","[Kanapathy, Kanagi] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,,kanagik@um.edu.my; Ashbiz28@yahoo.com,"KANAPATHY, KANAGI/B-8748-2010","KANAPATHY, KANAGI/0000-0003-3710-2249",,,,,22,0,1,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,86,90,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400019,0

It is important to create models to support different kinds of actors, information, competence and perceptions coming together in decentralized innovation platforms. Our target companies mainly operate in the rural area or near small cities. Their innovation networks consist, apart from company networks, mainly of developmental organizations, education and research institutions and other support organizations. Company know-how is based on experience rather than formal competence. Contact networks are directed towards customers and contractors. We aim to find the elements and networks for a regional innovation system which enhances SMEs' ability to innovate and compete in the long range. Our framework includes elements from futures research and Learning by Developing (LbD) model. The empirical part of the research is based on company interviews and case studies. The target companies are Finnish SMEs operating in the metals industry and mechanical engineering in different local innovation surroundings. The regional and local perspective is an important element in innovation networks even though most companies are dealing with global challenges. We also include benchmark company interviews to widen the critical elements of a regional innovation system. The research clarifies the structures of a regional innovation system and the roles of SMEs, universities and other organisations within it. In synthesis, we introduce the future driven core competence framework for a successful SME, critical elements for their successful open innovation environment and implications for further development of LbD model and new services for SMEs, like visionary concept design.","[Manninen, Anneli; Laitinen, Jukka; Meristo, Tarja] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Turku, Finland",Laurea University of Applied Sciences,,anneli.manninen@keuda.fi; jukka.laitinen@laurea.fi; tarja.meristo@laurea.fi,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,1073,1076,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800128,0

Innovation is also essential for the competitiveness of firms. Its importance is intensified by factors like the increased global competition, the decreased product lifecycles and the rapidly changing consumer demands. Large firms play a key role in innovation but this doesn't mean that there is no place for SMEs. The last years the environment for innovation has changed. The importance of SMEs to the innovation process has increased. The increasing incomes, the more niched market demand and the changing technologies have reduced the structural disadvantages of SMEs firm size. However, SMEs success is often dependent on the degree to which they embrace innovation. SMEs that successfully pursue innovation increase both their productivity and their likelihood of survival. In this paper we examine the role of the Greek SMEs in innovation generation. We will use patent records to measure innovation and specifically all patents that have been protected in Greece during the period 1989-2005. Generally, the description and measurement of innovation is a difficult and rather complex task. Empirical research in this field uses R&D based indicators and patent data in most cases. Each of these indicators exhibits its own characteristics in terms of measurement, strengths and weaknesses. Patents are the main and formal product-result of R&D activities inside firms, but also outside firms. Especially on firm level, however, firms develop patents in order to make profits, and these patents are also indicative of the forthcoming new products and procedures that will be introduced in the market. This is the first research that studies innovation through patents among the Greek SMEs. Our analysis shows that small firms are the main owners of the granted patents in Greece. So, firms that employ up to 50 employees account for the 57.83% of our sample, while the share of large firms (more than 500 employees) is 6.02%. Most of these firms are engaged in the economic activities of machine tools, metal and plastic products, chemical substances and wholesale. The Greek SMEs have a medium age and are characterized by different levels of exports, selling their products mainly to the countries of European Union, the Balkans and the Middle East. SMEs are very important in the OECD area, representing a major share of the total number of firms and accounting for more than the 60% of the total employment and the 50% of the total value added. The above shares are higher for Greece. Our findings confirm the importance of SMEs in Greece, as these firms are also the main producers of innovation. In addition our findings could be used in the development of public policy aimed at supporting and encouraging the innovation among SMEs in Greece.","[Markatou, Maria] Univ Athens, Technol Educ Inst Larissa, GR-10679 Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,markatou@prd.uth.gr,,,,,,,13,3,3,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,621,628,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800075,0

Such instruments are currently put forward, in the UK and elsewhere, as a way of locating environmental engagement in everyday practices, such as cooking and heating. The paper considers whether and how these technologies can be said to 'materialize' public participation. It argues that the materialization of engagement entails a particular codification of it: as participation is located in everyday material practice, it comes to be defined in terms of its doability and the investment of effort. Material participation, then, does not refer just to its mediation by things: it involves the deployment of specific legitimatory tropes associated with liberal theories of citizenship and the domestication of technology, in particular the notion that the engagement of everyday subjects requires things to be 'made easy' (Pateman, 1989; Schwartz Cowan, 1983). To make sense of this confluence of political and technological ideals, the paper takes up the notion of 'co-articulation' (Callon, 2009). A distinctive feature of the everyday devices of accounting under consideration here, I argue, is their ability to 'co-articulate' participation with other registers: those of innovation and economy. In this respect, the spaces of participation organized with the aid of these technologies can be qualified as spaces of 'multi-valent' action. Different carbon-accounting devices do this, however, in different ways, and this has consequences for how we understand the wider normative implications of the 'materialization' of environmental participation. In some cases, materialization entails the minimization of social, material and political changes, while in others it enables the exploration and amplification of precisely these modes of change.","Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London,"Marres, N (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",n.marres@gold.ac.uk,,"Marres, Noortje/0000-0002-8237-6946",,,,,72,15,19,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It focuses only on biological implications which have sounds in textiles and bring data on use efficiency. It represents the medical and textile base for an anti-allergy cloth. Substances used in conventional textile finishing chemicals are often accused of affecting human health and the environment. By using natural products on the textile support trying to improve consumer health and protect the environment. An appropriate answer of a body in an interference with some active principles can diminishes the anarchical evolution of mediators. One performs a system by means of a cyclodextrin compound which links a drug and then releases from surface of textile fabric to epidermis. Details linked on these aspects are presented in an another paper. In vivo tests determine anti-oxidative action in connection with natural active principles used in pathogeny of allergy episodes. One determines tests on toxicity of natural products to evaluate the effects of a dose used on a knitted fabric. The toxicity values are obtained by performing in vivo tests accomplished on white mice and Guinea pigs. One determines tests on toxicity of natural products to evaluate any possible harmful effect in the therapeutically use on a knitted fabric. One determined the effects of natural compounds on blood cells and anti-allergy efficiency.

For this, we have pooled data for the developing countries during time period 1995-2004. The obtained results indicate that economic liberalization has a positive and significant effect on the foreign direct investment, while inflation has a negative and significant effect and both of them seem to be robust. Based the results obtained, if developing countries attempt to attract foreign direct investment, it should be more efficient to focus on economic liberalization and develop their infrastructure rather than just reducing wage. Also, regarding negative and significant effect of inflation on foreign direct investment, these countries should provide a stable environment to facilitate inflow of foreign direct investment.","[Rasekhi, Saeed; Seyedi, Zeinab] Univ Mazandaran, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Babol Sar, Iran",University of Mazandaran,,srasekhi@umz.ac.ir,"Rasekhi, Saeed/AAS-3088-2021","Rasekhi, Saeed/0000-0002-6280-7243",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8640-0,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,1.0,,,,,,39,44,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303173400009,0

PPP were first developed in industrialised States to improve the quality and economic efficiency of public services in industrialised countries using market based solutions. They have become more important as governments have attempted to keep public spending under control and a general reluctance of electorates to pay higher taxes for public services. In LDCs, the issue is different: governments frequently do not have the funds to develop and maintain public services. The United Nations has endorsed the use of PPP (as a means of realising the Millennium Development Goals) that benefits the public and delivers economic development and an improvement in the quality of life. Gradually a revolution has taken place with use of private capital harnessed to deliver public services and infrastructure projects. As Schwartz points out, there appears an inherent conflict between the commercial interest underpinning PPP for social services, especially health care, and the goals of a public policy. Both goals seem irreconcilable. Yet these solutions have been transplanted to LDCs to ensure that basic social services are provided. Schwartz takes as a case study, the use of PPP in delivering health care services in Sierra Leone offering an analytical model to identify the concept of PPP in a developmental context of government health services in LDCs. Schwartz is able to offer a model which allows for the possibility of using PPPs for facilitating increased aid flows for funding a technical solution to problems encountered in health care systems in LDCs. She concludes by stating that whatever model is adopted LDC should retain the autonomy to choose the right regulatory mechanisms and provide the institutional capacity to meet the health challenges they face.","[Schwartz, Priscilla] Univ Leicester, Sch Law, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,,ps162@le.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,13,TMC ASSER PRESS,J N DEN HAAG,"R J SCHIMMELPENNINCKLAAN 20-22, J N DEN HAAG, 2517, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-6704-733-3,LEG ISS SERV GEN INT,,,2011,,,,,,,197,230,,10.1007/978-90-6704-734-0_9,0.0,,,34,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BVN53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291967200009,0

In the phase of the portfolio development the article highlights a key link to corporate strategy, specification of resource constraints, multi-criteria approach to the evaluation of projects with respect to the balance of the portfolio. Emphasis is put on the evaluation of all projects in the most common scenario and future development scenarios, respectively, all which improves the comparability of evaluation of projects. The goal of the third part of the article is to specify the problem of the project portfolio optimization under risk (optimal allocation of scarce resources).

However, privacy issues have been emerging as a real challenge to industry as well as researchers world-wide. We cannot deny the advantages of LBS, but one's privacy can be violated while he enjoys such services. Dealing with this properly aims at protecting users' personal information while the quality of services (QoS) needs to be assured.

This paper presents an empirical study on legitimacy building through intelligence generation activities. The empirical material consists of 40 interviews gathered in R&D departments of three companies. In our study we found that customer orientation activities and more specifically, intelligence generation is a powerful means to acquire legitimacy for ideas in FEI. Through these activities the acceptance of ideas may be advanced either intentionally or unintentionally. We identified six different ways through which intelligence generation legitimates ideas in FEI: (1) commitment of developers and internal customers to the product, (2) avoidance of resistance towards the product, (3) facilitation of future efforts, (4) concretization of technological potential to decision makers, (5) demonstration of developers' technological capabilities to decision makers, and (6) sustaining decision makers' interest towards the idea. Previous research presents ways to gather understanding about customer needs and preferences in order to develop products that cater to those needs as well as acquire an understanding of possible market potential. This study shows that these activities have a larger impact on organizations by providing means for achieving acceptance for the ideas. In this paper we show a previously unrecognized outcome for intelligence generation activities and demonstrate concrete examples of the exploitation of these activities in organizations. The objective of legitimation of ideas through customer orientation activities has not been discussed in previous literature, thus this study widens the understanding of the objective and impact of customer orientation in FEI. This research brings into attention that intelligence generation is a powerful mechanism through which ideas are legitimated to internal customers, developers and decision makers, and trust towards developers is created.","[Vanharanta, Outi; Nasanen, Jaana] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University,,outi.vanharanta@aalto.fi; jaana.nasanen@aalto.fi,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,837,843,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800101,0

Regarding engineering tasks, this change shows up most evidently in the increased importance and speed of product development, resulting in an equally high development rate of manufacturing techniques and its related processes.

(2) Do different cognitive abilities (e.g., math ability, language, or verbal ability) and social ability affect earnings of entrepreneurs and employees differently?, and (3) Does the balance in these measured ability levels affect an individual's earnings? Our (difference-of-difference) estimates of the returns to ability for spells in entrepreneurship versus wage employment account for selectivity into entrepreneurial positions insofar as they are determined by fixed individual characteristics. Our robust results provide the following answers to the three questions: General ability has a stronger impact on entrepreneurial incomes than on wages. Moreover, entrepreneurs and employees benefit from different sets of specific abilities: verbal and clerical abilities have a stronger impact on wages, whereas mathematical, social, and technical ability are more valuable for entrepreneurs. The balance in the various kinds of ability also generates a higher income, but only for entrepreneurs: This finding supports Lazear's Jack-of-all-Trades theory.","[Hartog, Joop; van Praag, Mirjam; van der Sluis, Justin] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam Ctr Entrepreneurship, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hartog, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam Ctr Entrepreneurship, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",J.hartog@uva.nl; c.m.vanpraag@uva.nl; Justinvdsluis@hotmail.com,,"hartog, joop/0000-0003-0818-6914",,,,,62,128,145,2,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

While the two extreme cases of hierarchical and non-hierarchical organizations are typically contrasted, what shapes the degree of hierarchy and how to measure it remain fairly vague. In this article, we compare bank size and functional distance between bank branches and headquarters as possible sources of organizational friction studying their impact on the likelihood of small firms introducing innovations. Our results show that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) located in provinces where the local banking system is functionally distant are less inclined to introduce process and product innovations, while the market share of large banks is only slightly correlated with firms' propensity to introduce new products.","[Alessandrini, Pietro; Presbiteroy, Andrea F.; Zazzaroz, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ, MoFiR, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Alessandrini, P (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ, MoFiR, Ancona, Italy.",p.alessandrini@univpm.it; a.presbitero@univpm.it; a.zazzaro@univpm.it,,"Presbitero, Andrea/0000-0003-4622-941X",,,,,110,82,88,2,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

All the well-known NEG results are based on these simple geography structures. When doing empirical work, these simplifying assumptions become problematic: it may very well be that the main NEG results do not carry over to the heterogeneous geographical setting faced by the empirical researcher, making it inherently difficult to relate empirical results back to NEG theory. This article tries to bridge this gap by proposing an empirical strategy that combines estimation and simulation. First, we show by extensive simulation that many, but not all, conclusions from the simple unidimensional NEG models carry over when using more realistic geography structures. Second, we illustrate our proposed empirical strategy using a sample of European regions, combining estimation of structural NEG parameters with simulation of the underlying NEG model.","[Bosker, Maarten; Brakman, Steven; Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Schrammz, Marc] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Utrecht University,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Int Econ & Business, Landleven 5, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands.",e.m.bosker@rug.nl,,,,,,,47,38,42,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

J,"Freeman, A",,,,"Freeman, Alan",,,The Economists of Tomorrow: The Case for Assertive Pluralism in Economics Education,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"P>This article presents the case for assertive pluralism in economics education and proposes how to achieve it, illustrating the point with reference to the U.K. Subject Benchmark Statement in Economics (SBSE). It proposes a revision of the benchmark, prioritizing the role of controversy in the teaching of economics, combined with pluralistic principles that uphold and guarantee critical and independent thinking. This reform is a necessary response to what Colander et al. (2009) term the systemic failure of economics-the inability of the profession, taken as a whole, to anticipate and understand the financial crash and recession of 2008. Failure on this scale testifies to a more deep-seated weakness in economics than commonly recognized. It arises from what Turner (Tett 2009) terms the regulatory capture of the economics profession by narrow financial interests. The public, and the economics profession, require specific protection against the pressures that have produced this systemic failure. This requires a rethink of the relation of economics to society, founded on a rejection of the idea that the function of economics is to provide a single, unequivocal solution to every problem of policy. Instead, the article explains, good economics should be constrained to evaluate the full range of relevant solutions to any given policy issue, leaving the decisionmakers accountable for the decisions they make on which solution to adopt.",,,,,"Freeman, Alan/Q-6893-2019",,,,,,41,17,18,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

So far, FTS was mainly used for preliminary assessment of the capacity- and safety-related effects of novel ATM concepts, with hardly any application concerning the economic implications of those concepts. As a novelty, we put forward a method to assess costs to airlines' of a new ATM scenario, based on FTS outputs. We first discuss the relevant ATM-related airlines' economic interests, and consequently identify the associated indicators. To provide consistency with the Single European Sky II requirements and specifications, we show that our approach is clearly aligned with the performance-based framework proposed by the Single European Sky ATM Research Programme (SESAR). Then we demonstrate the capabilities of the FTS to address economic aspects of an ATM scenario. We illustrate the methodology through a case study of different sectorisations of the Greek airspace. The results indicate that FTS allows for a detection of statistically significant airline cost differentials between alternative ATM scenarios.","[Jovanovic, Radosav; Babic, Obrad; Tosic, Vojin] Univ Belgrade, Dept Air Transport, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Castelli, Lorenzo] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Elettrotecn Elettron & Informat, Trieste, Italy",University of Belgrade; University of Trieste,"Jovanovic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Dept Air Transport, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Belgrade, Serbia.",r.jovanovic@sf.bg.ac.rs,"Castelli, Lorenzo/AAE-3780-2020","Castelli, Lorenzo/0000-0002-5621-0934; Jovanovic, Radosav/0000-0002-9111-8914",,,,,38,1,1,0,9,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Specifically, MNEs tend not to agglomerate with domestic companies, as they perceive potential knowledge inflows to be lower than potential leakages, unless domestic companies enjoy some comparative advantages. Conversely, MNEs are willing to agglomerate with other MNEs, as they bet on a positive balance between knowledge inflows and outflows.","[Mariotti, Sergio; Piscitello, Lucia; Elia, Stefano] DIG Politecn Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Piscitello, L (通讯作者)，DIG Politecn Milan, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",lucia.piscitello@polimi.it,"Elia, Stefano/AAL-3182-2020","piscitello, lucia/0000-0002-4817-315X",,,,,53,104,112,4,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The primary difference between TSX and TSX-V IPO companies is that TSX-V companies are significantly more underpriced than TSX companies, even after controlling for other company-specific factors, which suggests higher listing standards provide a signalling benefit to companies over-and-above what companies themselves are able to signal. Similarly, TSX companies experience a shorter time from IPO announcement date to an accurately predicted actual IPO date, suggesting TSX companies are better prepared to overcome the hurdles of exchange regulators scrutinizing their preliminary prospectuses. Taken together, the evidence is consistent with the view that higher exchange listing standards screen out companies that are less prepared to go public. But the data show exchange listing standards are not directly related to 1-year share price performance and/or trading volume as those performance indicators are more closely connected to observable company-specific factors.

The aim of this paper is to provide an answer to the last part of this question, focusing more heavily on cases of negligently inflicted harm. Departing from Simon's bounded rationality and influenced by other constructs in behavioral law and economics, we view judges as satisficers who make decisions within real-world constraints, such as imperfect information and uncertainty, cognitive limitations and erroneous information. Judges are limited by the commonly observed barriers to the decision making process. Because their goal is not to optimize but to render opinions that are merely satisfactory, they often act as poor agents of their principals' interests. In this light, it becomes clearer why judges tend to engage in behavior that is improper, especially under the circumstances of the currently overloaded judicial caseloads. We first address the differences in judges' roles in Anglo-American and Continental legal systems. We then present our simple model for judicial misbehavior based on an understanding of judges as satisficers. Next we discuss the particularities of judicial errors and introduce a realistic and viable construct of inexcusable judicial error. On this basis we evaluate the impact of various incentive schemes on judicial behavior, focusing on the civil liability of judges. We conclude that civil liability for grave judicial errors is the most adequate remedy.","[Zervogianni, Eleni] Univ Piraeus, Fac Business Adm, Piraeus, Greece; [Tsaoussi, Aspasia] ALBA Grad Business Sch, Athens, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Zervogianni, E (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Fac Business Adm, Piraeus, Greece.",atsaoussi@vivodinet.gr; elzervog@otenet.gr,"Zervogianni, Eleni/JAO-2829-2023",,,,,,72,3,6,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

However, there have been few analyses of these practices in the study of the postsocialist world, even though in many ways, postsocialist societies have been at the forefront of the extension of financial products and services and the ensuing remaking of economic practices. This article responds to this lacuna by exploring the experiences of everyday household financial practices in two postsocialist cities-Krakow and Bratislava-in an attempt to understand how households, particularly poor households, negotiate the remaking of financial practices as the wider landscapes of banking and access to financial services are remade. In the context of a wider project that also explores consumption, housing, care work, and other forms of labor, the article connects to ongoing work in economic geography to explore how postsocialist households manage their precarious budgets, engaging in a multiplicity of practices of lending and borrowing and credit and debt that combine the old and the new, the formal and the informal, the global and the local. These articulations reflect the ways in which households domesticate finance, such that their financial practices are a result of a combination of their agency, assets, knowledge, and geographies; their socioeconomic status; and the developing structures of financial institutions and support a conclusion that calls into question singular accounts of neoliberalization in East Central Europe.","[Stenning, Alison] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Smith, Adrian] Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Geog, London E1 4NS, England; [Rochovska, Alena] Comenius Univ, Dept Human Geog & Demogeog, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Swiatek, Dariusz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland",Newcastle University - UK; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Comenius University Bratislava; Polish Academy of Sciences,"Stenning, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",alison.stenning@newcastle.ac.uk; a.m.smith@qmul.ac.uk; rochovska@fns.uniba.sk; swiatekd@twarda.pan.pl,,,,,,,63,28,37,1,24,ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,WORCESTER,"CLARK UNIV, WORCESTER, MA 01610 USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We use a monopolistic competition framework, where firms sell differentiated products as well as offering differentiated jobs to households, who are all located at some distance from the firms. The symmetric equilibriums with and without the option of trip chaining are compared. We show analytically that introducing the trip chaining option reduces the profit margin of the firms in the short run, but increases welfare. The welfare gains are, however, smaller than the transport cost savings. In the free-entry long-run equilibrium, the number of firms decreases but welfare is higher.

The management of short-term earnings is vulnerable to misinterpretation, manipulation or deliberate deception even if these misleading accounting practices are prohibited by accounting regulations. Hence, the problem with managing short-term earnings is that it becomes an ethical practice, regardless of who is or may be affected by the practice or the information that flows from it. As a result of the publicity received by Enron and WorldCom on financial failures and fraud, and the subsequent legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, students are expected to understand the morality issues of earnings-management practices. Therefore, the ethics of earnings-management practices affect the accounting educator. Accounting students and business managers were surveyed and the findings indicated that there is no significant difference between gender regarding the ethicality of twenty earning management practices. The results, however, show that there is a significant difference between the perceptions of business managers and students regarding the morality of earnings-management practices.

The allocation of ownership rights will minimize enforcement costs when the legal system is inefficient. In particular, when legal enforcement of contracts is costly, there will be a shift from arrangements that rely on such enforcement (such as a rental agreement) toward other forms that do not (such as direct ownership). We then test this prediction and show that costly enforcement of rental contracts hampers the development of the rental housing market in a cross section of countries. We argue that this association is not the result of reverse causation from a developed rental market to more investor protective enforcement and is not driven by alternative institutional channels. The results provide supportive evidence for the importance of legal contract enforcement for market development and the optimal allocation of property rights.","[Casas-Arce, Pablo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Saiz, Albert] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; University of Pennsylvania,"Casas-Arce, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Saiz, Albert/AAZ-2321-2021","Saiz, Albert/0000-0003-4407-4661; Casas-Arce, Pablo/0000-0002-9832-1579",,,,,41,8,8,0,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The text follows on papers (i.e: [1], [19], [21]) presented in the frame of Research for regional disparities solution project and provides a new research direction; mainly deals with analysis of research data basis facilitating more detailed investigations in municipality management disparities. Research is concentrated on gathering data from municipalities' web presentations in individual regions, sub regions and smaller areas and its comparisons as well as individual municipalities itself. Focus is given to municipalities located in NUTS II - North East which comprises three regions -Liberec, Hradec Kralove and Pardubice. The paper goal is especially: (1) outline data basis for subsequent content analysis realization; (2) clarify reliability of collected data; and (3) obtain basic quantitative data on information provided by municipality to citizens in municipality www (primarily accessibility and up-to-dateness of records of municipality local authority/council meetings, municipality magazines, and information about non-governmental associations. Characteristics of gathered data are considered as substantial findings of presented paper. Testing of null hypothesis on ? = 0.05 significance level of own research coders results and Czech Statistics Office results correspondence could not be rejected. Hypothesis was accepted in important majority of districts, in all assessed regions as well as in whole region NUTS II. Due to mentioned reasons the gathered date can be considered as reliable and the data can be used for next research, for designed content analysis primarily.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky Managementu, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Bachmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky Managementu, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",pavel.bachmann@uhk.cz,"Bachmann, Pavel/H-6835-2012","Bachmann, Pavel/0000-0002-2823-8497",,,,,23,4,4,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

H. von Thunen, A. Weber). These theories build fundaments for other classic or modern theories of location decision-making process. Modification of location theory was realized after deconstruction of assumptions of perfect competition (e.g. Hotel ling's model, A. Losch). The key point of the location service sector theory is the central places theory (W. Christaller). The influence of French background is important in pole development theory given base for interpretation of spatial dimension of modern spatial cluster this theory. The behavioural theory's authors deconstructed the assumptions of rational behavior of consumers and firms. The realized empirical research in 284 small and medium firms (SME) is a base for classification of location decision making factors. The empirical research was aimed to verification of SME factors realized on local or regional supplier and customer's market in the Czech Republic. The universality of location factors is tested. Geographical (transport) nearness of the customer's market (factors important for SME location decision making process irrespective of sector and size character) forms the first category. The reverse category (factors insignificant over the sector and size character) is formed by the possibility to gain an unique market position, possibility to cooperate with competitiveness and improve information position about its activities. The third category (factors important partly) is formed by geographical nearness (distance) of competitiveness (important in tertiary sector and for micro-firm location decision making process), geographical nearness of suppliers (important for medium firms), accessibility of complementary services, regional economic growth (important over size characteristic and in secondary and tertiary sector) and copying of competitiveness (important in primary sector and category of medium firms). None of tested location decision-making factors can be determined as a universal one (important for majority of firms irrespective of sector and size characterization).","[Damborsky, Milan; Wokoun, Rene] Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu & Ekonomiky, Ustav Regionalniho Rozvoje Verejne Spravy & Prava, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Damborsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu & Ekonomiky, Ustav Regionalniho Rozvoje Verejne Spravy & Prava, Zlin, Czech Republic.",damborsky@fame.utb.cz; wokoun@fame.utb.cz,,,,,,,29,22,22,0,40,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This research was conducted on a sample of 30 large companies randomly selected across various industries and the primary technique of data collection was through a descriptive questionnaire distributed through e-mail or personal visits to companies. Out of the sample, 70 % of the companies have a moderate knowledge and usage of e-HR and a 30 % have a very high knowledge.The role played by HR professionals also changed from Administrative Expert to Strategic Agent. There were several reasons for driving organizations towards the adoption of e-HRM in Sri Lanka and the most common of which was the desire to be the leading edge. The critical success factors behind the successful implementation were employee attitudes, organizational culture,characteristics and the way of collaborating those with HR and IT. This adoption should not be done in an ad hoc way and it should be planned and implemented in a proper manner.

To answer this question, we develop an overlapping-generations model where altruistic parents care about both the number and human capital of their surviving children. We find that, under a private education system, if income is low initially, the economy converges to a Malthusian stagnation steady state. For a high level of initial income, the economy reaches a growth path in which children's education rises and fertility decreases with income. In the growth regime under private education, exogenous shocks that lower child mortality are detrimental for growth: fertility increases and education declines. In contrast, under a public education system, the stagnation steady state does not exist, and health improvement shocks are no longer detrimental for growth. We therefore offer a new rationale for the introduction of public education.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Fioroni, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Pisa, Italy.",fioroni@ec.unipi.it,,"FIORONI, Tamara/0000-0003-4948-2517",,,,,27,16,16,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Making a caution about the retail function and its influence on the seats' centrality is the purpose of this article. Retail function of seats is evaluated on the base of data about the localisation of FMCG units of transnational retail chains (discounts, supermarkets and hypermarkets). Results of the study draw attention to high differentiation among the values of retail, work and residence function of Czech seats. Hence, in the centrality studies, we have to take in account all these functions and not only those ones, for which the data are well accessible.","[Hruska, Vladan] Masaryk Univ, Geog Ustav, Prirodovedecka Fak, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,hvladan@seznam.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZENOTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-5210-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,291,299,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDC19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312551100036,0

One foremost spatial issue in community research involves variations in the level of scale of a number of social concepts including social capital. An appreciation of this issue highlights conceptual and empirical overlaps across research in community sustainability. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to contribute to urban and regional planning in meaningful ways through the development of existing place-based methodologies which are capable of defining spatial scales of relevance to policy and research. This paper seeks to provide a level of methodological integration so that research can incorporate spatial variation in analyses of social capital and other concepts relevant to community sustainability. First, the importance of the spatial dimension of social capital and the methodological limitations of existing approaches is highlighted. Next, a number of methodologies for generating spatial data are noted as a basis for presenting a mapping method capable of capturing the individual-level spatial variation in social capital. Finally, a data analysis approach is presented so that spatial data can be incorporated in place-based analyses of social capital and community dynamics.","La Trobe Univ, Ctr Sustainable Reg Commun, Bendigo, Australia",La Trobe University,"Jorgensen, BS (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Ctr Sustainable Reg Commun, Bendigo, Australia.",b.jorgensen@latrobe.edu.au,"Jorgensen, Bradley/ABE-1555-2021","Jorgensen, Bradley Scott/0000-0002-9858-4168",,,,,48,22,29,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

While country level GDP per capita has slightly converged, internal regional disparities have significantly increased in the same period. Although new endogenous growth theories predicting the spatial accumulation of economic activities provide an explanation for the differing regional trajectories, they usually do not account for the institutional and policy context in which market forces operate. The paper aims to address this somewhat neglected dimension. First, it argues that market mechanisms and the policies of the post-socialist governments, which adopted foreign capital-driven, export-led growth strategies, have jointly contributed to rising regional inequalities. The claim is supported by quantitative analysis of empirical data collected on NUTS 3 regions, which establishes a strong link between the spatial locations of government-attracted foreign investments and growing disparities. Furthermore, the paper also demonstrates that between 2004 and 2006 the rather prosperous NUTS 3 regions of the V4 have benefited more from the European Union's Structural Funds than the laggard regions. The paper therefore highlights that EU funds, which had been expected to lower the developmental gap between the rich and the poor regions, did not fulfil this goal.","[Medve-Balint, Gergo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Polit Sci, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Social Sciences,,medve-balint_gergo@ceu-budapest.edu,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,13,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-180-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,79,97,,,,,,19,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BGW05,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000324343700005,0

The results show that industry consolidation played a larger role in decreasing overall listening than new technology.
