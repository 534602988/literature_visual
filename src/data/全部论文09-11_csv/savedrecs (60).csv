Instead of trying to bring up some new details to gauge their respective accuracy, we propose a different route, i.e. testing the intrinsic features of these two series, in absolute terms first, then by benchmarking them to a non-retrospective time series. In order to do that, we rely on new mathematical tools-wavelet spectrum analysis-developed in signal processing. This leads to a new approach, which separates the accuracy of a series between amplitude and time variations, and brings nuanced conclusions as to which of the two series tested is the best: indeed, since a trade-off is almost inescapable between the two criterions of accuracy, the statistical quality of one retrospective time series tends to linger either on one side (amplitude level) or the other (time variations). Our study also shows that variance distribution along the time axis is a good proxy for complex retrospective series accuracy.","[Baubeau, Patrice] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Agence Natl Rech CoDiSyNa, IDHE, CNRS,UMR 8533, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Cazelles, Bernard] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, UMR 7625, F-75230 Paris, France; [Cazelles, Bernard] IRD UR GEODES, F-93143 Bondy, France",Universite Paris Nanterre; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Baubeau, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Agence Natl Rech CoDiSyNa, IDHE, CNRS,UMR 8533, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",patrice.baubeau@orange.fr; cazelles@biologie.ens.fr,"Baubeau, Patrice/HKH-0250-2023; Cazelles, Bernard/B-1572-2013","Baubeau, Patrice/0000-0002-7052-1413; Cazelles, Bernard/0000-0002-7972-361X",,,,,33,13,16,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2009,3.0,3,,,,,275,300,,10.1007/s11698-008-0033-9,0.0,,,26,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279352200004,0

In New Member States, accession to the European Union mostly brought a substantially increased public support to foster the diffusion of certified organic farming. However, the take-up of organic farming is varied for reasons that are not yet well understood. In this paper, we analyse the diffusion of organic farming through farm populations. This involves an understanding of farmer behaviour and how it can change over time. We present a generic agent based model that builds on the Theory of Planned Behaviour as framework for understanding and modelling farmers' decision-making processes. The model is applied to high-diffusion regions in two New EU Member States, Latvia and Estonia. The values for the model's parameters are informed by survey data. The model reproduces the interdependence of social influence and economic factors. Social influence alone is shown to make little difference to the model dynamics; organic farmers remain organic, and conventional farmers remain conventional. Introducing a change to the environment (e.g. a subsidy) results in an increase in the proportion of adopters. Thus, economic factors appear to be more influential than social factors. However, only when allowing for both, the subsidy and social influence, do we reveal the whole picture and the combined adoption rate is higher than the sum of the proportion of adopters resulting from just social influence (without a subsidy) and from just a subsidy (without social influence). We also compare the effect of the subsidy with the effect of influence from organic farm advisors to develop policy recommendations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, boreal and high-latitude temperate forests may also contribute to global warming due to the albedo effect. The relative effects of carbon sequestration and albedo can be quantified in terms of radiative forcing. We present a stylized, stand-level analysis to determine the optimal rotation age when considering a tax/subsidy scheme based on radiative forcing and the notion of equivalent carbon emissions. Additional management decision variables considered include species choice and regeneration effort, since these can impact the albedo effect. We demonstrate analytically that the optimal rotation length is likely shortened when albedo-related equivalent emissions are incorporated, relative to a policy based only on carbon. Empirical results indicate that rotation ages do decrease relative to a carbon only policy, and approach the traditional (timber only) Faustmann rotation age as equivalent emission rates increase. Our results suggest that forestation does not necessarily provide climatic benefits in all circumstances, and that. at the margin, other opportunities for carbon reduction (e.g. abatement), or pursuing forestation in other locations, become more attractive.

Climate policy under the conservative Howard government (1995-2007) in Australia was largely dictated by fossil fuel and mineral sector interests, and reflected a close alliance with the Bush administration. The Howard government shunned the Kyoto Protocol, refused to set national binding greenhouse gas reduction targets and preferred voluntary cooperative measures with industry. The APP was part of the Howard government's strategy to demonstrate some policy movement on climate change while postponing serious action. Climate change was a key issue in the election of the Rudd Labor government in Australia in December 2007. The Rudd government quickly ratified Kyoto, adopted emission reduction targets, and moved to introduce emissions trading. The Rudd government's decision to continue involvement with the APP, albeit with diminished funding, was a pragmatic one. The APP was supported by industry and provided bridges to China and India-both key countries in the post-2012 UNFCCC negotiations. Finally, in order to assess the long-term outlook of the APP, the article provides a preliminary assessment as to whether the APP advances technology transfer.","[Lawrence, Peter] Univ Tasmania, Sch Law, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Lawrence, Peter] Univ Tasmania, Climate Change & Antarct Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Lawrence, Peter] Univ Tasmania, IUCN, Special Interest Grp Climate Change, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Lawrence, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Law, Private Bag 89, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Peter.Lawrence@utas.edu.au,"Lawrence, Peter/J-7134-2014","Lawrence, Peter/0000-0003-3407-3446",,,,,58,18,19,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Presidential ambitions and congressional powers,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,US climate policy; Soft-law; Hard-law; Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate; Major Economies Initiative; International climate treaty,UNITED-STATES,"The U.S. membership in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) constituted an important element in the Bush administration's voluntary and non-committing 'soft-law' approach to climate change. With the inauguration of President Barack Obama, the U.S. has embarked on a shift in its climate policy towards a legislative, 'hard-law' strategy. Obama's approach implies that the distribution of interests in Congress becomes more significant. In this article, we assess the rules and procedures governing the relationship between the president and the Congress embedded in the U.S. Constitution and explore implications of a stronger congressional involvement in U.S. climate policies for President Obama's ability to realise his climate policy ambitions at both the domestic and the international levels. We argue that the strong relationship between natural resource dependence (coal and oil) and opposition to climate policies is a constant feature of the U.S. climate policy debate. In order to succeed, Obama must break the enduring gridlock characterising congressional debate in this policy area by designing policies that, through compromise and compensation, can mobilise the support of oil- and coal-state representatives in Congress. The acceptability of an international climate treaty in Congress, moreover, depends inter alia on the resolution of the difficult issue of developing country participation. Success may be enhanced by using the APP and the Major Economies Initiative as informal arenas for negotiation and sector-based cooperation, thus providing a much-needed supplement to the UN-based negotiation process.","[Skodvin, Tora] CICERO, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Andresen, Steinar] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Skodvin, T (通讯作者)，CICERO, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",tora.skodvin@cicero.uio.no,,,,,,,67,26,27,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

His estimates were published in the 1841 census after his death and have been very widely quoted ever since.

This paper proposes a flexible Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based data augmentation framework for forecasting lifetimes and estimating customer lifetime value (CLV) in such contexts. The framework can be used to estimate many different types of CLV models-both existing and new. Models proposed so far for estimating CLV in noncontractual contexts have built-in stringent assumptions with respect to the underlying customer lifetime and purchase behavior. For example, two existing state-of-the-art models for lifetime value estimation in a noncontractual context are the Pareto/NBD and the BG/NBD models. Both of these models are based on fixed underlying assumptions about drivers of CLV that cannot be changed even in situations where the firm believes that these assumptions are violated. The proposed simulation framework-not being a model but an estimation framework-allows the user to use any of the commonly available statistical distributions for the drivers of CLV, and thus the multitude of models that can be estimated using the proposed framework (the Pareto/NBD and the BG/NBD models included) is limited only by the availability of statistical distributions. In addition, the proposed framework allows users to incorporate covariates and correlations across all the drivers of CLV in estimating lifetime values of customers.","[Singh, Siddharth S.; Borle, Sharad] Rice Univ, Jesse H Jones Grad Sch Management, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Jain, Dipak C.] Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Rice University; Northwestern University,"Singh, SS (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Jesse H Jones Grad Sch Management, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",sssingh@rice.edu,,,,,,,22,32,37,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

A wide variety of empirical studies have concluded that disparate-impact discrimination does in fact exist since minority and low-income communities are at disproportionate risk for environmental harm. In this paper we examine these issues in the context of enforcing the safe drinking water act (SDWA). Specifically, we focus on the association between race, income, and hazardous levels of arsenic concentration and analyze the broad equity implications of implementing the new arsenic regulation by examining the relationship between community-level exposure to arsenic and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the population in Arizona. The results provide no support for the contention that continued selective implementation and enforcement of the revised SDWA arsenic standard is likely to disadvantage minority or low-income groups disproportionately in Arizona.

Using a novel data set that includes the store locations and accompanying market conditions for all stores belonging to the Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target chains, we study the factors that influence the entry and location decisions of these firms. The model involves an incomplete information game between the three players where each firm has private information about its own profitability. A key feature of our modeling approach is that it permits asymmetries across firms in the impact of exogenous market characteristics and competitive interaction effects. Variations in the exogenous firm specific characteristics, such as the distances from the market to firms' headquarters and the nearest distribution centers, serve as exclusion restrictions and provide the source for model identification. Parameter estimates of the payoff functions are used to predict the equilibrium market structure under a variety of market conditions that provide insights into the competitive landscape of the industry. Results show that all firms exert a strong negative impact on competitors when they are in close proximity, but the effect decreases with distance to rivals suggesting strong returns to spatial differentiation in this industry. Target stores fare well under competition except when these competitors are in close proximity. Wal-Mart's supercenter format is found to be the most formidable player as it substantially impacts competitors even at a large distance. We also find significant asymmetries across players in their response to market conditions and competition interactions.","[Zhu, Ting; Singh, Vishal] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhu, Ting; Singh, Vishal] NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, Dept Mkt, New York, NY USA",University of Chicago; New York University,"Zhu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tzhu@chicagogsb.edu; vsingh@stern.nyu.edu,"Singh, Vishal/AAH-4861-2021; singh, vishal/AAL-6086-2020",,,,,,21,69,94,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The model also yields the novel concept of aggregate honesty which combines veto players and corruption. FDI raises environmental policy stringency where the number of legislative units are many (aggregate honesty is high), but reduces it where the legislative units are few (aggregate honesty is low). Our panel data evidence is fully consistent with these predictions. An additional contribution is to show the empirical importance of endogenizing environmental policy in Pollution Haven Hypothesis studies.

We focus first on the degradation of this assimilative capacity triggered by pollution excesses and determine the intertemporal efficient pollution path, taking into account this ecological feedback. our analysis shows that a minimum level of initial assimilative capacity is necessary to prevent its optimal extinction. We then allow for the restoration of assimilative capacity and characterize the conditions under which this option frees the optimal policy from the dependency on the initial conditions. In both cases our results call for environmental standards based on the shadow price of assimilative capacity that are stricter than the static optimum commonly used in flow pollution control.

Although often not explicitly stated, the aims of these efforts are often to restore natural capital for the provision of ecosystem services and stimulate multifunctionality in landscapes. However, the scarcity of resources for, and the potential economic impact of, ameliorative actions that restore natural capital necessitates the identification of cost-effective geographic priorities, or hotspots, which provide multiple ecosystem goods and services. This requires the integrated spatial modelling of multiple environmental and economic processes accompanied by clear goals and performance indicators. Identification of hotspots provides guidance for highly targeted land use change that cost-effectively adds to the stocks of natural capital in a landscape. Additionally, the multifunctionality of the landscape can be increased through the provision of multiple ecosystem goods and services. This paper begins by examining data requirements for identifying geographic hotspots for land use change. This study integrates traditionally disparate landscape-scale biophysical and economic data and models. The elements of natural capital considered here are species and ecosystems, soil and water resources, and the atmosphere. It is demonstrated that locating ameliorative actions towards hotspots will be more cost-effective at restoring natural capital and stimulating landscape multifunctionality than a random targeting approach. We calculate these efficiencies using a small set of indicators for assessing aspects of multifunctionality. The focus of this study is the agricultural landscapes of the Lower Murray region of south-eastern Australia. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 72 participants were randomly allocated to two conditions by reading an academic journal article about GI that contained an FCI disclosure (conflict) or a statement detailing that the authors had no FCI to declare (no-conflict). Using a questionnaire, participants made judgements about the article and authors as well as intention to perform GI-related behaviour. These were then analysed for significant differences between the two conditions. Findings - Although no significant differences emerged between group means of judgements about the article, those in the conflict condition judged the authors as being significantly less trustworthy and credible than those in the no-conflict condition, Contrary to expectation, those in the conflict condition reported significantly higher intentions to perform GI-related behaviour. Research limitations/implications - The present research must be conducted in other populations of interest in order to establish whether the results can be generalised. Practical implications - The results suggest that FCI disclosure might be best placed at the beginning of articles and that education about FCI be made available to the general public. Originality/value - The paper examines the practical implications of FCI disclosure. It also focuses on a readership beyond an academic community who is well acquainted with the subject area and issues pertaining to FCI.","[Mullan, B.

Quality changes of ripe (shell color with 3/4 yellow surface and degree Brix above 14) 'MD-2' pineapples have been studied after treatment with 1-MCP applied before and after carnauba based wax. The fruit storage environment and the experimental period studied simulated shipping and marketing conditions considering Ceara State in Northeast Brazil as the production site and the Netherlands in Europe as the market place. Evaluation included fruit visual quality, degree of shell yellowing, mass loss, firmness, flesh translucency and color, content of soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, SS / AT ratio, contents of vitamin C, total and reducing sugar, carotenoids, and flavonoids. Temperature was the key factor for the maintenance of fruit visual quality. Waxing kept fruit visual quality and delayed shell yellowing, but these effects were not improved by application of 1-MCP, neither before nor after waxing. The addition of 1-MCP to the application of wax increased contents of flavonoids and carotenoids toward the end of the storage time, but did not affect flesh luminosity or color, which remained stable throughout storage. TA was reduced by the application of wax, while SS to TA ratio increased. The decrease in total sugar and vitamin C contents, as well as the increase in reducing sugar and pH, were higher after transfer of fruits from shipping to market conditions than throughout the shipping period. Translucency of the flesh seemed to be increased by application of the treatments, but only near the end of the experiment.","[Machado, F. L.

In the first one, the climate change issue is presented and a brief analysis of the major international treaties on climate change is provided. A special focus is placed on the concept of the combination between mitigation and adaptation activities which is required to deal effectively with climate change. The second part deals with the link between climate change and environmental security, stressing in particular the contribution that climate change may give to worsen the already occurring environmental crisis at a global level, acting as a threat multiplier. In order to prevent the effect of such a possible combined negative effect of climate change and environmental security, a serious and sharp series of climate change mitigation and adaptation activities must be performed in the years to come in an even more constant and incisive way compared to the last two decades. The third part addresses more specifically the issue of how to reduce environmental security risks in SEE through the implementation of climate change treaties. In such a context, in particular, two specific scenarios are proposed and analysed. Firstly, under option A, the simpler possibility for SEE countries to implement the existing major climate change treaties, namely the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, is considered. The formal implementation of such treaties should be accompanied by the development of appropriate national mitigation and adaptation policies to effectively tackle climate change and prevent climate change related risks. Depending on the seriousness and effectiveness of such national policies, the outcomes of the domestic actions in each of the SEE countries may finally prove more or less successful. Secondly, under option B, a more sophisticated integrated approach is proposed for the SEE countries, based on the track indicated by the 2005 Energy Community South East Europe Treaty (ECSEE Treaty), which aims inter alia at reducing environmental risks by establishing a single and comprehensive regulatory framework for trading energy across SEE. Such a treaty imposes to the contracting parties, as a prerequisite for its effective enforcement, the implementation of the most relevant acquis communautaire in the environmental, energy and competition fields. Moreover, it calls for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, thus linking within a broad comprehensive legal framework the major climate change, environmental, energy and competition issues in an integrated way.","[Montini, Massimiliano] Univ Siena, Dept Econ Law, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,,montini@unisi.it; montini@unisi.it,,"MONTINI, MASSIMILIANO/0000-0003-3351-1803",,,,,18,1,1,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1871-4668,,978-94-007-0227-1,NATO SCI PEACE SECUR,NATO Sci.

The use of hedgerows has been studied in Amazonia, especially in regions prone to forest fires as a consequence of intensive use of burnings which cause large ecological, social and economic damage. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of pineapple crops as firebreak hedgerows in fire prone regions of Roraima State, Brazil, in comparison with plants from other groups of herbaceous species (Desmodium ovalifolium and Arachis sp.), commonly used in rural areas in Amazonia. Results indicated that the treatments with pineapple, not only in dense crops but also in traditional ones, did not allow fire propagation as a consequence of high humidity in its aboveground biomass and its good soil coverage increasing burning time and avoiding fire propagation. Pineapple crops showed to have desired characteristics to avoid fire propagation, superior to those of the other treatments studied.","[Xaud, M. R.; Xaud, H. A. M.; Mourao, M., Jr.; Bendahan, A.

However, the recent literature regarding EF analysis has focused increasingly on presenting the different components inherent in an aggregated EF estimate, including consumption, land, and location categories. Analyzing the EF of a particular consumption category within its socioeconomic and environmental contexts reveals information relevant to sustainability issues. Examining results according to land category and location reference is also useful toward this end. Following the emerging disaggregating trend in EF analysis. this study measures Taiwan's rice and wheat consumption footprints in terms of cropland and energy land from 1989 to 2008. It also identifies the cropland location by source country. The results indicate that Taiwan has continuously enlarged and dispersed the cropland for its rice and wheat consumption footprints in foreign countries, but it has decreased its footprint in domestic territories. By examining these findings within their local context, this study identifies and discusses related sustainability challenges that the Taiwanese government faces, such as preventing excess cropland from being developed for non-agricultural purposes.

Differences were tested using a hedonic analysis of ambient water quality in two discrete housing markets in the Pigeon River Watershed, which have been polluted by the operation of a paper mill. The results suggest that North Carolina residents residing in subwatersheds with impaired portions of the Pigeon River, who experience economic benefit from the paper mill in addition to its harmful effects on water quality, do perceive the pollution as a negative externality. In contrast, the effects of both the degraded river and its contributing streams on property values are perceived as negative externalities by watershed residents in Tennessee who experience only harmful effects from the pollution. Differences in willingness to bear the water-impairment externality were not indicated by variables representing view of and proximity to impaired water bodies. The results suggest that the perception of water quality to which property owners implicitly apply value should be considered when establishing water-quality regulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

So called payments for agrobiodiversity conservation services (PACS) would increase the private benefits from utilizing local plant and animal genetic resources on-farm through voluntary reward mechanisms, so as to sustain their on-farm conservation. Theoretical and applied insights about PACS are discussed and attention drawn to some of the challenges to be overcome in implementing PACS. In particular, these relate to the identification of potential buyers, the complex institutional setting in which PACS might operate and the articulation of a meaningful conservation goal based on a safe minimum standard approach. The latter is urgently needed, so as to ensure that additional agrobiodiversity services are generated. Relative to a fixed pricing approach, PACS schemes that seek to overcome information asymmetries through the use of conservation auctions may be associated with significant efficiency gains. However, potential trade-offs between ecological effectiveness, economic efficiency, and social equity considerations need to be carefully evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In a marine ecosystem under common pool management regime the contribution margin from catching the fish belongs to the fisher, while the benefit from the investment of leaving the fish in the sea will be shared in the common pool. The intertemporal choice therefore creates a driver for short sighted use of the ecosystem. The intertemporal balance of the exploitation is analyzed by applying capital theory to a size-based ecosystem model. The model reveals a need for intertemporal balance with respect to both fish size and harvest volume. The management therefore is, at an ecosystem level, to set target and regulate not only harvest volume but also size. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The findings indicate that families migrated to the city such that the educational attainment of their children would be maximized, and that there is a positive correlation between family migration and children being apprentices in urban areas. The results suggest that rural-urban migration was powered not only by the exploitation of rural-urban wage gaps but also by aspirations to engage in human capital investment.","Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Klein, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,"Klein, Alexander/KBQ-6003-2024; Klein, Alexander/H-2941-2014",,,,,,49,4,5,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

K., as well as in the economies of other countries. Empirical evidence suggests that wage differentials adjusted for the cost of living cannot only be explained by the unequal spatial distribution of characteristics determining earnings. Rather, average wage gap decomposition reveals the important contribution made by regional heterogeneity in the price assigned to these characteristics. This paper proposes a method for assessing regional disparities in the entire wage distribution and for decomposing the effect of differences across regions in the endowments and prices of the characteristics. The hypothesis forwarded is that the results from previous studies obtained by comparing average regional wages may be partial and nonrobust. Empirical evidence from a matched employer-employee dataset for Spain confirms marked differences in wage distributions between regions, which do not result from worker and firm characteristics but from the increasing role of regional differences in the return to human capital.","[Motellon, Elisabet] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Motellon, Elisabet; Lopez-Bazo, Enrique; El-Attar, Mayssun] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Lopez-Bazo, Enrique] Inst Prospect Technol Studies IPTS, Seville, Spain; [El-Attar, Mayssun] McGill Univ, IZA, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [El-Attar, Mayssun] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; University of Barcelona; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); McGill University; McGill University,"Motellón, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oberta Catalunya, Avda Tibidabo 39-43, Barcelona 08035, Spain.",emotellon@uoc.edu; elopez@ub.edu; mayssun.el-attarvilalta@mcgill.ca,"Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/AAY-3187-2020; Motellon, Elisabet/L-2352-2014","Lopez-Bazo, Enrique/0000-0002-4654-8237; Motellon, Elisabet/0000-0002-5461-2825",,,,,29,20,20,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Conditional heteroscedasticity in historical commodity price series,CLIOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market efficiency; Conditional heteroscedasticity; Price volatility; Time-series analysis,MEDIEVAL ENGLAND; GRAIN STORAGE; AGRICULTURE; INTEGRATION,"The development in the working of markets has been an important topic in economic history for decades. The volatility of market prices is often used as an indicator of market efficiency in the broadest sense. Yet, the way in which volatility is estimated often makes it difficult to compare price volatility across regions or over time for two reasons. First, if prices are non-stationary, the variance is inflated. Second, the variance of commodity prices contains information on a number of region- and time-specific factors that are not related to market efficiency. Hence, the popular coefficient of variation and related indicators are not adequate measures of the efficiency of markets and are incomparable across regions. As a solution, we suggest using a conditional heteroscedasticity model to estimate the residual (conditional) variance of commodity prices. This measure reflects how markets react to unexpected events and can therefore be seen as a measure of market efficiency. Using this approach on grain prices from the Early Modern Pisa, Paris, Vienna, and Japan, we find that the residual price volatility had declined (and market efficiency increased) in the European markets in the late sixteenth century while it remained stable in Japan.","[Foeldvari, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Debrecen, Hungary; [Foeldvari, Peter; van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Fac Humanities, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Leeuwen, Bas] Free Univ Amsterdam, Fac Humanities, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Debrecen; Utrecht University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Földvári, P (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Debrecen, Hungary.",peter.foldvari@econ.unideb.hu,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,41,17,20,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JUN,2011,5.0,2,,,,,165,186,,10.1007/s11698-010-0055-y,0.0,,,22,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,756BX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289987800004,0

It contributes to the existing literature by examining the effect of urbanization, taking into account dynamics and the presence of heterogeneity in the sample of countries. The results show an inverted-U shaped relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions. Indeed, the elasticity emission-urbanization is positive for low urbanization levels, which is in accordance with the higher environmental impact observed in less developed regions. Among our contributions is the estimation of a semi-parametric mixture model that allows for unknown distributional shapes and endogenously classifies countries into homogeneous groups. Three groups of countries are identified for which urbanization's impact differs considerably. For two of the groups, a threshold level is identified beyond which the emission-urbanization elasticity is negative and further increases in the urbanization rate do not contribute to higher emissions. However, for the third group only population and affluence, but not urbanization, contribute to explain emissions. The differential impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions should therefore be taken into account in future discussions of climate change policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As with other low intensity farming systems across Europe, crofting is changing in response to a range of socio-economic factors. This is having a negative impact on the populations of rare bumblebees that are associated with this agricultural system. In this paper we use an ecological-economic modelling approach to examine the likely impacts of introducing two different management options for conserving bumblebees on croft land-use and income. Two linear programming models were constructed to represent the predominant crofting systems found in the Outer Hebrides, and varying constraints on bumblebee abundance were imposed to examine the trade-off between conservation and agricultural incomes. The model outputs illustrate that in some instances it is likely that both agricultural profits and bumblebee densities can be enhanced. We conclude that policy-makers should take into consideration the type of farming system when designing cost-effective agri-environment policies for low intensity farming systems, and that improvements in bee conservation are not necessarily in conflict with maintaining farm income.

Using ecological economics (EE) as a 'seed' journal and applying bibliometric techniques to all (2533) the articles published in EE from January 1989 to December 2009, we analyze the evolution of the field of ecological economics aiming to shed light on this debate. We observe the predominance (and increased relevance) of certain research topics: 'Methodological issues', 'Policies, governance and institutions' and 'Valuation'. Moreover, 'Collective action', 'Technical change and the environment' and 'Values' stand as emergent themes of research. Finally, we note that ecological economics experienced an 'empirical turn' reflected in a shift away from exclusively formalized papers towards exclusively empirical and, to a larger extent, 'formal and empirical' ones. The combination of the prominent and emergent topics and the 'empirical turn' mirrors the increasing awareness among researchers in the field of the need to address a key specificity of ecological economics - the interdependence of the economic, biophysical and social spheres. On this basis, we argue that at least through the lens of EE, ecological economics has evolved towards a post-normal science. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

How different was the Ottoman experience from the rest of the poor periphery? Was de-industrialization more or less pronounced? Was the terms of trade effect bigger or smaller? How much of Ottoman de-industrialization was due to falling world trade barriers such as ocean transport revolutions and European liberal trade policy, how much due to factory-based productivity advance in Europe, how much to declining Ottoman competitiveness in manufacturing, how much to Ottoman railroads penetrating the interior, and how much to Ottoman policy?

However, the public nature and competition involved in the use of these goods, and weak enforcement of institutional arrangements governing their use may lead to resource degradation. Using survey data from four communities in southeastern Zimbabwe for 2008 and 2009, this paper examines the extent to which forest degradation is driven by existing common property management regimes resource and user characteristics, ecological knowledge and marketing structure. A Principal Component Analysis indicates that the existence of agreed-upon rules governing usage (including costs of usage), enforcement of these rules, sanctions for rule violations that are proportional to the severity of rule violation, social homogeneity, and strong beliefs in ancestral spirits were the most important attributes determining effectiveness of local institutions in the management of CPRs. Empirical results from a regression analysis showed that resource scarcity, market integration, and infrastructural development lead to greater resource degradation, while livestock income, high ecological knowledge, older households, and effective local institutional management of the commons reduce resource degradation. The results suggest that there is need for adaptive local management systems that enhance ecological knowledge of users and regulates market structure to favour long-term livelihood securities of these forest-fringe communities.

Some researchers argue that consumers' lack of knowledge concerning organic food is an important factor slowing down growth. This paper aims to focus on the factors influencing objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production and the relationship between both types of knowledge and consumer attitudes and motivations towards organic food and its consumption. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is presented, relating to the impact of knowledge on behaviour in general and, more specifically, on organic food consumption. Several hypotheses are formulated concerning the relationship between objective and subjective knowledge, attitudes and organic food consumption and these are tested on organic vegetable consumption in Flanders (Belgium). Multiple regression models, a probit model and an analysis of variance are applied to a sample of 529 completed questionnaires (response rate = 44 per cent). The respondents were selected in January 2007 using a convenience sampling technique. Socio-demographic variables are used to check representativeness. Findings - In the sample, the level of objective knowledge regarding organic vegetables is high. Attitudes towards the consumption of organic vegetables are generally positive. The strongest motivations for consuming organic vegetables are that they are produced without synthetic pesticides, are better for the environment, healthier, of higher quality and taste better. The strongest perceived barriers are overly high prices and lack of availability. Objective and subjective knowledge with regard to organic food production show a positive correlation. Higher levels of objective and subjective knowledge concerning organic food are positively related to a more positive attitude towards organic food, greater experience of it and a more frequent use of information. Membership of an ecological organisation (VELT) is also related to higher levels of knowledge. Some variables have a significant positive relationship with subjective knowledge, but not with objective knowledge. Attitude is significantly and positively influenced by subjective knowledge, VELT-membership, norm, motivations and female gender. Perceived barriers have a significant negative influence on attitude. The likelihood of consuming organic vegetables is significantly and positively influenced by VELT-membership, subjective knowledge, attitude, motivations and the presence of children in the household. Whilst objective knowledge, norm and female gender have a significantly positive influence on attitude towards organic vegetables, they have no significant influence on the likelihood of actually consuming organic vegetables. Originality/value - Whilst several researchers argue that knowledge may be a very important factor in increasing organic food consumption, few have studied the mechanisms behind it. To the authors' knowledge this is the first paper describing the impact of knowledge on organic food consumption in such detail. By assessing the impact of knowledge, as well as other factors, on organic food consumption, greater insight is gained with regard to organic food consumption behaviour.","[Aertsens, Joris; Verbeke, Wim; Buysse, Jeroen; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Aertsens, Joris] Flemish Inst Technol Res, Vlaamse Instelling Technol Onderzoek, Boeretang, Belgium; [Mondelaers, Koen] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Merelbeke, Belgium",Ghent University; VITO; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research,"Aertsens, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Joris.Aertsens@UGent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",,,,,65,286,320,3,167,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper investigates one of them, user-provided connectivity or UPC. In contrast to traditional infrastructure-based connectivity, e.g., connectivity through the up-front build-out of expensive base-stations, UPC realizes connectivity organically as users join and expand its coverage. The low(er) deployment cost this affords is one of its main attractions. Conversely, the disadvantages of connectivity sharing and a high barrier-to-entry from low initial penetration create strong disincentives to its adoption. The paper's contributions are in formulating and solving a simple model that captures key aspects of UPC adoption, and in articulating guidelines to make it successful. For analytical tractability, the model is arguably simplistic, but the robustness of its findings is demonstrated numerically across a wide range of more general (and more realistic) configurations.","[Afrasiabi, Mohammad Hadi; Guerin, Roch] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,,afram@seas.upenn.edu; guerin@ee.upenn.edu,,,,,,,19,0,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-642-24546-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2011,6995.0,,,,,,38,49,,,,,,12,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BBA18,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306259200005,0

It was found out that the most common cases of contact - mode of injury for accidents occurred during maintenance of vehicles, tractors and harvesters were: crash on or against due to slip, trip or fall; struck by a portable powered tool; contact with sharp, rough surfaces. Risk of accidents is increased by the family business and self-employment nature of agriculture, farmers' education level, hiring workers without adequate training, working alone, hurry, long working hours and workers' physical and mental overload.

J,"Alonso, AD; O'Neill, MA",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte; O'Neill, Martin A.",,,Climate change from the perspective of Spanish wine growers: a three-region study,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climage change; Wines; Wine making; Spain; Emergent strategy,RESPONSE RATES; MAIL SURVEYS; AGRICULTURE; WEB,"Purpose - Winery operators and viticulturalists alike face many challenges in their daily and annual work cycle; not least the challenge of producing annually a consistent quality product and getting that product to the market in an ever competitive marketplace. While climate has always been a factor when it comes to meeting this challenge, it has become all the more pronounced recently due to the effects of global climatic change. Against this background, this paper aims to explore the effects of climate change from the perspective of winery operators in three prominent Spanish wine producing regions. Design/methodology/approach - Wineries in La Mancha, La Rioja and Penedes, totalling 570, were contacted electronically and invited to participate in an online survey. Of these businesses, 94 participated, a 16.5 per cent response rate. Findings - While it was found that generally climate change is not among growers' main challenges, three distinct groups emerged from this study: the unbelievers, the cautiously sceptical and the believers. This last and largest group of respondents (41.5 per cent) not only acknowledges changes due to climate change, but also strategies already in place to minimise the effects of climate change, suggesting the severity of the problem. Research limitations/implications - Comparisons among the three participating wine regions were not possible due to the low number of respondents from one of the regions. Also, the total number of respondents does not allow for making the study's findings generalisable. Practical implications - The wine industry, its stakeholders and government agencies need to work together to monitor any changes and find ways to address negative effects of climate change that may result in increased water usage, pesticides or changes in labour demand. Originality/value - The study provides new insights into climate change according to winery operators' perspectives, an area that to date has received very limited attention from researchers.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Penrith, Australia; [Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia; [O'Neill, Martin A.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Western Sydney University; Edith Cowan University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management, Penrith, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,50,27,32,0,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In the present study the authors aim to evaluate the effect of meteorological parameters on pine radial increment and detect key factors limiting pine growth over different periods of pine tree ring formation. Obtained data revealed that mean temperature of winter months was a key factor affecting pine tree ring width formation of the separated periods. Lack of humidity over vegetation limited pine growth over fertilisation, depression and stabilisation periods, meanwhile more humid September-December months - over depression, regeneration and stabilisation periods.","[Augustaitis, Algirdas; Augustaitiene, Ingrida; Kliucius, Almantas; Plausinyte, Erika] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Juknys, Romualdas; Vitas, Adomas] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Augustaitis, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",algirdas.augustaitis@asu.lt; i.augustaitiene@gmail.com; r.juknys@vdu.lt; almantas.kliucius@asu.lt; e.plausinyte@gmail.com; a.vitas@gmf.vdu.lt,"Vitas, Adomas/H-3752-2016",,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,15,20,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500002,0
J,"Dabrowska, A",,,,"Dabrowska, Anna",,,Consumer behaviour in the market of catering services in selected countries of Central-Eastern Europe,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Consumer behaviour; Catering industry; Lithuania; Latvia; Poland; Ukraine,,"Purpose - New member countries of the European Union such as Lithuania, Latvia and Poland are an interesting subject of study due to the fact that processes of changes in consumption and consumer behaviour in these countries are characterized by large dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to present consumer behaviour in the market of catering services in all the above-mentioned countries as well as in Ukraine. Catering services are an important market on account of their functions and the needs they satisfy. Moreover, on the one hand, under favourable conditions the market of catering services develops dynamically, and, on the other, in time of economic crisis we can feel its consequences fast because of decreasing demand. The possibility of observing consumer behaviour and its sensitivity to factors influencing food purchase decisions is interesting to both researchers and business practice. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is of an empirical character. The presented consumer research findings, which refer. to gastronomic services are a part of a study aimed at examining the situation of consumers and consumer behaviours in four countries: Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Ukraine. Consumer research like Omnibus, which has been conducted by GfK Research Company for a research project: The Position of a Consumer and Changes in Consumption in the Central-Eastern Europe following the EU Enlargement (the author has been the manager of the project), is representative with regard to: age, sex and the size of location. The research method was a direct (face-to-face) interview, based on a standardized questionnaire, conducted in a respondent's house. Findings - Analysis of the obtained qualitative and quantitative data allows us to conclude that consumers react to factors creating demand in various ways; consumers-respondents are differentiated with regard to frequency of using catering outlets; social and demographic features also influence consumer behaviour; and the greatest number of respondents use the services of cafes. Originality/value - The paper examines consumer behaviour in the gastronomic services market. The findings may be interesting for entrepreneurs whose activity is connected with the gastronomic sector or who are interested in diversifying onto the markets analysed in the research. What is worth emphasizing is that the majority of respondents perceive a positive influence of Europeanisation on quality, competition, the level of service or observing consumer rights. These evaluations also concern the changes which occur in domestic markets of catering services.","Inst Market Consumpt & Business Cycles Res, Dept Consumpt, Warsaw, Poland","Institute for Market, Consumption and Business Cycles Research","Dabrowska, A (通讯作者)，Inst Market Consumpt & Business Cycles Res, Dept Consumpt, Warsaw, Poland.",annadabrowskal@wp.pl,,,,,,,11,12,12,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We analyze how order of entry and quality affect the level of peak sales and the time-to-peak-sales of pharmaceutical brands. We develop a growth model that includes these two variables as well as control variables for own and competitive marketing activities. We find that early entrants achieve peak sales later, and they have higher peak-sales levels. High-quality brands achieve peak sales earlier, and their peak-sales levels are higher. In addition, quality has a moderating effect on the order of entry effect on time-to-peak-sales.

In particular, we study the case of absolute location advantage in a single industry model and the case of comparative advantages in a two-industry model. We characterize the structure of industries and discuss the possibilities of catastrophic changes, endogenous industrial asymmetries and specialization.

Improved cookstoves have been disseminated as an alternative to reduce these impacts. However, few detailed studies about the economic benefits of improved cookstoves (ICS) interventions, including environmental and health co-benefits, exist to date. In this paper we perform a comprehensive economic evaluation of a dissemination program of ICS in rural Mexico. The resulting cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the Patsari improved cookstove is presented, utilizing estimation of direct costs and benefits, including fuelwood savings, income generation, health impacts, environmental conservation, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis is based on comprehensive data obtained through monitoring studies carried out in the Study Area from 2003 to the present. Results show that Patsari cookstoves represent a viable economic option for improving living conditions of the poorest inhabitants of rural Mexico, with benefit/cost ratios estimated between 11.4:1 and 9:1. The largest contributors to economic benefits stemmed from fuelwood savings and reductions in health impacts, which constituted 53% and 28% of the overall benefit, respectively.

We use an integrated economic and ecological modelling approach to compare three scenarios with the situation in 2003/05. We base the economic sub-model on single farms, which alter their land use in response to economic stimuli. Within the economic part, factors like the farm's endowment with machinery and quota are regarded. Within the rule-based ecological sub-model we analyse: area of protected habitats according to the EC Habitats Directive: biodiversity for selected taxonomic groups and habitat quality for different target species. An overall evaluation of the scenarios indicates that decoupling has a limited effect, because higher direct payments compensate the effect of lower product prices. If all payments are strictly targeted to agri-environmental measures and set to a level which guarantees a low-input management of the grassland, the public costs could be reduced and additional habitats for the target species could be provided. Regarding all indicators but the extent of protected habitats and the public costs, a scenario with a cessation of public payments and market liberalisation performs the worst. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Small-scale farmers converting to OA require substantial external production-related, marketing and certification support. Access to OA was strongly dependent upon the type of support available to farmers. Organization based on a contract-farming model resulted in OA only being an option available to a narrow group of farmers, whilst OA initiated by a farmer cooperative provided better access. Gross output was significantly higher for oranges, whilst for the other crops gross output was similar. However, organic farmers in China felt that adoption had improved prices, incomes and market access. Farmers' perception of improved incomes is probably due to improved market access coupled with either a large production base, production intensification and production diversification. This study demonstrates that organization of farmers, and the manner in which this is structured, is crucial for external support to have an effect. Thus, OA may be a development path for small farmers if the supporting structures are provided at a small financial interest rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

While each is undoubtedly important, they are unrelated. In this paper, I show that the services-environment link is small, for two reasons. First, services account for only a small fraction of overall pollution. For none of five major air pollutants does the service sector account for even 4% of total emissions; for three of the five services account for less than 1%. Second, those service industries that do pollute are the least likely to be traded internationally. Those services for which the United States collects and publishes international trade data-presumably those services that are traded internationally-are less polluting than services for which trade data do not exist-presumably because the services are not traded. Even if we limit attention to the services that are traded across borders, the service industries most intensively traded are the ones that pollute the least. The bottom line is simple. International services trade bears little relation to the environment, because services in general contribute relatively little to overall pollution, and those industries that are traded internationally are among the least polluting.","Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC USA",Georgetown University,"Levinson, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC USA.",aml6@georgetown.edu,,"Levinson, Arik/0000-0002-9464-4936",,,,,4,8,8,9,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

From this perspective, the Great Merger Movement was a response to competitive pressures associated with a number of significant technological innovations which occurred at the end of the nineteenth century. Because the implementation of these innovations required large capital investments, and because the returns to the investments would have been highly uncertain if they had been made competitively, firms at the turn of the twentieth century sought to restrain competition. Since the uncertainty precluded cooperating at arms-length, cooperation was internalized through horizontal consolidations. The consolidations in turn increased the size of the capital investments undertaken to implement the technological innovations. The theory is supported with historical evidence about the technological environment and industrial conditions at the turn of the twentieth century, and an econometric model is tested using data from the Twelfth and Thirteenth Censuses of Manufactures.","Calif Western Sch Law, San Diego, CA USA",,"Smythe, DJ (通讯作者)，Calif Western Sch Law, San Diego, CA USA.",DSmythe@cwsl.edu,,,,,,,60,3,5,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JUN,2010,4.0,2,,,,,141,170,,10.1007/s11698-009-0041-4,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279352800002,0

Previous studies of no-net-loss regulation address the ecological efficacy and valuation of restoration but largely ignore the effects of market dynamics. We link an economic model of free-entry equilibria with an ecological model that includes returns to scale and inefficiency of restored ecosystems and apply the result to stream mitigation banking in North Carolina. Intuition from ecology alone must be modified to account for economic processes, and vice versa. To implement no-net-loss regulation, one must not only account for ecological differences between restored and natural ecosystems, but also consider the effect of market entry on the number and size of restoration projects. In a purely economic model, free-entry equilibria are characterized by excess entry: the equilibrium number of firms is greater than the welfare maximizing number. Ecological considerations may exacerbate or ameliorate this, so that either excess entry or insufficient entry may occur, depending on the specific ecosystem services sought. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At an epistemological level coevolution offers a powerful logic for transcending environmental and social deteriminisms and developing a cross-disciplinary approach in the study of socio-ecological systems. We identify four consistent stories emerging out of coevolutionary studies in ecological economics, concerning: environmental degradation and development failure in peripheral regions; the lock-in of unsustainable production-consumption patterns; the vicious cycle between human efforts to control undesirable micro-organisms and the evolution of these organisms; and the adaptive advantages of other-regarding, cooperative behaviors and institutions. We identify challenges in the conceptualization of coevolutionary relationships in relation to: the interaction between different hierarchical levels of evolution; the role of space and social power: uneven rates of change and crises. We conclude with the political implications of a coevolutionary perspective based on the premises of pragmatism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Wam, HK",,,,"Wam, Hilde Karine",,,"Economists, time to team up with the ecologists!",ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Ecological economics; Intrinsic; Nature; Management; Philosophy; Wildlife,,"Bioeconomic modeling is an increasingly relevant meeting arena for economists and ecologists. A majority of the growing literature, however, is written by economists alone and not with ecologists in true interdisciplinary teamwork. Physical distance between research institutions is no longer a reasonable justification, and I argue that, in practice. neither do the more fundamental philosophical oppositions present any real hindrance to teamwork. I summarize these oppositions in order of increasing magnitude as: 1) the axiom, held by many ecologists, of 'irreducible complexity of ecosystem functioning', which is avoided simply because the ecological 'whole' (as opposed to its 'parts') is not an element of most realistic modeling scenarios: 2) the axiom, also held by many ecologists, of 'the precautionary principle', which mainly surfaces at the applied end of natural resource management, and thereby should not prevent economists and ecologists from jointly building the models necessary for the final decision making; and 3) the economists' axiom of 'the tradability principle', which is harder to overcome as it demands value-based practical compromises from both parties. Even this may be solved, however, provided the economists accept nonmarketable components in the model (e.g. by using restriction terms based on ecology), and the ecologists accept a final model output measured in terms of monetary value. The easiest candidates for interdisciplinary teamwork in bioeconomics are therefore researchers who acknowledge ethical relativism. As bioeconomics presently functions mainly as an arena for economists, I say the responsibility for initiating interdisciplinary teamwork rests most heavily on their shoulders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In a hospitality industry context, local produce can enhance culinary experiences as well as benefit regions and businesses that promote it. However, to what extent are hospitality businesses aware and receptive to the range of local products available? Furthermore, are small hospitality enterprises (SHEs), particularly those near rural areas, actively involved in utilising local products on their menus? And if so, to what extent is this demand driven or an attempt to seek out a unique selling proposition on the part of SHEs? The present paper seeks to answer these questions from the hospitality operators' perspective. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 21 SHEs located in the southern United States were interviewed via telephone and face-to-face. Findings - Despite their close geographical proximity to farms that grow fresh produce and a near-by farmers' market open in the summer, SHEs' involvement with local foods in this study is very fragmented. In fact, more respondents are not involved in purchasing local products than those who are, while others are only marginally involved. Furthermore, convenience of direct deliveries by out-of-state food distributors and unawareness of existing fresh local produce availability are reasons expressed for not engaging in efforts to buy locally. Research limitations/implications - The narrow geographical area chosen and low number of participating businesses in this study may not allow for making generalizations with regards to the findings. Practical implications - The dysfunctional nature of the current relationship identified between SHEs and local food producers may be conducive to very unfavourable long-term impacts for both parties, including lost sales opportunities by not providing fresher, higher quality produce that appeals to increasingly discerning customers. Originality/value - The present study offers new insights into the relationship between SHEs and local food producers, an area that has been largely neglected in contemporary research.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia; [O'Neill, Martin] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Edith Cowan University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,44,17,20,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper seeks to adopt a comparative approach to the case studies, with considerable use made of primary sources such as parliamentary debate, government reports and EC legislation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a review of the strengths and weaknesses in the management of the Belgian and Irish dioxin contanimation incidents. Findings - It is concluded that open, transparent and decisive risk management, based on robust risk assessment, is paramount in ensuring confidence in both the food supply chain and, in the feed and food safety regulatory process. It is also concluded that the 2008 Irish dioxin incident tested the reforms prompted by previous food scares. Practical implications - It is important that the lessons from these two incidents are learnt if they are not to be repeated in other jurisdictions. Originality/value - This is the first academic study of the 2008 Irish dioxin incident, one of the most significant recent food scares in the European Communities. The incident emphasises the vital role of open, transparent and decisive decision making in managing risk. In addition, through a comparative analysis of the Belgian and Irish incidents, the utility of the reforms prompted by previous food scares is demonstrated. In particular, the study highlights the important role played by the European Food Safety Authority in one of its first major tests as a risk assessor and risk communicator.","[Wall, Patrick G.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Publ Hlth & Populat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Casey, Donal K.; Lawless, James S.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Law, Dublin 2, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Wall, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Publ Hlth & Populat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland.",patrick.wall@ucd.ie,,,,,,,19,29,30,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper aims to present the results of the project PAMLED, which was co-funded by the Med-Pact Programme of the EU. The project will complete its course at the end of April and it aims to develop and strengthen the capabilities of three Mediterranean cities (City of Marrakech, Morocco, Sin El Fil, Lebanon and Bodrum, Turkey) in managing and promoting their local sustainable development, as well as implementing innovative different action fields. The strengthening of the capabilities of these Mediterranean partners was mainly based on 'collective learning', achieved by the constitution of partnerships with five European partners (the municipalities of Prato, Lucca, Brtonigla, Rio Marina and Skopje). The needs and priorities of each Mediterranean partner were identified and pilot actions were specifically elaborated in order to promote the sustainable development and the exploitation of local resources, with particular respect to environmental protection, the enhancement of local tangible and intangible assets, economic support and overall sustainable development. The paper will show the outputs of several pilot actions carried out in the three Mediterranean cities involved. The Municipality of Bodrum carried out innovative pilot actions in the field of urban waste management; Sin El Fil developed a pilot project titled Youth development plan, while the City of Marrakech carried out a pilot project aimed at sensitizing the local communities and the actors of the touristic sector (e.g. hotels, hammams) on the importance of reducing water consumption.","[Daddi, T.; Farro, F.; Vaglio, S.; Bartoli, G.; Iraldo, F.] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Daddi, T (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy.",,"Vaglio, Stefano/AAX-3024-2020","Vaglio, Stefano/0000-0003-0885-8573",,,,,16,0,0,0,7,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

Design/methodology/approach - Samples of pre-packed fresh-cut fruit and vegetables as well as whole produce were collected from the market in Muscat and Oman, and analyzed for vitamin C, lycopene and total carotenoids. Analysis of variance was carried out to determine the level of statistical differences between fresh-cut and whole fruit and vegetables. Findings - In both fruit and vegetables, vitamin C contents are higher in whole than fresh-cut produce, with greater reductions in vitamin C contents of fresh-cut vegetables than fruit. In both fresh-cut and whole fruit, lycopene content is 30-36 times higher in watermelon than the contents of other fruit genotypes studied. Similarly, total carotenoids content of watermelon is six to 21 times higher than other types of fruit studied. Both lycopene and total carotenoids content are higher in whole than fresh-cut fruit, except in pineapple fruit. In both fresh-cut and whole vegetables, lycopene content of carrot is three to four times higher than cucumber, and four to six times higher than celery. Implications of these results on public health policy are discussed. Originality/value - Previous studies on quality of fresh-cut produce are based on controlled experimental studies using samples of produce from the same batch to compare fresh-cut versus whole produce. However, consumers in retails stores often have to make a choice between pre-packed fresh-cut or whole (un-cut) produce, which are not usually from the same source or batch. It is therefore essential to understand the differences in nutritional value of whole and pre-packed fresh-cuts sold in the market.","[Opara, Umezuruike Linus] Univ Stellenbosch, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Al-Ani, Majeed R.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Muscat, Oman",Stellenbosch University; Sultan Qaboos University,"Opara, UL (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",opara@sun.ac.za,"Opara, Umezuruike Linus/AAC-5805-2019; Opara, Umezuruike Linus/J-3978-2013","Opara, Umezuruike Linus/0000-0001-8056-7215",Sultan Qaboos University [SR/AGR/BIOR/05/01],Sultan Qaboos University,The paper was supported by his Majesty's Strategic Research Grant (SR/AGR/BIOR/05/01) at Sultan Qaboos University awarded to Professor Umezuruike Linus Opara.

This paper develops a conceptual framework to examine factors enabling and constraining successful policy reform and implementation in market-based environmental water allocation. This analysis distills and extends the findings and lessons of a September 2007 workshop in Brisbane, Australia on environmental water transactions. Two case studies were selected in water stressed basins - the Columbia (U.S.A) and Murray-Darling (Australia) Basins - where transactional approaches to environmental water allocation first emerged. The case studies draw upon practitioner perspectives and previous policy and economic analysis in two regions where shared political economic and physical conditions lend a strong analytical basis for comparison. A common set of policy and regulatory reforms has occurred in both cases - albeit in different forms and via distinct paths - to develop three enabling conditions: (1) establishment of rights to and limits on freshwater extraction and alteration; (2) recognition of the environment as a legitimate water use; and (3) authority to transfer existing water rights to an environmental purpose. However, these elements of policy reform are necessary but not sufficient for effective implementation; a second set of driving forces, barriers, and adaptations explains the ability to achieve larger scale ecological outcomes. These conditions include the physical, social and economic factors driving demand for environmental water allocation: administrative procedures, organizational development and institutional capacity to effect transfers; and adaptive mechanisms to overcome legal, cultural, economic, and environmental barriers. The case study analysis suggests that environmental water transactions can play an important role in establishing environmental water allocations, although water markets require ongoing institutional capacity and adaptive governance. The conceptual framework and empirical lessons generated through this cross-case comparison provide the basis for an expanded research agenda to evaluate the design and performance of market-oriented reforms as implementation experience accrues and new programs emerge in diverse ecological and political economic settings.

We find that while core-periphery equilibria are always saddlepath stable, interior equilibria are saddlepath stable when knowledge spillovers exceed a threshold level but are unstable otherwise.

This is unsurprising, because objecting to the goal of sustainability is like objecting to other inherently good goals like peace or freedom. Responses to sustainability exist on a long continuum, with some interpreting sustainability to mean conservation-at-all-costs and reduced economic growth, while others suggest that the market will ensure sustainable outcomes eventually result. Further, sustainability can be easily manipulated to justify predetermined outcomes. There are, indeed, a multitude of conceptual and pragmatic challenges to operating on sustainability, particularly when the scale shifts from a global goal to local action. Using the application of sustainability to affordable housing in Australia as a case study, this article argues that rather than limiting sustainable outcomes, the existence of the sustainability debate which focuses on the many challenges is a positive indicator that sustainability may be attainable.

Little is known about the effects of these statutes. This article analyzes the use of the limited partnership in nineteenth-century New York City. We find that the form was adopted by a surprising number of firms, and that limited partnerships had more capital, failed at lower rates, and had fewer members with kinship ties, compared to ordinary partnerships. The results suggest that the introduction of the limited partnership facilitated investments that would not have occurred in the absence of the form.","[Hilt, Eric] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [O'Banion, Katharine] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Wellesley College; Yale University,"Hilt, E (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",ehilt@wellesley.edu; katharine.obanion@yale.edu,,,,,,,51,21,25,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

J,"Agarwal, B",,,,"Agarwal, Bina",,,Rule making in community forestry institutions: The difference women make,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Community forestry institutions; Rule making; Gender composition; South Asia,POLICY; IMPACT,"Forest use rules determine what products are extracted from community governed forests, in what quantity, by what methods, and by whom. The nature of rules and the process by which they are formulated (e.g. who participates in formulating them) can impinge critically on institutional sustainability (given their potential impact on the commitment and incentive to protect), and on equity and conservation outcomes. This is well recognized in the substantial literature on institutions governing common pool resources (CPRs). It is also well recognized, although in relation to other types of institutions, such as legislatures and village councils, that there can be notable differences in women's and men's policy priorities. Yet there is surprisingly little existing work on, or statistical testing of, potential gender differences in rule making in institutions managing natural resources such as forests. This paper, based on the author's primary data for India and Nepal. seeks to fill this conceptual and empirical gap. It examines why we might expect women to favour different rules from men, and statistically tests whether the gender composition of the executive committees (ECs)-the main decision-making bodies of community forestry institutions (CFIs) in South Asia-makes a difference to the strictness of forest use rules. This is analyzed both by specifying a strictness index which aggregates rules across products and by examining rules for selected products, and both for all sample districts together and for each district separately. Gender is found to make a significant difference to the rules specified but not always in the expected direction. Given their substantial and daily dependence on local forests, especially for firewood and fodder, rural women may normally be expected to veer toward lenient rules of extraction. In fact, groups with more EC women and especially with all-women ECs tend to make stricter rules than other groups in most of the sample districts, except one district where they tend to make less strict rules. Greater strictness is attributable especially to the resource constraint faced by all-women groups (ie. CFIs with all-women ECs) which receive smaller and more degraded forests than groups with men. Less strict rules among CFIs in the exceptional district are attributable especially to the disproportionate presence of landless women on their ECs. In other words, not simply women's presence in rule making but also their economic class can matter. Strictness also varies by type of product, forest and population characteristics. the EC's average age and dominant caste, and monitoring constraints. The potential implications for equity, institutional sustainability and forest conservation are also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Air travelers asked to pay a carbon travel tax to offset carbon emissions from flying were asked how likely it is that they will actually pay if the tax is voluntary. When changing the market compliance imperative from a mandatory carbon tax to a voluntary contribution, a third of all air travelers consider it unlikely they will actually pay their stated WTP amount. An ordered probit estimation approach is applied to identify the sources of respondent uncertainty. Besides the bid price, respondent sense of responsibility and belief in the effectiveness of the voluntary carbon market are among the main reasons for the experienced uncertainty.

ANS extends the conventional net saving by adding human capital accumulation and deducting natural resources losses. This paper tests ANSas an index of sustainable development. it examines whether ANS explains changes in welfare. Welfare is measured by Infant mortality rate (IMR) and Human Development index (HDI). The study was conducted in 36 selected developing and developed countries and covers the period 1971-2000. The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between Adjusted net saving and aggregate welfare but weak in magnitude. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methodologies include scenario workshops, future searches and community visioning. This paper looks critically at the assumptions of deliberative visioning benefiting from a case study in Greece. We argue that there are fundamental choices to be made concerning how to frame the process, who to invite and how to facilitate it. These are not just a matter of following manuals' good practice guidance. We emphasize the need for epistemological and methodological awareness of: the assumptions which frame DV itself, the assumptions of the users of DV; and the situation in which DV is deployed. We find that whereas visioning motivates participants to work together and provides a good framework to systematize discussion, it is not necessarily effective for developing systemic perspectives and plan actions. This is especially true in contexts such as that of our case study, where there is lack of a collaborative culture and there are insufficient mechanisms that integrate effectively a deliberative process with other processes of policy or social change.

Expenditure elasticities are examined with regression analysis, and are compared and interpreted on the basis of insight at the product level. With data from the Netherlands in the year 2000, we find that environmental impact increases with increasing household expenditures, although the degree to which the environmental impact increases differs per impact category. Climate change and eutrophication increase less than proportionally with increasing expenditures. Acidification increases nearly proportionally with increasing expenditures, whereas smog formation increases more than proportionally. it appears that the mix of necessities and luxuries to which an environmental impact is related is essential in explaining the relationship.

In Tocantins where the new crop management system advanced faster, integrated production has reached commercial level: 150 hectares in 2007, cultivated by 15 pineapple growers in 11 municipalities. Evaluation of economic and environmental impacts was performed according to the Ambitec-Agro System, composed by a pool of indicators and components related to technology efficiency, environmental preservation and recovery. Eight growers were surveyed, all of them at the same integrated production level, as well as three experts that work on the project. In the conventional production system pesticides are applied in a preventive way, usually there are nine insecticide and six fungicide applications during the crop cycle. In the integrated production system, the decision to spray pesticide is based on the monitoring of pests and diseases. In addition to promoting the use of less toxic pesticides, the practice of integrated pineapple production has reduced the amount and the number of pesticide applications, resulting in lower production costs in comparison with the conventional system. Reductions in pesticide use were as follows: herbicides, 47%, insecticides, 37% and fungicides, 20%. The use of herbicide decreased from four pre-emergence applications to two post-emergence applications during the crop cycle. The positive effect of the integrated pineapple production on the environment was due to the improvement on soil quality and reduction of pesticides applications, resulting in an index equal to 2.34, on a scale ranging from -15 to +15.","[de Almeida, C.

In Brazil, the main producing states of pineapple are Para, Paraiba, Minas Gerais and Bahia. For many years Paraiba was the largest producer, but the lack of incentives, taxes and other factors contributed to its drop in the national ranking from 1996 to 1998. However from 2005, Paraiba came back to dispute the leadership of the national ranking producing more than 300 million fruits a year. In spite of that, the producers, mainly the small ones, face many problems that limit the activity. Hence a survey on its status is of basic importance for planning of the activities and for the public politics directed to the pineapple crop. This work had as objective to determine the forms of commercialization and the level of organization of pineapple producers. Data were collected in six municipalities, totaling 60 small and large-scale producers. It was observed that the majority of the producers is dependent on the action of middlemen in the commercialization process. The sales carried out through the stock market of agricultural commercialization of Pernambuco State has provided greater profitability and security in the negotiation for the pineapple producers. The region of Santa Rita presents the most developed organizational level of pineapple growers, mostly in cooperatives, who have contributed to the expansion of the pineapple crop in Paraiba. It was also observed that 50% of pineapple growers do not systematically plan their production costs and revenues estimated for a pineapple crop cycle.","[de Brito Neto, J. F.; Pereira, W.

Findings - Chemical analysis showed that PROW contained 2.71 per cent moisture, 22.95 per cent protein, 5.86 per cent fat, 3.75 per cent fibre, 62.39 per cent carbohydrate, 4.31 per cent ash and 3.75 kcal of energy, while PROP had 2.78 per cent moisture, 21.99 per cent protein, 8.86 per cent fat, 3.89 per cent fibre, 59.29 per cent carbohydrate, 4.77 per cent per cent ash and 3.78kcal of energy. The sensory evaluation showed that both PROW and PROP were equally acceptable as NUTR and more acceptable than YOG in terms of taste, flavour and texture (p < 0.05). However, there was no significance difference (p > 0.05) in acceptability of PROW, PROP, NUTR and YOG in terms of colour. Originality/value - The paper shows that the two weaning foods would be suitable for the commercial market to increase the protein intake and to combat protein energy malnutrition (PEM) amongst infants.","[Omueti, Olusola; Ajomale, Kayode; Afolabi, Olukayode] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Inst Agr Res & Training, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Jaiyeola, Olayinka] Cocoa Res Inst Nigeria, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Otegbayo, Bolanle] Bowen Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Iwo, Nigeria","Institute for Agricultural Research, Samaru, Zaria; Obafemi Awolowo University","Omueti, O (通讯作者)，Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Inst Agr Res & Training, Ibadan, Nigeria.",solaomueti@yahoo.com,"Otegbayo, Bolanle/GQA-9564-2022","Otegbayo, Bolanle/0000-0002-8672-1479",,,,,28,3,3,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The process and the parameters that were considered in the construction of the first unit are described and the first results of the tests made on different crops are presented. This shredder, which is designed to be connected to the front three point linkage hitch of the tractor, has four vertical rotating axles on which swinging knives are arranged on parallel planes. The machine can process two double rows at a time at a speed of 1 to 1.5 m.s(-1) with an overall power requirement of 100-120 kW. At this stage the work has focused mainly on the structure of the machine, on its kinematics and on the coupling to the tractor. The main problem was determining how to process the base of the stump without damaging the shredding blades and in allowing the chopped mass to flow freely out of the system thus assuring a safe working environment for tractor drivers and other field workers. This innovative approach to pineapple plant shredding reduces the energy requirement when compared to horizontal-axle flail mowers, processes more area per unit time and produces smaller and more homogeneous particles.","[Pegna, F.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the history of the Finnish school catering system and free school meals. It also briefly analyses theoretical approaches to school meals and introduces a plate model based on national nutritional recommendations. The empirical data were collected in 2003 by the second author of this paper. In total, 3,041 pupils returned the questionnaire from ten comprehensive schools. Data from the pupils' school meal choices were analysed using one-way ANOVA and F-tests. Findings - The findings indicate that there were significant differences in the chosen school meals between boys and girls, between classes, and between schools. Thus, the plate model has not been followed when choosing the free school meals. Practical implications - This paper has, for example, the following implication: school meals should not be considered with respect to food only, but should be viewed from a broader perspective, namely that of pupils' needs and wants. Originality/value - School meals have previously been studied with multiple theoretical approaches. The authors believe that the broader focus on pupils and their socio-ecological environment will further increase understanding of their food choices in Finland.","[Tikkanen, Irma] Univ Kuopio, Dept Business & Management, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Tikkanen, Irma] Helsinki Polytech Stadia, Helsinki, Finland; [Urho, Ulla-Marja] Dairy Nutr Council, Helsinki, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Tikkanen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kuopio, Dept Business & Management, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",irma.tikkanen@taloverkot.fi,,,,,,,65,25,26,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

'Perola'' pineapple fruits were submitted to MP, including dipping into suspensions of edible coatings with cassava starch containing gelatin or sorbitol. Fruits were stored in a cold room at 7 degrees C for eight days and analyzed every two days in relation to firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), ratio TSS/TTA, vitamin C, contents of total and reducing sugars and peroxidase activity. The experimental design was a completely randomized one with three replications. Better results were obtained for green-ripe pineapples treated with antioxidant agent or an edible coating containing cassava starch, as they kept characteristics of fresh fruits during the entire period of storage. The majority of changes observed along the storage period of the fruits could be attributed to differences in their maturation stages and not to the treatments evaluated.","[Viana, E. S.; Amorim, T.

The results of a group deliberation technique (deliberative monetary valuation) are compared to those derived from a contingent valuation (CV) survey using the same environmental topic. Evidence is here presented that DMV can address some of the limitations of CV; namely a prevalence for lexicographic preference ordering due to psychological reasons and the lack of a priori or well-formed preferences. Both of these methodological shortcomings can result in protest responses which decrease the external validity of results. It is common environmental valuation methodology practice to exclude protest responses from the analysis on the grounds that they are illegitimate choices, thus the sample and consequently the environmental valuation analysis may become less representative of the population. An advantage of the DMV methodology is that it was found to significantly reduce the rate of protest responses to less than half (from 29% to 13%). Furthermore, DMV significantly increased the proportion of positive bids but not the amounts contributed. In relation to preference formation issues, we suggest rethinking the current practice of the DMV method, and propose dedicating the entire initial discussion session to introducing the good outside of a valuation context.

One is to work in the usual preference space in which the random utility model is expressed in terms of partworths. These partworths or utility coefficients are estimated together with their distribution. The WTP and the corresponding heterogeneity distribution of WTP is derived from these results. The other approach reformulates the utility in terms of WTP (called WTP-space) and estimates the WTP and the heterogeneity distribution of WTP directly. Though often used, working in preference space has severe drawbacks as it often leads to WTP-distributions with long flat tails, infinite moments and therefore many extreme values. By moving to WTP-space, authors have tried to improve the estimation of WTP and its distribution from a modeling perspective. In this paper we will further improve the estimation of individual level WTP and corresponding heterogeneity distribution by designing the choice sets more efficiently. We will generate individual sequential choice designs in WTP space. The use of this sequential approach is motivated by findings of Yu et al. (2011) who show that this approach allows for superior estimation of the utility coefficients and their distribution. The key feature of this approach is that it uses Bayesian methods to generate individually optimized choice sets sequentially based on prior information of each individual which is further updated after each choice made. Based on a simulation study in which we compare the efficiency of this sequential design procedure with several non-sequential choice designs, we can conclude that the sequential approach improves the estimation results substantially.","[Danthurebandara, Vishva M.; Yu, Jie; Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Danthurebandara, VM (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",Vishva.Danthurebandara@econ.kuleuven.be; Jie.Yu@econ.kuleuven.be; Martina.Vandebroek@econ.kuleuven.be,"Vandebroek, Martina L./J-9103-2015","Vandebroek, Martina L./0000-0002-0317-1986",,,,,28,7,7,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

A bioeconomic model is developed incorporating an age-structured population dynamics model of wild pink and chum salmon with mortality caused by farm-derived sea lice. Our model incorporates capture fisheries under two management policy scenarios. Results suggest that the ecological and economic effects are minor when the sea lice induced mortality rate is below 20%, while they can be severe if the mortality is greater than 30%. Sea lice have greater ecological and economic impacts on pink salmon than on chum salmon. The impact of farm lice epizootics on wild salmon is greater under a fixed exploitation rate than under a target escapement policy. As a result, a precautionary principle should be adopted, and appropriate management schemes and policy strategies should be developed to minimize these effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

From a purely allocative point of view, transfers supporting mitigation tend to be Pareto-improving whereas this is not very likely in the case of adaptation support. We illustrate this by regarding transfer schemes currently applied under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto framework. However, if we enrich the analysis by integrating distributional aspects, we find that international adaptation funding may help both the developing and developed world. Interestingly this is not due to altruistic incentives, but due to follow-up effects on international negotiations on climate change mitigation. We argue that the lack of fairness perceived by developing countries in the international climate policy arena can be reduced by the support of adaptation in these countries. As we show - taking into account different fairness concepts - this might raise the prospects of success in international negotiations on climate change. Yet, we find that the influence of transfers may induce different fairness effects on climate change mitigation negotiations to run counter. We discuss whether current transfer schemes under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto framework adequately serve the distributive and allocative objectives pursued in international climate policy.

In this paper, we study the effects of gray markets on the profitability of distribution channel members under different channel structures with different parallel importer identities.

However, channel structure is critical in determining both who benefits and the mechanism by which this benefit occurs. In addition, we show whether the parallel importer is a third party or a retailer has significant effects on channel members' profits.

Smart cities are often centers of higher education, so students moving to pursue higher education may play an important role. I find that the greater in-migration to smart cities is mostly due to persons enrolled in higher education. Smart cities are growing in part because in-migrants often stay in the city after completing their education. The growth of smart cities is also mostly attributable to population redistribution within the same state and has little effect on population growth at the state level.","Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University Montgomery,"Winters, JV (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, POB 244023, Montgomery, AL 36124 USA.",jwinter3@aum.edu,,"Winters, John/0000-0002-0542-1416",,,,,46,205,224,8,228,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We characterize the steady-state equilibrium and show that it is unique. We then consider two policies: decreasing urban unemployment benefits and subsidizing urban employment. We find that decreasing the unemployment benefit in the city creates urban jobs and reduces rural-urban migration since new migrants have to spend some time unemployed before they can find a job in the city. On the other hand, raising employment subsidies increases urban employment but may also increase urban unemployment because it triggers more rural-urban migration. In this respect, the employment subsidy policy can backfire by raising rather than reducing urban unemployment.","[Zenou, Yves] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Zenou, Y (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",yves.zenou@ne.su.se,,"Zenou, Yves/0000-0001-6516-0812",,,,,30,11,15,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Results are not consistent because of crude and various exposure evaluation but suggest that adverse effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on preterm birth may occur. The purpose of this study was to assess individual maternal exposure during pregnancy to NO2 using dispersion modelling and to analyse the links between NO2 exposure and preterm birth risk. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 4,161 pregnant women in Kaunas (Lithuania). Case group consisted of 167 preterm births (< 37 weeks), while controls were 2846 term (>= 37 weeks) singleton newborns. Individual exposure to NO2 was assigned to each subject during the entire pregnancy by using a dispersion air quality modelling system Airviro. To assess the association between preterm birth and exposure to NO2 logistic regression analysis was used and odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated. NO2 exposure tended to be associated with increase in risk of preterm birth after adjustment for the main possible confounders. Adjusted odds ratios for preterm birth for entire pregnancy exposed to third versus first tertile NO2 was found to be 1.44, 95 % CI 0.98-2.11. The risk of preterm birth increased by 22 % (adjusted OR = 1.22, 95 % CI 0.94-1.56) per 10 mu g m(-3) increase in NO2 concentrations.

Design/methodology/approach - A representative survey of the Danish population (n = 1,104) was conducted during September 2007. The survey included dimensions of assessment of decontamination techniques and background variables of socio-economic status, food culture and safety profile. The data were analysed using latent class analyses, and subsequently the association of the predicted classes and background variables was analysed using bivariate analyses. Findings - The analysis shows that in general members of the public do not agree with the practice of decontamination. There was, however, some variation in public rejection of the techniques. Four latent classes were identified: rejects decontamination (57 per cent), accepts decontamination (4 per cent), accepts techniques that are familiar in meat production (18 per cent), and accepts techniques known from processed foods (21 per cent).

While analyzing the temperature in decades, it is found that it has been constantly increasing during spring, and in the past decade (2000-2009) was 1,13 degrees C higher, compared to the average temperature of 1970-2009. Following the data of four decades, drainage runoff is the highest in spring and the lowest - in summer. While examining the impact of meteorological conditions on dynamics of drainage runoff in the presence of changing climatic conditions, it is determined that the relationship between drainage runoff and precipitation during different seasons was weak (spring and summer) and the average one during winter and autumn. The analysis of relation between drainage runoff and average air temperature during different seasons revealed the average relation during winter and very weak relation during other seasons.","[Miseckaite, Otilija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Zhaliazko, Vladimir Iocifovich] Belarus State Acad Agr, Horki, BELARUS",Vytautas Magnus University,"Miseckaite, O (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Otilija.Miseckaite@asu.lt; Zhaliazka@mail.ru,"Miseckaite, Otilija/K-3983-2015",,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,314,319,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500056,0

The principal specific purpose of the use of a land parcel (defined in the Immovable Property Register) will determine the type of the territorial planning document. Analysis revealed the main problems: the long time of the coordination of the issuing of planning conditions and the prepared territorial planning documents (projects), intentional and unintended violations over the issuing, coordination and inspection of planning conditions, the shortage of publicity when preparing projects and the shortage of the control over the planning process.

Design/methodology/approach - The effect of frying (shallow and deep frying) on RS was studied in pressure-cooked potato and sweet potato. The baking conditions used for white wheat bread were 200 degrees C-35 min, 150 degrees C-12 h, and 120 degrees C-20 h. To study the effect of baking time at a specific temperature (200 degrees C), the bread was baked for 15, 25,35 and 45 mm. The bread baked for 25 mm at 200 degrees C was stored at ambient conditions for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Tubers were stored at 4 and 25 degrees C for 12 h and 24 h at each temperature. Findings - Frying resulted in a reduction of 28.0 and 32.0 percent in RS content of potato and sweet potato respectively, with deep-frying showing a more pronounced effect. The RS content of bread baked for 24 h at 120 degrees C was found to be higher (4.20 percent) than that of bread baked at a higher temperature of 200 degrees C and 150 degrees C for 35 min and 12 h respectively. Increase in baking time from 15 to 45 min at 200 degrees C also increased the RS content of bread from 2.13 percent to 3.18 percent. Storage resulted in an increase in the RS content of bread and tubers. Refrigeration storage had a more pronounced effect on the RS content of pressure-cooked tubers. Originality/value - This information on poor man's foods can be exploited to process and store the foods targeted to be used by the special category of persons, as varied processing conditions for these foods can be employed producing lower or higher RS content desirable for undernourished or diabetic persons respectively.","Chaudhary Devi Lal Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sirsa, India",Chaudhary Devi Lal University,"Yadav, BS (通讯作者)，Chaudhary Devi Lal Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sirsa, India.",baljeet.y@rediffmail.com,"Yadav, Ritika B/IAR-9693-2023","Yadav, Ritika B/0000-0002-9704-6309; Yadav, Baljeet/0000-0003-1503-3473",,,,,28,34,38,3,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper analyzes change of organic matter in the Nevezis, which is under influence of agricultural activity, in comparison with that in the Skroblus, which has natural background. In the period of 1986-2009 the established amount of organic matter in the Nevezis exceeded that in the Skroblus by up to 2.8 times. Water of the Nevezis was of good (11 years, i.e. 11 times), that of the Skroblus - of very good (13 times) ecological condition. Three periods of organic matter fluctuation were determined in the Nevezis: 1986-1991, 1992-2002 and 2003-2009. Fluctuation of organic matter was more related with changes of production intensity than with air or water temperature. Analysis of research results for the period of 1986-2009 according to Mann-Kendall test has detected different tendencies of change. In the Nevezis basin air and water temperature insignificantly increased, but organic matter decreased. In the Nevezis the highest concentration of organic matters was in 1988 (BOD7 = 5.66 mg O-2/L), later it was significantly decreasing until 1994, and increased again starting in 1995; however, content of these matter did not exceed the amounts established at the beginning of the research. In the Skroblus basin air temperature insignificantly increased, water temperature decreased, organic matter significantly decreased.","[Zibiene, Grazina] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Hydraul Engn, LV-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Rudzianskaite, Aurelija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Water Res Inst, Water Protect Dept, LV-58102 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Zibas, Alvydas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Invest & Dev, LV-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Zibiene, G (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Hydraul Engn, LV-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania.",grazina.zibiene@asu.lt; aurelija.rudzianskaite@asu.lt; alvydas.zibas@asu.lt,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,365,370,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500065,0

Adaptiveness refers to the capacity of a social actor or social-ecological system to adapt in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in the environment. We explore arguments both from a theoretical perspective and through illustrations from case studies of water management in the Alps of Europe and Mekong in southeast Asia. We propose and illustrate that social learning processes are important for building adaptiveness in several ways and at different scales. Social learning can help cope with informational uncertainty; reduce normative uncertainty; build consensus on criteria for monitoring and evaluation; empower stakeholders to take adaptive actions; reduce conflicts and identify synergies between adaptations; and improve fairness of decisions and actions. Findings in the case studies provide some support for these generalizations but often with caveats related to diversity of stakeholder interests, levels of shared understanding versus contested knowledge and scale of coordination.

We provide a conceptual framework for the evolution of productivity and efficiency measures and link this evolution to the issue of factor abundance taking into account specific transition characteristics. We document the changes in agricultural performance using empirical data on the evolution of partial productivity and total factor productivity estimates and we illustrate how productivity varies between countries at various stages of the transition process. Over the past twenty years, virtually all transition countries witnessed an initial decline in productivity, and virtually all countries currently witness an increase in productivity. However, the depth and length of the initial decline differs enormously between countries. Our analysis indicates that the productivity changes were related to the extent of the pre-reform distortions, initial resource endowments and technology use, and the reform implementation in the countries.","[Swinnen, Johan F.

Unlike most other goods and services, it is neither rival (use by one prevents use by others) nor non-rival (use by one does not affect use by others), but is enhanced with increased use, or 'additive'. Therefore a unique allocation system for both the production and consumption of information is needed. Under the current market-based allocation system, production of information is often limited through the exclusive rights produced by patents and copyrights. This limits scientists' ability to share and build on each other's knowledge. We break the problem down into three separate questions: (1) do markets generate the type of information most important for modern society? (2) are markets the most appropriate institution for producing that information? and (3) once information is produced, are markets the most effective way of maximizing the social value of that information? We conclude that systematic market failures make it unlikely that markets will generate the most important types of information, while the unique characteristics of information reduce the cost-effectiveness of markets in generating information and in maximizing its social value. We then discuss alternative methods that do not have these shortcomings, and that would lead to greater overall economic efficiency, social justice and ecological sustainability. These methods include monetary prizes, publicly funded research from which the produced information is released into the public domain, and status driven incentive structures like those in academia and the open-source community.

We devote special emphasis to institutional and political economy issues, which have been somewhat neglected in the literature on PES. We argue that the Coasean and pure market approach dominating the conceptualization of PES in the literature cannot be easily generalized and implemented in practice. By contrast, taking into account complexities related to uncertainty, distributional issues, social embeddedness, and power relations permits acknowledging the variety of contexts and institutional settings in which PES operate. The alternative approach presented in this introductory article to the special section may be more appealing to PES practitioners, since while avoiding restrictive and prescriptive standpoints, it allows some key sources of complexities they usually deal with on the ground to be more easily understood.

We analyse the conditions under which a FUND-like international compensation scheme is self-enforcing. We then discuss the overall impact of a self-enforcing international compensation regime in terms of accidental oil pollution prevention. We show in particular that the deterrent effect of such a compensation regime is a negative function of (i) the number of countries at stake in the field of oil pollution and (ii) the level of financial caps limiting the compensation for damage.","Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Ctr Droit & Econ Mer, F-29238 Brest 3, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Hay, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Ctr Droit & Econ Mer, 12 Rue Kergoat,CS 93837, F-29238 Brest 3, France.",julien.hay@univ-brest.fr,,,,,,,24,3,4,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This correlation is particularly strong in cities with higher levels of skill and virtually nonexistent in less skilled metropolitan areas. This fact is particularly compatible with the view that urban density is important because proximity spreads knowledge, which either makes workers more skilled or entrepreneurs more productive.

Efficiency and productivity measurement in such a setting can be seriously and systematically biased by the manner in which the stochastic technology is represented. For example, conventional production frontiers implicitly impose the restriction that information differences have no effect on the way risk-neutral decision makers utilize the same input bundle. The result is that rational and efficient ex ante production choices can be mistakenly characterized as inefficient-informational differences are mistaken for differences in technical efficiency. This paper uses simulation methods to illustrate the type and magnitude of empirical errors that can emerge in efficiency analysis as a result of overly restrictive representations of production technologies.","[Chambers, Robert G.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [O'Donnell, Christopher J.; Quiggin, John] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Queensland,"Chambers, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",c.odonnell1@uq.edu.au; rchambers@arec.umd.edu; j.quiggin@uq.edu.au,"Quiggin, John/C-1621-2013","Quiggin, John/0000-0003-0398-8280; O'DONNELL, Christopher/0000-0002-0107-7371",,,,,24,54,58,2,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the sequestration costs of agroforestry afforestation and reforestation projects (ARPs) following a partial market equilibrium using average cost curves and economic break even analysis to identify the supply costs. The modelling done in this work contrasts the voluntary and clean development mechanism transaction costs. Data is based on the voluntary project, Scolel Te, being implemented in Mexico. Cost curves are developed for seven different sequestration options considering transaction and implementation costs; information from agricultural production in Chiapas Mexico is used to integrate opportunity costs of two agroforestry practices suggesting that sequestration costs may follow a U shape, with an initial reduction due to economies of scale and a subsequent increase caused by high opportunity costs. The widespread implementation of agroforestry options not requiring complete land conversion (e.g. living fences and coffee under shade) might be cost effective strategies not generating high opportunity costs. Results also suggest that payments in the early years of the project and lower transaction costs favour the development of ARPs in the voluntary market especially in marginal rural areas with high discount rates.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consisted in a survey of 420 Madrid (Spain) cheese consumers during the month of December 2006, whose preferences were determined through several multivariate techniques. Findings - The first result derived from this paper is the negative influence of the organic production system attribute on the cheese consumer. preference structure. Therefore, this attribute becomes an inadequate differentiation strategy for cheese, while origin is the most adequate differentiation. In this sense, three consumer segments are identified: the first, shops for cheese mainly by type, the second, by a combination of origin, type and price and the third, by an origin of cheese. In this sense, except for the first segment, where competition by a type of cheese from other places could endanger the local market, possible strategies would he to continue emphasizing origin in a traditional approach. Originality/value - The paper highlights organic differentiation in products already differentiated and accepted by the consumer does not always contribute additional utility to the consumer. It does not matter whether this differentiation and acceptance comes from origin and/or traditional production, as is the case of Manchego cheese.","[Bernabeu, Rodolfo; Olmeda, Miguel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Agr, Albacete, Spain; [Diaz, Monica] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Desarrollo Reg, Albacete, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Bernabéu, R (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Agr, Albacete, Spain.",Rodolfo.Bernabeu@uclm.es,,"Diaz Donate, Monica/0000-0002-0957-1876; Bernabeu, Rodolfo/0000-0003-3492-6736",Ministry of Agriculture Committee for Castilla-La Mancha Communities [03-242/IA-43],Ministry of Agriculture Committee for Castilla-La Mancha Communities,The paper lies within the Commercialising and marketing organic food from Castilla-La Mancha (second stage) Research Project 03-242/IA-43 financed by the Ministry of Agriculture Committee for Castilla-La Mancha Communities.,,68,27,27,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

There are several instruments to improve building quality in terms of environmental performance, such as building codes, subsidies, and voluntary building assessment schemes. In this paper, the focus is on mandatory and voluntary building assessment schemes and their role in real estate valuation. Real estate valuation is based on calculation methods and on the assessment of market demand. Therefore, if there is a demand for energy efficient and sustainable buildings on the market, high performance buildings will be better valued than average buildings. Building assessment schemes serve to create awareness for the benefits of high performance buildings, thus increasing the market demand. However, work is also done on further developing real estate valuation calculation methods, in order to identify risks for future valuations that might be connected with, for example, the energy consumption and material properties of the respective building. This paper presents the findings of a project on further developing real estate valuation methods by taking environmental performance into account. It describes the voluntary building assessment schemes and the mandatory energy certification scheme applied in Austria, and then puts focus on the guideline for appraisers developed in the project.

Most of the earth's fertile land is used more or less intensively by humans for resource extraction, production, transport, consumption and waste deposition or as living space. Biomass production on cropland, grazing areas and in managed forests dominates area requirements, but other processes such as soil degradation, human-induced fires and expansion of settlements and infrastructure play an increasingly important role as well. The growing human domination of terrestrial ecosystems contributes to biodiversity loss as well as to a reduced capability of ecosystems to deliver vital services such as buffering capacity. soil conservation or self-regulation. This special section is devoted to the presentation of recent research into the patterns, determinants and implications of the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), an integrated socio-ecological indicator of land use intensity. By measuring the combined effect of land conversion and biomass harvest on the availability of trophic energy (biomass) in ecosystems, HANPP explicitly links natural with socioeconomic processes and allows for integrated analyses of land systems. This introductory article explains the rationale that links current HANPP research to Ecological Economics and discusses issues of definition and methods shared by all articles included in the special section. Finally. it gives an overview of the individual papers, provides some general conclusions and presents an outlook for future research: a better understanding of long-term trajectories of HANPP, of the significance of trade patterns as well as of the future role of bioenergy are highlighted as important issues to be addressed in the coming years.

An appreciation of such behaviors requires rigorous statistical methods, recognizing spatial effects and dynamic processes. This study develops a dynamic spatial-ordered probit (DSOP) model in order to capture patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in ordered categorical response data. This model is estimated in a Bayesian framework using Gibbs sampling and data augmentation, in order to generate all autocorrelated latent variables. It incorporates spatial effects in an ordered probit model by allowing for interregional spatial interactions and heteroskedasticity, along with random effects across regions or any clusters of observational units. The model assumes an autoregressive, AR(1), process across latent response values, thereby recognizing time-series dynamics in panel data sets. The model code and estimation approach is tested on simulated data sets, in order to reproduce known parameter values and provide insights into estimation performance, yielding much more accurate estimates than standard, nonspatial techniques. The proposed and tested DSOP model is felt to be a significant contribution to the field of spatial econometrics, where binary applications (for discrete response data) have been seen as the cutting edge. The Bayesian framework and Gibbs sampling techniques used here permit such complexity, in world of two-dimensional autocorrelation.","[Wang, Xiaokun] Bucknell Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA; [Kockelman, Kara M.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Bucknell University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Wang, XK (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",cara.wang@bucknell.edu; kkockelm@mail.utexas.edu,"Kockelman, Kara/ABF-7223-2021; WANG, XIAOKUN/GQR-1904-2022","Wang, Xiaokun/0000-0001-5819-0212",,,,,55,21,23,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Such conflicts - the focus of the article - have been neglected by ecological economists although there is a proliferation of related reports by environmental non-governmental organizations. This paper uses empirical evidence to show how elements of political ecology and ecological economics can be combined for understanding the languages of valuation deployed in tree plantation conflicts in Southern countries. Combining qualitative fieldwork on a Cameroonian rubber plantation and an Ecuadorian eucalypt plantation with a methodological framework taken from the study of social metabolism, we find that both conflicts (although with different emphasis) arise because of land and biomass appropriation, ground clearing, pollution from agrochemicals, and water shortage and are expressed as conflicts on valuation. The metabolism of such tree plantations, through the exchanges of materials with the local environment, explains the bio-physical basis of such conflicts. In the Cameroon case, resistance is mainly sporadic and individual, while in Ecuador, a grassroots organization has been able to respond to rural demands in a structured way. Both patterns of resistance are found in other present-day resource extraction conflicts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We take Ukrainian regions as a subject of investigation, yet the same toolkit can be applied to test disputable differences in productivity for many other countries where such questions can be of national concern (e.g., Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, etc.). Contrary to common perception of economists focusing on Ukraine, we find no significant differences in distributions and aggregate efficiencies between the agricultural and industrial regions, neither between western (mostly Ukrainian speaking) and eastern (mostly Russian speaking) regions of Ukraine. However, we find strong support for a rapidly increasing gap between the capital (Kyiv) and all the regions since 2001. Using truncated regression analysis with bootstrap we also find robust evidence that the inefficiency of regions is positively related to alcohol and tobacco consumption, the amount of foreign direct investment and inversely related to criminality in the region. On the other hand, we also find strong evidence that amount of capital in the region and its wealth is positively associated with efficiency level of this region.","[Zelenyuk, Valentin] Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Zelenyuk, Valentin] Kyiv Econ Inst, Kiev, Ukraine; [Demchuk, Pavlo] Rice Univ, Houston, TX USA",Kyiv School of Economics; Kyiv School of Economics; Rice University,"Zelenyuk, V (通讯作者)，Kyiv Sch Econ, Kiev, Ukraine.",pdemchuk@rice.edu; vzelenyuk@eerc.kiev.ua,"Zelenyuk, Valentin/L-3687-2019",,,,,,37,13,15,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The maximization of worst-case outcomes according to the maximin decision rule, based on the two parameters mean and variance of a financial indicator, is a prominent approach to integrate uncertainty in decision-making. In forestry, the problem of selecting the optimum tree species combination for a forest plantation investment can be seen as a problem of optimal portfolio selection, to be solved according to the maximin decision rule. Yet. it is well known that portfolios computed from expected means and variances are highly sensitive to changes in the estimated parameters. The financial results may be poor if we rely too much on the historical data. This paper tests an extended worst-case model that considers a lower bound for the expected mean net present value (NPV) of a tree species portfolio and an upper bound for its variance. Biased expected mean NPVs, variances and correlations for the tree species Picea abies [L.] Karst. (Spruce) and Fagus sylvatica L. (Beech) were used to test the variability of the resulting tree species portfolios (27 scenarios). A comprehensive simulated data set, which was adopted from an existing study and defined as the independent reference, served to evaluate the financial performance of the tree species portfolios obtained from optimization with the biased data. Compared with the results of classical worst-case optimization instances. it was feasible to reduce the variability of tree species shares effectively when the optimization was carried out with the extended worst-case approach. Furthermore, the financial performance of this approach was better when tested with the independent data. The worst-case forest NPVs achieved with the extended approach were on average 10% (statistical confidence 0.95) or 147% (statistical confidence 0.99) greater in comparison to the results of the classical approach. The influence of the uncertainty parameter selection was tested and the results were discussed against the controversial viewpoints on the usefulness of the information-gap decision theory. Finally, the significance of our results for sustainable ecosystem management is pointed out. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using the case of the forest rich Swat district, Pakistan, the paper addresses the issue empirically, historically, and institutionally. We do not find empirical support for the poverty-environment nexus, in that the poor and other income groups are equally resource dependent and also show that resource degradation is not associated with poverty. Our historical and institutional analyses provide alternative explanations for resource degradation. Selective and rotating ownership patterns, starting with the 17th century, provided limited incentive for resource conservation. It also created tension between de jure and de facto owners, that has persisted, and is one source of forest degradation. Ill-defined resource rights have also exacerbated the impacts of several other factors contributing to forest degradation which is compounded by poor management, corruption, and perverse incentives.

Therefore, the government of China can purse conservative energy policy and carbon emissions reduction policy in the long run without impeding economic growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Within the last 5 years several non-legally binding initiatives have emerged, including (i) the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate and various other public-private partnerships working on the policy implementation level and (ii) the Group of Eight Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development, and Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change as high-level political processes. As a first step toward analyzing the relationship between these parallel initiatives and the UN climate regime, this article looks at the negotiations of four UN-hosted climate meetings in 2007-2008, providing an examination of the interaction of 'soft law' climate initiatives and the 'hard law' UNFCCC/Kyoto Protocol process. The methodology of the study is based on participatory observations in the negotiations and document analysis of country and stakeholder positions. The analysis shows that the current multitude of processes in global climate governance entails potential institutional interaction. Deliberations of the key actors give some support to the claims of non-UN soft law being used to exert influence on the negotiations on a future climate regime within the UN context.","Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Helsinki 00130, Finland",University of Turku,"Vihma, A (通讯作者)，Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Korkeavuorenkatu 25 A 2, Helsinki 00130, Finland.",antto.vihma@tse.fi,,,,,,,23,16,18,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A low environmental impact of milk production is not necessarily associated with an economically viable farm. To gain insight into a possible trade-off between economic and environmental sustainability, the relation between the environmental and economic indicators of dairy farms was quantified, and farm characteristics that influence this relation were identified. Economic and environmental indicators were quantified for 119 specialized dairy farms in 2005, based on data from the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Economic indicators used were: gross value added expressed per kg fat-and-protein-corrected milk (FPCM) or expressed per unit of labour, i.e. labour productivity. Environmental indicators used were: land use per kg FPCM, energy use per kg FPCM, global warming potential per kg FPCM, eutrophication and acidification potential per kg FPCM or per ha of land. Environmental indicators were deduced from a life cycle assessment. High labour productivity on dairy farms was associated with low on-farm energy use, total and on-farm land use, total and on-farm global warming potential, and total and off-farm acidification potential per kg FPCM. High labour productivity, however. was associated also with high on-farm eutrophication and acidification potential per hectare. From partial least squares regression analysis, it was concluded that relations between economic and environmental indicators were affected mainly by milk production per ha, annual milk production per cow, farm size, and amount of concentrates per kg FPCM. An increase in annual milk production per cow. for example, not only increased labour productivity, reduced energy use and global warming potential per kg FPCM but also, in the case of an unchanged stocking density, increased eutrophication and acidification per ha. To be economically and environmentally sustainable, animal production in the Netherlands, therefore, should focus on high animal productivity, i.e. high annual milk production per cow and efficient use of feed per kg milk, and moderate stocking density, provided that a good animal welfare standard is guaranteed.

The two main approaches to prevent environmental degradation are technological improvement and economic degrowth. How do we establish the sustainability of technological options? LCA-type analysis of the technology system, combined with economic cost analysis, offers a first integrated eco-efficiency score. However, such a technology analysis focuses on micro-level technology relations only, is usually too optimistic and ignores other constraints implied in a choice. Fitting more comprehensive knowledge into the sustainability evaluation of options requires a unifying systematic framework, which is worked out in the present paper as a ten-step procedure. The integrative framework for empirical analysis is ultimately a comparative-static systems analysis at macro-level, not in a deterministic dynamic mode, which is impossible, but as a knowledge-fed scenario analysis. The analysis shows the change in society's overall eco-efficiency, combining total value creation with total environmental impacts. Possible domains of application include not only technology choices like those in eco-innovation, including changed consumption styles and volumes, but also changes in policies regarding technologies and markets, whether direct policy shifts or indirect changes through institutional adaptations. Ultimately, such a framework also allows culturally framed questions about the type of society we would like to live in. to be analysed in terms of their economic and environmental consequences.

In this paper we develop this analysis to the study of the CO2 emissions associated to the group of branches of the service sector. The decomposition of the total production of the services subsystem allows us to decompose the CO2 emissions into five different components (own, demand volume, feed-back, internal and spill over components). From the results obtained, we can highlight the different roles played by the different branches of services. Transport activities are the services with the highest level of the direct emissions generated in the production of the sector. These activities are required by the other sectors of the economy to a greater degree than they are for their own final demand. Therefore, the production sold to other sectors causes more emissions than its own final demand. However, in the case of other service activities, direct and indirect emissions related to final demand are much more important, due to the strong pull effect of service activities on other activities of the economy. In this respect, Wholesale and retail trade, Hotels and restaurants, Real estate, renting and business activities, and Public administration services should be highlighted. These services receive scarce attention in the design of policies aimed at reducing emissions, but are notably responsible for the major increase in emissions experienced in recent years.

This paper reports on a research project that aimed at identifying these possible relationships and establishing the areas of convergence. This study employed an inductive qualitative approach based on a single case study of a successful software (SW) development company in Taiwan. The company was selected as it is already explicitly using ERM as a component of their KS practices. Overall twenty-one participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview script. The findings of the study show that this is a particularly successful use of ERM and that its integration within KS facilitates internal communication and sharing of experiences. It was found that ERM is particularly useful in the process of externalization and codification of tacit knowledge and in the sharing and storing of this type of knowledge.","[Chen, Hui; Nunes, Miguel Baptista; Zhou, Lihong] Univ Sheffield, Dept Informat Studies, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,,lip07hc@sheffield.ac.uk; j.m.nunes@sheffield.ac.uk; l.zhou@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,5,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-2-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,222,231,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BKK53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268388300029,0

Two effects emerge. First, by increasing political accountability, such policies encourage democratic governments to invest in good institutions - the incentive effect. However, such developmental policies also increase the incentive of the rentier elite to tighten their grip on political institutions. In some cases, this latter political control effect can outweigh the former incentive effect, and result in an overall deterioration of institutional quality. However, it may also indirectly encourage the elite to modernize. Taking this possibility into account, the framework has the potential to explain a diverse set of possibilites as a result of developmental policy.","[Majumdar, Sumon] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Mukand, Sharun] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Mukand, Sharun] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Queens University - Canada; University of Warwick; Tufts University,"Majumdar, S (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",sumon@econ.queensu.ca; sharun.mukand@tufts.edu,"Mukand, Sharun W/D-3588-2012",,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank seminar participants at Queens University, Carleton University, and at the 2007 ISI Delhi conference on Comparative Development for useful comments.

We first build a simple analytical model that demonstrates how countries that face a low hazard of disasters are likely to see first increasing losses and then decreasing ones with increasing economic development. At the same time, countries that face a high hazard of disasters are likely to experience first decreasing losses and then increasing ones with increasing economic development. We then use a cross-country panel dataset in conjunction with a hazard exposure index to investigate whether the data is consistent with the predictions from the model. In line with our model, we find that the relationship of losses with wealth crucially depends on the level of hazard of natural disasters faced by countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that the FEVD improves the estimates with respect to the traditional panel data estimators. The GDP per capita and the unemployment rate appear to be the key determinants whose changes push migrants out from their regions and direct them to better off destinations. Migrants leaving the regions in the Center-North respond differently to the push and pull forces compared to southern migrants.

Three important results based on our empirical studies are obtained. First, a firm with a higher PB generally has less technical efficiency. Second, for an ex-post bankrupt firm, its PB tends to increase and its technical efficiency of production tends to decrease, as the time to its bankruptcy draws near. Finally, the information content about firm's technical inefficiency provided by PB based on DHM is significantly more than that based on Merton model. By the last result and the fact that economic-based efficiency measures are reasonable indicators of the long-term health and prospects of firms (Baek and Pagan in Q J Bus Econ 41:27-41, 2002), we conclude that PB based on DHM is a better credit risk proxy of firms.","[Hwang, Ruey-Ching] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, Hualien 974, Taiwan; [Siao, Jhao-Siang; Chu, C.

In this paper we analyze negotiations for new cars, a $340 billion industry in the United States in 2010. Our results suggest that search costs, incomplete information, and bargaining disutility have an economically significant effect in real-world negotiations: we estimate that relative to an uninformed consumer, a consumer with basic information about the seller's reservation price and his own outside options captures 15% of the average dealer margin from selling an automobile.

Finally, our results show that while search is common, there remains a substantial group of consumers who do not engage in any of the search behaviors we measure.

We have obtained an inverted U-shape trend in manufacturing specialisation which is similar to that in the USA. Using a model that nests factor endowments and increasing returns, we find that both the latter influence manufacturing location, albeit with variations over time, factor endowments being the most decisive. Manufacturing industries intensive in agricultural and mining inputs are located near regions with these factor endowments, while human capital location gained importance from 1965 onwards. Being located near the market was also significant for some industries. The inverted U-shape observed in manufacturing specialisation is due to the fact that the importance of immobile factors increased regional specialisation. However, when mobile factors increased, as was the case with skilled labour, and when this factor converged across regions, specialisation decreased. The fact that the importance of central markets diminishing also contributed to this trend.","Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Betran, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain.",mcbetran@uv.es,"Betran, Concha/AAB-5233-2019","Betran, Concha/0000-0002-5640-1087",,,,,36,8,8,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2011,5.0,3,,,,,259,290,,10.1007/s11698-010-0060-1,0.0,,,32,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,811MW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294216300003,0

This paper documents both the creation of the SOE sector and its privatisation, and analyses the role played by ideology, political interests and economic concerns in the decision to privatise. Whereas ideological factors might have played a significant role in the building of the SOE sector, the privatisation process was driven by economic factors. In the cement sector, the competing private firm was more efficient and the SOEs in other sectors with no private competitors in the island showed permanent losses.","[Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit & Estruct Econ Mundial, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Bel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085",,,,,52,0,1,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

They both have large populations and booming economies hungry for energy. China and India will therefore play a major role in shaping future global emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper assesses emissions reductions targets that can be realistically adopted by China and India in the following rounds of climate negotiations. The analysis is based on a business-as-usual (BaU) scenario and on four carbon tax scenarios until 2050, developed using the WITCH model. Results show that the lowest level of taxation (starting at 10$ per tonne of CO2 in 2020) would reduce emissions in 2050 by 25% in China and by 30% in India, with respect to the BaU, at little cost. The marginal abatement cost curves are, however, steep and a higher level of taxation brings little emissions reductions at high costs. In China, only the two highest tax levels reduce emissions in 2050 below the 2005 level. In India, emissions in 2050 are higher than in 2005 even with the highest tax. Therefore, the pledge of the G8 and the MEF of reducing global emissions by 50% in 2050-with high-income countries cutting them by 80% and low-income ones by 25-30%-appears extremely costly and therefore unrealistic. A more sensible international climate architecture would push for the introduction of a moderate control of emissions in China and India and would avoid overly ambitious targets.","[Massetti, Emanuele] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Massetti, Emanuele] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Massetti, E (通讯作者)，Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, C So Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",emanuele.massetti@feem.it,,,,,,,43,14,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Unfortunately, empirical research into this relationship has been hampered by the lack of identifying information due to the endogeneity of factors affecting both central city and suburban growth. This paper resolves the identification problem by constructing an index that measures price shocks to export industries located in either center cities or their suburbs. The results indicate that positive export industry price shocks to one area have a positive spillover effect on the other. Interestingly, the cross-elasticity of suburban employment with respect to center city employment (1.18) significantly exceeds the cross-elasticity of central city employment with respect to suburban employment (0.24).","US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, Washington, DC 20410 USA",,"Hollar, MK (通讯作者)，US Dept Housing & Urban Dev, 451 7th St SW,Room 8216, Washington, DC 20410 USA.",Michael.K.Hollar@hud.gov,,,,,,,30,9,9,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Previous studies have focused on the temporal analysis of biocapacity at broad geographical scales, but lacked the systematic spatial realization at fine scales. An improvement is proposed of this conventional methodology of the ecological footprint by incorporating land-use data derived from high-resolution remote-sensing images into the calculation of biocapacity supply at regional, provincial and county levels in Northwestern China in 2000. The spatial heterogeneity and its effect on the biocapacity supply were systematically revealed for this region. First, the biocapacity supply declined from the east (the Guanzhong Basin and the Loess Plateau) to the middle (the Qaidam Basin and the Turpan Basin), and turned to rise from the middle to the west (the northwest of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomy). Second. although the gap between biocapacity supply and demand resulted in a small ecological deficit at the regional level, a large ecological deficit was observed at the provincial and county levels, highlighting an unsustainable situation for some of the sub-regions. Importantly, a power law relationship was unveiled between the biocapacity supply and population density, suggesting that (i) the biocapacity supply as a critical indicator could reflect the intensity of human exploitation on local biophysical resources and (ii) humans tend to have a preference to inhabit those areas with high biological productivity. These results provide opportunities to enhance policy development by central and local governments as part of the long-term Great Western Development Strategy of China. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to comprehensively understand the impacts of plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation on agricultural ecosystem services and dis-services, we developed an assessment framework for the net ecosystem services and used China as a case study. Our results showed that, compared to conventional vegetable cultivation, plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation has higher fresh vegetable production, greater CO2 fixation (3.61 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1)), better soil retention (23.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), and requires less irrigation (2132 m(3) water ha(-1) yr(-1)), maintains similar soil fertility, but also has higher NO3- accumulation and N2O emissions. In 2004. plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China provided an overall net economic benefit of 67,956 yuan yr(-1) (8.28 yuan = 1 USD in 2004), where 68,240 yuan ha(-1) yr(-1) represented ecosystem services and 284 yuan ha(-1) yr(-1) for dis-services. The transition from conventional vegetable cultivation to plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation resulted in a net economic benefit of 24,248 yuan ha(-1) yr(-1). A cost-benefit analysis suggests that plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China has the potential to optimize social benefits in addition to increasing annual economic income to farmers directly.

Despite uncertainty about the exact form of a future, international REDD+ system, REDD+ carbon property rights would need to be created and allocated with liability assigned for the potential loss of climate benefits in the event of carbon reversal from deforestation. This commentary explores the links between forest property rights and liability, to different REDD+ policy options and their implications for permanence. Should national governments retain liability for permanence then project-level activities that have individually-assigned REDD+ carbon rights may have a higher risk of carbon reversal than policies where rights are assigned to the state. Knowledge of pre-existing forest rights is necessary for some policies implemented with government-assigned REDD+ rights in order to compensate for potential income losses from policy implementation.

It presents four main findings, some of which do not conform to the basic assumptions of standard asset pricing theories. First, in an era when efficient portfolio diversification was not possible, the intrinsic risk of an equity security was an important input into investor decision-making. Second, our evidence suggests that businesspeople initially regarded bank stock as a consumption good, as being a stockholder gave them privileged access to bank finance. When bank lending practices changed in the middle of the century, this access-to-credit advantage associated with owning bank stock largely disappeared. Third, investors typically exhibited a bias towards banks that conducted business in the areas where they resided. Fourth, a sizeable proportion of investors were stockholders in more than one bank.","[Acheson, Graeme G.] Univ Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Ulster University; Queens University Belfast,"Acheson, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland.",,,"Acheson, Graeme/0000-0001-7531-2082",,,,,48,19,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - Tocai wine, which is produced in Northeastern Italian regions and is involved in a dispute with the Hungarian geographical indication Tokaj, is taken as a case study. A hedonic price model has been estimated based on retail prices observed in local markets. Findings - The research shows that consumers buying at large-scale retailers are willing to pay a higher price premium for quality signals than those buying in specialised shops, ceteris paribus. For the latter, willingness to pay for quality signals is reduced by the information provided by the specialised shop retailer, which decreases the customer's uncertainty about wine quality; quality signals appearing on wine labels generally have a more relevant positive effect on wine price than brand reputation, confirming the findings available in the current literature. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature by proving, in a real market situation, that consumers are willing to pay a higher price premium for quality signals when information is supplied only by wine labels, as in a large-scale retail environment, than when it is provided by the assistance of a knowledgeable seller, as in specialised shops. The paper confirms that the information transmitted to the consumer during purchase affects price in a way similar to that reported in the literature for simulated markets in the case of expert consumers.","[Boatto, Vasco; Defrancesco, Edi; Trestini, Samuele] Univ Padua, Coll Agr, TeSAF Dept, Legnaro, Italy; [Boatto, Vasco] Univ Padua, CIRVE Ctr, Legnaro, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Trestini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Coll Agr, TeSAF Dept, Legnaro, Italy.",samuele.trestini@unipd.it,"Defrancesco, Edi/M-8654-2015; TRESTINI, SAMUELE/B-6157-2012","Defrancesco, Edi/0000-0002-3369-1616; TRESTINI, SAMUELE/0000-0002-9828-8262",,,,,31,33,41,1,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Through analysis of data collected from Zagat Survey food reviews, the research seeks to explore trends regarding each cuisine's social status, quality, and also to observe general comparisons between each ethnicity's cuisine. The secondary aim is to evaluate how each cuisine is currently perceived in the city that is not only beaming with culinary delights, but also deemed the Restaurant capital of the world. Design/methodology/approach - Using the Zagat Survey New York City 1997 and 2007, quantitative analyses were performed using the scores for comparison purposes. The mean and the standard deviations are calculated in terms of food, decor, service, and price. The t-test was used to verify whether there have been statistically meaningful changes in each cuisine for the past ten years in the Zagat Survey. Findings - In terms of popularity, the number of Japanese restaurants has significantly increased in ten years while that of Chinese restaurants decreased about 30 percent. According to the t-tests, Japanese showed most significant changes in almost all aspects. Thai cuisine also demonstrated remarkable improvements, especially, in decor and service. Korean and Chinese cuisine did not show a noticeable change in food, decor, and service. Only the price showed a little change for these cuisines. Vietnamese cuisine achieved a significant progress in food while no enhancement in other aspects. Research limitations/implications - Because the scope of the research was general restaurants in New York City, the discussion on their price range, quality of food, decor, and service, the type of restaurant under observation was inevitably limited. Practical implications - The research can help in marketing and development of new restaurants for it provides some insight into the characteristics of each ethnic cuisine and trend changes of restaurants. Originality/value - The research presented in the paper can be applied both by practitioners and academics in the fields of food service management.","[Cho, Mi-Sook] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Nutr Sci & Food Management, Coll Hlth Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Jia] Ongo Food Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jong-Mee] Nongshim Co Ltd, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Cho, MS (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Nutr Sci & Food Management, Coll Hlth Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",misocho@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,23,3,3,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports the results of field study involving 209 farmers in Lower Saxony and the northern section of North Rhine-Westphalia regions in northwest Germany. These regions are the most important milk production centres in Germany. Findings - The results indicate that, whereas behavioural factors, specifically relationship management practices and price satisfaction, have a positive influence on the quality of the business relationship between the farmers and the dairies, the actual price levels have no influence. Practical implications - Actual prices paid to the farmers is not the most important factor which influences the quality of their relationship with the dairies but rather behavioural norms such as milk price satisfaction and relational norms. Dairies are advised to enhance price perception through price negotiations and transparency in order to facilitate quality relationship instead of through higher price payment alone. Originality/value - This study is the first to integrate and compare the actual prices and behavioural variables to determine their relative importance and influence on relationship quality.","[Gyau, Amos] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Spiller, Achim; Wocken, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Adelaide; University of Gottingen,"Gyau, A (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",amos.gyau@adelaide.edu.au,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,47,14,15,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A review of the literature and the relevant legislation in the three different countries is conducted. Regulations are reviewed and scientific evidence requirements are outlined in each country. Findings - Full regulatory approval for claims across all three countries requires the support of robust scientific evidence. To obtain this, companies must submit comprehensive dossiers and detailed applications to the regulators with full descriptions of the tests and studies completed during product development. However in the USA and Japan, an alternative process exists. A health claim that is suggested but not supported by scientific evidence is known as a qualified health claim and is permitted in the USA and Japan, but not in the EU. Practical implications - The paper demonstrates the difference in regulatory requirements in different countries which leads to different claims being permitted in different countries. It also leads to different levels of scientific support for similar claims which causes consumer confusion and develops an uneven playing pitch for the industry. Given that the industry operates in a global market place, it is imperative that a consensus is reached as to the level of scientific evidence required to approve a health claim. In that way, consumers can be safeguarded from being misled, consumer confusion will not be a concern and products can be globally distributed in line with the increasing liberalisation of trade.

Test area in eastern part of Lithuania was photographed using Canon EOS-1DsMark II digital camera, installed on-board SkyArrow ultra-light aircraft. Camera lenses were adopted to capture images corresponding to the conventional color-infrared photography. Ground sampling density of acquired images was 9 cm. Crown defoliation in the field was assessed for more than 500 trees located on 46 sample plots. 89% of field surveyed trees were identified on rectified aerial images. The individual crown defoliations were estimated using two non-parametric estimation techniques - most similar neighbor and k-nearest neighbor and small format aerial image characteristics as the auxiliary variables. The prediction root mean square errors were at two levels - around 9-11% for 170-years old trees and around 11-15% for the 65-years old trees. Accuracy of individual crown defoliation class prediction ranged from weak to moderate. Defoliation prediction root mean square errors at a sample plot level were 5.07% and 1.58% for 65-years and 170-years old stands respectively.","[Mozgeris, Gintautas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm, GIS Educ & Res Ctr, LT-53362 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Augustaitis, Algirdas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm, Forest Monitoring Lab, LT-53362 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Gecionis, Andrius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Forest Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Mozgeris, G (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm, GIS Educ & Res Ctr, LT-53362 Kaunas, Lithuania.",gintautas.mozgeris@asu.lt; algirdas.augustaitis@asu.lt,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,452,458,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500078,0

Results show, that treating potatoes with a combination of potassium and phosphorus fertilizers and potassium fertilizers alone significantly increased total and marketable yield of organically grown potatoes. Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers had little effect on the output of marketable yield of potatoes. Energetic P value increased under the influence of combination of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and this shows lower suitability to human body. Treating potatoes with biological preparation in their growth technology did not allow determining their total and marketable yields.

The aim of the research is to study the opinions of Estonian farmers on the future outlook of agriculture in Estonia. For this, the data of a questionnaire survey of Estonian farmers is used. In the survey, the farmers were asked to give their opinion on the 6 statements: about the demand, prices, EU subsidies, agriculture as source of income and as a lifestyle and about the future prospects of agriculture in Estonia. 6 multiple regression models were constructed to study the relationship between the farmers' opinions and the following characteristics of the farmer: age of farmer, level of education, size of the agricultural holding, and distance of the farm from the nearest urban growth centre. The results show that the farmer characteristics explained the variation in opinions in 3 models. The farmers with higher level of education gave higher scores to the favourable future prospects of agriculture in Estonia. The farmers with larger arable area were more optimistic about agricultural production as a source of income, and more profit-oriented. There was a strong negative connection between the distance from the growth centre and the assessment on the importance of life-style over profit.","[Poder, Anne; Viira, Ants-Hannes; Putk, Kati] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,,anne.poder@emu.ee; ants.viira@emu.ee; kati.putk@emu.ee,"Poder, Anne/A-9600-2014","Poder, Anne/0000-0003-1402-1948",,,,,17,1,1,0,7,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,185,189,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000029,0

The both catchment areas close to 1100 km(2). The best results of the runoff simulation were received in the sub-basin of the River Susve (R-2-0,815). The River Nevezis above Panevezys showed less good correspondence with the observations (R-2-0,713) and bad result of low flows (R-log(2)-0,28-0,51). The author relates these error uncertainties by discreet precipitation distribution in basin or they can be solved by splitting the catchment to smaller sub-basins. The results show that some enhancements should be done, but HBV model could be successfully applied for further runoff analysis (risk under different anthropogenic conditions).","[Tvaronavicius, Arunas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Water Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,arunastvaron@centras.lt,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,348,351,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500062,0

Yet what such strategies might be, how they could be developed, and how effective, efficient and equitable such strategies would be, remains unspecified. It is apparent that the institutions, organizations and mechanisms by which humans currently govern their relationship with the natural environment and global biochemical systems are not only insufficient-they are also poorly understood. This article presents the science programme of the Earth System Governance Project, a new 10-year global research effort endorsed by the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP). It outlines the concept of earth system governance as a challenge for the social sciences, and it elaborates on the interlinked analytical problems and research questions of earth system governance as an object of study. These analytical problems concern the overall architecture of earth system governance, agency beyond the state and of the state, the adaptiveness of governance mechanisms and processes as well as their accountability and legitimacy, and modes of allocation and access in earth system governance. The article also outlines four crosscutting research themes that are crucial for the study of each analytical problem as well as for the integrated understanding of earth system governance: the role of power, knowledge, norms and scale.","[Biermann, Frank; Gupta, Joyeeta] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Policy Anal, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Betsill, Michele M.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gupta, Joyeeta] UNESCO IHE, Delft, Netherlands; [Kanie, Norichika] Tokyo Inst Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 152, Japan; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand; [Liverman, Diana] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Liverman, Diana; Schroeder, Heike] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Siebenhuener, Bernd] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-2900 Oldenburg, Germany; [Biermann, Frank; Zondervan, Ruben] Lund Univ, Earth Syst Governance Project, Int Project Off, Lund, Sweden",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Colorado State University; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Chiang Mai University; University of Arizona; University of Oxford; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Lund University,"Biermann, F (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Policy Anal, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",frank.biermann@ivm.vu.nl,"Betsill, Michele/ABD-5548-2020; Gupta, Joyeeta/L-8672-2013; Quinn, Patrick/B-5489-2010; Betsill, Michele/GQY-4502-2022; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014; Biermann, Frank/D-4175-2013","Betsill, Michele/0000-0001-7090-904X; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418; Siebenhuner, Bernd/0000-0002-0444-5889; Gupta, Joyeeta/0000-0003-1424-2660; Biermann, Frank/0000-0002-0292-0703",,,,,148,178,193,2,90,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In Denmark a biannual milk quota exchange was set up in 1997 to promote a more efficient reallocation of milk quotas as well as to reduce transaction costs related to the searching and matching of sellers and buyers. Using two comprehensive unbalanced panel data sets on organic and conventional milk farms this study attempts to disentangle the effects of the introduction of quota transferability on the production structure of those farms as well as the probability of market entry/exit. Bayesian estimation techniques are used to estimate an input oriented generalized Leontief distance function as well as a curvature constrained specification. The results suggest that the deregulation in the quota allocation mechanism led to an increased allocative efficiency of organic as well as conventional milk production as well as a relative shift of the PPF in favor of the production of organic milk.,"[Sauer, Johannes] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sauer, Johannes] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Manchester; University of Copenhagen,"Sauer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",johannes.sauer@manchester.ac.uk,,"Sauer, Johannes (Jo)/0000-0003-2674-0229",,,,,55,12,12,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

W.",,,Famine as agricultural catastrophe: the crisis of 1622-4 in east Lancashire,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article argues that historians have paid insufficient attention to the agrarian roots of early modern English famines. While not dismissing the insights arising from entitlements theory, the article takes issue with recent writings that have explained the famine of 1622-3 in north-west England as an entitlements crisis. It offers new empirical evidence from an estate in east Lancashire to demonstrate the scale of the crisis in the early 1620s, using estate accounts to produce new price data and estimates of productivity. On the basis of oat tithe data, the scale of the shortfall in foodstuffs in the harvest of 1621 is demonstrated as being probably in the region of a third; that of the following year has to be inferred from price data. The evidence shows that the crisis was not limited to the arable economy, but was followed by an extensive restocking of the pastoral economy. The article therefore makes a contribution to the growing interest in weather as an exogenous factor.","Univ Reading Hist, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Hoyle, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Reading Hist, Reading, Berks, England.",,,,,,,,40,22,23,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Our study set out to investigate how members of the public evaluate policy options that aim at adaptation to climate change, and more specifically, to reduce the risk from flooding and low flows. We explored how hierarchically structured networks of values and beliefs shape public preferences and attitudes towards two different policies, insurance and a sustainable flood management scheme. In particular, we assessed the role of governance-related values such as efficiency, solidarity and sustainability that allow individuals to evaluate a policy option even if its outcomes are highly uncertain. To this end, we conducted a survey among members of the Scottish public (n = 1033). Findings from spike models and structural equation modelling suggested that there was general support for both policy measures, with a preference for the sustainable flood management approach. In particular, we found perceived severity of change, trust in government, governance-related values and fundamental values to inform attitudes and willingness to pay (WTP) for policy measures. More specific constructs, such as attitudes, were embedded in contexts of more abstract and situation-transcendent values. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The framework presented here helps clarify differences between the normative and positive aspects of scale, allocation, and distribution. In particular, we distinguish between 'normative rules' and 'normative benchmarks'. This distinction helps untangle the web of hierarchical and evolutionary relationships that connect scale, allocation, and distribution. We also introduce concepts of scale efficiency and distribution efficiency as counterparts to the widely used allocation efficiency, and develop a simple dynamic model relating these three efficiencies. We then present stylized facts about the relationship between scale, allocation, and distribution that this model helps uncover. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A 2006 scientific atelier conducted in the city of Awassa. Ethiopia investigated investments in human and natural capital as a sustainable development strategy. Local stakeholders identified firewood shortages, degradation of croplands, rising lake levels encroaching on croplands and poor water quality as major impediments to development. They further identified ecological degradation as a key component of these problems, and they acknowledged multiple vicious cycles compounding the environmental and economic threats to the Awassa community. Proposed solutions included investment in natural capital in the form of reforestation activities, investment in human capital in the form of promoting more efficient wood stoves along with increasing public awareness of environmental threats, and investments in social capital in the form of inter-institutional coordination to address environmental problems. All recommended investments rely primarily on national resources, in distinct contrast to the extensive imports required for most built capital investments. Unfortunately, Awassa lacks the surplus necessary for major capital investments of any kind. The atelier therefore helped local participants identify potential funders and write grant proposals for various projects, though none have been funded so far. Reversing the ecological degradation on the scale necessary for sustained economic development in Ethiopia however will require a steady flow of substantial investments, and cannot rely solely on the short term generosity of funders. International payments for carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services could help provide the necessary resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Under conditions of resource limitations, utilization efficiency is a key concern for Chinese scientists and decision-makers. Based on forest production and trade data for China, we present a conceptual framework for resource flow analysis, calculate the quantities and analyze the characteristics of flows of forest resources (primarily wood and wood byproducts) during the critical early economic development of China (from 1953 to 2000) by converting the forest resource flows into log equivalents (i.e., the quantity of logs required to generate a unit of each type of product). The consumption of forest resources has accelerated throughout the study period, and the structure and efficiency of forest resource utilization have both improved. The proportion of forest resource flows obtained from outside China has increased, and most of this wood was consumed by wood-processing industries. Over time, consumption has shifted from logs and lumber to the pulp and paper and artificial board industries. To improve the economics and sustainability of its use of forest resources, China should increase consumption of forest resources by its pulp and paper industry, more fully utilize forest resources obtained from outside China, and weaken the dependence on these foreign forest resources by promoting increased utilization efficiency and structural readjustment of the forest industry. Therefore, improved forest management is an effective mean of weakening the dependence on foreign forest resources. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of land inequality is analysed in a cross-colonial multivariate regression framework complemented by an in-depth comparative case study of three former British colonies: Malaysia, Sierra Leone, and Zambia. The main conclusion is that the literature tends to overemphasize the role of geography and to underestimate the role of pre-colonial institutions in shaping the colonial political economic context in which land is (re)distributed from natives to colonial settlers.","Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Frankema, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"frankema, ewout/B-4186-2015","frankema, ewout/0000-0002-7504-2817",,,,,71,52,63,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This is further increased in the evolutionary perspective where the current carbon-based Socio-Technical System constrains and shapes consumers choices through structural forces. Habits being potentially counterintentional, they may explain the efficiency paradox in energy as well as the continued increase of energy consumption despite the rising environmental awareness among the population Policies aiming at reducing energy consumption should thus specifically address the performance context of habits For instance, targeting new residents has proven to be more effective given that their preceding habits have been disturbed The results of our empirical analysis confirm this idea by showing how a change of context makes people more receptive to a proposed measure. Our analysis of the role played by habits also suggests that individuals do not consider the need to change existing habits as an obstacle even though this is contradicted implicitly in the answers they provided to open questions This unconsciousness is one of the most delicate features of habits and it should thus be accounted for when designing measures Given the other characteristics of habits, the joint use of feedbacks and commitment strategies appears promising.

In the first stage, customers decide whether to consider joining the service. This (Consideration) stage is modeled by a hazard model. Customers who decide to consider the service move on to the Choice stage, wherein they choose among the service alternatives and an outside No Choice option. This stage is modeled by a conditional Multinomial Logit model. The service provider does not observe the transition in the first stage of potential customers who have yet to choose a brand. Such potential customers may have started to consider joining the service, yet chose the outside alternative in each period thereafter. One of the main contributions of the model is its ability to distinguish between these two non-adopter types. We estimated the model using data on the adoption process of newly introduced service plans offered by a commercial bank. We employed the hierarchical Bayes Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedure to estimate individual as well as population parameters. The empirical results indicate that the model outperforms competing models in breadth of analysis, model fit, and prediction accuracy.","[Landsman, Vardit] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Givon, Moshe] Tel Aviv Univ, Recanati Sch Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tel Aviv University,"Landsman, V (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",landsman@few.eur.nl; givon@post.tau.ac.il,,"Landsman, Vardit/0000-0001-6013-3751",,,,,49,13,18,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The potential success of this strategy crucially depends on insurers' bargaining leverage vis-A -vis health care providers. An important determinant of insurers' bargaining power is the willingness of consumers to consider alternative providers. In this paper we examine to what extent consumers are willing to switch hospitals when they are fully covered for hospital services, which is typical for many European countries. Since prices do not matter to these patients, we estimate time-elasticities to assess hospital substitutability. Using data from a large Dutch health insurer on non-emergency neurosurgical outpatient hospital visits in 2003, we estimate a conditional logit model of patient hospital choice taking both patient heterogeneity and hospital characteristics into account. We use the parameter estimates to simulate the demand effect of an artificial increase in travel time by 10% for every patient, holding all other hospital attributes constant. Overall, the resulting point estimates of hospitals' time-elasticities are fairly high, although variation is substantial (-2.6 to -1.4). Sensitivity tests reveal that these estimates are very robust and differ significantly across individual hospitals. This implies that all hospitals in our study sample have at least one close substitute which is an important precondition for effective hospital competition.","[Varkevisser, Marco; van der Geest, Stephanie A.; Schut, Frederik T.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Varkevisser, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, POB 1738,Room J8-03, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",varkevisser@bmg.eur.nl,"Schut, Frederik/D-2823-2013","Schut, Frederik/0000-0002-5748-5403",,,,,30,34,34,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Hitherto, most virtual water 'trade' studies have focused on its potential contribution to saving water, especially in water short regions, Very little, however, has been said about the opportunity cost of the associated water. The present research critically evaluates the strategic importance of green water (soil water originating from rainfall) in relation to international commodity trade. Besides having a lower opportunity cost. the use of green water for the production of crops has generally less negative environmental externalities than the use of blue water (irrigation with water abstracted from ground or surface water systems). Although it is widely known that major grain exporters - the USA, Canada, France, Australia and Argentina - produce grain in highly productive rain-fed conditions, green water volumes in exports have rarely been estimated. The present study corroborates that green water is by far the largest share of virtual water in maize, soybean and wheat exports from its main exporting countries (USA, Canada, Australia and Argentina) during the period 2000-2004. Insofar virtual water is 'traded' towards water-scarce nations that heavily depend on their blue water resources, green virtual-water 'trade' related to these commodities plays a role in ensuring water and water-dependent food security and avoiding further potential damage to the water environments in both importing and exporting countries. This potential of international green virtual-water 'trade'. however, is constrained by factors such as technology, the potential for further increases in the productivity of soil and irrigation water, the level of socio-economic development, national food policies and international trade agreements.

This ex ante analysis was undertaken as part of a cost-benefit evidence base to inform implementation of the proposed UK Marine and Coastal Access Bill. This Bill is part of an ambitious plan to designate and manage UK marine areas using an Ecosystems Approach. Benefits are measured in terms of anticipated increases in the value of ecosystem goods and services provisioned by MCZs relative to the counterfactual, i.e. no designation. The principal valuation and thus policy challenge is presented by the need to use benefits transfer in a context where biophysical provisioning functions are not well-developed, where there are gaps in the valuation literature related to temperate marine ecosystem goods and services, and where values (where available) are presented in aggregate terms. This paper develops and applies a methodology that first apportions these aggregate benefits across the diverse range of marine landscapes and habitats and then estimates the marginal benefit of protection. The value of benefits was calculated for three different configurations of MCZs under two different management regimes. We estimate a benefit range from designation of between 10.2 pound billion and 23.5 pound billion in present value terms, applying a 3.5% discount rate. The study questions the extent to which a defensible policy evidence base can be developed in the absence of primary valuation data and where benefit estimates are reported in aggregate terms.

However, current levels of conservation investment are not likely to mitigate degradation to natural capital and ecosystem services. We propose the further evolution of a conservation industry to generate substantially increased investment in conservation in agricultural landscapes, particularly from the private sector. A mature conservation industry is envisaged as comprising of investors, producers, and service providers who produce conservation products and services, exchanged via market transactions. A number of requirements for a viable and effective conservation industry are identified including institutional infrastructure (conservation market institutions and regulatory systems), information provision (quantifying benefits, business models, and accounting and auditing standards), and facilitation (entrepreneurship incubation and capacity building). A conservation industry requires careful design and planning in order to operate effectively.

While historical experience of developed countries is reviewed, today's rapid urbanization in developing countries offers an intense set of challenges. Rapid urbanization requires massive population movements and enormous local and inter-city infrastructure investments in a modern context of heavy government interventions in economies. This context raises under-researched issues, discussed in the second part of the paper. First concerns the spatial form of development. How much development should be focused in mega-cities, or huge urban clusters, as opposed to being more spatially dispersed, a critical question facing China and India today? How do we conceptualize and measure both the benefits and costs of increased urban concentration; and how are they linked to a country's evolving national industrial composition? Second, what is the evolution of spatial income inequality under massive rural-urban migration? Is inequality heightened today relative to the past by national government policies which favor certain cities and regions and by local government policies in those cities that may try to deflect migrants by offering them poor living conditions?.","Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Henderson, JV (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",J_Henderson@Brown.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,63,200,226,4,128,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

After the animal model was established, the rats were allowed to breed, and 36 offspring rats in each group (female: male=1:1) were randomly selected for the experiments. At 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 day, the offspring rats were anesthetized and their brain cells prepared for single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE=comet assay). Ratio of tailing in brain cells of 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 day-old rats in high fluoride group were 56.11%, 48.74%, 86.74%, 53.84%, 86.58%, 89.09% (average ratio, 70.18%) and the proportion of grade III damage to brain cells in 20 day-old rats is up to 85.71%. The rate and degree of DNA damage of brain cell in different age rats is higher in the HiF+LI group than in the other experimental groups.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is a qualitative focus group study involving a series of core user adult consumer groups, aged between 25 and the late 1960s, in a southern county of the UK. Findings - The adult consumption of biscuits involves a process that aspires towards an overall better-life, sensual experience by momentarily escaping the everyday realm and aiming to emulate either a perceived real or a mythical, largely past-related style of existence. This is often associated with meanings inherent in the terms natural, rural, home-baked and traditional as well as elegant associations and production and selling agency values around small or local, pre-modern source structures. Organic labelling is found to have a negative horn effect to buyers by countering other desired associations. Research limitations/implications - The study used a small sample in the county of Dorset in the south of England, but these are implications for new product development and marketing of luxury snacks. Practical implications - Alternative areas of marketing focus to rational appeal are suggested that could help promote healthier biscuit choice options. Originality/value - Irrational ideal and unreal aspects of consumer appeal are found to feature the creation of imagined or re-created moments of perfection in a process of cognitive suspension.","[McIntyre, Charles; Schwanke, Benita] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Serv Management, Bournemouth, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"McIntyre, C (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Sch Serv Management, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.",cmcintyr@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,9,9,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Additionally, the usual focus on the Roman provincial system limits the understanding of 'economic imperialism' to that of a 'formal empire' and ignores other ancient societies. The second reason, which so far has been neglected, is the changing vision of modern imperialism.

Key questions discussed are first, what has been the character of selected interactions so far-synergistic or disruptive? Second, what kinds of interaction mechanisms have been driving the interactions; normative, cognitive, or utilitarian? Third, with regard to cross-scale effects, has significant learning taken place between institutions at different levels? Four sub-cases of interaction are analysed: first, the interaction between the Kyoto Protocol as source and the ETS as target which started after the adoption of the Protocol in late 1997. Second, a next phase of interaction started in 2004 when the EU states started to develop national allocation plans (NAPs) where bringing in credits/allowances developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) became one compliance strategy. Third, the opposite relationship is examined, i.e., with the ETS as the source and the Kyoto Protocol institutions as targets. The first phase started after the adoption of the 2003 ET Directive and with the developing ETS possibly leading to a more rapid and extensive CDM development than would otherwise have been the case. Fourth and finally, a separate case of interaction deals with the possible role the ETS plays and could play for an emerging global carbon market. Key findings are that these cases are mainly of a synergistic nature. Furthermore, in order to understand the driving forces, it is necessary to draw upon several interaction mechanisms, particularly cognitive and utilitarian ones. Finally, as to cross-scale learning, the post-2012 global regime may avoid pitfalls related to the allocation process experienced by the ETS. But the learning and diffusion potential should not be exaggerated.","Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway",,"Wettestad, J (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.",jorgen.wettestad@fni.no,,,,,,,48,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

J,"Spiegel, SJ",,,,"Spiegel, Samuel J.",,,Socioeconomic dimensions of mercury pollution abatement: Engaging artisanal mining communities in Sub-Saharan Africa,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Small-scale gold mining; Mercury pollution; Environmental planning; Livelihoods; Poverty; Africa,SMALL-SCALE; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; REDUCING MERCURY; HUMAN EXPOSURE; LAKE VICTORIA; GOLD; EMISSIONS; TANZANIA; INDUSTRY; POVERTY,"In recent years, strategies to tackle mercury pollution from artisanal gold mining have mainly included restrictions - banning mercury trade internationally, prescribing alternate technologies and tightening regulations on mining (e.g. banning mercury use). However, artisanal mining communities in Africa are often trapped in cycles of poverty that make it difficult for workers to improve technologies and reduce mercury pollution. This article assesses problems with narrow pollution abatement discourses and top-down regulations, examining the need for integrated approaches to address pollution and socioeconomic challenges in low income mining communities. It advances the hypothesis that pollution abatement strategies fail if they do not explicitly address local socioeconomic capacities for improving environmental management, informed by an adaptive understanding of labor dynamics. Case studies in Mozambique and Tanzania are examined where United Nations pilot projects sought to address local challenges. These combined training on improved technologies and environmental risk mitigation with efforts to empower miners by enhancing access to microfinance services and fairer gold marketing arrangements. These case studies demonstrate adaptive ways of engaging local concerns in mining areas, highlighting lessons that are especially urgent now that recent policy commitments from Europe and the United States to ban mercury exports have specifically sought to make mercury more expensive for African mining communities. Ultimately, the analysis suggests how regionally focused ecological economics research has a vital role to play in (a) revealing how narrowly conceived responses to pollution can yield counterproductive results as well as exacerbate exploitative labor conditions in low income contexts; and (b) stimulating analytic focus on innovative ways of integrating pollution reduction strategy with grassroots socioeconomic empowerment strategies.

The market for monkeys consumed as food on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, is modeled as a bargaining game. The bargaining set-up leads to the conclusion that black colobus are being over-hunted. Using daily data an empirical density is fit to the price-quantity pairs resulting from exchange between buyers and retailers. The density provides support for the bargaining model. Quantile regressions are also fit to the data. The median quantile indicates buyers have greater bargaining power than retailers. Knowing who has bargaining power aids in the design of policy to reduce bushmeat hunting. Strategic elasticities are constructed from the quantiles.

We develop a framework that integrates product choice and price competition in a differentiated product market. The present model significantly improves upon the reduced-form profit functions typically used in the entry and location choice literature, because the variable profits that enter the product-choice decision are derived from a structural model of demand and price competition. Given the heterogeneity in consumers' product valuations and responses to price changes, this is a critical element in the analysis of product assortment decisions. Relative to the literature on structural demand models, our results show that incorporating endogenous product choice is essential for policy simulations and may entail very different conclusions from settings where product assortment choices are held fixed.","[Draganska, Michaela] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mazzeo, Michael] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Seim, Katja] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Stanford University; Northwestern University; University of Pennsylvania,"Draganska, M (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",draganska_michaela@gsb.stanford.edu; mazzeo@kellogg.northwestern.edu; kseim@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,26,79,138,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Where controlled experiments are not possible, econometric techniques can be used to determine the effectiveness of conservation treatments. We use a long-running yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) nest count in New Zealand to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three commonly used endangered species recovery treatments-trapping of introduced predators, revegetation, and intensive management. Following ecological theory, we specify a density-dependent population growth rate. We control for year effects and site characteristics such as land cover, slope, and elevation. The possibility of selection bias in treatment is confronted with site fixed effects and with an instrumental variable based on site accessibility. Of the three treatments that we analyze, only intensive management is significantly correlated with increases in annual site-level yellow-eyed penguin population growth rate. We estimate that intensive management increased the yellow-eyed penguin population by 9% above the counterfactual, and that the average cost of producing an additional yellow-eyed penguin nest through intensive management is NZ$68,600.

Its control is based upon integration of several cultural practices associated with chemical control, and growing resistant cultivars. In order to do that, Embrapa Cassava & Tropical Fruits is carrying out a pineapple breeding program aimed at obtaining fusariosis resistant cultivars. Up to the present that breeding program has generated and evaluated 53,397 hybrids. Among them, the hybrid PE x SC-56, that showed good quality fruits, besides being resistant to fusariosis, was released as a new pineapple cultivar in 2003, named 'Imperial', and was recommended for planting mainly in regions where that disease is one of the main limiting factors for pineapple production. The 'Imperial' pineapple plant is of intermediate height with spineless dark green leaves. The fruit is small and cylindrical, with a yellow peel at ripening. The pulp is yellow, with a high sugar content, moderate acidity, a high level of ascorbic acid and a very good flavor. 'Imperial' also shows resistance to internal browning. The following characteristics may be considered as unfavorable: slow plant growth, peduncle with small diameter, small fruit (1.6 kg), rough fruit surface due to uneven fruitlets (influenced by climatic conditions), slips occasionally attached to the fruit base. Growing 'Imperial' pineapple does not require fungicide applications to control fusariosis, thus resulting in reduction of production costs, lower environmental impact and safer fruit production.","[Cabral, J.

The use of unusually long-term data that correspond to the current borders of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh for the period 1901-2004 also distinguishes this study from the existing ones. The empirical results show a sharp discontinuity between the pre- and the post- independence periods in all of the three countries: total output growth rates rose from zero or very low figures to significantly positive levels, which were sustained throughout the post- independence period. The improvement in aggregate land productivity explained the most of this Output growth. To quantity the effect of crop shifts, a decomposition analysis is applied, which shows that the crop shifts contributed to the productivity growth in all three countries, especially during periods with limited technological breakthroughs, The contribution of the crop shifts was larger in India and Pakistan than in Bangladesh. The decomposition results and changes in crop composition are consistent with farmers' response to comparative advantage under liberalized market conditions.","[Kurosaki, Takashi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo 186860, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,,kurosaki@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-941-1,STAT SCI INT RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,303,330,,,,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Mathematics,BMY19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273874600014,0

Design/methodology/approach - The method used for this purpose was Wald, Benefit and Regret criterions of Game Theory. The transformed Wald, Benefit and Regret linear programming models were solved to find the optimal solution. The data consisted of monthly chicken meat prices received by producers between 2000-2007, which were obtained from the Poultry Meat Producers and Breeders Association. Findings - The optimal solutions of Wald and Benefit criteria showed that June was the best selling month for chicken meat producers in Turkey. August was found to be the optimal selling month according to the Minimum regret criterion. In light of the Maximum criterion it was concluded that the producers would be at highest regret positions with 98.28 percent in event of selling in November. Originality/value - The results found in this study could be an indicator for individual chicken producers for a more competitive bargaining power when they make a contract with chicken meat production and marketing firms.","[Sahin, Ahmet; Yildirim, Ibrahim] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Miran, Buelent] Ege Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Yuzuncu Yil University; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; Ege University,"Sahin, A (通讯作者)，Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",ahmet.sahin@yyu.edu.tr,"Sahin, Ahmet/AAB-3909-2021; yıldırım, ibrahim/IAQ-5372-2023; yildirim, ibrahim/AAD-7482-2021","Sahin, Ahmet/0000-0003-4063-545X; Yildirim, Ibrahim/0000-0002-0883-8612",,,,,32,1,1,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The seller may recommend excessive product features to uninformed consumers. In a monopoly with two types of consumer (one with a basic need and the other an advanced need) and two types of service (a basic service which fulfills only the basic need and an advanced service which fulfills both needs), we investigate the firm's honesty and product-line pricing. We reach several results. First, the firm is honest if the basic service is superior (in that it generates higher per-capita social surplus than the advanced service under the efficient allocation) or if the consumers with the basic need are sufficiently many. Second, when there exist informed consumers who neglect seller recommendation, the presence of informed consumers may cause consumer welfare to decrease, and a larger informed population may cause firm profits and social welfare to increase or decrease. Lastly, when the informed consumers boycott a dishonest firm and withhold purchase, firm profits may increase because the threat of boycotting makes the firm more credible and allows a higher price of the advanced service.","Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Beijing 100738, Peoples R China",,"Jing, B (通讯作者)，Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Oriental Plaza,Tower E3,3-F,1 E Chang An Ave, Beijing 100738, Peoples R China.",bjing@ckgsb.edu.cn,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This article provides new quantitative evidence consisting of annual series about a reliable indicator of the degree of electrification of the Latin American nations. The database built shows that towards 1930 electricity consumption per inhabitant in Latin America was far below that of most advanced economies, and only Latin American leaders in the electrification process had reached power consumption levels similar to the European late comers.

This importance, associated with the necessity of conserving marine environments threatened by multiple competing uses, leads us to propose mechanisms for co-management of fisheries by users and public authorities. This proposal takes into account: a) local conflicts between artisanal and industrial fishers; b) local rules over the use of fishing areas established by artisanal fishers; c) the advent of protected areas that close access to some fishing areas used by artisanal fisheries; and d) co-management options being explored between government and fishers. This study suggests policy and technical alternatives under consideration to manage the artisanal fisheries of southeastern Brazil with a focus on Ilha Grande bay in Rio de Janeiro. In our case study, based on field research conducted in 2009, we show that artisanal fishers are squeezed into a marine space between protected areas and industrial fishing. We suggest that a combination of fishing agreements (FAs), based on experience in Amazonian fisheries and extractive reserves, and payment for environmental services (PES), based on forest and related water resource experience, could improve management and livelihoods for local artisanal fisheries by stimulating and rewarding fishers who participate in conservation efforts. The two instruments (FAs and PES) are the subject of considerable research and practical experience. Their integration in an instrument mix represents a contribution from transdisciplinary fields of human ecology and ecological economics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We establish a cross-sectional analysis of bilateral ETBs into a volume of trade, composition and technology effect. In order to analyze the driving forces of changes over time we perform a structural decomposition analysis of embodied import and export emissions. The main findings are that the embodied import emissions have increased by 37% whereas export emissions increased by only 3%, which is primarily driven by CO2. The 2007 bilateral balances are positive with OECD countries but negative with economies such as Russia, Africa and China. The analyses demonstrate that the worsening of the ETB is to a large extent caused by the changing composition of trade: the Dutch economy increasingly exports clean products and imports dirty products.

We use a data set from the Paris Region notary office (Chambre des notaires d'(I) over cap le-de-France) which consists of approximately 250,000 transactions units between the first quarter of 1990 and the end of 2005. We use the exact X-Y coordinates and transaction date to spatially and temporally sort each transaction. We first choose to use the STAR approach proposed by Pace et al., 1998. This method incorporates a spatiotemporal filtering process into the conventional hedonic function and attempts to correct for spatial and temporal correlative effects. We find significant estimates of spatial dependence effects. Moreover, using an original methodology, we find evidence of a strong presence of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the model. It suggests that spatial and temporal drifts in households socioeconomic profiles and local housing market structure effects are certainly major determinants of the price level for the Paris Housing Market.","[Nappi-Choulet, Ingrid] ESSEC Business Sch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Maury, Tristan-Pierre] EDHEC Business Sch, Econ Res Ctr, F-75009 Paris, France",ESSEC Business School; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Nappi-Choulet, I (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Ave Bernard Hirsch,BP 50105 Cergy, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",nappi@essec.edu; tristan.maury@edhec.edu,,,,,,,28,21,23,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

However, the dynamic and interactions between mining and tourism when they both occur in biodiversity hotspots, and how they together may impact the economy and environment in these biodiversity rich areas, remain unclear. This paper examined how the two industries interact in terms of their economic contributions and spatial patterns in a biodiversity hotspot, Yunnan, China. We used correlation analyses to measure the relationships between mining activities, tourism visits and local gross domestic productions. We also employed a distance-based technique to investigate the nature of any dependency between mining and tourism sites. Results showed that mining activities tend to be in relatively fluent areas while tourism tends to occur in less developed areas. Our results showed that the location of tourism and mining sites are likely to be close to one another but the two industries usually perform better economically when they are apart from each other. These findings can provide insights on how mining and tourism together may impact the economy and environment in biodiversity rich areas, and provide important information for managers and planners on balancing mining and tourism development in these areas.

However, to date, little has been done to quantitatively examine the effect of crop diversity on cocoa farming efficiency. This study therefore sets out to first investigate whether and to what extent crop diversity (defined as the mixing of cocoa with other crop species on farmers' plots) affects productivity on cocoa farms. Secondly, it sought to establish whether there are economies of scope (i.e., cost complementarities) from the sharing of farm inputs by crops on the same plots. Our results indicate that diversified (i.e., multi-crop) cocoa farms are more efficient than single (i.e., mono) crop farms. Furthermore, our estimate for the economies of scope parameter indicates possibilities for cost complementarities between production of cocoa and other crops on the same plot. We advocate further investigation on the issue of scope economies to determine which crop combinations offer better cost complementarities and also meet biodiversity conservation objectives.

It used data from the Health Services Use and Expenditure Study conducted in Colombia in 2001, for which each household recorded its monthly out-of-pocket health expenditure during the year and the household income was measured as the sum of each member's contribution to the household. Payment capacity or available income and catastrophic health spending were based on the latest methodology proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005. A probit model was adjusted to determine the factors that significantly influence the likelihood of a household having catastrophic health spending. The percentage of households with catastrophic health spending in Bogota was 4.9%; incidence was higher in low-income households where none of the members were affiliated to social security, where there had been an in-patient event, and where the heads of household were over 60 years of age. There is no statistical evidence for rejecting the hypothesis under study, which states that low-income households that have no health insurance are more likely to have catastrophic health spending than higher-income households with health insurance.","[Amaya Lara, Jeannette Liliana; Gomez, Fernando Ruiz] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Ctr Dev Projects Cendex, Bogota, Colombia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Lara, JLA (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Ctr Dev Projects Cendex, Carrera 7 40-62, Bogota, Colombia.",amayaj@javeriana.edu.co; fruiz@javeriana.edu.co,,,,,,,40,41,48,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Specifically, Article 11 and Annex Ill of the Directive call for a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of alternative mitigation measures as a requirement in formulating Programme of Measures (PoMs) to achieve 'good ecological status' for all waters in Europe. As agriculture is supposed to be the major contributor to diffuse water pollution, CEA of agri-environmental measures has been given paramount importance in establishing the PoMs. This paper summarises the status, significance, and methodological limitations of WFD-related CEA studies in Europe. Cases from the United Kingdom, countries surrounding the Baltic Sea and central and southern Europe were included in the review. Review results indicate that most WFD-related CEA studies: (1) were based on models of 'representative' farms without capturing the variability among real-world farms; (2) concentrate on a single ecological effect of measures or are based on cost estimates of the sectors directly involved in the pollutant-reduction programme (i.e., co-benefits, trade-offs, and external costs were not examined); and (3) did not incorporate uncertainties in both cost and effectiveness estimates. Based on the review results, the paper suggests policy implications and recommendations for future research in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We examine two industrial water pollution indicators (wastewater and petroleum-like matter) and four industrial air pollution indicators (waste gas, sulfur dioxide, soot, and dust). Our results suggest that most air and water emissions rise with increases in economic growth at current income levels. The share of output of domestic-and foreign-owned firms increases several pollutants in a statistically significant manner while output of firms from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan either reduces pollution or is statistically insignificant.","[Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

A number of previous studies have used referenda to analyze the support for public environmental goods. These studies have used aggregate data from large jurisdictional units (usually counties) and summary income measures such as the mean or median, and have usually found that higher income areas offer greater support for environmental propositions. We examine environmental referenda voting in California using census block group data, spatial dependence controls, and detailed income distribution data. We find that household income has a negative marginal effect on environmental referenda voting for most of the income range when using census block data. In addition, controls for spatial dependence significantly reduce the magnitude of most coefficients. This suggests that OLS estimates of referenda determinants are biased. We also show that county level data may be subject to severe aggregation bias and might not be appropriate for referenda studies. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A means-end chain value map was then constructed using mecanalyst software. Findings - Using means-end theory, an example communications strategy was developed from the dominant chain. The health and wellness features that respondents associated with vegetables were freshness, a source of vitamins and minerals, and high nutritional value. In the mind of the consumer, these features were linked to the benefit concept maintain energy and vitality, which in turn was connected to the consequence maintain an active life.

Currently, much research has been focused on sustainable and environmental friendly energy from biomass to replace conventional fossil fuels. Biomass can be considered as the best option to produce hydrogen sustainably, using photosynthesis, fermentation and gasification methods. Biogas cannot be used directly with fuel cells because of additional gases in it content harmful for fuel cells (sulphides, for example). There is several hydrogen enrichment upgrading technologies discussed in the paper. Biological production of hydrogen, using bacteria, is a promising and advantageous area, especially when hydrogen is gained from a variety of renewable resources. Substantial factors like availability and cost are highly important in the selection of waste materials to be used in hydrogen production with fermentative bacteria. Hydrogen gas is produced during the fermentation process of bacteria in anaerobic conditions. In our work brief analyze of various hydrogen producers and substrates are made in order to find the most effective and suitable bacterial culture for usage in laboratory scale bioreactor system. Building up bioreactor prototype and optimization experiment results showed that stirring and gas sparging has significant impact on hydrogen production efficiency. An inert gas heavier than hydrogen can be used to extract hydrogen from liquid phase to increase its concentration in gaseous phase. Various bacterial isolates and different substrates were tested for hydrogen gas production in order to find the most effective and suitable bacterial culture and substrate for usage in a laboratory-scale bioreactor prototype system. Hydrogen concentrations in liquid and gaseous environments were measured with two experimental systems for quantitative measurements of hydrogen yield and rate. After fermentation processes following results were obtained in liquid and gaseous phase: Escherichia coli BW25113 hyaB hybC hycA fdoG frdC ldhA aceE::kan produced hydrogen with rate 3 mmol/L/h, using 30mM glucose as substrate and 0,04 mmol/L/h, using 60 mM lactose as substrate in gaseous phase.

It also aims to examine CYAs' wine knowledge and establish whether there are positive relationships between wine knowledge and wine drinking behaviour variables. Design/methodology/approach - Information was obtained from a convenience sample of 414 university students in China using the self-administration data collection method. The nature of CYAs' basic wine knowledge and wine drinking behaviour including wine drinking frequency, venue, and purpose of wine drinking were examined in the survey. Findings - The majority of CYAs lack even the most basic wine knowledge. Generally, they drink wine infrequently. A large proportion of CYAs prefer red wine (92 per cent) to white wine (7 per cent). Most (60 per cent) CYAs like to drink wine at home, followed by hotels (21 per cent) and restaurants (15 per cent). About 60 per cent of CYAs drink wine for social communication while 27 per cent drink for body health reasons. A high 96 per cent of CYAs consider themselves likely to drink wine in the future. Significant differences exist between the genders in wine knowledge and likelihood of future wine drinking. Strong correlations were found between consumer wine knowledge and frequency and likelihood of future wine drinking. Research limitations/implications - The paper provides an overview of CYAs' wine drinking behaviour by a convenience sample investigation, which could not elude generalization and simplification. Considerable regional diversity in China compels differentiated regional studies in terms of wine purchasing, wine culture and wine marketing. Originality/value - The paper contributes a baseline study on CYAs' wine knowledge and wine drinking behaviour. It also gives some managerial implications for wineries and wine marketers that will be helpful to wine companies in understanding the emerging Chinese wine market and in enacting wine marketing strategies more effectively.","[Li, Jia-Gui; Jia, Jin-Rong] NW A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China; [Li, Jia-Gui] NW A&F Univ, Coll Enol, Yangling, Peoples R China; [Taylor, Dennis; Bruwer, Johan; Li, Elton] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Adelaide,"Jia, JR (通讯作者)，NW A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China.",Jinrong661@sina.com,"zhu, zhu/JDN-0159-2023; Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X",State Scholarship Fund of China [2008630521]; Chinese Universities [QN2009062],State Scholarship Fund of China; Chinese Universities,This study was supported by the State Scholarship Fund of China (No. 2008630521) and the Chinese Universities Scientific Fund (No. QN2009062).

The radical economic modification that the wine sector had to face during communism exposed these countries to various problems during transition, when their market share in Western European markets shrunk. This paper aims to argue that an important cause of the decline is the inability of price to convey information about the quality level of the wine, as from the theory of asymmetric information. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses the econometric theory of hedonic pricing to explore the research question, relating price to the characteristics of the wine, including a quality rating from a respected British wine expert for the year 2006. Results are presented for a sample of 134 wines coming from different Eastern European countries (EEC) sold in the UK. The analysis also tackles the issue of understanding which parameters contributed to the quality level of Eastern European wines, modelling the qualitative description in order to identify the keywords that explains the change in quality level. Findings - The results show evidence of no correlation between ratings and price in the considered segment of the UK wine market, suggesting an imperfect communication of quality via the price information. Moreover, Romania, which is a very important producing country, has a weak brand value, suggesting the need for restructuring the industry and improving quality management schemes to compete in their newly enlarged destination market.

The study revealed that reasons for developing agri-tourism were ease of entry (62.50%), high profits (81.25%), employment opportunities (75.00%), and little competition (37.50%). Promotions of agri-tourism were by means of roadside hoardings (82.50%), through internet web sites (62.50%), advertisements in newspapers (37.50%), and local TV channels (18.75%). The farmers believed that Agri-tourism contributes towards the sustainability of agri businesses because: proper planning generates various sources of income (95.00%), it helps farmers enhance their knowledge (87.50%), it is beneficial for small farmers who have low soil productivity (90.00%). They argued that Agri-tourism increases income as it is a new enterprise with less competition (96.25%), it is business activity as compared to traditional farming (93.75%), less land with low productivity can give more returns (90.00%), and it provides employment to a wide range of farmers (85.00%). Agri-tourism is helpful in maintaining natural resources as the nutrient demand is less and soil conservation is good (93.25%), deforestations is avoided (92.25%) and there are no environmental pollution problems (97.25%). In addition Agri-tourism is better for human health and the environment (96.25%) and it provides local heritage and cultural experiences for tourists (90.00%). Lack of funds for publicity and advertisement of farm-tourism (96.25%), insufficient numbers of visitors (93.75%), Lack of technology to develop farm-tourism (93.75%), lack of motivation (86.25%) and inadequate prices for farm products/activities (88.75%) were reported as major constraints in establishing agri-tourism. Environmental management (96.25%), nursery production (93.75%), fruit and vegetable value addition (93.75%), were the preferred areas of training of the farmers for establishing farm tourism.","[Shehrawat, P.

After the publication of the European Commission's guidelines on coexistence in 2003, Portugal developed ex-ante regulatory and expost tort liability rules on the coexistence of GM and non-GM maize crops. There is an on-going debate on the extent to which the coexistence policies affect adoption. In this study we measure the costs and benefits of planting GM maize as a member of a cooperative. All group members achieved a higher gross margin by planting GM maize rather than non-GM maize on their farms. Group members did not face any ex-post liability costs and had zero ex-ante regulatory costs as they could easily internalize the ex-ante coexistence regulations. The results show that coexistence regulations such as informing neighbors or keeping minimum distances do not necessarily lead to increased production costs provided they are flexible enough.

In the case that one output variable has a linear dependence (conic dependence, to be precise) with the other output variables, it can be hypothesized that the addition or deletion of such an output variable would not change the efficiency estimates. This is also the case for input variables. However, in the case that a certain set of input and output variables is linearly dependent, the effect of such a dependency on DEA is not clear. In this paper, we call such a dependency a cross redundancy and examine the effect of a cross redundancy on DEA. We prove that the addition or deletion of a cross-redundant variable does not affect the efficiency estimates yielded by the CCR or BCC models. Furthermore, we present a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of an imperfect cross redundancy on DEA by using accounting data obtained from United States exchange-listed companies.","[Choi, Kyuwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Lee, Kyuseok] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Management, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA",Kyung Hee University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Choi, K (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",kyuseok.lee@mgt.gatech.edu; kwchoi@khu.ac.kr,"Lee, Kyu Seok/B-3391-2012",,,,,,42,7,7,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The spatially explicit methodology focuses on the changes in landscape properties resulting from the implementation of these policies and its effects on the supply of landscape services and economic values of the landscape services. After the policy implementation the strongest increase in services supply is expected in rural areas while the strongest increase in value is expected to occur in (peri-) urban areas of the study area. In addition, full implementation of the policy package will lead to an increase in multifunctional areas. This study presents one of the first spatially explicit methodologies to quantify and analyse spatial variation in economic value of landscape services in time, and therefore can contribute to well-informed management of landscapes.

PMGs involve a retailer matching any lower price offered by competition for an identical item. Until now, researchers focused on the scenario where customers can receive the lower price with a simple proof (e.g., weekly flyers). However, in reality, retailers reserve the right to verify the availability at the competitor location; if the product is not available there, then the price-match request might be declined. We develop a price competition model to investigate the effects of verification of availability on price decisions and profit levels of competing retailers. In our model, demand is driven by the availability levels of retailers as well as the price-search cost and store-switching cost incurred by customers. Price-search cost leads to two customer segments: uninformed ones who have no knowledge about prices, and informed ones who are knowledgeable about prices. On the other hand, store-switching cost determines how many customers search for the product at an alternative location because of high price or unavailability at their preferred retailers. Our analysis reveals, among others, that the outcome of availability verification is linked to three factors: price-search cost, store-switching cost, and the reservation prices of customer segments. Verification of availability allows retailers to price discriminate customers who could not be discriminated otherwise, specifically those belonging to the informed customer segment. Furthermore, it is a significant profit-enhancing mechanism only if there are switching customers in the market. Interestingly, even though customers view the verification of availability as a hassle, it can actually result in them paying lower retail prices by increasing the level of retail price competition.","[Nalca, Arcan] Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Boyaci, Tamer; Ray, Saibal] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada",Queens University - Canada; McGill University,"Nalca, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",arcan.nalca@business.queensu.ca; tamer.boyaci@mcgill.ca; saibal.ray@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,28,12,15,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Results indicate that the respondents in all cities have a positive willingness to pay for marine turtle conservation. The type of scope effect and payment vehicle effect considered did not seem to be significant in Beijing, Davao City and Bangkok.

At the same time, the growing competitiveness of the economic environment places demands on the industry to maintain its productivity and profitability. This study develops a method, based on the concept of an environmental performance index (EPI), to measure the economic and environmental performance of irrigated agricultural enterprises. In defining environmental pressure exerted by the irrigation industry the method incorporates certain characteristics of ecological assets affected by water withdrawal for irrigation. As an empirical application, the method was applied to a case study of seventeen natural resource management (NRM) regions within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Data Envelopment Analysis was used to compute the component distance functions in order to construct an EPI for each considered irrigated enterprise in each NRM region.

Sixteen headline indicators have been identified for monitoring the CBD targets. Of these indicators only one, Trends in the abundance and distribution of selected species, is a direct headline indicator of non-exploited biodiversity. In France, the implementation of this indicator is completely dependent on data collected by volunteers. Since this investment of volunteer time is equivalent to savings in administrative costs, we attempt in this paper to assign it a monetary value. This enables us to estimate how much the French administration saves thanks to volunteer efforts and how much public funding would have to be invested if volunteers were no longer willing to participate in these biodiversity monitoring schemes. We estimate this amount to be between 678,523 and 4,415,251 euros per year, depending on the scenario selected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, most research has focused either on environmental services that agriculture provides as a distinct ecosystem or the negative environmental impacts that agriculture imposes. Therefore, there is a great need to re-evaluate the all-round environmental roles of agriculture, to optimize environmental performance of agriculture and non-trade concerns in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. By valuing the environmental externalities of agriculture, this article aims to heighten awareness of the environmental roles of agriculture to stimulate its implication in agricultural policy-making. The study presents estimates of economic values of environmental externalities from rice-wheat farming system in Zhenjiang, in aspects of greenhouse gas emissions, non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration and water containing capacity. We provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, with each step including measurement of physical dimensions and monetary evaluation. The former is based on a large-scale literature review, which provided a vital foundation for the monetary valuation. The results reveal that the values of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land, agricultural non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration by crop and soil, and the flood control function provided by agricultural land are estimated as: -US$3.61 x 10(7) a(-1), -US$4.59 x 10(6)a(-1), + US$2.30 x 10(9) a(-1) and + US$2.21 x 10(7) a(-1), respectively. The net value of environmental externalities is as high as + US$2.28 x 10(9) a(-1), representing 17.87% of local GDP and 4.12 times the total agricultural output value in 2006. The results suggest that crops and soil in Zhenjiang are the most important carbon sinks, and that agriculture in Zhenjiang has huge positive environmental externalities, although both greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land and agricultural non-point sources pollution have negative environmental impacts.

Uncertainty about national population trends and about the taxation multipliers needed to arrive at population totals has made it difficult to answer this question. A direct comparison of the proportion of taxpayers that was urban in 1377 and 1524 suggests that the urban share of population was static or may even have declined in this period. However, such decline provides no simple index of urban prosperity or decay: a decline in urbanization could be the product of rural buoyancy rather than of urban recession.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Rigby, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,154,18,22,1,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Government agencies have to decide on the allocation of limited resources to manage the risk posed by multiple NIS. Bioeconomic modelling has focused on single species and little is known about the optimal management of multiple NIS using a common budget. A comprehensive bioeconomic model that considers the exclusion, detection and control of multiple NIS spreading by stratified dispersal and presenting Allee effects was developed and applied to manage the simultaneous risk posed by Colorado beetle, the bacterium causing potato ring rot and western corn rootworm in the UK. A genetic algorithm was used to study the optimal management under uncertainty. Optimal control methods were used to interpret and verify the genetic algorithm solutions. The results show that government agencies should allocate less exclusion and more control resources to NIS characterised by Allee effects, low rate of satellite colonies generation and that present low propagule pressure. The prioritisation of NIS representative of potential NIS assemblages increases management efficiency. The adoption of management measures based on the risk analysis of a single NIS might not correspond to the optimal allocation of resources when other NIS share a common limited budget. Comprehensive bioeconomic modelling of multiple NIS where Allee effects and stratified dispersal are considered leads to a more cost-effective allocation of limited resources for the management of NIS invasions.

This article develops an analytical framework for exploring the consequences of such choices. This framework is applied to implementation of international nutrient commitments in Norwegian agriculture from 1987 until 2007. Agriculture is the most important source of nitrogen inputs and eutrophication problems in the marine environment in Norway and Europe. It is concluded that, first, the consequences of hard and soft international law depend heavily on how they interact with changing national conditions. Some of these conditions can be deliberately changed to facilitate synergetic interaction between national conditions and international law. Secondly, under favorable conditions soft law can have a significant impact even when costly action is required, and resistance from target groups are strong. These observations are particularly interesting in light of the recent decision to end the soft law North Sea Conference process.","Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Lysaker, Norway",,"Skjærseth, JB (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Lysaker, Norway.",jon.b.skjaerseth@fni.no,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Design/methodology/approach The study described involved sensory analyses and personal responses from different consumers representing the population for who the product is intended. Standard methods were adopted for field and laboratory studies. Findings The experimental studies have shown that appearance, flavour, odour, texture and overall acceptance of farmed salmon is at least as accepted as wild salmon. The sustainability analysis has shown that under the right conditions, sustainability elements may be applied in aquaculture as a means to improve quality and catalyse sustainable food consumption. Practical implications The work was carried out in order to discuss the extent to which the concept of sustainability may apply to food consumption projects.

The goal is to find out if the decision not to consume meat is becoming more prevalent, and to understand in what social categories this is happening, if any. A further aim is to investigate whether meat consumption is strongly associated with gender on the household level. Design/methodology/approach - Expenditure survey data gathered from Finland during the last 40 years was used to identify what kinds of changes were taking place in the consumption of meat and meat products. The independent measures include six variables: the gender of the highest earner in the household (HEH), the type of household, the type of municipality and the income quintile, educational level and age of the HEH. The size of the samples varied between 2,986 and 8,258 households. Findings - The analysis revealed that the decision not to consume meat became prevalent in Finland at the end of the 1970s but the growth rate has somewhat stabilised during recent decades. The gender of the HEH affects the family meat consumption. As non-meat consumption has become more widespread it has also more clearly become a middle-class phenomenon. Originality/value - There are no previous studies available on the development of non-meat consumption from this long-term perspective.","[Vinnari, Markus] Finland Futures Res Ctr, Turku Sch Econ, Tampere, Finland; [Mustonen, Pekka] City Helsinki Urban Facts, Urban Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Rasanen, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Helsinki Inst Informat Technol, Helsinki, Finland",University of Turku; University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Vinnari, M (通讯作者)，Finland Futures Res Ctr, Turku Sch Econ, Tampere, Finland.",markus.vinnari@tse.fi,"Mustonen, Pekka/AAI-8841-2021","Räsänen, Pekka/0000-0001-7472-6355; Vinnari, Markus/0000-0003-2258-8282",,,,,58,24,24,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

An increase in police protection of a jurisdiction diverts crime to other jurisdictions when only public crime prevention such as police protection is available. However, residents also invest in private prevention (private security, burglar alarms, etc.), and the value of these measures depends on the level of local public protection. In a spatial context, an increase in public prevention of a jurisdiction not only alters the incentives of individuals of the jurisdiction, but also of other jurisdictions as well, and such a change in private crime prevention may end up attracting crime to the jurisdiction. An increase in public prevention of a jurisdiction thus may divert or attract crime.

Approaches to choosing discount rates are generally placed into two categories: the descriptive approach and the prescriptive approach. The descriptive approach is often justified on grounds that it uses a description of how society discounts instead of having analysts impose their own discounting views on society. This paper analyzes the common forms of the descriptive and prescriptive approaches and finds that, in contrast with customary thinking. both forms are equally descriptive and prescriptive. The prescriptions concern who has standing (i.e. who is included) in society. how the views of these individuals are measured, and how the measurements are aggregated. Such prescriptions are necessary to choose from among the many possible descriptions of how society discounts. The descriptions are the measurements made given a choice of measurement technique. Thus, the labels descriptive approach and prescriptive approach are deeply misleading, as analysts cannot avoid imposing their own views on society. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The central ingredients of the model are two important characteristics of advertising-targeting, and noisy information content. The theory yields interesting results about the informational role of targeted advertising, and its consequences. First, targeting can itself serve as a signal on product attributes. Second, the effectiveness of targeting depends not only on firms knowing consumer preferences, but on consumers knowing that firms know this. This creates a distinction between strategies of targeting and personalization. Third, the effectiveness of targeting in equilibrium may (far) exceed the information contained directly in the targeted message. Fourth, information content is not, however, superfluous. Specifically, when ads contain no information, a targeting equilibrium does not exist. Together, these results reveal how advertising conveys information both through the content of the message and the firm's choice of advertising medium. Furthermore, the model is robust to the various critiques of prior work on ads-as-signals: namely, that ad content is irrelevant, ad exposure is unnecessary, and the choice of ads as signals is inherently arbitrary.","[Shachar, Ron] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Anand, Bharat N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Shachar, Ron] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Tel Aviv University; Harvard University; Duke University,"Shachar, R (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",banand@hbs.edu; rroonn@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,26,44,59,3,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In a setup that closely resembles linear and probit regressions, this paper shows that when the monopoly seller is restricted to using one metric and no price discrimination cost exists, the pricing metric that best reduces the residual variance of buyers' willingness-to-pay is the one that maximizes revenue. Equivalently, the explanatory power of willingness-to-pay is the ordering criterion. This paper also shows that this criterion is not universally true when willingness-to-pay follows other distributions. When the seller incurs price discrimination costs associated with different metrics, the ordering criterion becomes the explanatory power of each pricing metric divided by its cost. This paper also discusses how to apply this model to solve real-world pricing problems with contingent valuation models or using probit regression.","[Huang, Ke-Wei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Huang, Ke-Wei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Informat Syst, Singapore 117543, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Huang, KW (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, SoC1 05-21,Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",huangkw@comp.nus.edu.sg,"Huang, Kewei/S-3939-2019","Huang, Ke-Wei/0000-0002-9932-6195",,,,,41,2,2,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Clearly the protection of environmental amenities is important, but what is the right balance between ecosystem protection and regional economic processes that simultaneously respond to and degrade ecological resources? We consider this question in the context of households that are attracted to a region by urban and lake amenities and a lake ecosystem that becomes degraded by land development. An analytical expression for the time evolution of population is derived from households' and firms' optimizing behaviors. Numerical methods with phase plane diagrams are used to study the steady state and transient dynamics of the resulting population-phosphorus coupled system. The system is found to be bi-stable under a range of parameter values with one attractor corresponding to a desired balanced economy-ecology state and the other to a very small population base with fully restored ecology. We examine the dynamics and quantify the resilience of the system in and away from the balanced steady state using phase plane diagrams that demarcate the two domains of attraction. Economic-ecological interactions fundamentally alter regional economic dynamics and influence the resilience of the balanced domain of attraction, For example, a one percent increase in the loadings coefficient associated with residential land development generates a three percent decline in the resilience of the balanced state. We find that economic feedbacks often increase system resilience. Initial increases in the attraction of urban amenities spur greater population growth that increases the resilience of the balanced state. In addition, price feedbacks that arise from capitalized (dis)amenities increase the resilience of the system to bad ecological shocks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, socio-economic scenarios project an increase in urbanization in flood prone areas, which results in a higher damage potential. The combined effect of climate and land use change on flood risks requires innovative adaptation policies to cope with rising risks. Increasingly, attention is paid to the role insurance can play in mitigating damage by providing incentives to policyholders to undertake damage reducing measures. The willingness of homeowners in the Netherlands to undertake measures that mitigate flood damage in exchange for benefits on hypothetical flood insurance policies is examined using surveys. The results indicate that many homeowners are willing to make investments in mitigation. In particular, approximately two-thirds are willing to invest in water barriers in exchange for a premium reduction and about a fifth are willing to replace floor types that are vulnerable to flooding with water resistant floor types. Furthermore, about a quarter are willing to move central heating installations to floors safe against flooding in favor of a reduction in the insurance premium. Estimates of the effectiveness of these mitigation measures to limit potential flood damage in the river delta indicate that prevented damage could be substantial, namely in the order of I billion euro or larger. Reductions in (absolute) flood risk due to mitigation are especially large under climate change. A probit model indicates that existing arrangements for compensating flood damage, risk awareness and perceptions, and geographical characteristics are important determinants in the decision to undertake mitigation.

Much focus has been on services of the public good type, and instruments like payments for environmental services. We extend this work to consider the possible social gains from supporting development of new markets for nature-based recreational goods, which may alleviate negative externalities caused by congestion problems. Our three main questions are: i) Why is there a lack of market development? ii) Can there be social gains from intervention and supporting the development of such markets? And iii) if so, then how could such intervention be best performed? We use a two-stage non-cooperative Bayesian simultaneous-move game model and show that in spite of apparent potential first-mover advantages in a developing market, demand uncertainty and sunk costs may equally well result in widespread presence of non-movers on the supplier side. We show that social gains can be made from offering a subsidy towards the sunk costs. Analysing three possible subsidy schemes, we show a) that fixed costs may make rationing optimal, b) that sequential rationing does not necessarily dominate strict rationing because c) the more subsidies are offered, the larger each subsidy must be to induce participation, and that d) the longer a single agent on the market may keep market information to himself, the better a non-rationing scheme will perform relative to rationing schemes. Finally, e) subsidies for second-mover entry may be optimal in some cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from the United States,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Physician gatekeeper; Health maintenance organization; Physician behavior,PRIMARY-CARE PHYSICIANS; MANAGED CARE; HEALTH PLANS; BACKLASH; COST,"Since the mid-1980s, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have grown rapidly in the United States. But despite initial successes in constraining health care costs, they have come under increasing criticism for their restrictive practices. This suggests that, to remain viable, HMOs must change their behavior. Yet few studies offer empirical evidence on the matter. The present study investigates one cost-containment mechanism often associated with HMOs: the assignment of primary care physicians as gatekeepers (who, among other things, monitor patients' use of specialist physicians). In particular, we estimate the effect of physician-HMO involvement on the percentage of HMO patients for whom physicians serve as gatekeepers. We examine this relationship over two time periods: 2000-2001 and 2004-2005. Because physicians can choose whether and to what extent they participate in HMOs, we employ instrumental variables (IV) estimation to correct for the endogeneity of the HMO measure. Although the single-equation estimates suggest that HMO assignment of physician gatekeepers diminished modestly over time, the endogeneity-corrected estimates show no change between the two time periods. Thus, one major tool used by HMOs to constrain health care costs-the physician gatekeeper-has not declined even in a period of backlash against managed care.","[Fang, Hai] Univ Miami, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Liu, Hong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",University of Miami; Central University of Finance & Economics; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Fang, H (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Hlth Econ Res Grp, 5665 Ponce de Leon Blvd,Flipse Bldg,Room 120, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",hfang@miami.edu; liuhong@cufe.edu.cn; john.rizzo@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,33,7,13,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The analysis with the application of dynamic panel data reveals that there isn't a Kuznets type relationship between environmental efficiency and income. Allowing for dynamic effects we find that the adjustment to the target ratio is instantaneous. We also find that increased economic activity does not always ensure environmental protection and thus the path of growth is important in addition to the growth itself. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

They simultaneously contribute and respond to the formation of public opinion. In this paper, we investigate to what extent stakeholder attitudes and interests help explain national conceptions of sustainable agriculture and how these conceptions diverge between countries with different agricultural policies. For that purpose, we conducted two stakeholder perception surveys in Switzerland and New Zealand. The data analysis revealed that there are significant differences in perception between the two countries. While Swiss respondents felt that Swiss agriculture is already quite sustainable and that international trade and new technologies are likely to render it less sustainable, New Zealand respondents generally thought that economic and technological change is necessary to make agriculture more sustainable. The conservative Swiss attitude is in accordance with the country's defensive agricultural policy while the more progressive New Zealand attitude is clearly linked to its need to reconcile agricultural sustainability with national competitiveness.

However, intensification of the traditional pasture-based system has occurred over the last decade and has not always been accompanied by increased efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to produce an updated reference of the eco-efficiency of NZ dairy farm systems and to analyse the implications of intensification on their eco-efficiency. Results for an average NZ dairy farm system were compared with those for three dairy farmlet systems representing a wide range in intensification practices. A low input system (LI) (no N fertiliser, no brought-in feed supplement, stocking rate of 2.3 cows/ha) was compared with an N-fertilised farm system (NF) (170 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year, 3 cows/ha) representing a first level of intensification and with an N-fertilised and maize silage supplemented system (NFMS) (170 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year, 13 t DM maize silage/ha/year, 5.2 cows/ha), representing a possible future intensification option. Their eco-efficiency in terms of milk production and land use was compared using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. NZ dairy farm systems rely on favourable temperate climate conditions and long-term perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture, to achieve eco-efficient milk production and land use compared to European systems. However, intensification of NZ dairy farms was shown to be detrimental to their eco-efficiency in terms both of milk production and land use functions and could greatly reduce their advantage compared to European systems. The eco-efficiency of LI was very high whatever the functional unit which is remarkable from an LCA perspective. NF and NFMS had a similar eco-efficiency except for energy use which corresponded to the most critical hot spot of NFMS. All studied NZ systems presented some areas for improvement where some new technologies available for dairy farms might play a promising role in the future. Finally, it should be highlighted that the comparison with European studies based on the literature available needs validation through a more comprehensive study using harmonised methodology and assumptions across countries.

This method yields reliable information when input data is sufficient; however, in uncertain systems Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used as a means to compensate for insufficient data. The MC optimization model was constructed from environmental emissions, process parameters and operation constraints. The results of MC optimization allow for the prediction of environmental performance and the opportunity for environmental improvement. The case study presented here focuses on the acidification improvement regarding uncertain emissions and on the available operation of Taiwan's power plants. The boundary definitions of LCA were established for generation, fuel refining and mining. The model was constructed according to objective functional minimization of acidification potential, base loading, fuel cost and generation mix constraints. Scenario simulations are given the different variation of fuel cost ratios for Taiwan. The simulation results indicate that fuel cost was the most important parameter influencing the acidification potential for seven types of fired power. Owing to the low operational loading, coal-fired power is the best alternative for improving acidification. The optimal scenario for acidification improvement occurred at 15% of the fuel cost. The impact decreased from 1.39 to 1.24 kg SO2-eq/MWh. This reduction benefit was about 10.5% lower than the reference year. Regarding eco-efficiency at an optimum scenario level of 5%, the eco-efficiency value was -12.4 $US/kg SO2-eq. Considering the environmental and economical impacts, results indicated that the ratio of coal-fired steam turbine should be reduced. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Based on ecosystem services, we developed a Benifit and Cost Analysis model to balance the conflicts between economic income and environmental loss caused by mariculture activities. This model not only calculates market income of mariculture but also monetizes the positive and negative effects of mariculture activities on ecosystem services. In this model, three indices, the NPV (Net Present Value), BCR (Benefit to Cost Ratio) and RC (Relative Coefficent) with consideration of discount rate, are developed to assess and prioritize the candidate mariculture modes. This Benefit and Cost Analysis model was applied to Sanggou Bay, one typical mariculture bay in China, to identify sustainable mariculture mode. In this paper, we find that benefit and cost analysis based on ecosystem services value provides a convenient and effective tool to compare different exploitation modes of marine ecosystem.

The findings of this research tend to highlight the importance of non-income aspects of individuals' life conditions. These findings are strongly complementary to themes within the sustainable development discourse. Firstly, they suggest ways in which we might consume less without compromising on our current levels of LS. And secondly, they help demonstrate the immediate LS benefits that could be gained from higher levels of environmental quality (EQ). However, the empirical evidence for the link between EQ and LS is, to date, somewhat weak, due in part to a lack of EQ data at a level of detail to match the individual-by-individual resolution of LS measures. This small, exploratory study therefore seeks to assess how the use of EQ data at very high spatial resolution could advance the empirical literature examining connections between LS and EQ levels, focusing on air quality in particular. It collects original survey data for approximately 400 Londoners, and uses geographical information system (GIS) software to calculate pollutant concentrations in the immediate vicinity of their homes. It uses this data to estimate maximum likelihood regression models explaining LS ratings in terms of a range of individual, household and local variables. Both perceived and measured air pollution levels are significantly negatively associated with the LS of the survey respondents, even when controlling for a wide range of other effects. An increase of 10 mu g/M-3 in annual mean nitrogen dioxide concentration appears to correspond on average to a drop of nearly half a point of LS on an 11-point rating scale. These findings cannot yet be generalised with confidence. However, if they were confirmed by larger future studies, they would appear to strengthen and extend existing arguments in favour of policies to reduce urban air pollution, framed both in terms of conventional economic efficiency analyses, and in wider political and ethical (and potentially legal) terms.

However, the border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have the highest rates of uninsurance in the US, accounting for over 30% of the total US uninsured population. We use survey data from the fourth wave of the Border Epidemiologic Study on Aging (BESA), a survey from a predominantly Mexican American region of South Texas from 2005 to 2006, to analyze how health insurance coverage in the US is related to the use of health care services in Mexico. BESA includes data on the use of health care services in the US and Mexico. We estimate probit models to investigate the association between having insurance coverage in the US and having a regular doctor in Mexico, the independent variable of interest. Separate models are estimated with having private insurance, Medicare Part B insurance, and any type of public insurance as dependent variables. We deal with the endogeneity, due to reverse causality, of having a regular doctor in Mexico by using instrumental variables in a bivariate probit model. The instruments are dental care utilization in Mexico and a variable measuring frequently visiting Mexico. The results show that competition from Mexico lowers the demand for health insurance coverage in the US side of the border.","[Brown, H.

Investigating the role of embodied technical change,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Embodied technical change; Natural disasters; Economic impacts,,"It has been suggested that disasters might have positive economic consequences, through the accelerated replacement of capital. This possibility is referred to as the productivity effect. This effect is investigated using a model with embodied technical change. in this framework, disasters can influence the production level but cannot influence the growth rate, in the same way than the saving ratio in a Solow-like model. Depending on reconstruction quality, indeed, accounting for embodied technical change can either decrease or increase disaster costs, but is never able to turn disasters into positive events. Moreover, a better but slower reconstruction amplifies the short-term consequences of disasters, but pays off over the long-term. Regardless, the productivity effect cannot prevent the existence of a bifurcation when disaster damages exceed the reconstruction capacity, potentially leading to poverty traps.

The information could be used for the development of long-term strategies for local organic market development based on the consumer profile information of buyers at the organic market, as well as its evolution and motivations that moved them to start and to continue purchasing organic products. In order to identify reliable trends and potential changes in the quantity and quality of the profile of the organic consumer, could the information also be be used for local market developments strategies. Design/methodology/approach - A total of six studies were conducted at Costa Rica's largest local organic farmers; market La Feria del Trueque, during the same period every year during the month of February, covering an eight-year period. The six surveys became three mega databases: one for the 1999/2000 period, another for the 2004/2005 and one finally for the 2007/2008 period. Findings - The study finds that the organic consumer is Usually highly educated, has a high income, is concerned with health and environmental problems, has a smaller than average family with men being more involved in the purchase of organic products and living in suburbia rather than from the metropolitan areas. Practical implications - After a decade of expansion, the Costa Rican organic products market is starting to show signs of consolidation. However, the volume, the available varieties and guaranteed supply will decide the future direction of the market. Relocating the market closer to the consumer will benefit the overall sales. Originality/value - The paper gives an in-depth insight into the organic market of today and is a valuable addition to the present literature.","CAMSA Consulting Serv, San Jose, Costa Rica",,"González, JAA (通讯作者)，CAMSA Consulting Serv, San Jose, Costa Rica.",jaguirre@racsa.co.cr,"Gonzalez, Juan Antonio/GQY-8281-2022",,,,,,23,20,21,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The study decomposes organic farming into its main quality aspects and measures consumers' preference structure for organic, in general, and for specific organic quality traits in particular. Design/methodology/approach - By means of stated choice preference modelling, the following hypotheses are tested: consumers prefer health over environment related quality traits; the organic label plays a significant role in consumers' choice for organic products; organic farming is perceived as healthier and more environmentally friendly than conventional farming; purchase intention is mainly driven by health related quality traits; both health and environmental concerns influence purchase frequency, though to a different extent. The choice experiment was completed by 527 participants, with four repetitions per participant. Findings - The health-related traits score better than environmental traits in shaping consumer preference for organic vegetables. Consumers prefer organic products over B-branded products, but not over A-branded products, which suggests that consumers classify organic products among other quality niche products. However, they attribute a better score to the health and environment related quality traits of organic products, indicating a difference in quality cues between organic products and quality products in general. Price becomes less important, whereas presence of an organic label becomes more important with increasing buying intensity of organic vegetables. Undesirable traits, such as pesticide residue levels trigger a stronger response than desirable traits, such as environmental or health benefits. Original value - The measurement of the role of health and environment quality traits in consumers' decision to buy organic or not is of relevance given the current debate on the factual differences between organic and conventional vegetables. Furthermore, the use of the stated choice preference to test the hypotheses is original and relevant.","[Mondelaers, Koen; Verbeke, Wim; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Mondelaers, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Koen.Mondelaers@UGent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",,,,,35,112,120,3,82,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Probes enable to control the process performance aligning it to the company's strategic goals. Probes offer a real time monitoring of the strategic goals achievement, also increasing the understanding of the maintenance activities.

One example is the effect of population size on CO2 emissions, which is concluded to be very close to 1 in some studies (e.g.. York et al., 2003) while far from 1 in others (e.g., Shi, 2003). What can explain these differences in results? In the present paper, I offer an alternative model equivalent to STIRPAT, which explicitly specifies the different role of technology (T) in STIRPAT from IPAT. By the alternative model, I conclude that different functional forms of STIRPAT can be one explanation for the difference among estimates in the studies on environmental impacts of population and affluence.

We posit four types of axioms: indication (of efficient production bundles), monotonicity, independence of units of measurement, and continuity (in technologies as well as input and output quantities). Impossibility results establish a tension between indication and continuity. We focus on seven well-known inefficiency indexes from the operations-research and economics literature, establishing the properties they satisfy-and do not satisfy-on a general class of technologies satisfying minimal regularity conditions and on the subset of these technologies satisfying convexity. We also discuss several other indexes that are dominated by or very similar to these seven indexes. The set of properties satisfied by these indexes elucidates the trade-offs faced in selecting among the indexes.","[Russell, R.

The article argues that the CDM has a relatively high degree of output-oriented legitimacy resulting in effectiveness and some input-oriented legitimacy, with few discernible tradeoffs between them. In contrasting this to REDD+, the hypotheses are advanced that (i) output-oriented legitimacy/effectiveness can again be achieved but that (ii) a higher degree of input-oriented legitimacy is necessary for REDD+ and thus also a certain trade-off between the two forms of legitimacy can be expected. This is shown through comparing the technologies and methodologies, economic rationales, political support, regulatory structures, and environmental impacts of both instruments.

However, effects of governance structure, trading system and possible policy interventions in the permits' allocation are not yet well analysed and understood. This paper explores in how far tradable fertilisation standards can be seen as a concentration permit trading (CPT) system which can be fine-tuned for further policy intervention. Indeed fertilisation standards such as obliged by the EU Nitrate Directive can be regarded as local nitrate emissions limits, and thus concentration permits. A multi-agent spatial allocation model is used to simulate the impact of defining the manure problem in terms of concentration permits rather than conventional emission permits. Impacts are simulated in terms of environmental performance and increased reallocation costs. The model is applied on the Flemish manure problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article finds that none of those assertions hold. The companies devised political strategies that maneuvered a reluctant President Roosevelt into supporting their interests, and the Mexican government more than fully compensated them as a result.

A roadmap to 2050,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon intensity target; Binding emissions caps; Post-Copenhagen climate negotiations; China; United States; India,TRADE; CAP,"Balancing China's energy needs to fuel its rapid economic growth with the resulting potential impacts of climate change presents an enormous climate policy dilemma, not simply for China but for the entire world. This is the major reason why the role of China is an issue of perennial concerns at international climate change negotiations. In response to these concerns and to put China in a positive position, this paper maps out a realistic roadmap for China's specific climate commitments toward 2050. Taking many factors into consideration, the paper argues that China needs to take on absolute emissions caps around 2030. However, it is hard to imagine how China could apply the brakes so sharply as to switch from rapid emissions growth to immediate emissions cuts, without passing through several intermediate phases. To that end, the paper envisions that China needs the following three transitional periods of increasing climate obligations before taking on absolute emissions caps that will lead to the global convergence of per capita emissions by 2050: First, further credible energy conservation commitments starting in 2013 and aimed at cutting China's carbon intensity by 46-50% by 2020; second, voluntary no lose emission targets starting in 2018; and third, binding carbon intensity targets as its international commitment starting in 2023. Overall, this proposal is a balanced reflection of respecting China's rights to grow and recognizing China's growing responsibility for increasing greenhouse gas emissions as China is on its way to becoming the world's largest economy.","[Zhang, Zhongxiang] East West Ctr, Res Program, Honolulu, HI 96848 USA; [Zhang, Zhongxiang] Fudan Univ, Ctr Energy Econ & Strategy Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhongxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",East West Center; Fudan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development,"Zhang, ZX (通讯作者)，East West Ctr, Res Program, 1601 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96848 USA.",ZhangZ@EastWestCenter.org,"Zhang, ZhongXiang/KBB-1443-2024","Zhang, ZhongXiang/0000-0003-3479-8666",,,,,50,21,22,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In a first stage by using DEA window analysis countries' economic efficiencies are obtained. In a second stage an econometric analysis based on robust GMM estimators reveals an inverted 'U'-shape relationship between oil consumption and economic efficiency. In order to capture heterogeneities among countries' development stages the analysis has been separated into two groups (advanced economies and developing/emerging economies). The results show that advanced economies have much higher turning points compared to emerging and developing economies. It appears that oil consumption increases countries' economic efficiency. In addition the consumption patterns of oil products and its derivatives have changed through years and among countries. The different turning points from the econometric analysis indicate the dependence of oil consumption in advanced economies (higher turning points) is driven mainly by household purchasing activities and their standards of living (transport, housing and water, food, etc.). Finally, it appears that oil consumption is the main driver behind the progress of industrialization and urbanization regardless of the country's development stage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The law of one price implies no persistent price pattern for identical assets sold sequentially. Nonetheless, the auction and nonauction literatures reveal conditions leading to sales sequence effects on prices. This paper examines price evolution in the condominium market where similar units are sold sequentially in a setting with minimal consumption risk. The results indicate no pervasive sequence-price relationship for sequential sales of similar property units.","[Munneke, Henry] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Ooi, Joseph T.

To do so, we develop a framework where workers have heterogeneous skills and where in-migration expands the range of available skills in the economy. In the short run, this expansion leads to productivity gains, which may more than offset the negative endowment effects of a larger labor supply so that all workers may be better off. In the long run, in-migration impacts wages further by altering the workers' incentives to acquire skills, thereby affecting the wage structure indirectly by changing the economy's skill composition. Since the short and the long-run effects of in-migration on wages may differ, compositional changes may be an important element to take into consideration. A numerical illustration calibrated on U. S. data suggests that the immigration of skilled workers negatively affects the incentives for domestic skill formation, thereby suggesting that endowment effects dominate externalities. We finally extend the model to cope with the simultaneous impacts that migration and skill formation have on the host and the source region, and we show that more migration increases wage disparities and the skill gap across regions.","[Behrens, Kristian] Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Sato, Yasuhiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Osaka, Japan",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Osaka University,"Behrens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",behrens.kristian@uqam.ca; ysato@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Sato, Yasuhiro/0000-0001-9947-1539",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21330055] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,33,14,17,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Also, the paper aims to examine the web content structure of confectioners in the given region and to explain the impact of the location and the size of the company on the quality of contents published on web sites. Design/methodology/approach - The experimental research was conducted on the sample of 333 companies in the confectionery industry from 5 SEE countries. The research questionnaire included 56 web sites' characteristics divided into five categories. Findings - The confectionery industry uses web sites as presentation space only, and the show-case is the main purpose. The implementation of the web in the confectionery industry in SEE countries is correlated with a company's characteristics. Companies within EU member countries more often implement the web as a customer communication channel. However, confectioners in non-EU countries have more information published on their web sites and their web sites are more interactive. Originality/value - The paper contributes to a better understanding of web usage within the confectionery industry because it classifies information published on web sites into several categories and describes common web contents in the confectionery industry. Moreover, it discusses the correlation between a company's characteristics (size and location) and web implementation. Finally, it gives an overview of relevant findings of web usage as a customer communication channel within transitional economies.","[Knezevic, Blazenka; Renko, Sanda; Bach, Mirjana Pejic] Univ Zagreb, Dept Trade, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Knezevic, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Dept Trade, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",bknezevic@efzg.hr,"Knezevic, Blazenka/A-5108-2013; Bach, Mirjana Pejić/E-7313-2012; Soucie, Sanda/P-9187-2016","Knezevic, Blazenka/0000-0003-1509-3126; Bach, Mirjana Pejić/0000-0003-3899-6707; Soucie, Sanda/0000-0002-9529-7534",,,,,32,4,4,1,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The self help groups have paved the way to the rural women for economic sustainability and independence. Majority of the rural women of SHGs are Micro - Entrepreneurs very few are associated with Small Scale Enterprises. Those women are not only developing with sustainable economy but also able to develop other women economically sustainable by providing job opportunities. The rural women entrepreneurs with the sustainable economic development are able to contribute to the family's, community's and the nation's development.

The main goal of the tests was to investigate the possibility to use air flow to sort the buckwheat grains by varying the buckwheat grain flow, the slanting air flow rate and angle, and to determine the rational parameters for the buckwheat grain grading. The tests have been executed using the method adopted by the Agricultural machinery department. The critical rate of the buckwheat grains has been determined prior to the buckwheat grain sorting tests using the air flow. Analyzing the test results 1000 grain mass of the buckwheat collected in the individual boxes has been estimated. The tests defined that average critical rate of the buckwheat grains Smuglianka was (v(k.vid) = 8.96 m s(-1)), and the flight coefficient was 0.33. To sort the buckwheat grains with air flow its rate should not exceed 0.9 kg.(m.s)(-1), the recommended air flow rate is approximately 10 m.s(-1), the impact of the air flow angle is insignificant. Suitable selection of the parameters of buckwheat grains and air flow makes it possible to use the air flow for buckwheat grain grading, and to use the seeds blown into the first two boxes for the sowing.","[Vaiciukevicius, Edvardas; Sarauskis, Egidijus; Straksas, Anicetas; Jonusis, Darius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Agr Machinery, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,edvardas.vaiciukevicius@asu.lt; egidijus.sarauskis@asu.lt; zum.katedra@asu.lt; dariusjonusis@yahoo.com,"Sarauskis, Egidijus/AAD-8552-2019","Sarauskis, Egidijus/0000-0001-9339-769X",,,,,9,1,1,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,469,473,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000076,0

In this paper, we describe how an integrated Deliberative Multi-Criteria Evaluation (DMCE) and fuzzy set approach can tackle these two issues in the analysis of alternative risk management strategies, using the example of European House Borer (EHB, Hylotrupes bajulus Linnaeus). DMCE offers a platform for stakeholders to interact and to make a trade-off decision between multiple goals based on social learning and deliberation. The fuzzy set approach, applied within a DMCE framework, explicitly incorporates the inherent uncertainty in estimating potential EHB impacts and in evaluating participants' subjective preferences. This integrated method, therefore, provides a promising approach for tackling the dual challenges of competing goals and uncertainty in the evaluation of invasive species risk management options.

The long-run estimates indicate that there is a statistically significant negative association between nuclear energy consumption and emissions, but a statistically significant positive relationship between emissions and renewable energy consumption. The results from the panel Granger causality tests suggest that in the short-run nuclear energy consumption plays an important role in reducing CO2 emissions whereas renewable energy consumption does not contribute to reductions in emissions. This may be due to the lack of adequate storage technology to overcome intermittent supply problems as a result electricity producers have to rely on emission generating energy sources to meet peak load demand.

Farmers can also produce a variety of non-commodity ecosystem services for which markets do not exist or are imperfectly formed. Such services may be valued by society, but due to their nature or institutional arrangements, farmers often do not receive a price signal for them. This results in inefficient allocations of resources, in that farmers under-produce non-commodity ecosystem services. One possible way to increase private investment in ecosystem services is to create a market for them. We draw lessons from six different markets for providing ecosystem services from farms (water quality trading, wetland mitigation, carbon cap-and-trade, over-the-counter carbon, eco-labeling, and fee hunting) on what is required for a market to function, and the problems these markets might face.

In addition, attention is asked for other aspects of sustainability economics, namely the distinction weak/strong sustainability, spatial sustainability and sustainable trade, distinctive sustainability policy, and the ideas of early sustainability economists. I argue that both sustainability and externalities reflect a systems perspective and propose that effective sustainability solutions require that more attention is given to system feedbacks, notably other-regarding preferences and social interactions, and energy and environmental rebound.

Both an innovation function and a production function augmented with dummy endogenous innovation are estimated. Three estimators which control for endogeneity of the dummy innovation are employed: the first is a maximum likelihood estimator of the equations' system while the other two are built in the instrumental variables framework. These estimators give useful complementary information because of the usual efficiency-robustness tradeoff comparing system-equations and single-equation estimators. We find that innovation is frequent in Knowledge Intensive Business Services and has a strong and positive effect on productivity. As in manufacturing, the main determinant of innovation is formal knowledge resulting from R&D or from acquisitions of equipment, patents or licenses.","[Musolesi, Antonio; Huiban, Jean-Pierre] INRA CESAER, UMR1041, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Musolesi, Antonio] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Huiban, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 12, ERUDITE, F-94010 Creteil, France",Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; INRAE; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Musolesi, A (通讯作者)，INRA CESAER, UMR1041, 26 Bd Dr Petitjean, F-21079 Dijon, France.",amusolesi@enesad.inra.fr,,,,,,,70,56,60,2,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In the Netherlands, however, two EE-related policy concepts, Environmental Utilisation Space and Ecological Footprint, were strongly present in environmental policy during certain periods in time, but subsequently disappeared from the environmental agenda. The central question of this article is how these ups and downs of the EE concepts can be understood: which factors determine their rise on and fall from the policy agenda over time? To answer this question, this article offers a conceptual model informed by the approaches in political science on framing, agenda-setting and knowledge utilisation. We conclude that the interplay of concept-specific characteristics, the formation of coalitions around the concept and contextual variables explain the rise and fall of the aforementioned concepts. A match between the dominant policy frame and the core elements of the concept provides the opportunity for the two concepts to be pushed on the agenda. We observe the alternation of 'constraining' frames, which allows for EE concepts to survive, and 'reconciling' frames, which block agenda entrance for EE concepts. Furthermore, the alternation of these frames seems to correlate with economic and public environmental attention cycles in the Netherlands. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

Sustainability appraisal methods, which open up dialogue and options before closing down and making suggestions, pay attention to the inclusion of various and conflicting points of view and address uncertainty, are increasingly used in the science, environment and energy policy domains. The quality of the process is seen as key to high quality appraisal outcomes. Dimensions of quality include learning opportunities which are seen as ways for addressing complexity and uncertainty. Participatory sustainability appraisal methods intend to support social learning among participants. Despite high expectations, social learning processes in sustainability appraisals are poorly conceptualized and empirically understudied.

These benefits' economic values, however, are poorly recognized and often ignored by landowners and planners. We use hedonic property price modeling to estimate urban tree cover's value in Dakota and Ramsey Counties, MN, USA, predicting housing value as a function of structural, neighborhood, and environmental variables, including tree cover, using a spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) error model. We measure tree cover as percent tree cover on parcels, and within 100, 250, 500, 750. and 1000 m. Results show that tree cover within 100 and 250 m is positive and statistically significant. A 10% increase in tree cover within 100 m increases average home sale price by $1371 (0.48%) and within 250 m increases sale price by $836 (0.29%). In a model including both linear and squared tree cover terms, tree cover within 100 and 250 m increases sale price to 40-60% tree cover.

To consider this problem, we investigated the implications of China's national and regional policies related to the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) for poverty in the dryland regions of northern Shaanxi Province. We found that 34.9, 47.0, and 59.8% of farmers, livestock grazers, and forest workers respectively, felt that their livelihoods had been adversely affected by the NFCP due to the ban on logging and grazing imposed by this program, and they perceived additional economic losses because they were not adequately compensated for their economic losses under the program. These perceptions are supported by economic data. In addition, our results showed that the poorer the survey respondent, the greater the likelihood they believed that they had suffered from the implementation of the NFCP. Although Chinese citizens have become more favorable towards environmental conservation efforts, the poorest citizens still need considerable help to make it possible for them to participate in both economic development and environmental restoration.

The majority of PES programs have been implemented in situations where the institutional framework and property rights are strong and target the behaviours of private landowners. By contrast, this paper compares three PES programs from a forest landscape in Cambodia, where land and resource rights are poorly defined, governance is poor, species populations are low and threats are high. The programs vary in the extent to which payments are made directly to individuals or to villages and the degree of involvement of local management institutions. The programs were evaluated against three criteria: the institutional arrangements, distribution of costs and benefits, and the conservation results observed. The most direct individual contracts had the simplest institutional arrangements, the lowest administrative costs, disbursed significant payments to individual villagers making a substantial contribution to local livelihoods, and rapidly protected globally significant species. However, this program also failed to build local management organisations or understanding of conservation goals. By contrast the programs that were managed by local organisations were slower to become established but crucially were widely understood and supported by local people, and were more institutionally effective. PES programs may therefore be more sustainable when they act to empower local institutions and reinforce intrinsic motivations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate Cobb-Douglas production functions by using new panel data for all Finnish publicly listed firms during 1992-2002. The data enable us to distinguish broad-based option plans, for which all employees are eligible, from those selectively allocated to particular employees. For both type of schemes, our baseline fixed effects estimators consistently find statistically insignificant associations with firm productivity. When endogeneity of production inputs and option-schemes are taken into account we continue to find no evidence of a link with firm productivity. Our main findings are consistent with hypotheses that predict negligible effects of option plans for enterprise performance, such as those based on free riding, psychological expectancy theory, accounting myopia, or rent-seeking. We consider reasons why our empirical findings on the impact of broad-based options differ from those found in earlier studies.","[Kalmi, Panu; Makinen, Mikko] Helsinki Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Kalmi, Panu; Makinen, Mikko] HECER, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Jones, Derek C.] Hamilton Coll, Dept Econ, Clinton, NY 13323 USA",Aalto University; Hamilton College,"Mäkinen, M (通讯作者)，Helsinki Sch Econ, Dept Econ, POB 1210, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",djones@hamilton.edu; kalmi@hse.fi; mikko.makinen@hse.fi,,"Makinen, Mikko/0000-0001-5898-5277",,,,,47,10,11,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Design/methodology/approach - The research comprised a face-to-face survey with 403 beer consumers. The respondents were divided into four groups regarding CA experiment (familiar/unfamiliar beer brand in combination with presence or absence of beer. tasting). CA validity was measured with five criteria: face validity, convergent validity, internal validity, predictive validity and subjective evaluation of conjoint task. In addition to the CA experiment, a structured questionnaire was used consisting of a few questions regarding respondents' socio-economic characteristics, beer purchasing, and consuming behaviour. Findings - The research results confirmed that tasting as an additional presentation method has significant influence On validity of CA. However, the results of the study indicate that tasting should be used as a stimulus presentation method for CA with food and beverage products/brands, which are unfamiliar to the consumers. When testing familiar brands and brands with established perceptions, simpler and less expensive verbal stimulus presentation can be used. Practical implications - According to the research results, it could be concluded that when performing CA with strong familiar brands, it is not necessary to use CA with tasting since tasting increases research complexity and. costs and it does not achieve better results. However, tasting as a stimuli presentation method gives better results than pure verbal CA in the case of unfamiliar brands. Originality/value - The paper is one of the first to deal with tasting as a presentation method in conjoint analysis and its results have direct implications for the future use of CA with food and beverages.","[Cerjak, Marija; Kovacic, Damir] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Mkt, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Haas, Rainer] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Mkt & Innovat, Vienna, Austria","University of Zagreb; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Cerjak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Mkt, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",mcerjak@agr.hr,"Haas, Rainer/A-1571-2013; Cerjak, Marija/AFS-5955-2022","Cerjak, Marija/0000-0003-0696-4364; Haas, Rainer/0000-0002-7854-8960",,,,,49,17,24,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose is to find out how power affects information sharing and collaboration between buyers and suppliers. Both demand and supply perspectives are utilized, and the value net approach is combined with research on supply management and market orientation. Design/methodology/approach - The case study method was used in order to analyze relationships and information sharing in the Finnish food industry. A 29 semi-structured interviews were conducted in four case companies. Findings - The results indicate that value net actors in the supplier role are willing to form collaborative relationships, but when they are in the role of the buyer the willingness to collaborate weakens. The implication is that power increases as the distance from the end-markets decreases and that power relations affect collaboration and restrict information sharing between the actors in the value net. Research limitations/implications - A single case study such as this does not purport to produce findings that can be generalized in a statistical sense, but the findings will be valuable in an analytical sense because they extend understanding of the existing theory. Further research should be directed towards comparative studies of value nets, power relations and information sharing in other countries and in other industries. Practical implications - The paper sheds light on the critical factors that influence value net collaboration, making it possible for managers to focus on relevant issues when developing business relationships and the value net as a whole. Originality/value - There is a limited amount of research on value nets in the food industry, and because of the changing business environment there is an urgent need for studies focusing on the food business in the context of networks and value nets. In combining the value net approach with purchasing and supply management and market orientation perspectives the study extends the discussion on information sharing with its emphasis on network relations and the complicated nature of collaboration.","[Kahkonen, Anni-Kaisa] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Tenkanen, Mari] Univ Tampere, Dept Management Studies, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; Tampere University,"Kähkönen, AK (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, Lappeenranta, Finland.",Anni-Kaisa.Kahkonen@lut.fi,"Kähkönen, Anni-Kaisa/AAO-5434-2021; Tenkanen, Maija/F-9080-2016","Kahkonen, Anni-Kaisa/0000-0003-0061-4830",,,,,56,11,13,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

As for acquiring soil, crop and environmental variables of precision agriculture, the real-time, robust, low-cost acquiring data system is indispensable. Sensor technology can be used to study soil dynamics based on information gathered at regular intervals, and the data collected can be used as feedback to improve irrigation efficiency. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology development is driven by its use in different applications. Data acquisition and detection in precision agriculture is an area of significant research in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The coordination of control and instrumentation data is most effectively managed using data networks and low-cost microcontrollers. In the past few years, many WSNs had been deployed. These applications serve to explore the requirements, constraints and guidelines for general sensor network architecture design. In near future, sensor networks will be an integral part of our everyday life. Sensor networks will be an integral component in most industries. For example, sensor networks could provide precise information about crops with respect to the soil quality and water content, enabling better irrigation schedules, pesticide usage and enhancing environment protection.

The educational function of agriculture has not been fully examined despite the growing need for such services from urbanites. This paper focused on the educational function of agriculture by considering it as a joint product of farm production in terms of not only technical complementarity, but also of institutional complementarity, which includes institutional aspects such as food and rural culture. Data were obtained from the URL of the Farm Experience Net, launched in May 2003 and operated by the National Association for Promotion of Rural Youth Education in Japan. We employed statistical tests to clarify the features of the bodies or individual farmers who provide experience services. Findings and implications were as follows. Firstly, from the perspective of complementarity, we can classify that crop-wise or operation-wise experiences showed a strong connection with the technical complementarity of farms with seasonality, while food and rural cultural experiences had a strong connection with institutional complementarity with less seasonality. Secondly, non-governmental organizations, the quasi-public sector and farmers' groups played important roles in food and rural culture experience services. Thus, we should recognize the significance of both technical and institutional complementarity to extend the educational function of agriculture and the rural heritage. The combination of the two types of complementarity is effective in building a wide range of networks of those stakeholders who provide food and rural experience services while easing the constraints of seasonality.","[Ohe, Y.] Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Chiba, Japan",Chiba University,,,"Ohe, Yasuo/K-1096-2019",,,,,,6,3,3,0,5,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,,,2010,131.0,,,,,,247,255,,10.2495/EEIA100211,0.0,,,9,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,BQH16,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280992200021,0

The empirical results of alpha convergence method show that from 1995 to 2008, the agricultural development in China has the trend of convergence, divergence and then re-convergence. The test results of beta convergence show that agricultural economic growth rate is higher in backward areas than in developed regions due to various conditions and the gaps between agricultural developments of different regions continue to be narrowed and will eventually reach equilibrium. Thus, there is absolute beta convergence in China. Under opening market the import and export trading volume of agricultural products, said the extent of opening up, has the significant effect on narrowing the agricultural economy development gap of various regions.

By using the model, slow moving, spare parts could be pulled from normal spare parts, building a solid foundation for cooperative management.","[Wei Xiaorui; Yang Chao; Liu Jun] Beijing Wuzi Univ, Grad Fac, Beijing 101149, Peoples R China",Beijing Wuzi University,,sunaroundme@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-15-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,527,532,,,,,,6,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298265500092,0

This paper presents a quantification of the biomass burned in large-scale as well as small-scale human-induced vegetation fires at the country level for the year 2000. The amount of biomass burned in large scale fires is estimated combining information on the amount of biomass destroyed by large vegetation fires each year, derived by remote sensing, with estimates about the fraction induced by human activities. For biomass flows resulting from shifting cultivation, no comprehensive information is available at the global scale. Therefore, this flow was modelled on the basis of data on the area subjected to shifting cultivation and assumptions about the typical length of the cropping and fallow periods and the amount of biomass destroyed in each rotation cycle. The results show that the amount of biomass consumed in anthropogenic vegetation fires ranges between 3.5 and 3.9 billion tons dry matter per year (Pg dm/yr). a considerable amount when compared to the global socioeconomic biomass harvest of 12 Pg dm/yr. One third of the biomass consumed in anthropogenic fires each year, 1.0-1.4 Pg dm, results from shifting cultivation. Anthropogenic fires are most important in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa (2202 Tg dm/yr), Latin America (795 Tg dm/yr), South-Eastern Asia (336 Tg dm/yr) and Central Asia (157 Tg dm/yr), whereas in regions dominated by industrialized countries, anthropogenic vegetation fires play a minor role. Due to the lack of consistent and spatially explicit data for the year 2000, these numbers do not include agricultural residues burned in the field. The inclusion of residue burning in the year 1985 would increase the total biomass consumed by 0.45 Pg dm to a total of between 4.0 and 4.4 Pg dm/yr. The paper shows that the current geographic pattern of biomass burning can be explained by a combination of natural factors, such as the type of the potential vegetation, and socioeconomic factors. such as population density and the degree of industrialization of a region, which ultimately determine the application of vegetation fires in land use management. it is expected that the magnitude of anthropogenic vegetation fires will decrease in absolute and relative terms, mainly due to population growth and the diffusion of modern land use technologies, which more and more replace the function of vegetation fires as a land management tool.

Yet ecological economics has thus far paid little attention to the role of organisations as sites for the discursive battles over the meaning of sustainable development. For an international organisation without regulatory powers, such as the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), discourse is the main vehicle for policy influence, but it also plays a key role in (re)defining the organisation's identity and authority, The OECD's organisational discourse has been strongly dominated by 'modern mainstream economics', and has given little room for marginalised discourses. This paper compares, from the perspective of institutionally oriented ecological economics (IOEE), and borrowing from critical discourse analysis, the experience from attempts to integrate the concept of sustainable development within two OECD peer review mechanisms - the Economic Surveys and the Environmental Performance Reviews. The extent to which the respective conceptions of sustainable development in the two reviews are in line with the principles of IOEE and the reasons for the apparent failure of sustainable development discourse to gain foothold within the organisation are analysed.

The US tariff on crude oil imports stabilised domestic crude oil prices but prevented consumers from benefiting from lower prices in refined petroleum products. The large US international integrated crude oil companies gained from higher crude oil prices for their domestic production while supplying their European markets with mostly cheap crude oil from their newly developed Venezuelan oilfields. The tariff increased the Venezuelan oil industry's vulnerability to international events because it narrowed the competitive edge it had over domestic US crude oil production. Consequently, the Gomez dictatorship in Venezuela at the time became more dependent on the oil companies operating in the country since they could reduce production considerably, or even leave the country as quickly as they entered with a negative impact on government revenues.",,,,brian@mcbeth.demon.co.uk,,,,,,,46,3,4,0,4,UNIV CARLOS III MADRID,GETAFE,"INST HIST ECONOMICA, C MADRID, 126, GETAFE, MADRID 28903, SPAIN",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Researchers should be aware that the scope for imposing and testing non-jointness in this model is limited. In the general version of the model non-jointness requires the non-testable maintained hypothesis of similar (in a sense we define) single-output production technologies, a maintained hypothesis for which there is not normally any basis. The apparent imposition and testing of non-jointness must be qualified accordingly. The attempt to impose non-jointness and global separability simultaneously necessarily imposes constant returns to scale and the implication that outputs are identical up to a scalar multiple. In this special case the model therefore effectively describes merely the production of a single output, and in this sense is only trivially multiproduct.","Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Stewart, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",kstewart@uvic.ca,"Stewart, Kenneth/AAQ-8009-2021","Stewart, Kenneth/0000-0002-7575-3264",,,,,24,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Factors affecting the performances of JFM communities are analyzed using an ordered logit model. The results indicate that JFM communities are more likely to perform well when they are smaller in size and when forest resources in the JFM community are scarce. Presence of social capital and high value forests are also likely to promote good forest growth. Effective protection of forests is likely to contribute to the growth of forests. JFM communities that were initiated by NGOs are more likely to manage forests effectively than the one initiated by the Forest Department. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The role of excess capacity is an important issue at the individual firm level as well as at the community level. In this paper we explore hospital capacity for a sample hospitals operating in the 15 largest standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs) in the U.S. during 2002. Using Johanson's (1968, Production Functions and the Concept of Capacity, Namur, Belgium, Recherches R,centes sur le Fonction de Production (Collection, Economie Mathematique et Econometrie no. 2). [Reprinted in Finn R. Forsund (ed) (1987) The Collected Works of Leif Johanson, vol 1. Amsterdam, North-Holland, pp 350-282]) notion of capacity as the maximum rate of output possible from fixed inputs (i.e., without restrictions on variable inputs), we measure capacity in a frontier setting using directional distance functions. Rather than attempt to determine the optimal level of hospital capacity, we instead quantify capacity and capacity utilization rates at both the individual hospital and, by aggregating, the SMSA levels. After determining capacity and capacity utilization rates, we then introduce a model that calculates the changes in variable inputs that would be needed to utilize excess capacity. Finally, we introduce a simulation model that is used to examine whether each SMSA has enough excess hospital capacity to accommodate the loss of one of its five largest hospitals. The approach developed in this study should be of value to decision makers and planners in a variety of fields.","[Ferrier, Gary D.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Leleu, Herve] Univ Catholic Lille, IESEG, LEM, CNRS, F-59000 Lille, France; [Valdmanis, Vivian G.] Univ Sci Philadelphia, Hlth Policy Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management; Universite Catholique de Lille,"Ferrier, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Business Bldg,Room 402, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",gferrier@walton.uark.edu,"Leleu, Hervé/B-5729-2013","Leleu, Hervé/0000-0003-4027-5175; Ferrier, Gary/0000-0001-7301-7928",,,,,35,16,16,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The results showed that the EF in Henan Province quadrupled in the 23 years, but its ecological carrying capacity (EC) was rather low and was in a state of slow decline, indicating that Henan's ecological deficit (ED) had become a remarkable social problem. Therefore, the major drivers of the EFs change were analyzed. According to the simulations with STIRPAT model. the major drivers of Henan's EF were human population (P), GDP per capita (A(1)), quadratic term of GDP per capita (A(2)). percent of economy excluded in the service sector (Ta-1) and percent of urban population (Tb-1). However, these drivers themselves had strong collinearity, which might produce some uncertain impact to the final results. In order to avoid the impact of collinearity, the method of partial least squares (PLS) was used. The results showed that the major drivers of EF were P, A(1), A(2) and Tb-1. Ta-1 was excluded. Compared with the results by the STIRPAT model, which showed that P is the most dominant driver and the effect of the other drivers could almost be ignored, the results by PLS method were considered as more reasonable and acceptable because the impacts of the A (Affluence) and T (Technology) conditions to the regional EF were still too important to be ignored. In addition, the results acquired by both methods showed that the curvilinear relationship between economic development and ecological impact (EF) or the classical EKC hypothesis didn't exist in Henan Province.

Western Cape of South Africa. The Groot Drakenstein. Franschhoek and Jonkershoek mountains receives more rainfall than the surrounding areas and is an important source of water for the city of Cape Town. The costs of alien invasive plant removal, gully-erosion repair and reseeding with indigenous plants are considered in a case-study cost-benefit analysis of restoration, in terms of the water and tourism benefits derived. Three different options of restoration (comprehensive, moderate. basic) were analysed under three different economic scenarios (optimistic. realistic, pessimistic) and the costs of which have been weighted up against the income derived from the supply of water and tourism. The results have shown that despite the high costs of restoration. the basic restoration option costs were out-weighed by the water and tourism benefits derived. This was also true of the moderate restoration option, when evaluated under the optimistic scenario and using an 8% discount rate, or a 3% discount rate under any scenario. However, this was not the case in the moderate restoration option when using an 8% discount rate in conjunction with the realistic and pessimistic scenarios. Neither was it the case when using a 12% discount rate, irrespective of the scenario. Under no scenario was the cost of a comprehensive restoration option outweighed by the benefits quantified, irrespective of the discount rate used. It was concluded that further restoration, in addition to the mere clearing of alien invasive plants, would be economically viable under certain assumptions and conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The processes of production and consumption of the private good by each agent impose negative externalities on other agents through the depletion of the environmental good. This paper shows that, in such context, the existence of private substitutes for environmental goods may fuel an undesirable economic growth process. This process is driven by the continuous increase in agents' needs for private consumption generated by the progressive reduction in free consumption of the environmental good. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The importance of the latter was investigated, distinguishing between organisational (explicit) and cultural (implicit) institutional factors, by analysing the influence of supply side factors, such as physician density and physician reimbursement, and demand side factors, such as co-payment and gate-keeping, while controlling for a number of individual characteristics, using cross-national individual-level data from SHARE. Individual differences in health status accounted for about 50% of the between-country variation in physician visits, while the organisational and cultural factors considered each accounted for about 15% of the variation. The organisational variables showed the expected signs, with higher physician density being associated with more visits and higher co-payment, gate-keeping, and salary reimbursement being associated with less visits. When analysing specialist visits separately, however, organisational and cultural factors played a greater role, each accounting for about 30% of the between-country variation, whereas individual health differences only accounted for 11% of the variation.","[Bolin, Kristian; Lindgren, Anna; Lindgren, Bjorn; Lundborg, Petter] Lund Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Bolin, Kristian] Lund Univ, Vardal Inst, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Bolin, Kristian] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lindgren, Anna; Lindgren, Bjorn] Lund Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lindgren, Anna] Lund Univ, Ctr Math Sci, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lindgren, Bjorn] Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lindgren, Bjorn] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lundborg, Petter] Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1007 MC Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lundborg, Petter] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lundborg, Petter] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bolin, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, POB 705, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Kristian.Bolin@nek.lu.se; plundborg@feweb.vu.nl,,,,,,,47,16,16,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The extent of damage covers both time and space. Therefore, in order to mitigate the effects of pollution, it is necessary to adopt integrated management of both productive and natural areas. However, to be effective it is necessary to consider not only the health or biophysical effects of the countermeasures, but also the response of individuals to these changes. The purpose of this study is to assess the potential social and environmental impacts derived from the implementation of restoration strategies resulting from spills. Our approach is based on a choice experiment applied within the context of a citizens' valuation workshop or market stall in Cumbria (UK) and Zaragoza (Spain). The results highlight the advantages of this participatory technique versus traditional surveys. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Comprehensive Profit (CP) and Comprehensive Cost (CC) were used in this paper to analyze the superiority of different strategies in protected horticultural fields for pest management. CP and CC of the pest-control strategies were used as the targets of AHP, in which CP was classified into economic, social and ecological profit, while CC was split into economic, social and ecological cost. Ratio of Comprehensive Cost to Comprehensive Profit (RCCCP) was calculated by dividing Comprehensive Cost (CC) by Comprehensive Profits (CP). According to the analysis, the best strategy was to apply gray insect-proof net rooms of 2.2 m high and 360 (12 m x 30 m) square meters in protected horticultural fields for pest management.

The results were compared with those obtained by a multiplex PCR using validated primers targeting for invA and lamB genes of Salmonella and E coli, respectively. Findings - Microbiological analysis showed the prevalence of Salmonella in 14 out of 30 chicken carcasses. The same rinse samples were also analysed by multiplex PCR, which allowed the simultaneous detection of both bacteria directly from the chicken rinse water microbial community. Originality/value - The optimized mPCR detected enterobacteria. directly from the rinse samples, a complex matrix food, in one workday.

The geographic distribution of Brazilian production for the few pineapple cultivars used are shown, pointing out the predominance of cultivar 'Perola' in the Northeast Region. The ten most important pineapple producing states are mentioned, with emphasis on the States of Para and Paraiba that together were responsible for 42% of the Brazilian production in 2006. The pineapple fruit volumes sold in the largest trading center in Brazil (Ceagesp) is presented, reporting the predominance of 'Perola' from the year 2000. The trend of the average price of pineapple fruits in the most important trade centers in Brazil is discussed. Based on price seasonality and on pineapple harvest periods, the period from January to May is identified as the market window in which prices in Brazil are above annual average, but with trends for decreasing differences and narrowing of that window. The reason for that is the increase of pineapple production in the states of Para and Tocantins, both located in the North Region of Brazil, in which harvest occurs during a period of low national pineapple supply. The international pineapple market is addressed, both exporting and importing countries and products. The trend of fresh pineapple consumption in the most important markets, the consumption seasonality in the European Union and the most important traders are mentioned, in addition to the most commercialized cultivars and the Brazilian insertion into that market.","[de Almeida, C.

However UK producers perceive that food safety and welfare standards imposed on UK producers are not imposed to the same extent on livestock producers overseas, whose share of the UK market has grown steadily over the past decade. In light of these challenges this paper aims to examine the perceived role and value of farm assurance along the length of the red meat supply chain, in order to determine the potential for turning a supply chain cost into a supply chain benefit and increasing returns to UK producers. Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the key supply chain stakeholders (primary producers, processors, retailers and consumers) in the red meat industry. Findings - The research indicates that the potential benefits of price premiums and preferential market access have not been fully captured. Findings indicate that this is due to a misalignment of the perceived value of farm assurance amongst supply chain members and the fact that consumers have a limited understanding and awareness of farm assurance. However the potential for increased benefits exists as when offered the choice between farm-assured and non-farm assured meat, consumers express a distinct preference and willingness to pay for the former. Originality/value - This research is timely as there has been little attempt to assess the perceived value of farm assurance along the length of the supply chain where the views of consumers are integrated with the rest of the value chain for red meat.","[Duffy, Rachel; Fearne, Andrew] Univ Kent, Ctr Supply Chain Res, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Duffy, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Ctr Supply Chain Res, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England.",R.S.Duffy@kent.ac.uk,,,meat and livestock commission (MLC),meat and livestock commission (MLC)(Meat and Livestock Australia),The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support provided for this research by the meat and livestock commission (MLC).

Design/methodology/approach - The samples of ripe acerola were collected from the Active Germoplasm Bank of Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits - Cruz das Almas/Bahia, from the species Malpighia emarginata DC and analyzed by using standard methods. Findings - The findings were that the Rubra variety stood out among the others in terms of flavour and pur-chasing intention, probably due to its pH 3.60, total acid (0.83 percent malic acid) and Vitamin C (911.97 g ascorbic acid/100 g) which gave the variety a less acidic flavour. As regards size, the average acceptability of this variety was 6.01, statistically different from Cabocla (8.08). Total anthocyanins were also found to be the highest, 76.7 mg/100 g and therefore the antioxidant activity of the peel was greater (85 percent) compared with the other varieties, though not differing statistically from the CMF 017 variety. According to these results, the Rubra variety is the one which should be of most interest to producers. Practical implications - The new variety often fails to exceed nutritional and organoleptic characteristics of existing varieties in the market with established acceptance levels. The paper evaluates the chemical and sensorial composition of new varieties of acerola fruit, which could be launched on to the market. It was observed that one particular variety had better sensorial and nutritive quality. Originality/value - This kind of data is important both for consumers who want to buy the best quality fruit and producers who want to plant more of the better quality variety so that they can gain greater added-value in the commercialization of the fruit.","[Mamede, M.

An application to the Greek wine industry,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Promotional methods; Advertising; Winemaking; Greece,FOOD; PRODUCTS; BUSINESS; EUROPE; LINE,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on promotional strategies, on which there has been relatively little research. The aim of this paper is twofold: first to review promotional strategies used by Greek wine producers to differentiate their products and second to develop and test a model that evaluates the relative importance of advertising expenses and other promotional expenses in explaining profit rates across Greek wine firms. Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review relative to the question under investigation is presented. A survey among 43 Greek wine firms was carried out to identify the main categories of promotional expenses and their contribution to the total promotional expenditures for 2000. Annual balance sheet and income statements data for these firms were collected for the period 1993-2000. The fixed effects method is used to estimate the coefficients of the specified empirical model using time series cross-section panel data for the 43 Greek wine firms over the period 1993-2000. Findings - The non advertising promotional expenses were found to be the major part of promotional expenses, in the case of the Greek wine firms. For the Greek wine firms promotional expenses include promotion through the development of new informational labelling referred to origin and specific wine attributes, coupons, free samples, catalogues, new market channels through wine routes. These ways of promotion seem to be more effective to create goodwill for the company and to increase consumer loyalty than advertising. The fixed effects results show that total promotional expenses along with market share affect profitability.

In this paper we shed some light on it. In the literature, works that are closest to this question are based upon the notion of 'relevant information capacity', which is concerned with whether one schema may replace another without losing the capacity of the system in storing data. We observe that the rational of such an approach is over intuitive (even though the techniques involved are sophisticated) and we reveal that it is the phenomenon that one or more instances of a schema can tell us truly what an instance of another sachem is that underpins a convincing answer to this question. This is a matter of one thing carrying information about another. However, conventional information theoretic approaches are based upon the notion of entropy and the preservation of it. We observe that schema instance recovery requires looking at much more detailed levels of informational relationships than that, namely random events and particulars of random events.","[Xu, Kaibo] Beijing Union Univ, Coll Business, E Business Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Junkang] Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp, Database Res Grp, Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland",Beijing Union University; University of West Scotland,"Feng, JK (通讯作者)，Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp, Database Res Grp, Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland.",kaibo.xu@bcbuu.edu.cn; junkang.feng@uws.ac.uk,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-2-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,214,+,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BKK53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268388300028,0

Such transnational networks of subnational governments have also been created in the sphere of sustainable development, a policy domain that is largely shaped in multilateral decision-making settings and that is characterized by complexity and uncertainty, urging policy-makers to learn from other governments. Those networks have both external and internal objectives. On the one hand, they want to represent their members at international organizations and influence multilateral decision-making. On the other hand, they are aimed at fostering cooperation between subnational governments and at stimulating policy learning. After presenting a typology of existing networks in the sphere of sustainable development, the article presents a comparative analysis of the participation of the Belgian entities Flanders and Wallonia in ENCORE (Environmental Conference of the European Regions) and nrg4SD (Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development). The research shows that Flanders and Wallonia use networks mostly for formal and informal cooperation but not for influencing multilateral decision-making for sustainable development. The external dimension of the networks, however, is applied for identity politics. The analysis also demonstrates that little political capital is invested in the networks.","[Happaerts, Sander; Van den Brande, Karoline; Bruyninckx, Hans] KULeuven, Inst Int & European Policy, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Happaerts, S (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Inst Int & European Policy, Parkstr 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",sander.happaerts@soc.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,62,16,18,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Typologies of ecosystem services, such as that developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, do not ameliorate these challenges. Among the causes of ambiguity in classifying values associated with intermediate versus final ecosystem services are (1) the lack of simple, broadly applicable guidelines to assist natural and social scientists in deriving consistent and replicable classifications, and (2) attempts to define universal typologies of final services that apply to all beneficiaries. This paper presents an operational mechanism for determining whether a biophysical feature, quantity, or quality represents a final ecosystem service for an inclusive suite of beneficiaries. It is designed for straightforward application by those without expertise in natural or social sciences, and can be used within existing typologies. Illustrations of the structure demonstrate how the resulting classifications avert double counting and other ambiguities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We illustrate the relevance of these theoretical results for the empirical analysis of time series. Using Italian data, we find that multivariate and univariate models extract similar core inflation measures when analyzing the moderate-low inflation period.

Adopting the framing used in modern engineering rather than physics suggests that the market place has already recognised most of these thermodynamic truths as self-evident rather than challenging basic concepts. The exception is the relatively small market for heat where the idea of thermodynamic grade, conveniently represented by the exergy or available work content of a heat source, exposes inconsistencies especially in monopoly supply and economic instruments.

This paper examines the determinant factors influencing farmers' adoption of the EU-financed agri-environmental Nitrate Reduction Programme (NRP) in Greece and the extent of the programme's adoption, in terms of land allocation. The decision to adopt the NRP is modeled as a two-step procedure. First, farmers decide whether to participate in the agri-environmental programme and second, the extent of participation is determined. We employ Heckman's self-selection bias correction model to derive unbiased estimates. Based on farm level data, we develop the profile of farmers who choose to adopt the agri-environmental programme and the characteristics of their farms. The results of the analysis provide valuable policy insights decomposed into the main factors determining first, the adoption of the agri-environmental programme and second, the extent of adoption. By decomposing the determining factors, policy makers can employ this information to design effective agri-environmental programmes, desirable to farmers and more targeted towards specific environmental and agricultural development goals.

During the last decades, the focus of attention has moved from the pure economic level to the environmental aspects of international trade. Establishing a simplified system of North-South trade for one reference period (2003), this paper attempts to test empirically the extent of potential asymmetries with regard to extracted material flows, and contrasts the results with the economic benefits from trade (in terms of value-added). The South is thereby represented by a selection of Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico), the North comprises one of their main commercial partners, the United States. At the methodological level, a multi-regional input-output analysis is used as the tool of investigation. Results generally support the hypothesis that the South was feeding the North's societal metabolism. South-North material exports were 1.6 times larger than North-South material exports, resulting in a net deficit for the South of 324 million tons. Moreover, material intensity of exported commodities from the South was twice as high as that from the North. It is worth highlighting, however, that part of the North-South hypothesis fails for the sample of countries since the larger part of the economic surplus has remained in the South, contrarily to what would have been expected.

The study sought to trace changes to productive resources of ecosystems over a period of 50 years; and trace the dependence of well-being of local populations on the ecosystems for the same time period. Data was collected from land-use maps, records and participatory rapid/rural appraisal (PRA) surveys in multistakeholder forums. To illustrate the changes, an indicator-based assessment framework was developed that integrates data from biophysical and socio-economic parameters. We observed that the approach (1) provides a better representation of the preferences of different stakeholders of ecosystem services, (2) fosters validation of data between the different stakeholders and (3) enables a communication and planning process among the stakeholders to sustainably utilize and manage their ecosystems. The use of spatial maps validates the relevance and utility of diachronic observations of communities and other stakeholders directly dependent on ecosystems. At the same time, they can be used to strengthen local planning processes for the development of services in the ecosystem. Such research thereby also acts as a catalyst to a social process of coordinated action to address local issues of global relevance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

With a significant sample of 8014 consumers, we first identify international segments in the European organic products market using the Values Theory. Then we apply the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine how European consumers use attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control to form their purchase intention for organic products. Results show that subjective norms are the main underlying factor driving consumer behavior concerning these products. This effect is higher for the group of countries whose citizens score higher on Schwartz's value scale. In this segment of countries, people are more likely to be affected by what others think, which means that the best approach is to increase social awareness of the relevance of purchasing organic products. Organic products represent a potentially profitable opportunity for companies with an international horizon. Results are also useful for consumers and public administrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The sessions were conducted between 1998 and 2007 as part of a series of summer institutes on institutional analysis and environmental change. Subjects were graduate students and professionals from diverse disciplines, representing 41 countries of residence. The participants in this study stand in sharp contrast to most previous studies, which used undergraduates who self-select into experiments by volunteering to participate. Results from these experiments substantiate earlier findings that non-binding communication can serve as an effective mechanism for solving social dilemma problems, with subjects achieving near socially efficient outcomes.

We investigate the determinants of the public's awareness and knowledge of invasive species as few studies have examined this relationship. We focus on aquatic invasive species (AIS) and employ survey data from property owners in a lake district. A major contribution is that we estimate a mixed trivariate binary-ordered probit regression model that accommodates correlations among unobserved characteristics, produces statistically more efficient estimates, and allows a more proper investigation of the probability of knowledge conditional on awareness. Our results provide insights for invasive species education and management programs. We find that individuals are more likely to be aware of AIS if they participate in water-based recreation, visit lakes outside their area, have a boat, belong to a lake association, or are college educated. This has a policy implication: Given high levels of AIS awareness by those most involved in activities around lakes and those with a higher education, it may be beneficial to target informational campaigns at those who do not display these characteristics, so that they can better make informed decisions about whether to support and expend money on invasive species management programs.

The first test is based on a result from Akerlof (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1970). If there is asymmetric information in the used market, bidders should place a premium on a new Corvette, all else equal. The paper finds little systematic evidence of a new car premium. The second test is based on a result from Bajari and Hortacsu (Rand Journal of Economics 34(2):329-355, 2003). If there is asymmetric information, then bidders will prefer to bid late in the auction in order to conceal their private information from other bidders. The paper fails to find evidence of more late bidding on used Corvettes relative to new Corvettes. The third test is based on the idea that if there is asymmetric information then there may be a winner's curse problem in these auctions. The paper fails to find evidence consistent with bidders avoiding the winner's curse. The results are not consistent with asymmetric information problems in the market for used Corvettes sold on eBay. It is not clear however, whether this result generalizes to other cars sold on eBay or cars sold in the off-line market.","[Adams, Christopher P.; Hosken, Laura] Bur Econ, Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Newberry, Peter W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Adams, CP (通讯作者)，Bur Econ, Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA.",CADAMS@ftc.gov,,,,,,,17,8,9,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

It differs from earlier studies in that we look at the welfare cost of health insurance tax exclusion as coming directly from excessive health insurance rather than from overconsumption of medical care and that we account for the labor market effect of the tax exclusion on welfare. Both differences work to produce a smaller tax reform welfare gain. For a set of mid-range parameter values, the welfare gain is about 21% of current health insurance tax expenditures. In addition, government tax expenditures would fall by 38%, and health insurance spending would fall by 77% after the reform.","[Liu, Liqun; Rettenmaier, Andrew J.; Saving, Thomas R.] Texas A&M Univ, Private Enterprise Res Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Saving, Thomas R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Rettenmaier, AJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Private Enterprise Res Ctr, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",lliu@neo.tamu.edu; a-rettenmaier@tamu.edu; t-saving@tamu.edu,"Liu, Liqun/HRE-2145-2023",,,,,,18,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We assess how entry affects the pricing of the incumbent stores and the role played by the location of the entrant. Our primary objective is to identify how traditional retailers respond to new forms of low-cost retailing. Results show that post entry, the prices for some products are higher than the pre entry. However, which product prices increase depends on the incumbent's location. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that the store closer to the entrant is better off compared to the incumbent located further away. We empirically demonstrate the main workings of our theory using sales data from several grocery stores that saw entry by discount stores in their trading areas.","[Zhu, Ting] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Singh, Vishal] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Dukes, Anthony] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Chicago; New York University; University of Southern California,"Zhu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tzhu@chicagogsb.edu,"Singh, Vishal/AAH-4861-2021; singh, vishal/AAL-6086-2020; Dukes, Anthony/AAW-4545-2020","Dukes, Anthony/0000-0003-2699-8019",,,,,28,31,37,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

In this paper, we use choice experiment to value different tradeoffs that evolved in park development scenarios. Specifically, we examine which kind of development profiles are worth considering and which paths not to follow. We focus on biodiversity and recreational services provided by Oulanka National Park in Finland, which represents a popular recreation site attracting a large number of visitors. The increase of biodiversity was the most highly valued feature by the respondent national park visitors. Thus, our results show that the protection of biodiversity and recreational and tourism use of national parks can cause conflicting welfare effects if managed in inappropriate ways.

While value is typically added along the whole production chain, certain environmental impacts, such as land and water use, biomass appropriation, and soil degradation, are intrinsically linked to where the primary products originate from. When taking a consumer oriented approach on environmental problems, bilateral trade statistics can help in providing a clearer picture about the location of impacts caused by consumption elsewhere. However, in today's increasingly globalized world, consumer goods are often imported from countries other than where the primary product originated from. For instance, soybeans are transported from Brazil to the Netherlands, where they are processed into soy oil, which is shipped to Austria, where it is consumed. Utilizing bilateral trade matrices and matrix algebra, we present a method that allows to clearly link consumption patterns to the origin of primary products. In this, the method can help to provide information about consumption related, distant environmental impacts. We employ the case of land and water use linked to Austria's soy product consumption to demonstrate the approach's relevance. Finally, we outline some possible applications of this method to show its potential in enhancing understanding for informed consumer based environmental decision making. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, rights to water tend to be fixed, and obtaining rights to water incurs high transaction costs. As a result, water catchments are over-allocated worldwide. In this paper, I show how a catchment manager could match users' rights to the available water, in near real time, despite uncertain future inflows, while making effective use of all available hydrological data. The solution uses the framework of a smart market. A smart market is a periodic auction cleared with the help of an optimization model. In addition to market clearing, this model allows a convenient means to adjust initial rights, and the auction revenue reflects the available water relative to users' rights. When the auction is revenue neutral, the catchment may be viewed as allocated perfectly. I suggest several ways in which a catchment manager can find this revenue-neutral allocation, assuming the manager has authority to adjust initial rights. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This new notion is critically evaluated by considering five common interpretations of it. One conclusion is that these multiple interpretations make it an ambiguous and rather confusing concept. Another is that degrowth may not be an effective, let alone an efficient strategy to reduce environmental pressure. It is subsequently argued that a-growth, i.e. being indifferent about growth. is a more logical social aim to substitute for the current goal of economic growth, given that GDP (per capita) is a very imperfect indicator of social welfare. In addition, focusing ex ante on public policy is considered to be a strategy which ultimately is more likely to obtain the necessary democratic political support than an ex ante. explicit degrowth strategy. In line with this, a policy package is proposed which consists of six elements, some of which relate to concerns raised by degrowth supporters. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

The Chinese government has recognized that environmental protection and sustainable economic development can promote mutual and sustainable co-development of the economy and the environment as a basic national principle. This paper examines the interactions between economic development and environmental change in China that were compared and analyzed for the years 1996 and 2000. Net primary production (NPP) was selected as a proxy evaluator of ecosystems and gross domestic product (GDP) was chosen as a proxy evaluator of economic development. An NPP change map was produced with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) summed annual NPP imagery products. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime imagery was used to produce a Chinese GDP change map. An integrated map was produced to exhibit the combined changes of NPP and GDP. This map showed that in the regions with increased GDP, NPP decreased but the regions with no GDP change were smaller in area for NPP increase while larger in area for NPP decrease. The changing pattern of NPP varied with the developing level of GDP at province level. A province's development of GDP is controlled by its accessibility to natural resources. Interactions between NPP and GDP are greatly affected by factors of spatial location aside from human factors and natural systems' characteristics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Agriculture is a major driver of these modifications. Taking into account these environmental impacts, agriculture nowadays aims at a more sustainable way of producing which would reconcile its economic and ecological functions. The objective of this paper is to give insights into the impact of public policies on both conservation of biodiversity and farming production. We develop a macro-regional model combining community dynamics of 34 bird species impacted by agricultural land-uses and an economic decision model. The ecological dynamic model is calibrated with the STOC (French Breeding Bird Survey) and AGRESTE (French land-uses) databases while the economic model relies on the gross margins of the FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network). We investigate the scenario based on subsidies and taxes. We show that simple economic instruments could be used to establish scenarios promoting economic performances and bird populations. It is pointed out how the sustainability of the policies is sensitive to the ecological and economic indicators used by the planner. The bio-economical analysis shows several solutions for the ecology-economy trade-off. These results suggest that many possibilities are available to develop multi-functional sustainable agriculture.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was qualitative in nature. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 children on all dimensions of the CSM. Twenty four children were normal weight and nine were overweight. A drawing task formed the methodology for the identity section of the interview. Findings - Although children identified food intake as a main cause of obesity, almost half did not name sedentary behaviours as a cause of obesity. Duration (timeline) of obesity was regarded by most children as reliant on a person's undertaking of positive health behaviours. Normal weight children were found to list more severe consequences of obesity than the overweight group. It was found that experience contributed to the detailed knowledge of overweight children's perceptions of cures of obesity. Overweight children also spoke of personal incidents of barriers to cures. Practical imlications - The findings suggest that the CSMs can be used to classify children's perceptions of obesity. Future childhood obesity interventions can utilise these findings to create campaigns and strategies that are more consistent with children's understandings of this condition. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, no previous study has examined children's perceptions of obesity beyond perceived causes.","[Mullan, Barbara Ann; Sharpe, Louise] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mullan, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",barbara@psych.usyd.edu.au,"Sharpe, Louise/J-1868-2012; Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019","Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899; Sharpe, Louise/0000-0002-8790-6272",,,,,40,13,17,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The tillage experiment distinguished between conventional tillage (CT) with mouldboard ploughing 23-25 cm depth after harvest in August-September, late ploughing (LP) in the end of October - beginning of November and reduced tillage (RT). The aim of this work was to study the effects of three tillage systems on soil physical properties, soil water content and drainage outflow, during the six successive year's treatments (2005-2010). The reliability of the results was determined by processing them with mathematical-statistical methods using MS Excel 2000 Data Analysis Tool Pack. Differences of tillage treatments were tested at the significance level p <= 0.05. When considered across all the tillage treatments reduced tillage resulted in significantly higher (by 9-11%) soil water content in surface layer (0-20 cm) compared to traditional tillage while the differences between other tillage treatments were insignificant. Reduced tillage may be considered as a measure for drainage outflow retention in springtime especially under the dry spring period, because during spring peak (in March) the average monthly drainage outflow in reduced tillage system was 7% lower compared to late ploughing at the end of October -beginning of November and 23% lower compared to conventional tillage after the harvesting.","[Baigys, Giedrius; Bastiene, Nijole] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Water Res Inst, Fac Water & Land Management, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ulen, Barbro] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Uppsala, Sweden",Vytautas Magnus University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Baigys, G (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Water Res Inst, Fac Water & Land Management, Kaunas, Lithuania.",giedrius_b@hotmail.com; vegelyte@delfi.lt; barbro.ulen@slu.se,"Ulen, Barbro/V-9148-2017",,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,256,261,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500046,0

Although there are a few market research studies, none of them is completely oriented on the role and market significance of GI of wine. There is an evident lack of information in this field. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The population of the basic group is a high-qualified population for reviewing different aspects of wine as a complex product. Stratification of the units from the sample has been made on the sample (n = 200). Data were analysed using univariate statistics, bivariate correlations and multiple factor analysis. Findings - Results have shown a high correlation degree between the higher socioeconomic status of examinees and preferences for wine with GI. It might be concluded that examinees with a higher level of education are more familiar with wine with GI and also have a higher culture of wine consumption. Research limitations/implications - The sample, including only expert groups from institutions, could be understood to be a limitation of this study although they are a highly-qualified population for reviewing different aspects of wine as a complex product. Further research is needed to analyse other consumer groups and to determine possible differences in attitudes. Practical implications - Research results indicate a need to increase consumers' familiarity with GI wine. Overall positive attitudes towards wine with GI should be reinforced and consumers could be influenced through targeted advertising. Originality/value - The paper presents some Croatian consumers' opinions about the importance of GI of consumed wine. Extracted are the main impact factors regarding the wine selection.","[Cacic, Jasna] Minist Agr Fisheries & Rural Dev, Zagreb, Croatia; [Tratnik, Miroslav] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Cacic, Drazen] Croatian Agr Extens Serv, Zagreb, Croatia; [Kovacevic, Dragan] Univ Osijek, Fac Food Technol JJ Strossmayer, Osijek, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Cacic, J (通讯作者)，Minist Agr Fisheries & Rural Dev, Zagreb, Croatia.",jcacic@mps.hr,"Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos/AAD-2935-2021","Kljusuric, Jasenka Gajdos/0000-0001-6657-7337",,,,,31,14,16,4,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These meanings are to be explored within the broader context of subcultural experience in an investigation of the motives and the self-concept dynamics underlying this symbolic consumer behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses an interpretive research strategy and adopts a multi-method ethnographic approach that includes: netnography: multiple, in-depth, ethnographic interviews; and prolonged participant observation. Interview informants are young Irish subcultural members aged between 18 and 23. Data analysis proceeds according to a constant comparative method. Findings - The findings suggest that the social gaming ritual, when intersected with food, is closely linked to issues of identity, community, fantasy and escape, gustatory rebellion and prolonged hedonism. Commensality during the core social gaming ritual contributes to a sense of communitas, while the junk nature of the shared food products helps to manufacture the hedonism of the event. The social ritual then is sovereign and bound by its own subcultural parameters, which oppose mainstream cultures norms and dietary regulations. From its role in helping to create a Utopian and rebellious experience, food is then leveraged as part of the garners' collective identity. Practitioner implications of the results are discussed. Originality/value - This paper investigates contemporary food consumption behaviour within a postmodern community. The main contribution pertains to providing an insight into a previously neglected group of food consumers.","[Cronin, James M.; McCarthy, Mary B.] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"McCarthy, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland.",m.mccarthy@ucc.ie,"McCarthy, Mary B/IUM-4856-2023","McCarthy, Mary/0000-0001-5383-738X",,,,,124,17,21,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although the first active credit union did not spring up on the American side of the ocean until the early 20th century, the concepts that helped to shape those that formed much earlier in Europe had been developing for centuries. Frequently, credit unions are viewed as providers of microcredits and instrument for expansion of crediting, since the amount of microcredits claimed by small and medium size businesses has grown compared with the previous years. The growth mainly relates to the present economic situation in the world and the necessity to increase and optimise the activity of small businesses to retain their competitiveness. Credit unions represent a significant part of the small-loan market in several EU Member States, but are not meant primarily to production credit. The European Commission has launched an initiative to engage credit unions in expansion of the micro crediting system; hence, Latvia has also elaborated a micro-crediting development programme, where credit unions play the basic role. The research aim is to study and discuss credit unions compared with other financial institutions and their development in Latvia. The discussion begins with a historical background on credit unions, followed by an analysis of the concept and legal regulation of credit unions and it is summarised by the analysis of credit maturity structure of loans disbursed by credit unions in Latvia. The paper concludes that in Latvia, credit unions are established to enhance the availability of financial resources for the local population, to promote regional development, and to facilitate the participation of population in the national economy. Presently, both large and small rural credit unions operate in Latvia and unfortunately the governing Law on Credit Unions does not encourage the establishment and development of rural cooperative credit unions. The research is based on the monographic descriptive method, methods of analysis and synthesis as well as the logical and constructive methods.","[Mazure, Gunita] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,Gunita.Mazure@llu.lv,"Mazure, Gunita/AAA-7586-2020","Mazure, Gunita/0000-0002-3722-9437",,,,,18,1,1,0,5,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,136,143,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000021,0

However, there is very little micro-level evidence from earlier years, when lower inflation rates and a less regulated labour market may have led to stronger downwards pressure on wages. This paper examines wage adjustment at the Victorian Railways, Australia, between 1902 and 1921. It is shown that, despite strong downwards pressure on wages, nominal wages were rigid downwards and a high proportion of triennial wage changes were exactly zero. Even for workers with very long tenure and in years when the national price level declined, wage cuts were rare. We also show that the characteristics of workers whose wages were unchanged were very similar to those receiving wage cuts. Finally, we show that unlike the wages of incumbent staff, entry wages for new junior staff frequently declined from year to year.","[Seltzer, Andrew] Univ London, Egham, Surrey, England; [Sammartino, Andre] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Melbourne,"Seltzer, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, Egham, Surrey, England.",a.seltzer@rhul.ac.uk,"Sammartino, André/D-8768-2016","Sammartino, André/0000-0001-5117-2919; Seltzer, Andrew/0000-0002-9826-7082",,,,,63,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2011,5.0,1,,,,,53,78,,10.1007/s11698-010-0050-3,0.0,,,26,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,756BV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289987600003,0

With this aim, we estimate a production function model in which effective labour is represented by the shares of permanent, temporary and self-employed workers. Results suggest that productivity growth has been slowed down by the use of temporary contracts for regular jobs and that this has not been affected by compositional changes in activity over the period.

Often, in a second stage, a regression model is estimated to relate DEA efficiency scores to exogenous factors. In this paper, we argue that the traditional linear or tobit approaches to second-stage DEA analysis do not constitute a reasonable data-generating process for DEA scores. Under the assumption that DEA scores can be treated as descriptive measures of the relative performance of units in the sample, we show that using fractional regression models is the most natural way of modeling bounded, proportional response variables such as DEA scores. We also propose generalizations of these models and, given that DEA scores take frequently the value of unity, examine the use of two-part models in this framework. Several tests suitable for assessing the specification of each alternative model are also discussed.","[Ramalho, Esmeralda A.] Univ Evora, Dept Econ, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal; Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal",University of Evora; University of Evora,"Ramalho, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Econ, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal.",ela@uevora.pt,"Arranhado, Esmeralda/B-6180-2009; Ramalho, Joaquim J.S./B-5949-2009","Arranhado, Esmeralda/0000-0002-9525-0082; Ramalho, Joaquim J.S./0000-0003-3533-2411; Henriques, Pedro/0000-0002-9646-3223",,,,,35,147,166,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The paper develops a methodology which allows the inequality in energy consumption per capita to be decomposed into explanatory factors. It also analyses the contribution of different groups of countries to this inequality. The results show that although differences in affluence are the most significant factor in explaining inequality in energy consumption per capita, the inequality in energy intensity levels plays a prominent role in reducing the inequality in energy consumption per capita over the analysed period. The paper also develops a methodology which determines the importance of different production structures and energy efficiency of productive sectors in the differences in energy use per unit of GDP between the countries analysed. The results show that sector specialisation becomes increasingly important in explaining the inequality of energy intensity, while there is a significant trend towards the convergence of energy efficiency between countries sector by sector. This trend would explain the decreasing weight of energy intensity as an explanatory factor of the inequalities in energy consumption per capita. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A historical note on Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen; History of ecological economics; De-growth; Club of Rome,STEADY-STATE; ECONOMICS; RESOURCES; ENERGY,"At a few months' interval, Georgescu-Roegen's The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (1971) and Club of Rome's Limits to Growth (1972) were published. Both emphasized the dangers of economic growth, and both drew negative reactions from mainstream economists. Relying on archival evidence, we show that Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome developed strategies of mutual support, which would present them at first view as natural allies. Georgescu-Roegen actually became a member of the Club of Rome, while Dennis Meadows acknowledged the influence of Georgescu-Roegen's ideas on the team of authors of Limits to Growth. But in the late 70's, the gap widened between Georgescu-Roegen's adamant defense of de-growth, and the Club of Rome's less firm view of sustainable growth. This paper explores the process leading to the self-isolation of Georgescu-Roegen, by showing that beyond a shared acknowledgment that economic and biologic systems were interdependent, technological optimism and ambitions for the global management of growth were central to the Club of Rome, while Georgescu-Roegen's personal history led him to ignore those practicalities and judge that de-growth was inescapable.

The review presented here suggests that the trend towards monetization and commodification of ecosystem services is partly the result of a slow move from the original economic conception of nature's benefits as use values in Classical economics to their conceptualization in terms of exchange values in Neoclassical economics. The theory and practice of current ecosystem services science are examined in the light of this historical development. From this review, we conclude that the focus on monetary valuation and payment schemes has contributed to attract political support for conservation, but also to commodify a growing number of ecosystem services and to reproduce the Neoclassical economics paradigm and the market logic to tackle environmental problems.

This paper addresses a branch of EKC literature focused on the role international trade plays in shaping this relationship. In particular, we test the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, which posits that emission reductions observed in developed nations are partly the result of shifting dirty production to developing nations with lax environmental standards. We estimate EKCs for seven oft-studied pollutants and find little evidence that pollution havens play a significant role in shaping the EKC.

This pattern differs from that observed during the past globalisation period (1880-1913), in which wage inequality decreased in most of the Old World countries. The present debate over wage inequality focuses on the implications of globalisation, technological change, the role of labour market institutions and education. Similar factors were at work in the past globalisation process. In order to disentangle the main factors that contribute to wage inequality, we calibrate a general equilibrium model for the UK economy in the past globalisation period. The results show that a trade shock and a skilled-biased technology shock increased wage inequality. However, education and emigration had a more significant impact and led to a decrease in wage inequality.","[Betran, C.; Ferri, J.; Pons, Maria A.] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Pons, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain.",concepcion.betran@uv.es; francisco.ferri@uv.es; angeles.pons@uv.es,"Betran, Concha/AAB-5233-2019; Pons, Maria A./AAA-3180-2019; Ferri, Javier/L-2024-2014","Betran, Concha/0000-0002-5640-1087; Pons, Maria A./0000-0002-9092-5220; Ferri, Javier/0000-0001-7722-9186",,,,,58,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2010,4.0,1,,,,,19,50,,10.1007/s11698-009-0038-z,0.0,,,32,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KT,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279352400002,0

It aims to analyse the following dimensions: general expectations, learning organization and interactions in students' discourses. Design/methodology/approach The methodology adopted is of interpretative nature using semi-structured qualitative interviews. An interview guide was designed taking into account the learning modalities (styles and strategies), materials and learning tools, teacher-student interaction and peer interaction dimensions. The students of both courses were interviewed in the second semester of the curricular year of the respective MSc degrees. Findings This study has shown that face-to-face and online students are equally satisfied with their courses revealing the same confirmed general expectations. Comments for both course delivery systems are the need for more laboratory and practical classes. Results from this study also indicated that face-to-face and online educations are effective training food consumer sciences students suggesting, however, that both systems should evolve to blended-learning. Practical implications Both course delivery systems (face-to-face and online) contributed to the competencies acquisition in Food Consumer Sciences. B-learning appears as the natural convergence of students needs.

The aim of this paper is to examine whether a business gets the food poisoning it deserves and to assess the role of management including food safety culture in outbreaks. Design/methodology/approach - Factors influencing the likelihood of a business causing food poisoning are considered and discussed using four categories or variables. These are then applied in a case study of an E coli O157 outbreak. Findings - The risk of a business causing food poisoning depends on the types of foods produced, the people consuming the food and where the business sources its raw materials. These need to be considered in relation to the hygiene behaviour of the food handlers employed. Food safety does not happen by accident and to produce safe food consistently, especially on a large scale, requires management. Management includes the systems that are used and the organizational food safety culture of compliance with those systems. Food poisoning will never be totally prevented; however, to a considerable extent, a business does get the food poisoning it deserves.

Whereas substantial improvements in policies, legal requirements and assessment guidelines have occurred, hydropower planning and development still need a lot of improvement. Some major problems relate to capacity and institutional environment, such as insufficient quality of environmental and social assessments, ineffective regulatory framework, a lack of transparency, and the failure to conduct comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders. Hydropower development in Lao PDR and in the whole Mekong Region needs to be sustainable, which will require minimal adverse social and environmental impacts, while remaining a viable, profitable and source of renewable energy supporting the country's economic development. Hydropower development should also better respond to the realities of regional energy market. Hydropower must be developed cautiously in the context of broader development goals, including responsible environmental management, institutional development, poverty alleviation and social development along with integrated water and energy management. Sustainable development of hydropower requires the integration of economic and social development and environmental protection and the need to take into account the values of efficiency, participatory decision-making, sustainability, accountability along with precautionary approach to environmental management and eco-efficiency. The purpose of the paper is to identify key challenges related to sustainable hydropower planning and development in Lao PDR. The paper aims to contribute to the broader discourse on sustainable hydropower planning and development in developing countries.","[Jusi, S.] Finland Futures Res Ctr, Turku Sch Econ, Turku, Finland",University of Turku,,,,,,,,,31,2,4,0,23,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,,,2010,131.0,,,,,,199,210,,10.2495/EEIA100171,0.0,,,12,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,BQH16,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280992200017,0

In this study, we use a novel data set to study the role of learning in the diffusion of three Cox-2 Inhibitors-Celebrex, Vioxx and Bextra-before the Vioxx withdrawal. Our study has two unique features: first, we observe each patient's reported satisfaction after consuming a drug. This patient level data set, together with market level data on FDA updates, media coverage, academic articles, and pharmaceutical advertising, allows us to model individual prescription decisions. Second, we distinguish across-patient learning of a drug's general efficacy from the within-patient learning of the match between a drug and a patient. Our results suggest that prescription choice is sensitive to many sources of information. At the beginning of 2001 and upon Bextra entry in January 2002, doctors held a strong prior belief about the efficacy of Celebrex, Vioxx, and Bextra. As a result, the learning from patient satisfaction is gradual and more concentrated on drug-patient match than on across-patient spillovers. News articles are weakly beneficial for Cox-2 drug sales, but academic articles appear to be detrimental. The impact of FDA updates is close to zero once we control for academic articles, which suggests that FDA updates follow academic articles and therefore deliver little new information to doctors. Two counterfactual experiments are carried out to quantify the influence of information on market shares.","[Jiang, Renna] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Chintagunta, Pradeep K.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jin, Ginger Z.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jin, Ginger Z.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Jiang, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",pradeep.chintagunta@ChicagoBooth.edu; rejiang@ucdavis.edu; jin@econ.umd.edu,"Chintagunta, Pradeep K/A-4764-2017","Chintagunta, Pradeep/0000-0003-2854-5216",,,,,18,39,52,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

J,"David, G",,,,"David, Guy",,,The convergence between for-profit and nonprofit hospitals in the United States,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nonprofit hospitals; Mixed ownership equilibrium; Convergence,COMPETITION; CARE,"This paper proposes a novel model of the hospital industry in the United States in which firms in effect choose their ownership type and the regulatory and tax regimes under which they must function. Accordingly, I develop a model in which firms have identical objectives but differ in their ability to benefit from a given ownership form. Changes in the economic environment alter firms' incentives to maintain a given ownership type. This in turn induces firms to modify their capacity and encourages some firms to switch ownership type. One implication of this model is that changes in the economic environment that have occurred since 1960 imply that the optimal size of those firms which choose to be for profit should more closely approximate the optimal size of firms which choose to be nonprofit. Hospital level data indicate that this size convergence has indeed occurred. In 1960, U.S. nonprofit hospitals maintained on average more than three times as many beds per hospital as their for-profit counterparts; following a monotonic decline in relative size, by 2000, the average nonprofit hospital was only 32% larger than the typical for-profit hospital. Declining roles of government hospitals, population growth, suburbanization, and increasing government intervention in the healthcare market help explain the convergence in size. Analysis of data at the state and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) levels is consistent with the principal theoretical predictions.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"David, G (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch Business, 202 Colonial Penn Ctr,3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",gdavid2@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,45,19,26,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Wind farms have both positive and negative effects on the marine environment. Negative effects include bird collisions, underwater sounds and electromagnetic fields, whilst positive effects constitute functioning as artificial reef and acting as no-take zones for fish, with possible spill-over effects. This paper presents a spatially explicit framework to analyze effects of wind farms on the marine environment and aims to evaluate how wind farms can contribute to protection of the marine environment through strategic and economically viable location choices. The functioning and the applicability of the model are demonstrated in a numerical example for the Dutch exclusive economic zone. We find that the careful spatial planning of wind farms is a key factor for profitability and environmental protection, and that, if carefully planned, the environment can benefit from offshore wind farms.

Understanding boating behavior, and how behavior responds to policy changes, is central to understanding the effectiveness of efforts to halt or slow the spread of aquatic invasives. We develop a framework that combines a recreation demand model of boating behavior with a discrete duration model describing the spatial and temporal spread of an aquatic invasive. The integrated approach allows us to link invasion risk probabilities directly to boating behavior, policy levers, and behavior changes arising from policy shocks. With an application to zebra mussels in Wisconsin we show that explicitly accounting for behavioral responses can dramatically change predictions for the effectiveness of particular policies, in some instances leading to increases in invasions risks at some sites.

Business examples of such decisions include mergers, acquisitions, distribution channel partners, as well as manufacturing and brand alliances. Dating and marriage partner selection are also natural examples of this game. The paper shows that (a) when communication is informative, the communication strategy as a function of the expected payoff of the partnership involves pretending fit when expected payoff is high, pretending misfit when expected payoff is low, and telling the truth in the intermediate range, and (b) the condition for informativeness of communication is that the distribution of payoffs has thin tails. Furthermore, the paper shows that the possibility of communication, even when this communication is not restricted to be truthful, can decrease the expected payoff for both the sender and the receiver; in particular, it can decrease the expected social welfare.","Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Kuksov, D (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Campus Box 1133,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",kuksov@wustl.edu,,,,,,,25,2,3,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Generic drug utilization has risen substantially alongside, from 19% of scripts in 1984 to 47% in 2001, thus tempering expenditure growth through significant direct dollar savings. However, generic drugs may lead to indirect savings as well if their use reduces the average price of those brand-name drugs that are still purchased. Prior work indicates that brand-name producers do not lower their prices in the face of generic competition, and our study confirms that finding. However, prior work is silent on how the mix of consumer choices between generic and brand-name drugs might affect the average price of those brand-name drugs that are purchased. We use a nationally representative panel of data on drug utilization and costs for the years 1996-2001 to examine how the share of an individual's prescriptions filled by generics (generic script share) affects his average out-of-pocket cost for brand-name drugs, and the net cost paid by the insurer. Our principal finding is that a higher generic script share lowers average brand-name prices to consumers, presumably because consumers are more likely to substitute generics when brand-name drugs would cost them more. This effect is substantial: a 10% increase in the consumer's generic script share is associated with a 15.6% decline in the average price paid for brand-name drugs by consumers. This implies that the potential cost savings to consumers from generic substitution are far greater than prior work suggests. In contrast, the percentage reduction in average brand costs to health plans is far smaller, and statistically insignificant.","[Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Zeckhauser, Richard] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Harvard University,"Rizzo, JA (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",john.rizzo@stonybrook.edu; richard_zeckhauser@harvard.edu,"Mendoza, Elvia/A-9361-2012",,,,,,24,28,36,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

It is, therefore, important to examine what has moved countries to be involved in these agreements alongside the UN climate regime. This article seeks to identify possible factors contributing to Japan's participation in both the UN climate regime and the APP, looking at the position of domestic interest groups, the distribution of climate policy-making at the government level and varying international pressures. It concludes that Japan's participation in both the APP and the UN climate regime flows from a policy-making process that tries to accommodate conflicting viewpoints at the domestic and international levels. To what extent Japan's participation in both fora can be regarded as constructive will depend on the partnership's ability to support the implementation of a future climate regime.","[van Asselt, Harro] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Policy Anal, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kanie, Norichika; Iguchi, Masahiko] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Tokyo 152, Japan",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"van Asselt, H (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Policy Anal, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",harro.van.asselt@ivm.vu.nl,,"van Asselt, Harro/0000-0003-3028-0659",,,,,65,15,15,3,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Based on stochastic frontier regressions, we show for a sample of coal mining corporations and the period 1881-1913 that cartelization did not affect productive efficiency. Bonuses paid to board members, however, did increase the efficiency of coal mining firms. Thus, one pillar of the German economic model did not negatively affect economic efficiency, whereas another pillar had a positive impact. Furthermore, our results suggest that coal was mined with slightly decreasing returns to scale.","[Burhop, Carsten; Luebbers, Thorsten] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Burhop, C (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",burhop@coll.mpg.de; luebbers@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,44,18,19,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

We first develop a mathematic model for the allocation of control rights and its influence on cooperation efficiency, and then derive some basic hypotheses from the model. The results of an empirical test show that the allocation of control rights influences how enterprises invest in PPPs. A proper allocation provides incentives for firms to make fewer self-interested and more public-interested investments. Such an allocation also improves the cooperation efficiency of PPPs.","[Jia, Ming] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Shaanxi 710072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhe; Wan, Difang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Shaanxi 710049, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Jia, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Shaanxi 710072, Peoples R China.",zhangzhe220@yahoo.com.cn; xjtujiaming@163.com; wandf@stu.xjtu.edu.cn,"Jia, Ming/O-6351-2017; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023",,,,,,10,6,9,1,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

This article examines the nature and limits of regulatory convergence in the field of agri-biotechnology and investigates the effects that international forces have on biotechnology and biosafety policies in developing countries. Based on detailed case studies of Mexico, China and South Africa this article shows that these three leading biotechnology countries in the South are exposed to powerful international influences but are responding to the regulatory challenges of genetically modified organisms (GMO) adoption in distinctive ways. The existing regulatory polarization between US and EU biotechnology approaches has not forced a convergence around either of these two international models. GMO policies in the South do not simply follow the binary logic of the US-EU regulatory conflict. Instead, they integrate elements from both regulatory approaches and are steering a course that suggests substantial regulatory diversity in the South. The globalization of biotechnology thus goes hand in hand with regulatory diversity in the developing world. Furthermore, regulatory polarization between the EU and US has helped to open up political space in key developing countries.","[Falkner, Robert] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Gupta, Aarti] Wageningen Univ, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Wageningen University & Research,"Falkner, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.falkner@lse.ac.uk; aarti.gupta@wur.nl,,"Gupta, Aarti/0000-0003-4908-7453; Falkner, Robert/0000-0001-9990-6926",,,,,72,35,40,1,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

New Zealand had the world's highest GDP per capita in 1938, but it experienced long swings in its growth rates. Dramatic swings in rural land market activity engendered by the pastoral boom contributed greatly to a long depression in the 1920s; subsequently a new monetary regime facilitated fast recovery.","[Greasley, David] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oxley, Les] Univ Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Oxley, Les] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Edinburgh; University of Canterbury; University of Western Australia,"Greasley, D (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023","Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",,,,,80,19,20,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Riparian vegetation surveys comprising comprehensive measures of the ecological characteristics of riparian habitat were completed in the metropolitan Tucson study area and the data incorporated into a hedonic analysis of single family residential house prices. The results indicate that high quality riparian habitat adds value to nearby homes and that instead of indiscriminately valuing green open space, nearby homebuyers distinguish between biologically significant riparian vegetation characteristics. This research also suggests that it is worthwhile to account for the heterogeneity of natural amenities in hedonic analysis. Furthermore the results suggest that riparian preservation and restoration programs are more likely to receive public support if they incorporate features that are preferred by nearby homeowners. Our study's results show that household preferences for existing riparian habitat match features of the ecologically-functional riparian habitat envisaged in a recently funded joint federal-city urban riparian restoration project in Tucson, Arizona.

How can this situation be explained? This article postulates that a combination of approaches from the political sciences (in particular policy analysis) and institutional economics would enable the identification of the most relevant regulatory dimensions which can explain the (un)sustainable uses of resources. Based on this starting point, it develops an innovative theoretical framework, i.e. that of the Institutional Resource Regime (IRR). The adopted approach facilitates the analysis of the regulatory measures and resource management practices associated with complex and competitive heterogeneous use situations from a perspective of sustainability. Indeed, the two dimensions of extent and coherence enable the definition and categorization of the IRR of a given resource. The extent of an IRR refers to the total number of goods and services in use that are actually regulated by the regime at a given time, while the coherence measures the degree of coordination of the various user-actors within the regime. One of the major contributions of the IRR framework is its ability to describe the different configurations of regimes, both theoretically and empirically, and to predict their effect on the sustainability of a resource based on the hypothesis that high levels of regime extent and coherence are necessary preconditions for sustainability. By doing this, the IRR framework also enables the analysis of the actual use rights to the goods and services provided by resources as the result of the political strategies of actors who mobilize different legal provisions, which stem either from formal property rights to resources or from policies that regulate the use and protection of these resources. Having developed the central research hypotheses and the empirical research procedure, we present the lessons drawn from the first campaign of field research which was mainly conducted in Switzerland from 1999. Based on the evidence from these initial findings, it is suggested that the scope of the IRR framework could be far broader than evidenced by its application in the case of Switzerland where it was initially developed.

To date, however, these dimensions have been discussed to a very limited extent in emerging New World wine regions; where the lack of a traditional heritage of wine making presents special challenges in terms of origin branding. The focus of most previous research has been on the viewpoints of consumers, not those of producers. This study seeks to explore these dimensions among small wine growers. Design/methodology/approach - Using a qualitative approach, 42 interviews with winery operators from several emerging Western Australian wine regions were conducted. Findings - In the absence of historical wine pioneers and traditions, winery operators in emerging wine-producing regions use alternative means for origin branding that emphasise heritage and landscape characteristics centring on the wider rural idyll. These associations serve to forge a vintage identity for their industry, which essentially masks its youth for their region. Research limitations/implications - In view of the more than 200 small wineries operating in Western Australia the number of respondents in the study may not allow for making generalisations of the state's wine industry. Practical implications - The current growth in the number of wineries in the regions studied and the increasingly acknowledged quality of their wine product may help towards the establishment of their history and identity, thus contributing to origin branding over time. Originality/value - The study explores the importance of history and landscape among winery operators in promoting their wineries and their wine products in the context of emerging wine regions, an area for the most part ignored in contemporary research.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte; Northcote, Jeremy] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,"Northcote, Jeremy/JKI-7885-2023","Northcote, Jeremy/0000-0002-4136-2097",,,,,40,17,18,3,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A citizens' jury (CJ) was held in Penicuik, a small town on the pen-urban fringe of Southeast Scotland. A CJ consists of a small group of people, selected from the general public, who meet over a number of days to deliberate upon a particular question. The major advantage of this approach is the ability to provide a greater level of technical information and offer fewer time constraints on the deliberation process amongst the group. In the case of dairy farming, the jury was presented with evidence of the economic, environmental and welfare impacts of both conventional and organic systems and asked to recommend its favoured system and how it would define the term organic. Findings - The jury's knowledge of certain aspects of fanning had improved over the two-day period and was unanimous in favouring organic agriculture when solely considering the environment, but was mixed towards the animal welfare effects. Conversely, when considering the economic impacts the jury supported the conventional system. This complicated the decision for the group favouring one particular system. Research limitations/implications - Some bias is introduced into the jury as most citizens either worked or came from an urban background and hence may have less knowledge of dairy systems when compared with those from a rural background. However, most CJs begin from a point where participants have little or no knowledge of the subject and their views are shaped by the CJ process itself. Practical implications - The findings show the implications of the consumer decision-making process. Originality/value - This paper is the first application of a CJ to consider organic food. Previous studies have adopted a questionnaire or focus group approach, both of which impose constraints on information dissemination and time to deliberate on decisions.","[Barnes, Andrew P.; Vergunst, Petra; Topp, Kairsty] Scottish Agr Coll, Land Econ Res Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Scottish Agricultural College,"Barnes, AP (通讯作者)，Scottish Agr Coll, Land Econ Res Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",Andrew.barnes@sac.ac.uk,"Barnes, Andrew P/E-5503-2015; Topp, Cairistiona/L-8439-2016","Topp, Cairistiona/0000-0002-7064-638X; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0001-9368-148X",Scottish Government,Scottish Government,This work is funded as part of the Scottish Government research work packages programme.,,33,18,20,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis includes two steps. In the first, principal component analysis is carried out in order to identify factors that can explain the features that differentiate Italian food firms. In the second phase the role of such factors on innovation behaviour is quantified by means of a logit model. Findings - The empirical analysis showed that, in the Italian food sector, innovation adoption follows different patterns when product or process innovation is considered. In particular, the probability of introducing product innovation is influenced by the quality of human capital, the geographical context and, to a lesser extent, the age of the firm. Research limitations/implications - The research is restricted in so far as it only considers the Italian food sector. Because the data survey is representative only at the level of the manufacturing industry as a whole and excludes firms with fewer than ten employees, the analysis for the food sector can only be indicative. Practical implications - This paper provides a useful source of knowledge on the innovative behaviour of Italian firms. This highlights the need to provide for diversified intervention strategies to stimulate and enforce innovation in the Italian food sector. Originality/value - The research provides some initial insight into firm perspectives in the role of innovations to enhance firms market competitiveness.","[Capitanio, Fabian; Coppola, Adele] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Econ & Policy, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Capitanio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Econ & Policy, Naples, Italy.",capitani@unina.it,"Coppola, Adele/AAV-6741-2021; Capitanio, Fabian/E-7806-2011; Capitanio, Fabian/J-2815-2016","Coppola, Adele/0000-0002-9201-7859; Capitanio, Fabian/0000-0003-0327-8019",,,,,51,81,90,1,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The context is the Norwegian furniture and fishing industries. The samples consisted of 118 respondents, 69 from the fishing industry and 49 from the furniture industry, with an average response rate of 33 percent. Respondents reported on six groups of marketing costs, gave an overall evaluation of their existing and potential management accounting systems and of the systems' existing and potential decision support in nine marketing decision areas. Findings - Marketing costs represented 8.9 per cent of total revenues in the fishing industry and 16.2 per cent in the furniture industry. The difference can be attributed to items that resulted in revenue reductions and promotional costs. Both industries showed significant potential for improvements in management accounting systems. Priorities regarding the nine decision support areas differed between the two industries. Additionally, priorities in the fishing industry seemed to differ regarding time horizons (short- versus long-term). Research limitations/implications - While the discussion was based on a survey representing 55 per cent of the total turnover for the fishing industry and 40 per cent for the furniture industry, the findings cannot be considered valid in other contexts. Thus other studies are welcomed. Practical implications - The findings suggest a need to be fairly familiar with business contexts when preparing a management accounting system. Therefore marketers should become involved and make substantial contributions when any system is developed. At a minimum, marketers should ensure that necessary decision-relevant information is made easily available. Originality/value - Few studies have focused on the cost and profitability aspects of marketing.","[Helgesen, Oyvind; Voldsund, Terje] Aalesund Univ Coll, Inst Int Mkt, Alesund, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Helgesen, O (通讯作者)，Aalesund Univ Coll, Inst Int Mkt, Alesund, Norway.",oh@hials.no,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We argue that to enhance BPA, semantics have to be the core backbone in order to better support the application of analysis techniques on the first hand, and to guide the computation and presentation of the results on the other hand. We propose a knowledge-based approach to supporting strategy-driven BPA by making use of a comprehensive and extensible ontological framework capturing from high-level strategic concerns down to lower-level monitoring information. We describe how corporate strategies can be operationalized into concrete analysis that; can guide the evaluation of organisational processes, structure the presentation of results obtained and better help assess the well-being of corporate business processes.","[Pedrinaci, Carlos; Domingue, John] Open Univ, Knowledge Media Inst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Markovic, Ivan; Hasibether, Florian] SAP Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",Open University - UK; SAP,"Pedrinaci, C (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Knowledge Media Inst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",c.pedrinaci@open.ac.uk; ivan.markovic@sap.com; florian.hasibether@sap.com; j.b.domingue@open.ac.uk,,"Domingue, John/0000-0001-8439-0293",,,,,18,4,4,1,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1865-1348,1865-1356,978-3-642-01189-4,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2009,21.0,,,,,,169,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJQ82,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267007900015,0

Pineapples are one of the main crops supported by the government for commercialization in this state. Pineapple cultivation has the potential to improve the livelihood of the rural people in the state. In Nagaland, pineapples have been grown traditionally, however randomly and with low yields and scattered production. Pineapple fruit grown in the state is of excellent quality in terms of size, appearance, TSS and other aspects. The soil and climatic conditions are well suited for its cultivation. In addition to this, pineapple has been cultivated organically by default. This has provided a great opportunity for a more organized organic pineapple cultivation, focusing on the global market. Progress has been made in the cultivation and commercialization of pineapples in the state and many rural people have shifted from paddy cultivation, an age-old practice, to pineapple production and thereby improving their livelihood to a great extent.

With the large-scale production of pineapple, the establishment of a processing unit has become viable and the state has opened opportunities to become a global player in the organic pineapple trade.

Design/methodology/approach - A model of the world orange juice market is used to assess the presence and level of free riding by Brazilian orange growers on the Florida program. Findings - Recent legal challenges have caused the program to be fully funded by Florida orange growers. The results suggest that elimination of the promotion program would negatively impact grower revenue in both Florida and Sao Paulo and this provides evidence that there is considerable free riding by import suppliers to the US orange juice, market. Originality/value - The paper uses a model of the world orange juice market to consider the effect of elimination of the Florida generic advertising program to promote orange juice consumption in the USA.","[Spreen, Thomas; Jauregui, Carlos] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Spreen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",tspreen@ufl.edu,,,,,,,12,1,1,2,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Despite the increasing interest in using the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model by researchers, few studies have looked into the mechanism of feedback effects. We introduce a method called the stepwise distribution of emissions embodied in trade (SWD-EET) to reveal how the emissions embodied in trade are absorbed by a country's final demands through a series of allocation steps. A country's indirect absorption patterns and its indirect trade balance of emissions from bilateral trade with other countries are also studied based on the proposed method. An empirical study using the data of Asian economies shows significant differences in the consumption-based emission estimates for some economies due to feedback effects through international trade. The differences can be largely captured by the first step or the first two steps of the adjustment procedure in the SWD-EET analysis. Other findings and some recommendations are also presented.

The analysis reveals that responses by leading international organisations continue to appeal to the precepts of neoclassical economy. We argue that from an ecological economics perspective, policy responses under the various labels of green economy, green growth, sustainable growth, green new deal, fall well short of what is needed to fight the environmental crisis and rising inequality across and within countries. The idea of justice and equity that underpins the mainstream approach seems inadequate in terms of sustaining our environmental base and global environmental justice. Based on this critical review, we propose an 'alternative turn', centred on three elements of a paradigm shift leading to a new economy where the environmental base and global environmental justice are at the centre of the discourse.

We develop an approach that synthesizes the best features of the two main methods in the estimation of production efficiency. Specifically, our approach first allows for statistical noise, similar to Stochastic frontier analysis (even in a more flexible way), and second, it allows modelling multiple-inputs-multiple-outputs technologies without imposing parametric assumptions on production relationship, similar to what is done in non-parametric methods, like Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Free Disposal Hull (FDH), etc.... The methodology is based on the theory of local maximum likelihood estimation and extends recent works of Kumbhakar et al. (J Econom 137(1):1-27, 2007) and Park et al. (J Econom 146:185-198, 2008). Our method is suitable for modelling and estimation of the marginal effects onto inefficiency level jointly with estimation of marginal effects of input. The approach is robust to heteroskedastic cases and to various (unknown) distributions of statistical noise and inefficiency, despite assuming simple anchorage models. The method also improves DEA/FDH estimators, by allowing them to be quite robust to statistical noise and especially to outliers, which were the main problems of the original DEA/FDH estimators. The procedure shows great performance for various simulated cases and is also illustrated for some real data sets. Even in the single-output case, our simulated examples show that our stochastic DEA/FDH improves the Kumbhakar et al. (J Econom 137(1):1-27, 2007) method, by making the resulting frontier smoother, monotonic and, if we wish, concave.","[Zelenyuk, Valentin] KEI, UA-04119 Kiev, Ukraine; [Simar, Leopold] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Simar, Leopold] Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Zelenyuk, Valentin] KSE, Kiev, Ukraine",Kyiv School of Economics; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Kyiv School of Economics,"Zelenyuk, V (通讯作者)，KEI, Vul Yakira 13, UA-04119 Kiev, Ukraine.",vzelenyuk@eerc.kiev.ua,"Zelenyuk, Valentin/L-3687-2019",,,,,,28,363,364,5,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

However, little is known about how this survey mode may influence data quality and welfare estimates. As part of a national contingent valuation (CV) survey estimating willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity protection plans, we assign two groups of respondents either to an Internet or face-to-face (in-home) interview mode. Our design aims to better isolate measurement effects from sample composition effects by drawing both samples from the same sample frame. We find little evidence of social desirability bias in the interview setting or satisficing (shortcutting the response process) in the Internet survey. The share of don't knows, zeros and protest responses to the WTP question with a payment card is very similar between modes and equality of mean WTP cannot be rejected. Results are fairly encouraging for the use of Internet in CV as stated preferences do not seem to be significantly different or biased compared to face-to-face interviews. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In order to examine how to improve the appeal of such schemes, a choice experiment was conducted concerning 444 Danish farmers' preferences for subsidy schemes for pesticide-free buffer zones. A random parameter logit framework was used to capture heterogeneity among farmers. Our results indicate that 1) the vast majority of farmers are willing to trade off the size of the subsidy for less restrictive scheme requirements and that 2) the amount of the subsidy they are willing to trade off varies with specific scheme requirements, suggesting which features are most important for successful policy design. Our results suggest that farmers value flexible contract terms higher than reduced administrative burdens. Finally, we suggest a practical approach to estimating a monetary value of farmers' reluctance to participate in AES. While the trade off's that farmers are willing to make between subsidy size and individual scheme requirements are case specific, our results concerning increased use of farm advisors, farmers ability of valuing different types of flexibility, and our attempt to place a monetary value on farmers' reluctance to engage in regulatory subsidy schemes have a potentially broader application platform.

This decoupling was highlighted when economic activity and CO2 emissions moved in opposite directions in 2009. More generally, we observe several periods of relative decoupling in Brazil, but not to the extent witnessed in 2009. To identify the determinants of emissions change, we develop a decomposition model based on a log-mean Divisia index (LMDI) framework. The results indicate that the carbon intensity and energy mix are the main determinant of emissions reduction in Brazil between 2004 and 2009. Modifications in the economy structure are also associated to emission mitigation in the period. Such evidence demonstrates similarities with events of decoupling registered for the interval 1980-1994 in Brazil. Finds from Brazil differ from observations in other countries in which improvement in energy intensity has been the most common determinant of emissions reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

New evidence on the relationship between firm size and innovativeness,CLIOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Innovation; Firm Size; Technology; Patents,PATENT RIGHTS; MARKET POWER; COMPETITION; SPILLOVERS; GROWTH,"Many papers have been written about the effect of firm size on innovativeness, revealing a positive, a negative or a mixed impact. To this day, the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis of the above-average innovativeness of large firms has neither been confirmed nor rejected, often because of insufficient data or a too-short observation period. Many studies concentrate only on a specific region or sector, or they analyze a very short time period. Windows of technological opportunities, providing technological booms for both firms and sectors, have not yet been investigated. An analysis of Germany's chemical, metal and electrical-engineering sectors between 1877 and 1932 reveals that the sector-specific long-term relationship between firm size and innovativeness is negative, except during times of specific technological booms. In combination with firm-specific characteristics, this new aspect can contribute to a better understanding of the long-term relationship between firm size and innovativeness.","Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Degner, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany.",h.degner@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,62,5,6,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JUN,2011,5.0,2,,,,,121,144,,10.1007/s11698-010-0054-z,0.0,,,24,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,756BX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289987800002,0

The case under study requires a non-aggregated spatial distribution of the fields to be enrolled in an agri-environmental programme. A spatially explicit mathematical programming farm-based model, which accounts for three spatial levels (field, farm and landscape), is coupled with a relevant spatial pattern index (the Ripley L-function) to analyse the design and implementation of an agri-environmental programme aimed to preserve the Tetrax tetrax in the Plaine de Niort, France. The model is run using a stylised map with heterogeneous soil types and both crop growing and mixed dairy farms. Results show that valuable insights into agri-environmental programme design are gained through a detailed representation of farming system management. The suitable, non-aggregated spatial pattern for T. tetrax conservation is more costly than less-suitable, more aggregated patterns, because it tends to require equal participation of all farms. The policy simulations reveal that the various spatial patterns can be obtained through relatively simple uniform contract structures. An effective contract structure entails a set of two degressive payments which encourages all farms to enrol at least a small share of their land in the program. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In a study in boreal Sweden, we compared the cost-effectiveness of three different approaches a forest owner may use to select patches: selection based on the conservation value of patches alone, economic cost alone or both of them combined. We also compared the cost-effectiveness of six different common types of patches. Conservation value was measured as species richness of bryophytes and lichens and as structural characteristics of patches. Compared to the selection approach in which both conservation value and cost were used, cost-effectiveness was 5-14% lower when only conservation value was used, depending on how conservation value was measured. On the contrary, using only the economic cost decreased the cost-effectiveness by only 1-2%. Among the patch types, swamp forest areas and deciduous tree groups were cost-effective types to retain. However, the patch types were complementary in their species composition and all hosted unique species. We argue that, ideally, assessments of both conservation values and economic costs of retaining patches should be made prior to harvest to enable planners to make well-informed and cost-effective decisions.

Providing public information on past actions can promote trust through the formation of reputations. We developed an economic experiment to test whether a formal reputation mechanism could facilitate trusting relationships in the tradable grazing rights markets. Providing information to create formal public reputations for market participants did not increase the overall efficiency of the market. However, it did result in greater equality of income between partners, suggesting that participants showed more concern for their partners when they knew they would be rated. Even with public reputation information, bilateral relationships remained central to the market. Market failures in existing grazing rights markets may be better addressed by measures to increase communication between partners rather than simply relying on a formal reputation mechanism.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,"Muscadine-wines, wineries and the hospitality industry An exploratory study of relationships",BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wines; Hospitality services; Channel relationships; United States of America,FOOD,"Purpose - Muscadines (Vitis Rotundifolia Michx.), a vine native to the southern USA, is processed into different products, including wines. Today, many wineries in the southern USA offer an experience that combines muscadine wine tastings, tours, education, and in some cases food. However, apart from offering on-site sales and a tourist experience related to the hospitality industry, to what extent are wineries engaged in relationships with local or state restaurants? Also, what, if any, challenges do wine operators face in the process of seeking to market their wines to hospitality operations? The present study aims to explore these areas from a winery operator's perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 31 winery owners located in different southern states, including Alabama, Florida and North Carolina, predominantly via telephone interviews. Findings - Almost half of the respondents (15, 48.4 per cent) acknowledge synergies between their wineries and hospitality businesses; however, the other 16 (51.6 per cent) are not involved in such relationships. Such absence of networks and relationships is to a great extent due to concerns of surrendering control of their wines to wholesalers and distributors (in many cases winery operators are not allowed to sell directly to restaurateurs), and the apparent lack of appreciation of muscadine wines by many hospitality businesses. Research limitations/implications - While the findings of this study may provide useful information to the muscadine wine industry, particularly as a foundation for future research, the low number of participating wineries presents a limitation. Practical implications - Muscadine wines have the potential to enhance not only winery visitors' experience when travelling to areas where muscadine grapes are grown, but also their restaurant/dining experience. However, support in the form of promotion, education and legislation, allowing more direct winery-hospitality industry relationship, is critical for the long-term sustainability of the muscadine-wine industry. Originality/value - The present study examines an area that, despite its clear links to hospitality and tourism, to date has been overlooked in contemporary research.","[Alonso, Abel Duarte] Edith Cowan Univ, Churchlands, WA 6018, Australia; [Alonso, Abel Duarte] Univ Western Sydney, Joondalup, Australia",Edith Cowan University; Western Sydney University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Churchlands, WA 6018, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,54,6,6,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index and Grubel-Lloyd index (GLUT) to indicate sectors and markets where country's exports are more (or less) competitive in relation to their trading partners, present on a given destination market. Findings - B&H agrifood import, export and trade deficit are growing, but export growth rate is significantly higher, especially on SEE markets. The values of RCA and GLUT index are indicating better overall B&H agribusiness performances at SEE market in comparison with EU 27. Findings confirm that trade liberalization opened up a window of opportunity, which is not efficiently utilized by B&H agribusiness sector. Research limitations/implications - RCA does not provide information of how spotted advantages will evolve and overlooks impacts of public policies. The GLUT offers no information of correlation in quality between imported and exported goods. Practical implications - As for the government, the main implication is the mode to improve the business environment, especially to empower institutions which have to provide services in order to meet international agreements requirements and customers' requirements. Originality/value - There are no studies examining B&H agribusiness trade patterns, competitiveness and level of integration at SEE market which used disaggregated trade data. The outcomes could be used to craft both direct public sector policies and private business policies in order to improve sector competitiveness.","[Nikolic, Aleksandra; Bajramovic, Sabahudin; Ognjenovic, Dragana; Lalic, Davor; Uzunovic, Mirza] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Inst Agr & Food Ind Econ, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Nikolic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Inst Agr & Food Ind Econ, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",a.nikolic@ppf.unsa.ba,,,,,,,30,5,5,2,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In order to help the Chinese government to establish a food traceability system (FTS), the authors conducted the present research which aims to investigate the acceptability of certified traceable (CT) food among Chinese consumers. Design/methodology/approach - A survey consisting of face-to-face interviews with 1,757 consumers from 13 cities in the Jiangsu Province of China was used. The 13 cities fell into three different categories according to their levels of economic development. The acceptance and purchase of CT food were compared and analyzed in the three levels of consumers. The factors affecting consumer unwillingness to purchase CT food were obtained by factor analysis. Findings - After the respondents were fully informed about FTS, their acceptance level for CT food significantly increased. The respondents who were willing to buy CT food particularly preferred milk, eggs, and honey as well as meats such as pork, beef, mutton, chicken and duck. Of the total respondents, 68 per cent stated that they would be willing to pay extra for CT food. The main factors affecting consumer unwillingness to buy CT food were: lack of familiarity with CT food and doubt about its function, preference for direct and concise food quality labels, and worries regarding excessively high prices. Practical implications - Ultimately, it is hoped to improve the overall safety of food in China and potentially worldwide. The Chinese government has to ensure the effectiveness of the FTS, to increase public knowledge about the FTS, to allocate government funds for the establishment of a FTS, and to give extra support to underdeveloped regions. These are the key issues that the Chinese government faces in establishing and popularizing the food traceability system. Originality/value - This paper researched the acceptability of CT food among Chinese consumers and the factors preventing its acceptance. It provides valuable information for developing countries while seeking to raise China's food safety levels.","[Wu, Linhai; Xu, Lingling; Gao, Jian] Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Prov Res Base Food Safety, Wuxi, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Prov Res Base Food Safety, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",hualongxifeng6130@sina.com,,,Nation Soft Science Project of China [2009GXS5B078],Nation Soft Science Project of China,This research is supported by a grant from the 2009 Nation Soft Science Project of China (Project Number: 2009GXS5B078).

Baumgartner and Quaas (2010) define sustainability economics as the combination of economic efficiency and justice in the distribution of nature's services. Van den Bergh (in press) criticizes their approach as 'axiomatic' and incomplete, lacking a discussion of environmental externalities and dogmas like the 'GDP dogma'. The focus on non-measurable welfare or happiness in both articles impairs the use and usefulness of their sustainability notions for applied economics and policy. Alternatively, environmentally modified national accounts offer a quantifiable sustainability concept of produced and natural capital maintenance. For practical reasons, sustainability economics should therefore deal with sustainable economic performance and growth. Coordination with other social goals has to be left to politics.

We extend previous studies in two ways. First, to explore the spatial dimension of inequity, we adopt a perfect decomposable inequality measure-the Theil index-in our analysis. Secondly, we conduct a before and after comparison of a change in the degree of decentralization in Canada-the introduction of the CHST in 1996/1997. This may shed some lights on the casual relationship between decentralization and health-related inequity. The results of our analysis show that the overall inequity in health care utilization is mostly explained by variations within provinces in Canada. The increase in the degree of decentralization is related to lower degree of overall and within-province inequity in the use of GP and hospital services, and lower between-province inequity in the use of all the three health care variables examined in this paper.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhong, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 S Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",haizhong@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,33,12,14,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

These two limitations are primarily caused by the fact that the materials balance condition is strictly regulated by the law of mass/energy conservation and that mass/energy content cannot be a good physical common unit of various inputs. The use of cumulative exergy content overcomes these problems. The use of cumulative exergy content allows the inclusion of life cycle assessment; hence facilitates the analysis of the cumulative pollution and total affects on natural resources. The present study uses cumulative exergy content to construct new efficiency sustainable measures and decomposes them into technical efficiency and cumulative exergy allocative efficiency in agricultural production. Empirical applications on OECD agriculture yielded a number of important findings: (1) OECD has the potential to save 72.3% of cumulative exergy consumption and improvements can be achieved by being more technically efficient and choosing a better combination of inputs; (2) the sustainable efficiency varied enormously across countries; and (3) the efficiency levels in 2003 was lower than in 1990.

The water footprint is defined as the total volume of water used during production and consumption of goods and services as well as direct water consumption by humans Water is not only consumed directly but also indirectly in production processes Therefore, calculating the water footprint enables us to quantify total water consumed along the whole global supply chain. In this paper, we develop a regional input-output (IO) model extended by water consumption coefficients to quantify the respective domestic water footprint for different consumption categories for the South-East and North-East of England and the UK, i.e. the water consumed directly and indirectly along the regional supply chain In addition, we calculate the total water footprints which include both domestic water consumption and the water required in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed in the region under investigation through applying a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. Both footprints also include households' direct consumption of water With regards to the two regions, we can observe a very pronounced regional disparity of regional (domestic and total) water footprints between the relatively water-scarce South-East and the water-rich North-East of England We find that the domestic water footprint per capita in the South-East is 22% higher than the domestic water footprint per capita in the North-East. The key water cosumers include Agriculture, Food Products. Electricity and Gas Production, and Hotel and Catering. The total water footprints per capita in the South-East (1257 m(3)/year) are more than twice the ones in the North-East (597 m(3)/year). The domestic water footprint focuses only on the supply chain effects and associated water consumption within the regional boundaries, which are usually of higher interest to policy makers and water companies concerned with the balance of supply and demand of water resources within their respective administrative boundaries or watersheds The total water footprint allows assessing global effects and supports global supply chain management and is also introducing notions of fairness and equity in terms of resource consumption.

Evidence from the market for physician services,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Managed care; Physician services; Physician behavior; Endogeneity,PLANS; TESTS; COST,"Managed care has been the dominant organization of health care coverage in the United States, and seeks to achieve cost control by constraining services. The restrictive practices of managed care organizations have been widely criticized and the role of managed care in constraining health care services may be declining. Physician behavior is also believed to be influenced by the practices of managed care organization. This study examines the evolving nature of managed care and its restrictive effects on the provision of physician services. Physicians can choose whether and to what extent they are involved in managed care, so it is an endogenous decision. We employ instrumental variables method to correct for this endogeneity. Using data from the Community Tracking Study physician surveys from 2000-2001 and 2004-2005, we find that managed care organizations have became relatively less restrictive over time in terms of limiting the provision of physician services, compared to non-managed care organizations. These results suggest that managed care and non-managed care are converging in their effects on the provision of physician services.","[Fang, Hai] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Hlth Syst Management & Policy, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Colorado School of Public Health; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Fang, H (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Hlth Syst Management & Policy, Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, 13001 E 17th Pl Room E3312,Campus Box B119, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",hai.fang@ucdenver.edu; john.rizzo@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,37,3,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The present paper aims to investigate whether the daily intake of phospholipid concentrate (PL) rich in phosphatidylserine (PS) and sphingomyelin (SM) has similar beneficial effects on working memory, allostastic load and the acute stress response. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 46 healthy men (average 41.5 years) received either placebo or 13.5 g per day PL over a three-week period. On the 21st day of PL intake, subjects' working memory performance and their psychological and endocrine responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) were tested. Findings - Compared to placebo-exposed individuals, there was a tendency for shorter reaction times in the working memory task, suggesting better performance in PL-treated subjects. The two treatment groups did not significantly differ in their endocrine stress response. However, PL-treated subjects with a higher stress load showed a blunted psychological stress response. Practical implications - Results of the present study show beneficial effects of PL intake on cognitive performance. Under acute stress, benefits of PL may only be visible in chronically stressed subjects. Originality/value - This paper provides new information for practitioners, academics and food supplement industries interested in possible beneficial effects of a milk phospholipid product on memory and mental stress.","[Hellhammer, Juliane; Hero, Torsten; Buss, Claudia] Diagnost Assessment & Clin Res Org, DAaCRO, Trier, Germany; [Waladkhani, Ali-Reza] Univ Trier, FPP Ctr Psychobiol & Psychosomat Res, Trier, Germany; [Hero, Torsten; Buss, Claudia] Univ Trier, Dept Psychobiol, Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier; Universitat Trier,"Hellhammer, J (通讯作者)，Diagnost Assessment & Clin Res Org, DAaCRO, Trier, Germany.",hellhammer@daacro.de,"Hellhammer, Juliane/GQI-4368-2022; Buss, Claudia/ABC-3687-2020","Hellhammer, Juliane/0000-0001-9262-6681","Arla Foods Ingredients amba, Denmark","Arla Foods Ingredients amba, Denmark","This study was supported by Arla Foods Ingredients amba, Denmark.

After examining the variants of economic models for RETs, the risk dimensions of traditional energies and RETs were compared. The asymmetry risks allocated between traditional energy and RETs were shown. Combining these asymmetry risk allocations, a project-based RETs financial feasibility model which simultaneously integrates cost and risk information with respect to renewable and traditional energy technologies, was developed. Results of the analysis showed that the risk premium of traditional energies should include the effects of the escalation and volatility of fuel prices. On a national/regional level, the subsidy of fossil fuels for traditional energy production, which is embedded in the economic development policy, should be recovered and the degree to which investment of RETs improved the efficiency of cost-risk portfolio should be measured.

This change in application prompts two issues requiring careful examination: (1) what is measured by Leontief inverses or extended environmental Leontief inverses, and (2) whether a sector's land multiplier (or compositions of land multiplier) can appropriately reflect the effect of delivering one unit of the sector's output to final demand on the required area(s) of production lands used by the sector itself and by other producing sectors whose products are contributed directly and indirectly to its production. The underlying message of these two questions is whether the assumed linear marginal relationship between a sector's output and its intermediate inputs (input-output coefficients)-a critical assumption made by W. Leontief to transform a transactions table from an accounting framework into the input-output model-can be extended to assume that the marginal relationship between a sector's output and the area of production land it uses for generating output is fixed (land-output marginal coefficient equal to average coefficient). By reviewing the literature on input-output analysis and its application to environmental issues and by theoretically and empirically examining the relation between sector output and land appropriation, this study advises against the use of land multipliers or their compositions in the EF scenario analysis. To apply the input-output model to EF scenario analysis for enhancing policy relevance with due attention to the relationship between sector output and land appropriation, this study suggests a two-stage EF calculation procedure. In the first stage. the input-output application estimates only the required raw materials (or generated pollutants) for meeting a given consumption pattern, which is the objective of environmental input-output analysis: in the second stage, the estimated amount of raw materials or pollutants is converted into land/water area, and a choice of conversion methods is suggested according to the research questions and the availability of conversion methods and required data.

The Finnish analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s has been particularly focused on the importance of foreign trade. Despite the lack of quantified evidence, it is commonly accepted that the export industries had a major role in the economic development. The basic input-output framework is extended into a production-consumption model to produce a more elaborate model that provides a quantification of changes in final demand of some key industries in the economy. Results suggest that even though the role of export industries was dominant, domestic market industries and private consumption also had a significant role in the depression.","OECD & Int Transport Forum, Joint Transport Res Ctr, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Kauppila, J (通讯作者)，OECD & Int Transport Forum, Joint Transport Res Ctr, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",jari.kauppila@oecd.org,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2009,3.0,3,,,,,245,273,,10.1007/s11698-008-0034-8,0.0,,,29,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279352200003,0

These externalities call for corrective measures by the government. Economists have developed a number of procedures that provide reasonable estimates on the monetary value of some amenities and externalities. In this paper we develop a spatially-explicit hedonic pricing model for house prices in order to quantify the social cost of aircraft noise disturbance in monetary terms. While focusing on aircraft noise around Amsterdam airport in the urban fringe of the Amsterdam region, a key point in our analysis is that we account for background noise. We do this by taking multiple sources of traffic noise (i.e. road. railway and aircraft noise) into account simultaneously and by setting threshold values for all three sources of noise above which sound is generally experienced as nuisance. Based on our regression results we conclude that a higher noise level means ceteris paribus a lower house price. Air traffic has the largest price impact, followed by railway traffic and road traffic. These model outcomes can subsequently be used to estimate the marginal and total benefits of aircraft noise reduction in the studied area around Amsterdam airport. We find a marginal benefit of 1 dB noise reduction of 1459 Euro per house, leading to a total benefit of 1 dB noise reduction of 574 million Euros. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It highlights an important gap in the historiography of Indian railway finance, which has focused on the period up to 1875. The role of N. M. Rothschild as lead underwriter and its relationship with the India Office, managing agents, and investors is analysed. This gives an evolving picture of mutual dependence between the City and Whitehall in the financing of the British Empire's largest investment programme. Gentlemanly capitalists are shown to combine the self-reinforcing roles of arranger, investor, and informal government advisor.","Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Sweeney, S (通讯作者)，Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, England.",,"Sweeney, Stuart H/G-7024-2015",,,,,,43,3,4,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The ratios of the decomposition analysis are discussed in relation to the social and economic drivers of energy use, and the kinds of changes in these drivers which would be necessary to bring the ratios about.

At the same time, other research suggests that Japanese banks' support for inefficient firms prolonged recessions by reducing productivity through misallocation of resources. Using the data on large manufacturing firms between 1969 and 1996, the paper attempts to disentangle the factors behind the slowdown in productivity growth during the 1990s. The main results show that there was a significant drop in within-firm productivity, the component that is not affected by reallocation of input and output shares across firms over time, during the 1990s. Although we find that misallocation among large continuing firms represents a substantial drag to overall TFP growth for these firms throughout the sample period, the negative impact of misallocation was least visible during the 1990s. The significant reduction in within-firm productivity growth suggests that, as the Japanese economy has matured, a policy which fosters technological innovations via greater competition, R&D, and fast technological adoption may have become increasingly important in promoting economic growth.","[Griffin, Naomi N.] Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC USA; [Odaki, Kazuhiko] Minist Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan",Congressional Budget Office,"Griffin, NN (通讯作者)，Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC USA.",naomi.griffin@cbo.gov; odaki-kazuhiko@meti.go.jp,,"Griffin, Naomi/0000-0001-5750-9383",,,,,15,8,9,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Under traditional management the land area used per person was relatively large but few resources were imported. Although the reliance on local resources has declined through interactions with Western society, at least some exploitation of the natural environment remains. This means that higher-density urban populations, which are largely non-indigenous, have larger footprints than rural and remote populations, which are largely Indigenous. Thus Northern Territory urban populations are not necessarily requiring less land, but are just offsetting their land impacts to other regions. Finally, Indigenous ecological footprints are found to be heavily influenced by the provision of government services. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Conservative estimates indicate that the boycott resulted in 26% lower weekly sales at its peak, and 13% lower sales over the 6 months period that we estimate the boycott lasted. Although theory suggests consumers would not participate in boycotts due to a free-rider problem, these findings indicate that businesses should be concerned that consumers may boycott their products.

The departing point for this research was the recognition that although there is a relative agreement regarding the need to develop new multi-dimensional, inclusive and plural approaches to water resource management, there is still a deficiency of related methodologies and tools. This acknowledgement has motivated the undertaking of the ADVISOR - Integrated Evaluation for Sustainable River Basin Governance research project, which aimed at improving the understanding of evaluation processes, as part of river basin planning and management, and to test the use of specific tools to support the conduct of participatory processes. The paper starts with a discussion of the concept of integrated water resources management and an illustration of the water policies that have been adopted in different countries as a response to these trends. The conceptual framework that was developed in ADVISOR is then presented, as well as the main results from the ex-post analysis of the decision processes regarding five water related projects in different European countries. This analysis concluded that, in most situations, the decision-making processes fell short of including the interests, perceptions and values of affected parties. The remaining of the paper introduces the articles that form this special section, mostly devoted to the testing of new platforms for participation and deliberation. In the final section, a discussion on the assumptions and limitations of deliberative processes is presented, based on the results from the application of the different methods. Further research needs on the integration of different deliberative tools and on the integration of deliberation with decision processes are identified. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A group of stakeholders was involved in a causal mapping exercise that lead to the development of a shared view of the problems, pressures and impacts characterizing the river basin. A simulation model was also developed to support experimentation with alternative management scenarios for the area. The paper looks critically at the evaluation of the participatory modelling outcomes, both at the individual and group levels, discussing the role of this approach in supporting the scoping stages of river basin planning and management processes. On the downside, the unstable group composition seems to have hindered the chances of producing a higher impact in the functioning of the group, and subsequently the capacity to sustain the level of collaboration required to achieve the strategic river basin objectives established during the participatory modelling process. The paper discusses the issue of group stability as well as some options to overcome the limitations of unstable participant groups. The strengths of participatory modelling, as underlined by the Baixo Guadiana experience, include the flexibility to adapt the method to different contexts and participatory designs and the capacity to structure the active involvement of stakeholders, providing an open and shared language for collaborative policy design, fostering learning and knowledge integration.

Anxious about its political position, it avoided the necessary measures, involving stringent deflation and possibly devaluation. This article seeks to revise the traditional view by re-examining the response to what were actually two sterling crises. The first was handled efficiently. The second was provoked by speculation stemming from market expectations of devaluation. The decision not to devalue but seek external support was justifiable, given changes within the international economy which were to create problems for many postwar nation states.","Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Newton, S (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,,,,,,,49,18,18,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

J,"Illge, L; Schwarze, R",,,,"Illge, Lydia; Schwarze, Reimund",,,A matter of opinion-How ecological and neoclassical environmental economists and think about sustainability and economics,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sustainability; Ecological economics; Neoclassical economics; Research prospects; Cluster analysis; Questionnaire,,"The differing paradigms of ecological and neoclassical environmental economics have been described in various articles and books and are also embedded in different professional associations. However, we cannot take for granted that the paradigm debates described in the literature are actually mirrored in exactly the same way in the perceptions and opinions of researchers looking at sustainability from an economic perspective. This paper presents empirical results from a German case study on how economists and others involved in sustainability research from different schools of thought think about the issues of sustainability and economics, how they group around these issues, how they feel about the current scientific divide, and what they expect to be future topics of sustainability research. We analyze the data using cluster analysis. Based on a literature survey, we generated forty sustainability economics-related statements and asked 196 sustainability researchers about their degree of agreement or disagreement with these statements. In evaluating our survey results, we discuss to what extent the clusters that we identified do - or do not - represent the two schools of thought of ecological and neoclassical environmental economics. We also propose some fields of research that can help to bridge the gaps amongst sustainabihty economics researchers while clearly marking others that are more suitable for a scientific 'competition of ideas'. Key results of the study are: We identify two primary scientific clusters, one clearly confirming the existence of the ecological-economics school of thought, and the other largely capturing the neoclassical environmental view. Yet, there are some surprising exceptions: Both schools of thought share a conceptual definition of sustainability that is integrative in considering ecological, societal and economic dimensions ('three pillar concept') and is geared at preserving the development potentials of society. We also find a shared critique of 'pure economic growth' strategies in our sample. These shared opinions may provide bridging concepts between the schools of thought. Also both clusters agree with respect to a wide range of future fields of sustainability economics research. Yet, the research agenda of the ecological-economics cluster contains a large number of additional topics, primarily related to social, distributional and evolutionary aspects of sustainable development. Strong divides between the clusters that seem to be more suitable for a scientific competition of ideas are primarily related to the question of how to achieve sustainability, including appropriate environmental policies.

This paper aims to assess the availability and efficient management of resources for environmental health services (EHS), as well as the approach followed by local government (metropolitan and district municipalities as well as provincial health departments) in allocating available resources to monitor and control the informal milk-producing sector in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire survey was conducted, targeting the cohort of municipal health service (MHS) managers (n = 52) at the various metros and DMs in South Africa. Questions focused on physical and human resource management as well as the approach followed by MHS towards milk hygiene control. Findings - At the time of the survey it was determined that resources (financial, human and to a lesser extent transport) available for MHS to effectively monitor, control and support the informal milk-producing sector, were insufficient. Although food control enjoys high priority in MHS, activities such as sampling, premises inspections, and health and hygiene education at milking parlours, are predominantly performed on an ad hoc basis. This approach impacts negatively on the management of available resources and the effectiveness of interventions, leading to a need for national and provincial governments, industry and relevant associations to support and strengthen the capacity of municipalities to optimally exercise their powers and perform their functions. Originality/value - The importance of the paper lies in its quantification and description of the current MHS situation in South Africa and thereby, via quantifiable results it makes an appeal to regulatory bodies towards channelling and effective management of resources by applying project management principles and skills.","[Agenbag, M.

The acclimatization period has been a critical period in this process, determining evolution of plant development and time needed for obtaining plantlets adequate for transfer to the field. This work was carried out to determine the effects of substrates and fertilizer doses on 'Imperial' pineapple plantlets growth during acclimatization. Treatments studied were combinations of the substrates Plantmax (R), Plantmax (R) plus soil, Plantmax (R) plus carbonized rice straw, Plantmax (R) plus soil and carbonized rice straw, with the Osmocote (R) fertilizer at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 kg/m(-3) in a 4 x 5 factorial scheme set up in randomized blocks with four replications. 120 days after transfer of plantlets to the greenhouse the following variables were evaluated: shoot and root length, root number, shoot and root dry mass. Plantmax substrate alone was superior to its combination with soil and carbonized rice straw, resulting in better plant growth during the acclimatization period. Plant growth was improved by application of Osmocote fertilizer.","[Ferreira, E. A.] EPAMIG CTTP, POB 351, BR-38001970 Uberaba, MG, Brazil; [Costa, F. H.

The estimates are based on enrolment in different forms of education, stretching as far back as 1812, and the size and age distribution of the population within age range 15-65 years. The secular accumulation of human capital has closely matched the long-term trend in aggregate productivity and both grew at a rate of 2.4% annually. Our estimates differ significantly from the data attributed to Sweden in the international short-cut estimates of human capital for the period since 1960. The basic question addressed is about causality: whether human capital causes economic growth or if causality goes in the other direction. We address this problem with modified Granger-causality tests. According to our results, changes in the stock of human capital have in a systematic way preceded changes in aggregate productivity up to the structural crisis in the 1970s. This allows us to conclude that human capital has been a causal factor in Swedish economic growth since the industrialisation. However, after 1975, the growth of human capital has not been able to match the demands of the third industrial revolution.","[Ljungberg, Jonas; Nilsson, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Ljungberg, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",jonas.ljungberg@ekh.lu.se,"Ljungberg, Jonas/JNS-3650-2023",,,,,,63,40,43,2,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2009,3.0,1,,,,,71,95,,10.1007/s11698-008-0027-7,0.0,,,25,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,618KG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279351000004,0

Inherent in the debate around food deserts (i.e. how they are defined, if and where they exist) is the topic of access. The central purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that access is a more accurate and less misleading concept than food deserts when it comes to highlighting food inequalities. Design/methodology/approach - Social exclusion, choice, food security, and public health are fields on which the paper draws. The proposition is that food security studies have entered a postmodern food security paradigm, which can readily be seen in US-based community food security efforts. Findings - Progressing beyond the initial attention-grabbing nature of the food desert term, a conceptually thin foundation is discovered that impedes universal understanding and acknowledgment that areas of inadequate food access do exist. Food access, on the other hand, is an established phrase that has evolved and been applied in different arenas to address food security. Food access is a readily understood concept that can be tailored to specific applications; whether it is physical, economic, or informational food access.

A standard practice is to leave the land fallow for three years, followed by fumigation with EDB before replanting with pineapples. Later in the season, chemical nematicides are used for nematode control. In this trial, the effect of intercropping with a cover crop to enhance soil fertility and/or control nematodes was determined. Four crops (velvet bean - Macuna sp., dolichos bean - Dolichos sp., cow peas - Vigna sp., sunn hemp - Crotolaria sp.) and a control (fallow) were planted in a randomized block design. After incorporating the green material of each cover crop into the soil, half of each plot was fumigated with EDB. Results showed that fumigated plots performed better than the non-fumigated plots both for yield and nematode control. The sunn hemp + EDB treatment had the highest yield with 73.2 t/ha followed by fallow + EDB with a yield of 71.6 t/ha. In the non-fumigated treatments, fallow produced the highest yields with 49.4 t/ha followed by sunn hemp with 39.1 t/ha. In the non-fumigated treatments, nematode numbers in pineapple plants ranged from 120 nematodes in 10 g roots in the sunn hemp treatment to 2000 nematodes in 10 g roots in dolichos bean treatment, having a direct effect on yield. Only sunn hemp can be considered in a rotation system. Velvet bean that is supposedly resistant to Pratylenchus brachyurus proved to be susceptible and was not able to keep the nematode numbers down in the pineapple crop.","[Rabie, E. C.; Tustin, H.

The goal of framework SCADA is to employ the application of semantic web - context aware environment, by aggregating context from different sources within a local environment and determining the appropriate service for the user. The major contributions of this paper are context representation and context processing. Ontology has been used to formally describe contextual information since it represents data and information in semantic notations and supports reasoning process to abstract new knowledge or fact. The increasing complexity required for context awareness makes such kind of applications difficult to write and adapt, hence the skeleton frame format has been discussed for building context aware applications as dynamically composed sequences of calls to fine granularity context services, addressing the reactive behavior of pervasive driving environments.","[Saravanan, K.; Thangavelu, Arunkumar; Madhangi, M.; Devi, R.

Using annual 1994-2003 data on prices of molecules that treat cardiovascular disease, we examine whether drug price dispersion has indeed decreased across five EU countries. Hedonic regressions show that over time, cross-country price differences between Germany and three of the four other EU sample countries, France, Italy and Spain, have declined, with relative prices in all three as well as the fourth country, UK, rising during the period.

The revisionist thinking insists indirect incentives and a cooperative, reciprocal relationship are often more appropriate. Those characteristics, however, hark back to the indirect, cooperative interventions that constitute community conservation, which PES was originally designed as an improvement over. In that context, this study revisits the criticisms and potential benefits of community conservation. We analyze a case study of community conservation in Peru and find that it supported an uptake of forest-friendly behaviors. We take up the suggestion of a two-stage approach to PES, but refine it based on our results that indicate an important role for cognitive (e.g. education) alongside structural interventions (e.g. provision of alternatives), and a strong role for social consensus to support conservationist behavior. Community conservation can provide these elements in a first-stage of PES to create a social context conducive to conservation. Without creating that context first, PES could destabilize local resource management norms rather than improve on them. With the social context established, however, a market mechanism can be implemented in the second stage to reinforce the new conservationist behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To address this issue, we apply a regional approach to generate ecological footprints based on the multi-region input-output model. This method enables us to trace the origin of regional consumption and to systematically account for the ecological impacts embodied in interregional trade. By using decomposition analysis, we attribute regional differences in ecological footprints to three behavioral factors associated with consumption: the selection of production origins, the structure of consumption and the level of expenditure. An empirical study for China's eight regions shows substantial cross-regional variation in terms of the amount of land appropriation and the mix of land types. The empirical study also confirms that not only how much is being consumed and what is being consumed, but also geographical origins (and, by implication, regionally specific production processes and methods) influence consumption-induced ecological impacts. This paper therefore sheds light on the importance of accounting for interregional variation in consumer behaviors and recommends customized solutions to achieve effective reductions in regional ecological footprints.

However, some texts suggest otherwise. Microeconomic examples are given in which a rise in the market rate of interest results in increased biodiversity loss and others in which it does not. It is also posited that the rate of biodiversity loss (as well as the rate of natural resource extraction) tends to rise with the level of aggregate investment and aggregate economic activity. It is demonstrated, using macroeconomic models, that the market rate of interest can increase or decrease with a rise in aggregate investment and also with an increase in the level of aggregate economic activity. Therefore, changes in biodiversity loss (and in the rate of natural resource extraction) are independent of variations in the market rate of interest in macroeconomic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the income from NTFPs and the dependency on these of different socio-economic groups in Northern Benin. Using survey data from 230 households of two villages, we firstly compared incomes of five different ethnic groups being differentiated by their traditional source of livelihood and regional provenance. Secondly, we investigated disparities between three income groups. On average, income from NTFPs accounted for 39% of total household income and had a strong equalizing effect on it. However, the economic relevance of NTFPs differs between households: Poorer households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs in order to fulfill basic needs than wealthier households. However, the latter extract more NTFPs in quantitative terms and have significantly higher cash returns than poorer ones. This is mainly due to a significant greater land holding. Moreover, our study revealed that net income from NTFPs reflects traditional sources of livelihoods of different ethnic groups. In conclusion, both conservation and development strategies should take into consideration the socio-economic context of different beneficiaries of savanna woodland resources in order to apply appropriate measures to poverty reduction.

According to these principles, decision-support tools should offer a holistic perspective and handle high uncertainty. The difficulties in reaching sustainability are due partly to the prevailing use of narrow-system-boundary tools that are non-holistic. Consequently, they fail to capture important ecosystem services and ignore interdependencies between them. To comply with the basic principles, our method allows environmental assets to be evaluated in multiple units and integrates results from recent researches in natural sciences. Both enable coverage of interdependencies between ecosystem services. Thereby, we enlarge input-output modelling from the two conventional ecosystem services of sink and provisioning to the most vital ones: the supporting services. An application to the Seine estuary addresses the impacts of maritime transportation infrastructures on nursery habitats for commercial fish. The ecosystem services covered are life support and resource provisioning. Our results show that the restoration of a total of 73.7 km(2) of nursery areas over the period 2004-2015 would result in a stock of sole in 2015 that exceeds the business as usual scenario by 44.2% (uncertainty range: 35.9%-69.9%). In spite of high restoration costs, the negative macroeconomic impact is very low. However, on the sector level, a trade-off results between nurseries and three economic sectors. The quantification of such trade-offs in our model is particularly useful to public participation in decision-making. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The 'soft' power of persuasion is understood to be exercised through discursive and to a lesser extent ideational means, and is interpreted in terms of compliance related to distributive (conflictual) or integrative (consensual) ends (after Scott (1994)). The focus is on inter-state water conflicts in hegemonic political contexts, where, it is found, the 'first among equals' has a greater ability to exploit 'soft' power and to determine the outcome. 'Soft' power is also seen to influence the choices states make or avoid in their transboundary water interaction, which explains in part how treaties intending to manage conflict may in fact delay or perpetuate it. For example, 'soft' power can be used by the basin hegemon to frame inequitable forms of cooperation in a cooperative light, such that unfair and ultimately unsustainable transboundary arrangements are replicated by the international donor community. Non-hegemonic riparian states also employ their capacity of 'soft' power, though may find themselves with little choice other than to comply with the arrangement established by the basin hegemon. The findings stress the importance of analysts questioning claims of interaction promoted as 'cooperative', and of examining the 'soft' power plays that underlie all transboundary water arrangements. Exemplification is provided through transboundary river basins and aquifers around the globe.","[Zeitoun, Mark] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mirumachi, Naho] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Warner, Jeroen] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Warner, Jeroen] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of East Anglia; University of London; King's College London; Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Zeitoun, M (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.zeitoun@uea.ac.uk; naho.mirumachi@kcl.ac.uk; jeroen.warner@wur.nl,"Mirumachi, Naho/J-8811-2016",,,,,,122,108,118,4,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It can be argued that it is not easy to reduce all dimensions of sustainable supply chain to a single unit. Then, the issue is that all valuations should somehow be reducible to a single one-dimensional standard. Multi-criteria evaluation introduces a framework to remedy this issue. As a consequence, multi-criteria evaluation seems to supply a proper and adequate assessment framework for sustainable supply chain assessment. In this study, a multi-criteria framework based on fuzzy entropy and fuzzy multi-attribute utility (FMAUT) is proposed in order to evaluate and compare the company performances in terms of sustainable supply chain. However, note that reducing all aspects of sustainable supply chain to a single unit using a multi-criteria framework may not be sufficient to satisfy all the needs of decision makers although it is used to evaluate sustainability performance of supply chains with respect to three aspects. Therefore, in this research, an alert management system is also developed to satisfy further requirements of users. The proposed frameworks are tested using data obtained from one of the middle sized Turkish grocery retailers. (C) 2011 Elsevier ay.

We show that fundraising efficiencies are generally quite low for art organizations in the U.S. when private giving is only considered as a fundraising output; however, when the effect of fundraising on ticket sales is considered, fundraising efficiencies improve substantially.

The model relies on technological assumptions consistent with the material balance principle and on an explicit distinction between the material content and the quality of the produced goods. Growth follows from research activities that allow firms to improve the quality of their output and to reduce the material resource intensiveness of their production process. Even though recycling is assumed perfect, we show that 1) the material balance constraint may affect the whole transitory dynamics of the growth process; 2) quantitative growth (i.e. positive growth of material output) can only be a transitory phenomenon, long term economic growth taking exclusively the form of perpetual improvements in the quality of final goods. A long term growth path is characterized by constant values of material variables (or in a less favourable scenario, by a constant negative growth rate of those variables). We establish the existence conditions of a growth path based on quality improvements and constant material variables. It may fail to exist in a decentralized framework even though it is feasible from a purely physical point of view. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is thought that by measuring the performance of each system, information can be gained about the sustainability of the whole system. However it seems there has been no attempt to evaluate if such an assumption is true. During the development of a sustainability assessment framework for south west Victoria, Australia, it has become evident that this approach to sustainability assessment does not provide an accurate assessment of system sustainability. The project found that environmental indicators were considered the most important for assessing regional sustainability. As a consequence, the assessment produced shows that in south west Victoria, sustainability is largely determined by the condition of the environment. This finding highlights the current disconnection between the theory and reality of sustainability. Here, we describe a framework for sustainability assessment that attempts to re-connect theory to practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wallis, Anne M.; Graymore, Michelle L.

We use these data to estimate urban poverty among working families in the British Isles. Applying Bowley's poverty line, we estimate that at least 23 per cent of people in urban working households and 18 per cent of working households had income insufficient to meet minimum needs. This is well above Rowntree's estimate of primary poverty for York in 1899 and high in the range that Bowley found in northern towns in 1912-13. The skill gradient of poverty is steep; for instance, among labourers' households, the poverty rates are close to 50 per cent. Measures of the depth of poverty are relatively low in the data, suggesting that most poor male-headed working households were close to meeting Bowley's new standard.","[Gazeley, Ian; Newell, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Gazeley, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",,,"Gazeley, Ian/0000-0002-4277-1001",ESRC [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,9,11,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The main purpose of the concept is to identify and implement activities to enable production that is both economically more efficient and cleaner. This means that parameters with a high indicative value have to be used. Since both the environmental and the economic performance of industries must be described concurrently, environmental intensity appears to be a good indicator of eco-efficiency. Environmental intensity is environmental impact per unit of economic performance. In this paper, the environmental impact of industry classes is derived from emission data, released by the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER), and then aggregated and assessed using Eco-Indicator 99, a single-score life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. The calculated ratio is thus an accurate description of the environmental-economic state of industry classes. The main advantage of this approach is the underlying consistent statistical framework, that permits, on a disaggregated level, economic data to be correlated with ecological data and to be frequently updated. This single indicator facilitates a comparison of environmental intensity of different industry classes. The paper shows that it is possible to deduce a disaggregated eco-efficiency indicator, which is exemplified using German data, however could be analysed for different European countries.

By using mathematical modeling methods we make forecasts and substantiate some alternative scenarios of changes in the number of the employed in the Russian agriculture for the period ending 2040. A forecast estimation of demand for labor for implementing the inertial and innovation scenarios of development of the agro-food complex implies analyzing the interconnections between volumes of production, labor productivity, number of the employed in the agriculture, number of rural population of the able-bodied age and amounts of investments. As target guideposts for the macroeconomic parameters we used the data presented in the State Program for Development of the Agriculture and Regulation of the Markets for Agricultural Products, Feedstock and Food for the 2008-2012 Period and also the parameters contained in the inertial and innovation options of development set out in the Concept of the Long-term Social-Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the Period Ending 2020. An assessment of the influence the economic policy exerts on employment parameters in the agriculture of Russian Federation is made. Forecast scenarios of the employed in the agriculture and forestry of Russian Federation are made by using the target guideposts for the sector set out in state programs. The need to change the structure of employment for the rural population is explained.

However, this scheme does not provide incentives for users to use network resources efficiently. As the demand for wireless video and other resource-intensive services grows faster than the providers' ability to expand the network capacity, this inefficiency becomes critical. This situation has led numerous researchers and practitioners to explore new pricing schemes. In this spirit, we introduce a pricing scheme called Token Pricing that is both practical and efficient. As in flat-rate pricing, the users face a fixed price. However, users consume tokens when they want a higher quality of service while the network is congested. This mechanism encourages users to congest the network only when they have a high utility for the service.

The most effective protection against winter barley seed pathogens demonstrated chemical treatment Raxil 060FS. The best at protecting organic winter barley seeds was growth stimulator Penergetic-p for roots, its biological efficiency against fusariosis, alternariosis comprised respectively 100 and 48.7 per cent, however, it was inefficient against important for barley pathogen Drechslera spp. Penergetic-p for roots was efficient protecting barley shoots and roots against the agents of root diseases, however, it had no major influence on seed damages by pathogens. Spraying of winter barley seeds with Biokal 2 has essentially reduced the damages of barley shoots and roots by pathogens (28.0 and 26.0%), and seeds were also the least damaged (68.0%) by pathogens. Both shoots and roots against root diseases as well as seeds against contamination by pathogens were best protected with synthetic treatment Raxil 060FS. Biokal 2, Penergetic-p for roots and Biojodis have essentially reduced the spreading of fungal diseases in the coleoptyles of winter barley shoots. The intensity of shoot damages by root diseases in organic winter barley decreased from 0.14 to 0.30 per cent.

In order to answer these questions empirical research has been conducted that has involved employees and managers from three organizations. It has been found that the attitudes of employees and managers towards applicable means of motivation differ significantly. A number of employees are dissatisfied with not only monetary incentives but also with normative incentives. Managers believe that employees are cared for, that efforts have been made to listen to employees' concerns and to ensure suitable working conditions in the organizations studied.

The research of the spread of Heracleum sosnowskyi and Acer negundo was carried out in the regions of Pasvalys and Kaunas. The research focuses on the spread features of these plants, most effective control measures and the level of invasion. The results showed that water had larger influence on the spread of Acer negundo rather than wind as some spontaneous trees were found in all 10 kilometres of onshore area. The longest distance from the parent tree in urban territory revealed to be approximately 100 meters. These plants fruit abundantly; one mature tree of Acer negundo produces approximately 70 thousands of seeds. Heracleum sosnowskyi matures about 7.5 thousands of seeds/1 m(2). The most effective control measure for Acer negundo is destroying spontaneous seedlings since cutting of the grown trees isn't effective, they re-grow from the stumps. Digging is more effective than spraying with herbicides for the control of Heracleum sosnowskyi, because only 45% of the spontaneous seedlings re-grow after digging while even 85% of them re-grow after spraying. Calculated level of invasion shows that Heracleum sosnowskyi has higher pest plant score than Acer negundo.","[Valantinaite, Audrone; Straigyte, Lina; Jurksiene, Girmante] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Forestry & Ecol, Dept Forestry, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,Audrone.Valantinaite@gmail.com; lina.straigyte@asu.lt; jgirmante@gmail.com,"Straigyte, Lina/KBD-3620-2024; Jurkšienė, Girmantė/Z-6060-2019; Jurkšienė, Girmantė/K-4303-2019","Jurkšienė, Girmantė/0000-0001-8210-6711;",,,,,18,2,2,1,6,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,161,166,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500029,0

J,"Marfany, J",,,,"Marfany, Julie",,,Is it still helpful to talk about proto-industrialization? Some suggestions from a Catalan case study,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FLANDERS,"The concept of proto-industrialization is considered by many historians to have outlived its usefulness. This article seeks to argue the contrary, using a case study from Catalonia, in southern Europe, which provides a rare example of early industrialization on the periphery of Europe. Using an in-depth study of an important proto-industrial community, Igualada, the article puts forward two key arguments. First, it shows how the proto-industrialization of the woollen industry and later the cotton industry shaped the transition to the factory. There were important continuities throughout in terms of human capital and organization of production; in particular, the persistence of the family as unit of production. Second, the impact of proto-industrialization on the family economy is shown to have had important consequences for demographic behaviour. As in other areas of Europe, there was a notable impact on age at marriage and on marital fertility. Equally important, however, was the impact on mortality and migration, aspects that have been neglected by historians. In particular, the high infant and child mortality rates for Igualada suggest that historians need to rethink the effect of proto-industrialization upon life chances.","Homerton Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Marfany, J (通讯作者)，Homerton Coll, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,99,14,19,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Evidence from colonies in the Americas suggests that skewed initial factor endowments could create small elites that own a disproportionate share of wealth, human capital and political power. The Cape Colony, founded in 1652 at the southern tip of Africa, presents a case where a mercantilist company (the Dutch East India Company) settled on the land and established a unique set of institutions, within which inequality evolved. This paper provides a long-run quantitative analysis of trends in asset-based inequality (using principal components analysis on tax inventories) during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, allowing, for the first time, a dynamic rather than static analysis of inequality trends in a newly settled and pre-industrial society over this period. While theory testing in other societies has been severely limited because of a scarcity of quantitative evidence, this study presents a history with evidence, enabling an evaluation of the Engerman-Sokoloff and other hypotheses.","[Fourie, Johan; von Fintel, Dieter] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Fourie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",johanf@sun.ac.za,,"von Fintel, Dieter/0000-0001-6771-1315; Fourie, Johan/0000-0002-7341-017X",,,,,44,35,35,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,OCT,2010,4.0,3,,,,,229,267,,10.1007/s11698-009-0044-1,0.0,,,39,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,642SS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281238300001,0

Following Pyo and Ha, Hitotsubashi J Econ 48(1): 67-81, (2007), we have adopted a gross output model rather than a value added model of relative TFP analysis. We have found that the cyclical variation of productivity growth plays a dominant role in the decomposition effects before and after the 1997 financial crisis in Korea. Productivity growth is modest before the crisis and strong after the crisis owing to the recovering market efficiency. There is the likelihood that the productivity growth of stayers during the post-crisis period was significantly higher than new entrants. The net entry effect is found to be more sensitive in small business and export-based firms than in large business and domestic market-based firms. Our findings suggest that Korean firms have recovered a modest level of technical change after its severe financial crisis owing to the improvement of management transparency and the build-up of market efficiency during the IMF-mandated restructuring process. But since the entry effect is estimated to be still negative in Manufacturing and the exit effect is negative in Service sector after the crisis, the Korean economy has not fully recovered its metabolism in the post-crisis period and still lacks a creative destructive process to resume another round of sustainable growth path.","[Pyo, Hak K.] Seoul Natl Univ, Econ Div, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Rhee, Keun Hee] Korea Prod Ctr, Seoul 110751, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Pyo, HK (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Econ Div, San 56-1, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",ghlee@kpc.or.kr; pyohk@plaza.snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,66,8,8,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The environmental economics approach to PES tries to force ecosystem services into the market model, with an emphasis on efficiency. The ecological economics approach, in contrast, seeks to adapt economic institutions to the physical characteristics of ecosystem services prioritizing ecological sustainability and just distribution and requiring a transdisciplinary approach. This paper summarizes the results of a participatory atelier workshop held in Costa Rica. We developed a set of principles (the Heredia Declaration) for PES systems and report on evolving initiatives in several countries. We discuss how the distinction between ecosystem goods (which are stock-flow resources) and ecosystem services (which are fund-service resources) and the physical characteristics of the fund-services affect the appropriate institutional form for PES. We conclude that PES systems represent an important way to effectively manage fund-service resources as public goods, and that this represents a significant departure from conventional market institutions.

This article describes a method to calculate complete physical trade flows for all countries which report their trade to the UN. The method is based on the UN Comtrade database and it was used to calculate world-wide physical trade flows for all reporting countries in nine selected years between 1962 and 2005. The results show increasing global trade with global direct material trade flows reaching about 10 billion tonnes in 2005, corresponding to a physical trade volume of about 20 billion tonnes (adding both total imports and total exports). The share from European countries is declining, mainly in favour of Asian countries. The dominant traded commodity in physical units was fossil fuels, mainly oil. Physical trade balances were used to identify the dominant resource suppliers and demanders. Australia was the principal resource supplier over the period with a diverse material export structure. It was followed by mainly oil-exporting countries with varying volumes. As regards to regions, Latin America, south-east Asian islands and central Asia were big resource exporters, mostly with increasing absolute amounts of net exports. The largest net importers were japan. the United States and single European countries. Emerging countries like the 'Asian Tigers' with major industrial productive sectors are growing net importers, some of them to an even higher degree than European countries. Altogether, with the major exception of Australia and Canada, industrialized countries are net importers and developing countries and transition countries are net exporters, but there are important differences within these groups.

In this vein, the strategic groups perspective has emerged as a powerful means to understand such competitive phenomena. Empirical approaches to model competitive dynamics within the strategic groups framework, however, have been piece meal as researchers typically resort to distinct sequential analysis by time period. To overcome the limitations of these simplistic approaches, we develop a hidden Markov model to study strategic group (competitive) dynamics. In this approach, we explicitly account for competitive dynamics over time by modeling strategic group memberships as latent states that follow a first-order Markov process. Thus, we explictly model the notion that firms adopt their strategy for the next time period based on their current strategy and respective outcomes. We illustrate the model with longitudinal data from COMPUSTAT on 63 public banks from the tri-state region of NY-OH-PA. The results show the proposed model to be superior to a number of viable alternative approaches that have been suggested in the literature. We find the existence of three strategic groups: the leveraged group has low current assets compared to current liabilities, high debt to equity, and high total borrowing to assets. The lending group consists of the largest banks that focus on lending with high ratios of gross loans to securities and gross loans to deposits. The balanced group has the largest number of banks where the values of the financial and product ratios are intermediate compared to the leveraged and lending groups. The asymmetries in the switching probabilites are also evident as there seems to be a higher probability of switching into the balanced group than switching out of this group. The switching probabilites are symmetric between the the leveraged and lending groups.","[Ebbes, Peter; Grewal, Rajdeep; DeSarbo, Wayne S.] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"DeSarbo, WS (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, 433 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",pebbes@psu.edu; wsd6@psu.edu,,"Ebbes, Peter/0000-0002-6561-5319",,,,,96,15,17,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Procyclicality resulted principally from demand shocks interacting with capital services which are relatively invariant over the cycle.

However, the tremendous changes in the sector-sometimes back and sometimes forwards-as well as evolving institutions make it difficult to gauge from casual observation if the sector is healthy or not. Research spending has waxed and waned. Policies to encourage the import of foreign technologies have been applied unevenly. Structural adjustment policies also triggered wrenching changes in the sector. Horticulture and livestock production has boomed; while the output of other crops, such as rice, wheat and soybeans, has stagnated or fallen. At a time when China's millions of producers are faced with complex decisions, the extension system is crumbling and farmer professional associations remain in their infancy. In short, there are just as many reasons to be optimistic about the productivity trends in agriculture as to be pessimistic. In this paper, we pursue one overall goal: to better understand the productivity trends in China's agricultural sector during the reform era-with an emphasis on the 1990-2004 period. To do so, we pursue three specific objectives. First, relying on the National Cost of Production Data Set-China's most complete set of farm input and output data-we chart the input and output trends for 23 of China's main farm commodities. Second, using a stochastic production frontier function approach we estimate the rate of change in TFP for each commodity. Finally, we decompose the changes in TFP into two components: changes in efficiency and changes in technical change. Our findings-especially after the early 1990s are remarkably consistent. China's agricultural TFP has grown at a healthy rate for all 23 commodities. TFP growth for the staple commodities generally rose around 2% annually; TFP growth for most horticulture and livestock commodities was even higher (between 3 and 5%). Equally consistent, we find that most of the change is accounted for by technical change. The analysis is consistent with the conclusion that new technologies have pushed out the production functions, since technical change accounts for most of the rise in TFP. In the case of many of the commodities, however, the efficiency of producers-that is, the average distance of producers from the production frontier-has fallen. In other words, China's TFP growth would have been even higher had the efficiency of production not eroded the gains of technical change. Although we do not pinpoint the source of rising inefficiency, the results are consistent with a story that there is considerable disequilibrium in the farm economy during this period of rapid structural change and farmers are getting little help in making these adjustments from the extension system.","[Jin, Songqing] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Ma, Hengyun] Henan Agr Univ, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun; Hu, Ruifa] Chinese Acad Sci, CCAP, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Michigan State University; Henan Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Stanford University,"Jin, SQ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, 213E Agr Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jins@msu.edu,"Ma, Hengyun/P-8034-2019; Jin, Songqing/W-4340-2019","Ma, Hengyun/0000-0003-4405-3078; Jin, Songqing/0000-0001-8514-7930",,,,,52,96,103,5,107,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

This paper examines the potential implications of this change by estimating the effects of a retiree health insurance (RHI) offer on a comprehensive set of labor, health and health care use outcomes in the near-elderly population. An RHI offer increases the probability of early retirement by 37% for both men and women. While the results suggest that an RHI offer has little, if any, effect on health, there is strong evidence that RHI provides significant protection from high out-of-pocket medical costs. In the top 40% of the out-of-pocket spending distribution, those with an offer of retiree coverage spend 22% less on average. Estimates of the value of RHI of over $4,000 per year suggest that increasing opportunities for the near-elderly to purchase coverage at actuarially-fair prices through the individual market or public programs could significantly increase insurance coverage and reduce financial risk for this age group.","McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",McGill University,"Strumpf, E (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, 855 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",erin.strumpf@mcgill.ca,,,NIA NIH HHS [T32-AG00186] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,54,18,26,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

In this paper, we argue that the service-providing unit (SPU) concept may help achieve this objective by promoting the systematic quantification of the key components of nature that provide services (e.g., population density of a key pollinator) and linking these with measurable outcomes for human well-being. We discuss and provide examples of the potential role of the SPU concept in improving economic valuation of ecosystem services. Further, we suggest the concept may contribute to addressing the endpoint problem, which can be defined simply as the inability of researchers to communicate the implications of environmental change in a way that is understood by a broad cross-section of society. The endpoint problem is of particular relevance to stated preference approaches, and we discuss the capacity of the SPU concept to refine these approaches. We argue that the concept enhances interdisciplinary collaboration, promoting more validated, well-informed valuation applications. It also has the potential to minimize 'warm glow effects' and put the notion of marginal changes in the provision of ecosystem services in a new light. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Since its creation, in 1923, Colombia's central bank has undergone several reforms that have changed its objectives and degree of independence. Between 1923 and 1951, it was private and independent, with a legal commitment to price stability. In 1962, monetary responsibilities were divided between a government-dominated monetary board, in charge of monetary policies, and the central bank, which carried them out. In the early 1990s, the bank recovered its independence and its focus on price stability. Inflation varied substantially during these subperiods. Our analysis suggests that the central bank independence, combined with a commitment to price stability, renders the best results in terms of price stability.","[Meisel, Adolfo] Banco Republ, Ctr Estudios Econ Reg, Cartagena De Indias, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Meisel, A (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Ctr Estudios Econ Reg, Calle 33,3-123 Ctr, Cartagena De Indias, Colombia.",ameisero@banrep.gov.co; jbaronri@banrep.gov.co,,,,,,,46,2,3,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

The second plan proposes solely the development of a green park with light recreational facilities. In order to examine the situation from a social point of view, the effect of the proposed plans to the property prices in the surrounding area is examined by means of the Fuzzy Delphi Method. The results indicate that although both plans will positively affect the price of dwellings in a similar influence zone, the second plan will create a premium almost 60% higher, compared to the first one. Although a clear answer can only be obtained through further research, the findings could be used in order to justify the evaluation of the proposed land-use alternatives.","[Damigos, D.; Laliotis, E.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, GR-10682 Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,,,"Damigos, Dimitris/AAH-1963-2019; Damigos, Dimitris/A-1806-2016","Damigos, Dimitris/0000-0003-0142-7156; Damigos, Dimitris/0000-0003-0142-7156",,,,,29,0,0,1,14,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

More specifically, it conducts a quantitative analysis of marketing concentration and geographical dispersion within different travel time zones. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative database was constructed on the marketing channels and travel time zones used by 61 organic farmers to sell their produce and purchase necessary inputs. Indices of marketing concentration and geographical dispersion (outputs and inputs) were then calculated for each farm and region. Findings - Results indicate a high level of marketing concentration, dominated by marketing cooperatives, direct marketing and abattoir/processors. Similar levels of concentration are recorded for the indices of geographical dispersion (especially outputs). Results vary significantly between the three regions, but it is clear that organic farmers in each region make use of different combinations of marketing channels, both local and national, in increasingly hybridised and individualised supply chains. Research limitations/implications - Many organic farmers are developing hybridised supply chains, including both local and more conventional marketing channels, and further research is needed into the identified regional differences and the reasons for developing what are often very individualised marketing chains. Originality/value - This is the first attempt to calculate indices of marketing concentration and geographical dispersion for organic farms in different regions of England and Wales. The paper also contributes to debates on the potential impact of organic farming on rural development and the local economy.","[Ilbery, Brian; Courtney, Paul; Kirwan, James; Maye, Damian] Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Cheltenham, Glos, England",University of Gloucestershire,"Ilbery, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Cheltenham, Glos, England.",bilbery@glos.ac.uk,"Maye, Damian/AAS-7693-2020; /AAC-2349-2022","Maye, Damian/0000-0002-4459-6630; Kirwan, James/0000-0002-4626-9940",,,,,36,15,16,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, in the case of money ethics, there is no significant relationship with all the three dimensions of socially responsible consumption.","[Lau, Teck-Chai] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR),,lautc@utar.edu.my,"Lau, Teck Chai/C-9339-2011; Lau, Teck Chai/JAC-5643-2023","Lau, Teck Chai/0000-0002-5282-4373",,,,,23,0,0,0,7,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-026-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,126,130,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BSB91,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284085200026,0

Design/methodology/approach - Samples were collected and plated in duplicate for aerobic plate, total Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms and Escherichia coli counts using standard methods. Typical E. coli colonies on Rapid E coli 2 Agar (TM) were selected and further identified using 16S rDNA molecular sequencing methods. Findings - Bacterial counts associated with biltong product ranged between 6-7 Log CFU/g, while counts on cutting utensils ranged between 5-6 Log CFU/cm(2). Overall, the lowest counts were associated with display cabinets (2-6 Log CFU/cm(2)). Predominant populations were often similar between biltong product and various surface samples, indicating potential cross-contamination. Results from 165 rDNA sequence analysis showed that E. coli strains isolated from biltong product and correspondingly from cutting utensils, were 100 per cent genetically similar. Strains of potential pathogens belonging to the Shigella dysenteriae group (99 per cent) were also identified. Originality/value - This paper highlights that surfaces in direct contact with biltong, an increasingly popular dried meat commodity worldwide, may act as potential sources for cross-contamination of product with potential food-borne pathogens, which may hold foodborne illness implications.","[Naidoo, Keshia; Lindsay, Denise] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Naidoo, K (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.",naidookeshia@gmail.com,,"Lindsay, Denise/0000-0002-4193-0867",University of Witwatersrand; Friedel Sellschop Award; Carnegie Corporation Transformation Programme; National Research Foundation,University of Witwatersrand; Friedel Sellschop Award; Carnegie Corporation Transformation Programme; National Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the University of Witwatersrand and the Friedel Sellschop Award, and Carnegie Corporation Transformation Programme for project funding, as well as the National Research Foundation for student funding.",,38,6,7,2,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper aims to examine the effects of different cooking methods (baking, boiling, deep-frying, pan-frying, microwaving and grilling) on total carotenoids and lycopene content in muscle and skin fractions of Omani kingfish. Design/methodology/approach - Fresh, commercially harvested kingfish samples were purchased from a supermarket and prepared using six commonly used cooking methods. Raw fish samples were used as control. Muscle and skin fish portions for each cooking method and raw samples were analyzed for total carotenoids and lycopene contents. Findings - The paper finds that cooking methods affected kingfish skin and muscle differently. The positive effects of cooking methods on kingfish muscle scored from high to low are as follows for total carotenoids content: grilling, microwaving, pan-frying, boiling, deep-frying and baking; and grilling, microwaving, boiling, deep-frying, baking and pan-frying for lycopene content. Baking resulted in the highest increase in both total carotenoids and lycopene contents in the skin, followed by grilling and pan-frying for total carotenoids. In conclusion, grilling, followed by microwaving, is finds to be the best cooking method for high-carotenoids content and healthy eating of kingfish. Originality/value - This is the first paper to be reported on the effects of different cooking methods on total carotenoids content (including lycopene) in skin and muscle of kingfish caught in the warm waters of the Gulf of Oman.","[Opara, Umezuruike Linus] Univ Stellenbosch, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Al-Ani, Majeed R.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Muscat, Oman",Stellenbosch University; Sultan Qaboos University,"Opara, UL (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",opara@sun.ac.za,"Opara, Umezuruike Linus/AAC-5805-2019; Opara, Umezuruike Linus/J-3978-2013","Opara, Umezuruike Linus/0000-0001-8056-7215",Majesty's Strategic Research Trust Fund [SR/AGR/BIOR/05/01],Majesty's Strategic Research Trust Fund,This paper was carried out under his Majesty's Strategic Research Trust Fund as part of project (SR/AGR/BIOR/05/01) awarded to Professor Umezuruike Linus Opara at Sultan Qaboos University.

Skewed endowments meant huge gains from trade during the First Globalization boom; but, conversely, disintegration of world commerce in the Depression was a heavier blow for such a naturally specialized economy. The extreme protectionism, characteristic of the post-war period, was related to the country's peculiar economic structure: comparative advantages in food production and disadvantages in (labor-intensive) manufacturing implied that closing the economy was a political winner, though it eventually hampered growth. The road to openness followed in the last quarter of the 2011, century would have meant, correspondingly, an increase in inequality.

The stress on biodiversity is far beyond the levels imposed by the natural global climatic changes occurring in the recent evolutionary past. It includes temperature increases, shifts of climate zones. melting of snow and ice, sea level rise, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. Natural systems are vulnerable to such changes due to their limited adaptive capacity. Based on an analysis using the DPSIR framework, this paper discusses some of the important socio-economic driving forces of climate change, with a focus on energy use and transportation. The paper also analyses observed and potential changes of climate and the pressures they exert on biodiversity, the changes in biodiversity, the resulting impacts on ecosystem functions, and possible policy responses. The latter can be divided into mitigation and adaptation measures. Both strategies are needed, mitigation in order to stabilise the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and adaptation in order to adjust to changes that have already occurred or cannot be avoided. One mitigation option, increased biofuel production, which is also a response to oil depletion. would change land use patterns and increase human appropriation of net primary production of biomass, thereby threatening biodiversity.

We argue that whether an output is desired or undesired, is not given per se, but depends on the economic circumstances which change over time. As a result, by-products of one industry, first perceived as non-marketable wastes, may become desired inputs into other production processes. By adopting an evolutionary perspective on economic dynamics, in particular by exploiting the concept of niche exclusion, we identify favorable circumstances for undesired outputs to become marketable. To cope with the pace and unpredictability of economic evolution, we argue for a flexible policy system which favors outcome-over process-oriented waste management policies and balances the responsibility between consumers and producers on the one side, and the society as a whole on the other side.

This is the case in the French Guiana shrimp fishery for which profitability objectives imply a reduction in the fishing activity. On the one hand, this fishery has negative externalities on marine biodiversity due to discards. On the other hand, this fishery has positive externalities on the economy of the local community and interestingly enough on a protected seabird species in the area (the Frigatebird that feeds on discards). In this paper, we examine the viability of that system considering two sustainability objectives: an economic objective in terms of the profitability of the fishing activity, and a conservation objective in terms of the Frigatebird population. For that purpose, we have developed a dynamic model of that bioeconomic system and study here the trade-offs between the two conflicting objectives. It provides a means to quantify the necessary give and takes involving the economic and ecological objectives that would ensure a viable management solution. Our study confirms the relevance of the viability approach to address natural resource management issues, which should lead to the development of new tools for the arbitration of conflicting sustainability, objectives. In particular, such tools could be used as a quantitative basis for cost-benefit analysis taking into account environmental externalities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Besides prices, income and household size, we consider the effects of population age, the share of wells, housing patterns, precipitation and temperature. We also explore why current per capita residential water consumption in the new federal states is about 30% lower than in the old federal states. Since average cost pricing may cause an endogeneity problem, we apply instrumental-variable procedures in addition to single equation ordinary least squares, but find no evidence that prices are endogenous. Our estimation results suggest that the price elasticity of water demand in Germany is around -0.24. The income elasticity is positive, decreases with higher income levels and is at least three times higher in the new federal states than in the old federal states. Current differences in prices and income levels explain about one third of the gap in residential water use between the two regions. Household size and the share of wells have a negative impact on per capita water demand, and water use increases with age. Finally, the findings provide some evidence that rainfall patterns rather than total rainfall affect water consumption, while temperature appears to have no impact at an. All outcomes are robust to a log-log and two types of semi-log specifications for the water demand function. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Models were developed to estimate C flux associated with live trees, forest floor litter, soils, wood products, harvest, fossil fuel. used in manufacturing and C displacement from biofuels and products for representative British plantation species: Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). Map databases of publicly and privately owned woodlands were compiled for Great Britain. Carbon flux was determined for individual woodland sites, and monetised using candidate parameters for the social discount rate (1, 3, 3.5 or 5%) and social value of carbon (US$109.5, $1, $10 or $17.10/t). A conventional discount function was applied. Final results are expressed as Net Present Values, for the base year 2001, with discounting commencing in 2002. The minimum suggested NPV (discount rate = 3% and social value of carbon = $1) of GB woodlands already existing in 2001 is $82 million, with a further $72 million that might be added by future afforestation. These figures rise dramatically if a discount rate of 1% and social value of sequestered carbon = $109.5/t are assumed.

There is some evidence that design dimensions, including the number of alternatives available in each choice set, can influence model outcomes. A key issue is whether referendum formats with binary options are preferable to choice sets with multiple alternatives. A choice modelling experiment was performed where questionnaires delivered to two split samples differed only according to whether two or three alternatives were offered to respondents in each choice set. The results indicate that more robust models could be constructed from the three-alternative split compared to the two-alternative split. One reason for the difference is that respondents tended to display serial non-participation in the two-alternative format, choosing an alternative consistently without regard for changes in the attributes, For practitioners of the CM technique, the results suggest that it may be preferable to offer more than two alternatives in a choice set that includes a status quo option.

People are extremely poor, with 97% having incomes of less than 1 USD/day. Forest income constitutes around 15% of total income; only non-farm income (47%) and agriculture (28%) rank higher. The poorest segment depends more on forest income than the least poor group, but the medium income group exhibits the highest dependence. Fuelwood constitutes the major source of such income followed by fodder. The incomes mainly support current consumption. People with better access to the forest reserve have higher total income, forest income, and relative forest income. As revealed through a Gini-coefficient analysis, forest resources have an important income equalizing effect across rural households. A particular group of resource poor farmers (8.1% of sample), with little access to agricultural land and a high representation of female heads, derives an average of 65% of their income from the forest. An important policy lesson is that restricting people's access to forest resources can have substantial effects on household livelihoods and welfare, and would serve to increase income inequalities in the area. Livelihood researchers should now recognize the substantial income from forest resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Since the 1990s it has experienced rapid growth, and supermarket chains have become the sales channel with the largest market share and are the main driver for further growth. However, different supermarket retail groups have very different strategies concerning the marketing of organic products. The purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the different strategies of retailers who are active in the organic product market and to explain the drivers which may underlie them. Design/methodology/approach - The strategies of the three most important Belgian retailers that market organic products, and in particular organic beef, are analyzed. Data were collected through interviews with the retailers' staff and through observations in retail outlets. Also, GfK-household panel data which recorded all purchases of 3,000 Belgian households and a postal survey with 529 respondents were used as data sources. Findings - The different strategies used by retailers to market organic foods are associated with the overall characteristics and marketing strategies of the retail groups. Some retail groups have clear first mover advantages from engaging in the organic product line, while for others an adaptive strategy is more appropriate. Research limitations/implications - The insights from this paper will help the understanding and facilitate the development of future strategies for organic and other high-value or premium products, which will be of interest to researchers and stakeholders who are active in these markets. Practical implications - The retail sector is not a single homogeneous block, but instead consists of retailers who pursue quite different strategies. This concept may have major implications for the future development of high-value markets. Originality/value - Existing relevant theories were applied to the adoption of the organic product line, a segment in the portfolio of retailers,that is becoming more important. The empirical material collected sheds new light on the drivers behind retail strategies.","[Aertsens, Joris; Mondelaers, Koen; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Van Huylenbroeck, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Guido.vanhuylenbroeck@ugent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017",,,,,,49,38,40,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

New hybrids developed for the fresh fruit market have been introduced in Hawaii, Australia, Malaysia and Taiwan. These low acid types have become the preferred types and have expanded rapidly to supply the fresh fruit markets of the USA, Japan and Europe. The newer cultivars present new challenges in production and maintenance of quality. In Hawaii, natural flowering which can significantly increase harvest costs and production losses, translucency and too low acid levels are quality issues all tied to production practices. Postharvest chilling injury appears to be less of a problem, though shell scuffing is an issue with some clones. Translucency is correlated with susceptibility to mechanical injury and non-pathogenic fungal growth on the broken peduncle and both are of concern with marketers and consumers. Our fruit quality research focus has been on translucency and inconsistent fruit quality throughout the year due to variation in the sugar to acid balance, the major fruit flavor component. In the warm season there are fruits with too low acids and high sugars, and a more desirable balance of acids and sugars occurs in the cool season. Flesh translucency is possible due to photosynthetate competition between the crown and the fruit during the initial period of crown growth. Alternatively, insufficient calcium uptake during the fruit growth makes the fruit flesh more leaky. The low acid hybrids during fruit growth accumulate high levels of titratable acidity. This acidity peaks at a higher level than the canning variety and declines rapidly as the fruit approaches maturity. The decline in acidity is associated with two acid metabolism enzymes. Sugars are rapidly accumulated about six weeks before harvest just before the acid levels decline. The sugar accumulation appears to be via an apoplastic pathway utilizing neutral and cell-wall invertases. For this non-climacteric fruit, eating quality is determined before harvest. Cultivar and field management, such as fertilization and irrigation practices, developed for canning may not be the most appropriate for the production of low acid hybrids used for fresh fruit.","[Chen, N.

Design/methodology/approach - The study sought, through video observation and self-report surveys, to determine if differences exist between consumers' intent and actual behavior. Findings - A survey study of consumer reactions to safe food-handling labels on raw meat and poultry products suggested that instructions for safe handling found on labels had only limited influence on consumer practices. The labels studied by these researchers were found on the packaging of chicken products examined in the current study alongside step-by-step cooking instructions.

Recent studies have shown a critical absence of a strong and dependable cold chain in developing economies. The purpose of this paper is to set out to identify and inter-relate the inhibitors that significantly influence the efficiency of a cold chain in developing economies like India. Design/methodology/approach - The synthesis and prioritization of inhibitors are done on the basis of an extensive literature review as well as consultation with academicians and industrial professionals. Using semi-structured interviews and Fuzzy Interpretive Structure Modeling (FISM) approach, the research presents a hierarchy-based model. Findings - The end result is a model that establishes the relationships among the identified inhibitors with their respective dominance. The research shows that there exists a group of inhibitors having a high driving power and low dependence with strategic importance and requiring maximum attention and another group includes inhibitors that have high dependence and the consequential actions. Research limitations/implications - At the time when cold chain is the key domain for the food sector, these findings will be immensely helpful for industry professionals, Government, non-government, academia and the community in developing strategies and impounding the root causes responsible for the inefficient and weak cold chain in India. The Indian situation echoes to the situation in most of the developing economies and similar solutions can apply there also. These findings will be truly useful for organizations that are planning to operate food chains in developing nations. Orignality/value - Presentation of inhibitors in hierarchy and their classification into driver and dependent categories with their respective dominance on the system is a unique effort in the area of cold chain management. This would help decision makers to better utilize the limited resources.","[Joshi, Rohit; Banwet, Devinder Kumar; Shankar, Ravi] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Joshi, R (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India.",rohitgjoshi@rediffmail.com,"Shankar, Ravi/HSF-1169-2023","SHANKAR, RAVI/0000-0001-8724-593X",,,,,58,85,90,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The differences between K sources on AC content occurred during the storage period and the lowest values were observed for K2SO4.

The use of K2SO4 resulted in better fruit ratio, mainly at higher K rates. The effect of different K rates on fruit translucence was not significant and the small difference observed between K sources was only observed right after harvest. Despite the long storage time, there were no symptoms of fruit internal browning. Fruit firmness decreased along the storage period. This effect was less intensive without K application, but it was observed for all sources, especially for KCl.","[Quaggio, J. A.; Teixeira, L. A. J.; Cantarella, H.; Mellis, E. V.; Sigrist, J.

However, the promotion of a new industry in rural areas is typically hindered by the scarcity of human capital, lack of information, infrastructures, and competing interests. In this context, public support is unavoidable to assist promotion of this innovative sector. The various policy options reveal some strengths and drawbacks, posing the problem of finding the best trade-off to public decision makers. In this paper we aim at developing a methodology to support policy decision making within the biorefinery framework, with the purpose of determining a way to identify the most suitable policy option given the actual uncertainty in developing the bio-refinery industry in rural areas. The empirical experiment, based on a simulation of the enforcement of four identified policy instruments, highlights that, although subsidies and incentives to profitability of dedicated crops appear to have the greatest effects on the development of bio-refinery, the best performances are exhibited by technological innovation and information options.

Using primary and secondary sources, I find that geography imposed difficult transport challenges on Peruvians during this period. There were no navigable rivers in coastal and highland regions, railroads were scarce and most roads were inadequate for wagons, sometimes even for horses and mules. As a result, transport costs were extremely high, which constituted a barrier to trade, reduced gains from specialisation and retarded economic growth. Therefore, high transport costs seem to be one important factor in explaining the low income levels of Peru in the early 20th century in spite of the country's large endowments of natural resources.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Sch Business, Ctr Catolica, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Zegarra, LF (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Sch Business, Ctr Catolica, Lima, Peru.",lfzegarrab@pucp.edu.pe,,"Zegarra, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-9956-8055",,,,,59,5,6,4,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Moreover, the costs associated with investments in reduced vulnerability to climatic events are likely to exhibit economies of scope. We explore the implications of these characteristics on farmer's decisions to adapt to climate change using a framed field experiment applied to coffee farmers in Costa Rica. As expected, we find high levels of risk aversion, but even using that as a baseline, we further find that farmers behave even more cautiously when the setting is characterized by unknown or ambiguous risk (i.e. poor or non-reliable risk information). Secondly, we find that farmers, to a large extent, coordinated their decisions to secure a lower adaptation cost, and that communication among farmers strongly facilitated coordination.

A model is proposed in which norms of private contributions to a public good can be influenced by public policy, and these norms affect people's self-image, which derives from a comparison of one's own contribution with the norm contribution. In this context, we examine the conditions under which private contributions to a public good are efficient, and the conditions under which policy affecting these norms improves social welfare. We find that (1) a benevolent social planner who fails to account for private provision norms will underprovide the public good, and (2) public policy that attempts to raise the norm contribution of private provision can increase social welfare lithe effect of raising the norm does not have an extreme negative effect - either extremely small or extremely large - on peoples' self-image.

The size of the loading fees and how they vary by employer group size have important implications for health policy given the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Despite their policy relevance, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence on the magnitude and the determinants of health insurance loading fees. This paper provides estimates of the loading fees by firm size using data from the confidential Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component-Insurance Component Linked File. Overall, we find an inverse relationship between employer group size and loading fees. Firms of up to 100 employees face similar loading fees of approximately 34%. Loads decline with firm size and are estimated to be on average 15% for firms with more than 100 employees, but less than 10,000 employees, and 4% for firms with more than 10,000 workers.","[Karaca-Mandic, Pinar; Abraham, Jean M.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Rochester,"Karaca-Mandic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",pkmandic@umn.edu; abrah042@umn.edu; chuckphelps2@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,17,20,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We used Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) and Threat Reduction Assessment (TRA) to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of individual Species Action Plans (SAPs) with regard to improving conservation status and reducing threats within the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Spending was highly biassed towards vertebrates, in particular mammals and birds. Of 38 fully-costed SAPs, the top five most expensive SAPs accounted for almost 80% of the total money spent. Just over half of the SAPs studied had improved the conservation status of the species concerned, and one third of SAPs achieved at least a 50% reduction in threats. SAP cost was significantly positively related to improvement in conservation status but unrelated to threat reduction for that species. Effectiveness and efficiency were significantly correlated with one another in terms of threat reduction for different species, but there was no correlation between effectiveness and efficiency in terms of improving conservation status. Although conservation decisions should not be made solely on the outcome of such analyses. CUA and IRA can provide an important contribution to the evidence base to inform the development of more effective and efficient conservation strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Sustainability as a normative concept captures basic ideas of intergenerational justice when human well-being depends on natural capital and services. Thus, resilience and sustainability are independent concepts. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between resilience and sustainability of ecological-economic systems. We use a simple dynamic model where two natural capital stocks provide ecosystem services that are complements for human well-being, to illustrate different possible cases of the relationship between resilience and sustainability, and to identify the conditions under which each of those will hold: a) resilience of the system is necessary, but not sufficient, for sustainability; b) resilience of the system is sufficient, but not necessary, for sustainability; c) resilience of the system is neither necessary nor sufficient for sustainability; and d) resilience is both necessary and sufficient for sustainability. We conclude that more criteria than just resilience have to be taken into account when designing policies for the sustainable development of ecological-economic systems, and, vice versa, the property of resilience should not be confused with the positive normative connotations of sustainability.

This article reports from a model based study of market related carbon leakage and poverty reduction in the wake of a CDM tree-planting project in Tanzania. A tree plantation was incorporated in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with income differentiated household segments. The study focused on sensitivity of carbon leakage and income distribution to different project ownerships and carbon premium allocations. It turned out that the project value in terms of carbon premium has clear shortcomings as indicator of induced GDP growth and poverty alleviation. The non-poor rural and urban households benefit considerably more than the poor households. However, rising household income in all domestic project ownership arrangements increases demand for food, raises use of fertilizer and crop yields. A carbon cycle module for agricultural land use was incorporated in the CGE model, showing an increased carbon sequestration in agricultural soil, representing a negative leakage through markets in the range of 60-120% of the certified emissions reductions as registered in the CDM tree plantation project.

The analysis uses a unique database spanning 31 consumer package goods (CPG) categories, 39 months, and the 50 largest US metropolitan markets. We organize our description of market structure around the notion that firms can improve brand perceptions through advertising investments, as in Sutton's endogenous sunk cost theory. The richness of our data allow us to go beyond Sutton's bounds test and to study the underlying forces bounding concentration away from zero. Observed advertising levels escalate in larger US markets. At the same time, the number of advertised brands in an industry appears to be invariant to market size. Therefore, the size-distribution of brands across markets is characterized by bigger (i.e. more heavily advertised) as opposed to more brands in larger markets. Correspondingly, observed concentration levels in advertising-intensive industries are bounded away from zero irrespective of market size.","[Dhar, Sanjay K.; Dube, Jean-Pierre H.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bronnenberg, Bart J.] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Chicago; Tilburg University,"Dubé, JPH (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jdube@chicagobooth.edu,"Bronnenberg, Bart/D-7971-2011; Bronnenberg, Bart/AAS-2684-2021","Bronnenberg, Bart J./0000-0003-2947-5192",,,,,33,8,10,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We find that single-purpose governments per square mile have a positive impact on metropolitan population and employment growth, but no significant impact on nonmetropolitan counties. In contrast, the fragmentation of general-purpose governments per capita has a negative impact on employment and population growth in nonmetropolitan counties.

Existing accounts exaggerate the significance of the gold standard as a good housekeeping seal of approval and underestimate the role of direct financial controls. Furthermore, they underestimate the linkage in zones of inter-imperial rivalry, such as the Balkans, between foreign borrowing and strategic alignment. We show how Bulgaria found its politics destabilized prior to 1914 by the demands of its creditors. After defeat in the First World War, Bulgaria was forced to submit to an even tighter system of creditor control. Though it obtained substantial debt relief during the 1930s, these concessions were gained not through an assertion of national sovereignty and default, but at the price of even closer supervision. This in turn casts new light on the conventional view of Bulgaria as a victim of Nazi 'informal imperialism'. In light of Bulgaria's previous experience, the more striking feature of its trade relations with Hitler's Germany is that they were conducted on a basis of sovereign equality.","[Tooze, Adam] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Bulgarian Acad Sci, BG-1040 Sofia, Bulgaria",Yale University; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Tooze, A (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"Ivanov, Martin I/AAZ-6304-2021","Ivanov, Martin I/0000-0002-3912-4014",,,,,59,27,32,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The sustainability of a country is based on a multitude of basic indicators. In all 75 indicators for 128 countries are used. This work extends SAFE as follows: (a) The model is amended by an imputation procedure to fill in missing data, (b) the rule bases of SAFE are compiled algebraically, and (c) sustainability thresholds are defined so as to reflect expert opinion and international agreements and norms. Countries are ranked according to their sustainability index. Switzerland and Sweden take the first two places and Mauritania and Sudan the two last ones.

Design/methodology/approach - Calibration and validation sets were designed for the conception and evaluation of the method adequacy in the range of moisture content 70 to 95 per cent (wb). The prediction models based on partial least squares (PLS) regression, were developed in the near-infrared region (4,000-2,500c-m(-1)). Conventional criteria such as the R-2 the root mean square errors of cross validation (RMSECV), root mean square errors of estimation (RMSEE) as well as the number of PLS factors were considered for the selection of three pre-processing (vector normalization, minimum-maximum normalization and multiplicative scatter correction) methods. Findings - The best calibration model was developed with min-max normalization (MMN) spectral pre-processing (R-2 = 99.3). The MMN pre-processing method was found most suitable and the maximum coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.993 was obtained for the calibration model developed. The developed results indicated that FTNIR spectroscopy could be used for rapid detection of moisture content in bael pulp samples without any sample destruction. Originality/value - The research in this paper is useful for the quick detection of moisture content of bael fruit pulp during processing.","[Bag, S. K.; Srivastav, P. P.; Mishra, H.

A water level control structure was installed and two separate systems - free drainage (FD) and controlled drainage (CD) were arranged. The groundwater table level was allowed to rise to a maximum of 68 cm above the drains. Measurements to record groundwater table depth, drain outflow quantity and quality were performed through the period 2000-2007. It was determined that in the CD system annual drainage outflow lasted shorter by 40-62%, at the same time it was reduced by 25% and nitrate leaching - by 20-28% lower in comparison with drainage operating in an ordinary regime. These quantities varied depending on weather conditions.

After briefly discussing recent events that made us reconsider our understanding of corporate governance, accountancy and ethics, we try to delimit the state of the art by looking at ethics from the accounting professions' perspective. Teaching ethics to accounting students should no longer try to convince them that they should act in an ethical manner, but raise their awareness with regard to ethical issues in accounting practice. Codes of ethics are therefore useful by considering common issues being dealt with within the business environment. It is here that we try to bring our contribution by developing a conceptual approach that would enhance ethical behavior. When aiming to clarify professional ethics, we closely analyze integrity based on the latest developments undertaken by European professional bodies.
