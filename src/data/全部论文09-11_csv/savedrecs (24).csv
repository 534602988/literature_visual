This article uses recent Swedish income and expenditure data to examine the extent of underreporting of income among self-employed individuals. A key hypothesis is that underreporting of incomes among the self-employed would be visible in the data as 'excess food consumption', for a given level of observed income. Our results confirm the underreporting hypothesis. In particular, we estimate that households with at least one self-employed member underreport their total incomes by around 30%. Under-reporting appears to be much more prevalent among self-employed people with unincorporated businesses as among those with incorporated businesses.","[Engstrom, Per; Holmlund, Bertil] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Holmlund, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Box 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",bertil.holmlund@nek.uu.se,"Engström, Per/L-9193-2018",,,,,,22,62,68,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Long-run identifying restrictions are used to decompose shocks into technology shocks and other shocks. The UK results show more sample stability than similar historical results found for the U.S. in a companion paper. The short-run impact of technology shocks on labor is found to be negative both before and after WWII, regardless of the data generating process assumed for labor. This suggests that the technology-driven real business cycle hypothesis is strongly rejected for the UK. The decomposition also reveals important changes in the volatility of shocks over time.","Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Francis, N (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",nrfranci@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We identify three possible sources of regional effects: differences in the importance of interest-sensitive industries, differences in the contribution of exports to output and differences in the proportion of small relative to large firms. Using the overnight interest rate as the instrument of monetary policy, we present impulse responses of industry output from a recursive vector autoregression, which incorporates a cointegrating relation. The results show that manufacturing and primary industries are the most interest sensitive. We conduct impulse responses of provincial employment from a monetary contraction. The results show that Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island (PEI), primary industry-based provinces, are strongly and adversely affected by a monetary contraction. Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, also primary-based, are also affected. Ontario, which is manufacturing-based, is also affected but to a lesser extent. The response of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and British Columbia are not statistically significant.","York Univ, Econ Sch Analyt Studies & Informat Technol, Atkinson Fac Liberal & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"Georgopoulos, G (通讯作者)，York Univ, Econ Sch Analyt Studies & Informat Technol, Atkinson Fac Liberal & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",georgop@yorku.ca,,,,,,,54,16,21,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper considers the possibility that some of these consequences make themselves felt in the trade flows between migrants' countries of origin and destination. Using a panel of data covering a number of CEE countries between 1996 and 2003, we employ an augmented gravity model to examine the effects of immigration from these transition countries on their bilateral trade flows with the UK. We pay attention to a number of issues that have been raised within the literature on gravity models. We find evidence that migration positively enhances the bilateral exports of the migrants' home country; however, there is less (but some) evidence that the imports from their destination country are also enhanced.","[Ghatak, Subrata; Daly, Vince] Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, London, England; [Silaghi, Monica Ioana Pop] Univ Babes Bolyai, Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Kingston University; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Daly, V (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, London, England.",v.daly@kingston.ac.uk,"Silaghi, Monica/F-9320-2016; Silaghi, Monica/ABA-2513-2020","Silaghi, Monica/0000-0001-8287-9829;",,,,,24,19,20,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The bank brings the bonds to the market and informs the potential buyers about the bond risks; a unique benevolent public authority aims at maximising investors' welfare, The main goal is to investigate whether this unique authority is able to fully inform the market on a firm's true credit worthiness when banks, in order to recover doubtful credits, favour the placement of bonds issued by levered firms by concealing their true risk. By establishing the necessary conditions that allow optimal sanctions to produce the first best equilibrium, we show that the core problem of adverse selection in the corporate bond market does not lie so much in the benevolence of the delegated monitoring system, but rather in the possibility of affecting and sanctioning a firm's behaviour.","[Giuli, Francesco] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Giuli, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Rome, Italy.",fancesco.giuli@uniroma1.it; marco.manzo@agenziadogane.it,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2009,56.0,4,,,,,435,452,,10.2298/PAN0904435G,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,540ZF,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273379600002,0

Several types of models were evaluated in representing the relationship of the rate of unemployment and the index of investment outlays per person actively employed. Best results from a statistical viewpoint were obtained for linear models. These were used to discuss: (a) the intensity of changes in unemployment in the analyzed relationship to investment; (b) the initial situation (starting points) with regard to unemployment; (c) substitution between the starting points and intensity of change of the rate of unemployment as related to the index of investment; (d) the effects of hysteresis in unemployment in the years 2000-2001.

In many European countries, including the USA, very similar circumstances occurred, when the government debt increased during the last decade. In the past such high growth of debt level was characteristic only to wars or economic depressions. The level of a certain country's public debt is mostly determined by the general economic situation of the country and its perspectives. On the other hand, one of the recent and most important issue, faced by many countries, is the effect of the government debt on the economic and social life. Trying to achieve more effective and faster economic development, the government usually borrows in domestic and foreign markets. The academic society discusses the role of the public debt in economics: how the borrowed funds should be used; how much can a government borrow? It is important to determine the place and role of the public debt in the Lithuanian economy and evaluate how borrowing effects the growth of the economy. Currently, the financial markets are closely observing the state budget deficit because it shows how much of financing the government needs at a certain time and how much the rate of the national debt has increased. The analysis of the budget deficit provides information on how effective is the mobilization of the domestic means and on how the state expenses are being managed All that enables us to decide about state's borrowing demands. They also point out that the main causes of the budget deficit may be tax collection from income, too high expenses or ineffective control. The governmental borrowing does not cause damage to the economy if only the opportunities provided by debt are used in an optimal way. The aim of this article is to determine a possibility to forecast the limits of the national debt acceptability, knowing the forecasted actual GDP growth and the value of the budget deficit. It is important to learn what level of the fiscal deficit is acceptable to the state and how it could be managed under certain economic conditions. In making a choice for the criteria needed to determine the acceptable level of the budget deficit, it is indispensable to make a notice of the possibility to apply those criteria, e.g. in analyzing and forecasting.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Karazijiene, Z (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",zaneta.karazijiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,25,5,6,1,8,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

First, we examine the discretionary ( time consistent) solution in cases where the Phillips curve has both a backward-looking and forward-looking component. Second, we show that the commitment ( time inconsistent) solution does not normally involve zero inflation and output at its natural rate. Instead, with a purely forward-looking Phillips curve and positive discounting, it will involve a dynamic path for inflation in which steady state inflation is below its target. In this sense, we obtain negative inflation bias. Third, we show that the timeless perspective policy has the same steady state as the commitment case, but without any short-term output gains.","[Kirsanova, Tatiana] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Vines, David; Wren-Lewis, Simon] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Exeter; University of Oxford,"Kirsanova, T (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",t.kirsanova@ex.ac.uk; david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk; simon.wren-lewis@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Kirsanova, Tatiana/0000-0002-1470-4311",,,,,30,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The system includes database and knowledge base as well as modules used for formation of models, optimization, simulation, decision analysis and inference. The linear programming model contains several hundreds of variables and restrictions. The farm model, using entered data, is formed according to if-then type rules that are stored in the knowledge base. Having solved the task of optimization, the particular values of variables indicate what kind of crops should be grown and in what area, as well as what animals and how many of them should be kept and what resources and how much of them have to be used for achieving the biggest benefit under the environmental and other conditions. The simulation was employed to test the sensitivity of the plan to weather and market variations. Having applied a set of production rules to the given facts and modelling results within the module of decision analysis and inference, conclusions and suggestions are made. Decision support system performs the analysis of production efficiency, resource reserves and shortage, and with the help of the Internet in real time provides a farmer with conclusions and suggestions necessary to increase the efficiency of production conforming to environmental constraints. The integration of optimization calculations and knowledge management into the agricultural decisions-support system expands its possibilities and improves the quality of solutions.","Lithuanian Univ Agr, Dept Informat, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Kurlavicius, A (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Agr, Dept Informat, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",info@kurlavicius.lt,,,,,,,26,14,15,2,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

By using data obtained from eight Asia-Pacific countries over the period 1976 to 2003 and a fixed-effects model to conduct the regression analysis, the results of this study indicate that unemployment rate is negatively and significantly correlated with total mortality and mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases, motor vehicle accidents and infant mortality. These findings are consistent with the view that health may improve during economic downturns. In addition, suicide is found to move countercyclically with economic fluctuations. Socioeconomic factors such as age and gender also play important roles in affecting the mortality rates. The results also show that unemployment has a stronger immediate and contemporaneous, rather than a sustained, effect on mortality rates. Finally, this study concludes that the effects of economic fluctuations on health outcome tend to lead to erroneous conclusions if the fixed-effects problems are neglected. The findings of this study shed some light on the link between economic fluctuations and health outcome and provide further international evidence on this issue.","Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Econ, Tao Yuan, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University,"Lin, SJ (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Econ, Tao Yuan, Taiwan.",joysjlin@ms41.hinet.net,,,,,,,41,59,69,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

What happens when arbitrage is 'broken' and house prices no longer reflect future fundamentals? Adding a bubble to capture the disequilibrium behaviour picked up by econometricians, we show that a narrow focus on consumer price inflation-while neglecting house price disequilibrium-may for some time create the appearance of stability. But, with the bubble distorting policy and the economy on the way up and wreaking havoc on the banking system when it bursts, this is an illusion. For a bubble economy, new instruments of policy (such dynamic capital requirements and loan-to-value limits) are clearly needed-together with clear mandates as to who regulates what.","[Miller, Marcus; Mohanty, Ishita; Zhang, Lei] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Miller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,"Miller, Marcus/A-2123-2009; Zhang, Lei/E-7975-2012",,,,,,39,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We form portfolios according to size, industry, size and book-to-market ratio, momentum and coskewness and compare alternative asset pricing models. The traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the three-factor model of Fama and French are tested in the multivariate testing procedure of Gibbons-Ross-Shanken (1989). Coskewness is introduced as a fourth factor and its incremental effect over CAPM and Fama-French factors is examined both in multivariate tests and in cross-sectional regressions. The findings reveal that coskewness is able to explain the size premium in ISE. Hence, the basic two-moment CAPM without the coskewness factor would underestimate the expected return of size portfolios. Multivariate test results indicate that coskewness reduces the pricing bias, albeit insignificantly. Cross-sectional analysis uncovers that coskewness has a significant additional explanatory power over CAPM, especially for size and industry portfolios. However, coskewness does not have a significant incremental explanatory power over Fama-French factors in ISE.","[Alper, C. Emre] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Misirli, E.

Historically, tourism markets have been national and regional, that is, isolated from one another. However, in the last decades the boundaries between national businesses tend to disappear. General trend of growing income enables individuals and families to travel longer distances. An increase in the quality of tourist products and services, innovations in the field of transport and communications ingenious measures of tourism marketing, and other factors also significantly contribute to the development of global tourism. The competitiveness of tourist destinations becomes increasingly important to countries that intend to control a large share of rapidly growing tourism market, That is particularly relevant to the tourism-dependant countries, which heavily rely on the situation in tourism and travel industry. The competitiveness of tourism sector encloses many factors, such as natural environment (geographic location, climate, scenery, etc.), artificial environment (tourism infrastructure, transport, supply of leisure and entertainment services, retail stores, hotel network), and globalization of markets. The identification and evaluation of tourism competitiveness factors is a pretty common research problem of many scientific studies and articles dedicated to tourism economics. As tourism markets grow, and the concept Of tourism evolves (holiday tourism, tourism of the physically disabled, ecological tourism, conference tourism, political tourism, etc.), the aforementioned research problems become more significant. The object of this study is the identification and evaluation of tourism competitiveness factors. The aim of this study: to identify and evaluate the factors of tourism competitiveness with the use of a systematic approach and renewed version of Competitiveness Monitor (CM) method, adapted for the analysis of modern needs of tourism market The following scientific research methods were applied in the study: the systematical and logical analysis of scientific literature, and synthesis. The study carried out by the authors of this article proposes that the competitiveness of tourism sector significantly adds to the economic development. Some countries are not rich in natural resources or highly developed industry sectors. Such countries tend to concentrate their efforts on the development of tourism industry and services. Various competitiveness factors of tourism sector are analyzed in scientific literature. They are related to market conditions, the level of social development, environmental policy, the base of human resources, the quality of infrastructure, technological advancement, and other fields of development. The degree of development strongly correlates with competitiveness of tourist destinations. Competitive tourist destinations offer a wider range of tourist products; attract potential visitors with the help of their exceptional image (for instance, natural scenery, clean lakes, advanced environmental policy are a perfect niche for ecological tourism and environment-friendly country image); and provide services of a particularly high quality.","[Navickas, Valentinas; Malakauskaite, Asta] Kauno Tech Univ, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Navickas, V (通讯作者)，Kauno Tech Univ, Laisves A1 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",,"Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018; Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019; Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022","Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410",,,,,32,76,85,0,47,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Thus, the holders of such privately placed assets learn more quickly about their assets than other agents. This paper studies the pricing implications of this learning by holding. In an economy in which investors are price takers and risk-neutral, and absent any insider trading or other transaction costs, we show that risky assets command an excess expected return over safe assets in the presence of learning by holding. This is reminiscent of the credit spread puzzle-the large spread between BBB-rated and AAA-rated corporate bonds that is not explained by historical defaults, risk aversion, or trading frictions. The intuition is that the seller of a risky bond needs to offer a coordination premium that helps potential buyers overcome their fear of future illiquidity. Absent this premium, this fear could become self-justified in the presence of learning by holding because a future lemons problem deters current market participation, and this in turn vindicates the fear of a future lemons problem.","London Business Sch, London, England",University of London; London Business School,"Plantin, G (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",,,,,,,,26,33,41,0,30,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The aim is to explain this reorganisation by relying on the New Institutional Economics framework.

This is no paradox. It simply comes from the definition of CA deficit and ED, and points to different degrees of sustainability of CA deficits according to the way they are financed and to the composition of the CA itself. By the evaluation of the determinants of interest rates spreads vis a vis US lending rates we assess the sustainability of CA deficits. We find that FDI net inflows (proxy of equity capital) allow emerging economies to sustain larger CA imbalances with respect to CA deficits financed by inflows of more liquid assets. Equity capital is a way to finance the CA. It does not contribute to the ED and it affects the solvency assessment of a country.","[Rossini, Gianpaolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Zanghieri, Paolo] ANIA Assoc Italian Insurers, Res Dept, I-00186 Rome, Italy",University of Bologna,"Rossini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",gianpaolo.rossini@unibo.it,,"ZANGHIERI, PAOLO/0000-0002-0896-8433",,,,,25,5,5,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Additionally, the diffusion of technology among developing nations has been fulfilled not only directly from developed nations but also from surrounding nations through local spillovers such as learning from others. Recently, the disparity in national football performance among the nations appears to have improved, and it is evident that talented players are mobilized from developing nations to developed ones. The present article attempts to apply the framework of development economics, as introduced earlier, to the case of international football. An empirical examination of FIFA's world ranking points considered as reflecting nations' performances was conducted, applying panel data to control for unobserved nations' specific effects (Baltagi 2005). The results indicate that both technology transfer and the local information spillover play a crucial role in improving the performance of developing nations, but not of developed nations. The presented results are interpreted as implying that developing nations are able to catch up with developed ones due to the effects of technology transfer and local information spillover.","Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawaraku, Fukuoka 8148511, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,,,,,,11,20,20,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Controlling for unobserved prefecture-specific fixed effects and an endogeneity bias of the lagged and lead-dependent variables (the volume of cinema attendance), by using a fixed effect two-stage least squares estimation, I find that people in Japan are likely to be addictive. This finding is contrary to that found in the United Kingdom (Cameron, 1999). Further results suggest that the younger the people are, the more video is a favoured substitute for the cinema. If other factors are equal, the past accumulated consumption of young people is, of course, smaller than that of older people. Hence, the addictive behaviour is more attenuated for younger people because of their lesser past consumption. The complementary effect of past consumption is more likely to outweigh the substitution effect of preferring video as people become older. These findings are in accord with the Becker and Murphy (1988) model of rational addiction.","Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Nishijin Fukuoka 8150075, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, 6-2-92 Sawaraku, Nishijin Fukuoka 8150075, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,,,,,,13,11,11,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The present paper represents a different take on the formulation of a Generalized Darwinism and on Replication. Replication in evolutionary biology is argued to combine two functions: (i) the production of propositions (Synthesis) and (ii) the retention of propositions over time (Memory). By insisting on universally grouping these two functions together the Replicator-Interactor (RI) framework is here argued to suffer from a fundamental ontological mismatch that no amount of bending and stretching of the concept can avoid. When we allow different packaging of Interaction, Synthesis and Memory (ISM) for different systems, we produce much less empirical friction. Replication then emerges as an important special case, but where replication is not the right model, the ISM model brings a range of issues into the open that remain hidden from an RI viewpoint. Also, when we reserve replication for the cases where it really fits we retain the strong theoretical power and empirical relevance by which it gained its fame in evolutionary biology.

Although trade in parts and components and final assembly within production networks (network trade) has generally grown faster than total world trade in manufacturing, the degree of dependence of East Asia on this new form of international specialization is proportionately larger than elsewhere in the world. Network trade has certainly strengthened economic interdependence among countries in the region with the People's Republic of China playing a pivotal role as the premier center of final assembly However, contrary to popular belief, this has not lessened the dependence of the export dynamism of these countries on the global economy. This inference is basically consistent with the behavior of trade flows following the onset of the global financial crisis.","[Athukorala, Prema-chandra] Pacific Australian Natl Univ, Acton, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,,prema-chandra.athukorala@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,30,87,94,0,44,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Concentrating on the determinants of investments in the transition economies that could explain now conventional, puzzling Feldstein-Horioka results for transition economies, we were the first who consider remittances as possible explanation. The results of panel analysis seem to support the hypothesis of capital mobility among the economies in transition for the period 1995-2007.

Following liberalization and the elimination of the Zambian cotton marketing board, the sector developed an outgrower scheme whereby cotton firms provided credit, access to inputs and output markets, and technical assistance to the farmers. There are two distinctive phases of the reforms: a failure of the outgrower contracts, due to farmers' debt renegation, firm hold up, and lack of coordination among firms and farms, and a subsequent period of success of the scheme, due to enhanced contract enforcement and commitment. We find interesting dynamics in the sector. During the phase of failure, farmers were pushed back into subsistence and cotton yields per hectare declined. With the improvement of the outgrower scheme, farmers devoted larger shares of land to cash crops, and farm output significantly increased.","[Brambilla, Irene; Porto, Guido G.] Univ Nacl La Plata, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina; [Brambilla, Irene] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",National University of La Plata; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Brambilla, I (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl La Plata, Calle 6 E-47 & 48,Piso 5,Oficina 532, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina.",irene.brambilla@econo.unlp.edu.ar; guido.porto@depeco.econo.unlp.edu.ar,,,,,,,31,14,15,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The aim of this paper is to use the information provided by this dataset in order to identify the causes of those divergences after controlling for educational inputs and environmental variables. For this purpose, we explicitly consider that education is a multi-input multi-output production process subject to inefficient behaviours, which can be identified at student level using a parametric stochastic distance function approach. Our findings suggest that La Rioja and Castile-Leon are the most efficient regions in Spain while Andalusia, Catalonia and the group composed of the regions that do not participate in the PISA with an extended sample are the worst. In addition, we conclude that most divergences in efficiency are attributable to students who are immigrants or repeating some course. In contrast, other factors such as class size or the type of school ownership do not seem to account for differences in students' performance.","[Cordero Ferrera, Jose Manuel; Crespo Cebada, Eva; Pedraja Chaparro, Francisco] Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Santin Gonzalez, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Complutense University of Madrid,"Ferrera, JMC (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain.",,"FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/S-5567-2018; Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016","FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/0000-0001-8783-6748; Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659",,,,,77,20,23,0,14,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Using a unique monthly dataset of 27 states and eight industries from 2000:1 to 2009:7, this paper evaluates the sensitivity of businesses of different sizes to business cycle conditions in Brazil. The behaviour of the difference in employment growth rates between large and small firms is counter-cyclical and suggests that small firms are more sensitive to business cycle conditions. In addition, the SVAR impulse response analysis suggests the existence of the effect of small firms hiring cheaply from unemployment proportionally more than large ones. On the other hand, credit constraints seem to hit small firms harder and help to explain the empirical regularity that small firms are more cyclically sensitive than large ones for the Brazilian case.

First, we show that self-selection based on ex-ante productivity drives firms' export decisions, which we subsequently relate to various sources of fixed market-entry costs: governance and regulatory quality, the extent of corruption, and cultural proximity. Second, we provide evidence that firms learn to export by trial and error, so as to obtain experience in exporting and to gather knowledge about the potential of foreign markets. Such experimentation appears to be reflected in the volatility of a firm's export product portfolio. More volatility is associated with a higher survival rate in the export market.

This is done by using the results of the hedonic approach together with the Quantity Based Demand System (QBDS) model. The elasticity results obtained with the latter are then compared with those simulated using the Linear Almost Ideal Demand System (LA/AIDS). The methodology is applied to the dishwasher market in Spain: it is found that 15.6% of the final price is actually paid for the energy efficiency attribute. This accounts for about (sic)80 of the average market price. The elasticity results confirm that energy efficient appliances are more price elastic than regular ones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The current paper argues that advocates as well as critics of the procedure have overlooked the crucial necessity to distinguish between internal and external selection in the economy and to include both in economic Genetic Algorithms. The paper claims that such a differentiation will allow the model to depict intentional decisions as well as market selection and help to understand the effects of bounded rationality.

The two key features of the model imply that both Tobin's inflation grease argument and Friedman's rule are operative, and so optimal inflation may be positive or negative. The Simulated Method of Moments is used to estimate the nonlinear model based on its second-order approximation. Results indicate that the Ramsey policy that maximizes social welfare involves an average inflation rate of about 0.4% per year. In the more realistic case where a central banker follows a simple targeting policy, the optimal inflation target is about 1% per year.

While the overall utilisation of EU trade preferences is high, preference utilisation rates of these low-value imports are markedly lower. This fact is unobserved in the aggregate figures, and thus rarely noticed. This paper examines the extent and the importance of this phenomenon.

Our results show that gender earnings gaps are large in all the cities in our sample with significant variations across cities. Cities with large gender earnings gaps are also where gender education gaps are wider and where the female labour market participation is highest. Decomposition of the gender gaps shows that differences in characteristics explain around 40% of the raw gender gap on average, but this varies somewhat across cities. The results of the full decomposition of the gender earnings gaps suggest that differences in sector allocation contribute, on average, to one third of gender earnings gaps. Gender gaps are very wide in the informal sector and differences in micro-firm characteristics also account for differences in self-employment earnings. In contrast to the large gender earnings gaps measured in the seven cities, majority ethnic groups do not appear to be in a systematically advantageous position on the urban labour markets in our sample of cities, and observed gaps are small compared with gender gaps. Looking at more detailed levels of ethnic disaggregation, ethnic earnings differentials are found to be systematically smaller than gender differentials.

The approach of the study is based on the random utility and the application of discrete choice models to two alternative transports: land and sea. The empirical analysis takes as its reference the possibility of increasing shipping of food products from Southeast Spain to Southeast France. By estimations of Binomial and Mixed Logit, heterogeneity of preferences is determined, showing that the decision of exporters depends mainly on costs and time of transit. These estimations lead us to consider different scenarios and to analyze the sensitivity of final clients to future change in the variables which condition the choice between the two forms of transport.","[Perez Mesa, Juan Carlos; Galdeano Gomez, Emilio] Univ Almeria, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Mesa, JCP (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Almeria, Spain.",,"Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014; Gomez, Emilio/KBQ-1973-2024; Galdeano-Gómez, Emilio/J-9979-2014","Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475;",,,,,49,1,1,0,7,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

A simple partial equilibrium model of an international Cournot duopoly is presented in which a domestic and a foreign firm are identical except that the foreign firm faces positive transport costs. Asymmetric information generates a market failure, which the government attempts to alleviate with a MQS. It is found that although firms face the exact same costs of compliance, they will generally prefer different levels of regulation. As a result, international trade disputes are likely to arise even when regulation is non-discriminating.","[Baltzer, Kenneth] Univ Copenhagen, Food & Resource Econ Inst, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Baltzer, K (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Food & Resource Econ Inst, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",kb@foi.dk,"Baltzer, Kenneth/E-4631-2015","Baltzer, Kenneth/0000-0002-8417-7916",,,,,21,9,9,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We address this puzzle in the context of redistribution toward special interest groups (SIGs) by focusing on a set of important policies: tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our policy choice model a government can gain by committing to constrain tariffs through international agreements even if this leads to the use of less efficient NTBs; commitment has political value because it improves the bargaining position of a government that is weak relative to domestic SIGs. Using detailed data we find support for several of the model's predictions including: (i) tariff commitments in trade agreements increase the likelihood and restrictiveness of NTBs but not enough to offset the original tariff reductions; (ii) tariff commitments are more likely to be adopted and more stringent when the government is weaker relative to a SIG. Thus, the results can explain the use of inefficient policies for redistribution and suggest that the bargaining motive is an important source of the political value of commitment in international agreements.

Despite substantial evidence on the negative impact on long-term growth of inequality in the literature, however, there is not much consensus on the specific channels through which inequality affects growth. The empirical validity of two most prominent political economy channels - redistributive fiscal spending and taxes, and sociopolitical instability - has recently been challenged. We advance a new political economy channel for the negative link between inequality and growth, a fiscal policy volatility channel, and present strong supporting econometric evidence in a large sample of countries over the period of 1960-2000. Our finding also sheds light on another commonly observed negative relation between macroeconomic volatility and growth.

To answer this question, we assemble a novel country-industry level panel database with data on entry (by incorporation) for 17 European countries between 1997 and 2004. Our analysis is based on recent models of how corporate taxation affects firm's incorporation decision. We compute effective average tax rates and study how the taxation of corporate income affects entry rates at the country-industry level. Drawing on the political economy literature, we account for the possible endogeneity of taxation. We find a significant negative effect of corporate income taxation on entry rates. The effect is concave and suggests that tax reductions affect entry rates only below a certain threshold tax level. Our results are robust to alternative measures of effective taxation and to the use of alternative and additional explanatory variables. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We first consider the definition proposed in Klibanoff et al. (Econometrica 73(6):1849-1892, 2005) based on the classic Ellsberg two-urn paradox (Ellsberg Q J Econ 75:643-669, 1961) and show that it satisfies several desirable properties. We then compare this definition with those of Nehring (Math Soc Sci 38(2):197-213, 1999), Epstein and Zhang (Econometrica 69:265-306, 2001), Zhang (Econ Theory 20:159-181, 2002), and Ghirardato and Marinacci (J Econ Theory 102:251-289, 2002). Within the smooth ambiguity model, we show that Ghirardato and Marinacci (J Econ Theory 102:251-289, 2002) would identify the same set of ambiguous and unambiguous events as our definition while Epstein and Zhang (Econometrica 69:265-306, 2001) and Zhang (Econ Theory 20:159-181, 2002) would yield a different classification. Moreover, we discuss and formally identify two key sources of the differences compared to Epstein and Zhang (Econometrica 69:265-306, 2001) and Zhang (Econ Theory 20:159-181, 2002).

When much of retail competition is among products provided by a dominant supplier, disclosure provides a means through which the supplier can use its prices to coordinate the retail behavior of its wholesale customers. From the retail consumers' perspective, such coordination is unwanted, leading them to favor opacity of contracts. When retail competition is across brands made by different suppliers, disclosure becomes a conduit through which suppliers compete indirectly via their retail surrogates. Consumers welcome the increased competition accompanying such disclosures. In short, the efficacy of disclosure standards depends critically on the suppliers' market reach and the relative intensity of intrabrand versus interbrand retail competition.","[Arya, Anil; Mittendorf, Brian] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Arya, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",arya.4@osu.edu; mittendorf.3@osu.edu,"Mittendorf, Brian/C-9530-2012","Mittendorf, Brian/0000-0002-5182-4240",,,,,26,32,33,1,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

We calibrate the model to match the U.S. distribution of employment and firms by size. Higher entry costs lead to greater misallocation of productive factors and lower TFP and output. In the model, countries in the lowest decile of the entry costs distribution have 1.32 to 1.45 times higher TFP and 1.52 to 1.75 times higher output per worker than countries in the highest decile.

The empirical estimates show that Croatia classifies among countries with higher unemployment and lower employment rate, characterized with higher tax wedge. Furthermore, the estimates of the regression analysis showed that the tax wedge at all three wage levels (i.e. 67 %, 100 % and 167 % of average wage) has a significant positive impact on unemployment rate. This signifies that Croatia, as other studied countries, should continue with reduction of tax wedge, as this would alleviate unemployment problems and stimulate job creation.","[Dolenc, Primoz; Laporsek, Suzana] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Primorska, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Dolenc, P (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Primorska, Slovenia.",primoz.dolenc@fm-kp.si; suzana.laporsek@fm-kp.si; anasep22@gmail.com,"Laporšek, Suzana/AAC-5278-2020","Laporsek, Suzana/0000-0002-7787-8749",,,,,38,8,8,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that rising wage income and declining agricultural income play important roles in the rapid increase of income inequality in rural China from 1991 to 2006. Only increases in agricultural income appear to reduce total income inequality. China has recently eliminated taxes on agricultural income.

The analysis yields important insights into the relationship between carbon, commodities and financial markets. Firstly, we find a significant relationship between EUA returns and those of the other considered variables that is most appropriately modelled by a Gaussian and Student-t copula. These results contradict some earlier studies that report no statistically significant or even negative correlations between returns of emission allowances and other financial variables. Secondly, considering time-varying copulas shows that the estimated copula parameters are not constant over time. We find in particular that the dependence is stronger during the period of the financial crisis. In a Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis, finally, we further illustrate the advantages of copula methods. In particular, the Student-t copula provides an appropriate quantification of VaR at different confidence levels while other models fail to specify the risk correctly. This analysis shows that ignoring the actual nature of dependence might lead to an underestimation of the risk for portfolios combining EUAs with commodities or equity investments.","[Trueck, Stefan] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Gronwald, Marc; Ketterer, Janina] Ifo Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany",Macquarie University; Ifo Institut,"Trück, S (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",stefan.trueck@mq.edu.au,,"Trueck, Stefan/0000-0002-5302-3850",,,,,60,35,38,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

This paper examines the effect of this reform on capital accumulation and the welfare of each generation. Three methods are used to finance the pension debt, government debt financing, tax financing, and government asset financing. With government debt or tax financing, the market equilibrium remains unchanged and all generations are as well off in the new system as in the PAYG system. Thus, switching from the PAYG system to a funded system is neutral. With government asset financing, the interest rate will decrease, private capital will increase, but the total output may either increase or decrease. The welfare effect is also ambiguous in general, depending on the rate of return of government assets. With plausible parameters, our simulation shows that the reform will lower the interest rate, increase private capital, and lower government capital in the short run, but raise government capital and increase output in the long run.

Why? Pasinetti's book provides an answer by first pointing out the unwise behavior of the Cambridge group of Keynesian scholars, then by suggesting how to overcome the present theoretical impasse by the methodological device of the separation theorem. Economic enquiry, he argues, should distinguish the phase of pure theory, to be elaborated at a logical stage that precedes institutions, from the (applied) institutional analysis. The review concludes by maintaining that, while Pasinetti's suggestion is fully valid, the theoretical strength of a paradigm is a necessary but not sufficient condition for becoming dominant. As the last decades show, the success or failure of a paradigm is also crucially dependent on social and power relations in society.","[Reati, Angelo] Commiss European Union, Brussels, Belgium; [Reati, Angelo] Drew Univ, Madison, NJ 07940 USA",Drew University,"Reati, A (通讯作者)，Emile de Beco 55, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",angelo.reati@skynet.be,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We characterize the optimal BP policy as when the seller can control both the policy length (when the promise expires) and the refund scale (what portion of the price difference is refunded). We explain why the policy length is finite and varies across industries. In a setting where consumers' valuations decline over time, we show that a finite-length BP allows the seller to commit to not lowering her price too soon, while at the same time letting her capture some of the benefits of intertemporal price discrimination. However, because the decline in consumers' valuations is uncertain, a BP does not allow the monopolist to achieve the profit she could earn with a full commitment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates this issue using a time-varying cointegration approach based on the quarterly data from 1996 to 2009. We find some interesting results: (i) the estimates of the income elasticities are between 0.60 and 0.75, which are comparable with the previous studies; (ii) the estimated interest rate elasticity supports the argument that the overall effect of the interest rate on the money holding is weak although there are some mild evidences that it has been strengthened in recent years; (iii) the substitution effect of equity asset dominates the wealth effect, especially, during the bullish market period. Our result is robust to the alternative choices of the scale or opportunity cost variables and shows that omission of the stock prices in the money demand function would possibly yield a misspecification problem.

Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by 'counting' the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M-0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.

We show that not all shocks that could make society richer reduce conflict: positive shocks to labor-intensive industries diminish conflict, while positive shocks to capital-intensive industries increase it. The key requirement is that conflict activities be more labor intensive than the economy as this determines how shocks affect the returns and costs of conflict. Our theory is consistent with several observed patterns of conflict and implies that empirical work should take into account the relative factor intensities of the productive and conflict sectors in each country. Incorporating appropriation into a canonic general equilibrium model affects what policies may be deemed desirable: in order to reduce conflict and generate Pareto-improvements policy must be distortionary, while reforms that appear efficiency-enhancing under the unrealistic assumption of perfect property rights may backfire. This offers one explanation for why reforms based on traditional models without appropriation may be delayed and become unpopular when implemented, and why societies may sympathize with seemingly inefficient redistribution.","[Dal Bo, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dal Bo, Pedro] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",DalBo@Haas.Berkeley.edu; PDalBo@Brown.edu,,,,,,,69,162,200,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We characterize efficient design of these mechanisms. We then gather an extensive data set of highway projects awarded by the California Department of Transportation between 2003 and 2008. By comparing otherwise similar contracts, we show that where the scoring design was used, contracts were completed 30-40% faster and the welfare gains to commuters exceeded the increase in procurement costs.

Yet despite the millions of dollars spent on these policies, we are far from a situation where we know whether many of them are yielding the desired payoffs. This article establishes some basic facts about the number and heterogeneity of firms in different Sub-Saharan African countries and discusses their implications for experimental and structural approaches towards trying to estimate firm policy impacts. It shows that the typical firm programme such as a matching grant scheme or business training programme involves only 100 to 300 firms, which are often very heterogeneous in terms of employment and sales levels. As a result, standard experimental designs will lack any power to detect reasonably sized treatment impacts, while structural models which assume common production technologies and few missing markets will be ill-suited to capture the key constraints firms face. Nevertheless, I suggest a way forward which involves focusing on a more homogeneous sub-sample of firms and collecting a lot more data on them than is typically collected.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"McKenzie, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dmckenzie@worldbank.org,,,,,,,23,11,11,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We find that in a country like France the annual flow of inheritance was about 20-25% of national income between 1820 and 1910, down to less than 5% in 1950, and back up to about 15% by 2010. A simple theoretical model of wealth accumulation, growth, and inheritance can fully account for the observed U-shaped pattern and levels. Using this model, we find that under plausible assumptions the annual bequest flow might reach about 20-25% of national income by 2050. This corresponds to a capitalized bequest share in total wealth accumulation well above 100%. Our findings illustrate the fact that when the growth rate g is small, and when the rate of return to private wealth r is permanently and substantially larger than the growth rate (say, r = 4-5% versus g = 1-2%), which was the case in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century and is likely to happen again in the twenty-first century, then past wealth and inheritance are bound to play a key role for aggregate wealth accumulation and the structure of lifetime inequality.

We first develop a simple econometric model in which voters choose candidates under uncertainty and rely on endorsements from better informed sources. Newspapers are potentially biased in favour of one of the candidates and voters thus rationally account for the credibility of any endorsements. Our primary empirical finding is that endorsements are influential in the sense that voters are more likely to support the recommended candidate after publication of the endorsement. The degree of this influence, however, depends upon the credibility of the endorsement. In this way, endorsements for the Democratic candidate from left-leaning newspapers are less influential than are endorsements from neutral or right-leaning newspapers and likewise for endorsements for the Republican. We also find that endorsements are more influential among moderate voters and those more likely to be exposed to the endorsement. In sum, these findings suggest that voters do rely on the media for information during campaigns but that the extent of this reliance depends upon the degree and direction of any bias.","[Chiang, Chun-Fang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Knight, Brian] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",National Taiwan University; Brown University,"Chiang, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,"CHIANG, CHUN FANG/M-2476-2018","CHIANG, CHUN FANG/0000-0002-7034-2001",,,,,38,168,222,5,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Advocates of discretionary measures emphasize that government spending can stimulate additional private spending - the Keynesian multiplier effect. Thus, we investigate whether the spending package announced by euro area governments for 2009 and 2010 is likely to boost GDP by more than one for one. Because of modelling uncertainty, it is essential that such policy evaluations be robust to alternative modelling assumptions and parameterizations. We use five different empirical macroeconomic models with Keynesian features such as price and wage rigidities to evaluate the impact of the fiscal stimulus. Four of them suggest that the planned increase in government spending will reduce private consumption and investment significantly. Only a model that largely ignores the forward-looking behavioural response of consumers and firms implies crowding-in of private spending. We review a range of issues that may play a role in the recession of 2008-2009. Implementation lags are found to reinforce crowding-out and may even cause an initial contraction. Zero-bound effects may lead the central bank to abstain from interest rate hikes and increase the GDP impact of government spending. Crowding-in, however, requires an immediate anticipation of at least two years at the zero bound. Using a multi-country model, we find that spillovers between euro area countries are negligible or even negative, because direct demand effects are offset by the indirect effect of a euro appreciation. New-Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models provide a strong case for government savings packages. Announced with sufficient lead time, spending cuts induce a significant short-run stimulus and crowding-in of private spending.","[Cwik, Tobias] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany; CEPR, London, England",Goethe University Frankfurt; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Cwik, T (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,81,45,51,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

For economies with high-quality institutions (defined by the competitiveness of the financial sector, the quality of corporate governance, and the level of property rights protection), finance is passive. On the other hand, for economies with low-quality institutions, the quality of the financial system is an independent source of comparative advantage. Interestingly, the conventional measure of financial development (the size of the financial market relative to GDP) does not adequately capture the underlying quality of financial institutions.

We demonstrate that the moral hazard of banking, such as reducing the monitoring efforts, is aggravated by cross-border financial externalities, while the introduction of an international policy coordination mechanism might reduce the moral hazard caused by these externalities. Moreover, international policy coordination is less likely to be sustained when the policy maker is short-sighted and the banking sector has greater political influence. However, when the distortionary cost of a liquidity aids policy is lower with high administrative transparency, and cross-border financial externality is greater, the coordination mechanism is more likely to be sustained.

Furthermore, a dynamic correlation analysis is carried out to broaden the scope of business cycle synchronisation further. We enrich the study with a frequency domain analysis and use the concepts of coherence, dynamic correlation and phase. Our main results are (i) that the synchronisation of business cycles in the euro area is fairly high, and (ii) that the introduction of the euro in 1999 does not seem to have generated a very strong-neither positive nor negative-impact on synchronisation. Coherence and dynamic correlation among the euro area countries, the UK, Japan and the US are also fairly high, reminding of the importance of synchronisation with the global business cycle.","[Weyerstrass, Klaus] Inst Adv Studies IHS, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [van Aarle, Bas] European Business Sch, D-65201 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Kappler, Marcus; Seymen, Atilim] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Weyerstrass, K (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies IHS, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",klaus.weyerstrass@ihs.ac.at,"van Aarle, Bas/AAM-6179-2020","van Aarle, Bas/0000-0002-5944-4939; Weyerstrass, Klaus/0000-0002-5659-8991",,,,,16,23,24,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Why does the RM in Taipei exhibit such a peculiarity? Is it because the populace there are so peculiar in their housing behaviours that can be held to account for such an extraordinary phenomenon or because there are logically consistent economic factors behind the scene that might have led the people to make their housing choices rather differently from the way usually envisaged by the conventional wisdom in economics? In this article, we try to uncover the myth by examining whether the economic factors such as user cost, vacancy rate and people's disposable income can be held to account for the above-mentioned consequence through a vector error correction model. More specifically, we examine whether there are long-term relationships between those explanatory variables and the RMs in question. The results show that our argument that the extraordinary RM phenomenon can be explained with user cost is empirically verified.","[Wang, Chieh-Hsuan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Wu, Sun-Tien] China Univ Technol, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Wang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",95258508@nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,5,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We consider an infinitely repeated game where an upstream firm sells a product to a downstream firm. In each period, the firms negotiate a delivery contract comprising the quality of the good as well as a non-linear tariff. Assuming asymmetric information about the actual quality of the product and focusing on incentive compatible contracts, we show that from the firms' perspective delivery contracts lead to more efficient contracts and thus higher overall profits the lower the firms' outside options, i.e. the higher their mutual dependency. Buyer power driven by a reduced outside option of the upstream firm enhances the efficiency of vertical relations, while buyer power due to an improved outside option of the downstream firm implies less efficient outcomes.","[Baake, Pio] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Baake, Pio] DIW, Berlin, Germany; [von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany; [von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Baake, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",pbaake@diw.de; vschlippenbach@diw.de,,,,,,,36,6,7,0,11,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Donors consist of approximately 1000 participants from a nationally representative sample. We manipulate the perceived worthiness and race of the charities' recipients with an audiovisual presentation. Respondents then decide how much to give to the charities and report their perceptions of recipient worthiness and racial composition. We have four main findings. First, treatments describing recipients as worthy significantly increase giving. Second, the treatment where respondents viewed photos mostly of the black recipients rather than white recipients had no significant effect on giving, even though it successfully manipulated perceptions of racial composition. Third, we find significant racial bias in perceptions of worthiness; the black picture treatment lowers perceived recipient worthiness significantly more among non-black respondents than among black respondents. Finally, we decompose the reduced-form effect of the black picture treatment on giving into two channels: one operating via perceptions of recipient worthiness and one running through perceptions of recipient racial composition. The worthiness perceptions channel is statistically significant, while the race perceptions channel is not. Thus, racially biased worthiness perceptions have a significant effect on giving but this effect is not strong enough to cause a significant reduced-form effect of the black picture treatment on giving.

In response, leading economists have invoked the 'laws of economics' to warn that the extensions may be responsible for much of the current unemployment crisis. This prediction follows directly from a neoclassical vision in which jobs are taken only to generate the income necessary for desired levels of consumption and leisure, workers can 'price' themselves into a job by lowering wage demands, and benefit eligibility rules are not effectively enforced, so any income replacement must reduce work incentives and increase unemployment. In contrast, in a Keynesian-Institutionalist vision, there is job rationing in economic downturns, worker identities are often closely linked to work, there is recognition of long-run scarring effects of extended unemployment, and UB work rules are enforced, so even generous income replacement is not likely to produce much voluntary unemployment, especially in recessions. This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of the UB extensions of 2008-9. The case for the orthodox prediction has relied heavily on extrapolating from pre-Great Recession findings, particularly through the use of selected 'spike at benefit-exhaustion' results from the early 1980s. We conclude that the more recent spike evidence, the recent shifts in the Beveridge curve, and the labour flows data (unemployment to employment) evidence offer little support for the orthodox disincentive view of the current unemployment crisis in the US. If UB generosity has increased unemployment, it has done so more by keeping workers attached to the labour market than by reducing the incentive to work.","[Howell, David R.; Azizoglu, Bert M.] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Howell, DR (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA.",howell@newschool.edu; azizb489@newschool.edu,,,,,,,57,18,27,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

While the provision of HIV care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may improve physical health, to achieve the broader goal of improving the quality of life and socioeconomic viability of people living with HIV/AIDS, appropriate social and economic programmes may need to complement treatment. We report results from baseline data of a longitudinal, prospective cohort study with a 12-month follow-up period in two Ugandan HIV clinics. We use t-tests to examine differences across sample subpopulations and in a second step employ multivariate logistic and ordinary least squares regressions. The investigation of retrospective variables such as the respondent's employment and income history, as well as changes in household composition, allows us to draw conclusions about the shocks experienced by households with HIV-positive members. We find that the study participants have experienced job loss and declining household income since testing HIV-positive, mainly due to worsened health status of the respondent. We also find that households use a range of coping mechanisms, such as changes in household composition or borrowing in response to these shocks, but that these strategies are not accessible to all types of households to the same degree. The findings highlight the importance of ART, not only to improve physical health, but also as a first necessary (though potentially not sufficient) step to help households restore their economic capacity.","[Linnemayr, Sebastian; Glick, Peter; Wagner, Glenn] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Lawson, Brooke Stearns] USAID, Washington, DC USA",RAND Corporation; United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Linnemayr, S (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA.",slinnema@rand.org,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R21 HD061267] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,21,3,3,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We set up a simple two-period model of international migration between a poor South and a rich North with temporary visas issued for one period. Because of capital market imperfections, immigrants from the South face additional capital costs when financing the visa fee. In this model, we find that temporary visas can improve welfare in the North if capital costs of the immigrants are sufficiently low. For high capital costs, however, a welfare reduction cannot be ruled out. We extend the model to the case of heterogeneous immigrants and asymmetric information. In this setting, we show that the government in the North may have an incentive to issue temporary visas for those with low capital costs and to tolerate illegal immigration of the others.","[Lorz, Oliver; Schaefer, Karen] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Econ & Business, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Lorz, O (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Econ & Business, Templergraben 64, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",lorz@rwth-aachen.de; karen.schaefer@rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In this paper, we characterize the optimal contract between a public regulator and an altruistic agent according to the degree alpha of public service motivation, when the type of the public service consumer is privately observed. We show that the requested effort is nondecreasing with alpha and can be higher than the first-best level. Moreover, we show that the agent is put on a high-powered contract when some customers are served but that this contract is associated with different types of consumers according to alpha. In contrast, the agent is never put on a cost-plus contract. Finally, we show that the first-best allocation can be achieved under budget balance for a degree of altruism higher than a threshold that we characterize.","[Naegelen, Florence; Mougeot, Michel] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Naegelen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France.",florence.naegelen@univ-fcomte.fr; michel.mougeot@univ-fcomte.fr,,"mougeot, michel/0000-0003-1969-2353",,,,,24,4,6,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In July 2002, the French government moved to reduce this insecurity at the start of working life by introducing the Youth-in-business Contract (Contrat Jeune en Entreprise), a new contract for young people under 22 years old who dropped out of school before passing their final secondary school examinations. Under this scheme, firms were entitled to claim a subsidy when they hired an eligible young worker on an open-ended contract. We assess the impact of the Youth-in-business Contract on transitions to permanent employment by estimating a dynamic difference-in-difference model drawing on the French Labour Force Survey. We use a new method, inspired by Keane and Sauer (2009), to deal with measurement errors in the data.

We utilize the bivariate SVAR modeling and adopt an identification scheme, which allows for the possibility that a shift in the aggregate demand curve may induce the long-run aggregate supply curve to shift. We have shown that aggregate supply shocks are positively affected by the demand shocks in each of the G-7 countries. It is found that a one-time positive aggregate demand shock increases the output level permanently in these industrialized economies. We have also shown that our decomposition strategy can help resolve anomalies in the responses of inflation to a positive aggregate supply shock observed in a simple Blanchard-Quah decomposition.

This new model has the feature to account for the long memory and the structural change in the conditional variance process. The structural change is modeled by a logistic function allowing the intercept to vary over time. We also implement a modeling strategy for our TV-FIGARCH specification whose performance is examined by a Monte Carlo study. An empirical application to the crude oil price and the S&P 500 index is carried out to illustrate the usefulness of our techniques. The main result of this paper is that the long memory behavior of the absolute returns is not only explained by the existence of the long memory in the volatility but also by deterministic changes in the unconditional variance.

In equilibrium (payoff maximization), P does not punish and A refuses any positive demand. In the experiment. P punishes increasingly often and increasingly severely as she gains experience; most As comply with P's demands. The observations are compatible with linear spite. In a finite mixture model, the types of P and A in the subject pool are characterized. An A that is resistant to extortion (declines all demands) is very rare, and hence the threat of punishment in general is effective, but all As either ignore actual punishment or react negatively to it.

Empirical measurement has been demonstrated using 1999 and 2004 trade data from Pakistan.

The paper finds that labor quality measured by education level plays an important role in deciding the distribution of inward FDI, but labor quality measured by working certificates loses its significance using non-parametric matching techniques and the instrumental variables and generalized method of moments technique. The author also finds that labor quality has a more significant impact on other foreign investments than Hong Kong-invested, Macau-invested and Taiwan-invested firms. The impacts of labor quality on inward FDI are found to be strongly uneven across industries and provinces. Therefore, China should pay more attention to the education of employees in all foreign-invested firms, and invest more in education to improve labor quality, which will help China to attract more FDI, especially technology-intensive FDI.","Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Lin, FQ (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",faqin.lin@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,10,11,12,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2011,19.0,3,,,,,68,86,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01243.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,772IJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291227300005,0

It is important that individuals recognize their overweight status as a health risk in order for an effective change in lifestyle behaviors to occur, and growing evidence suggests that actual weight and perception of weight status often do not match, especially among adolescents. In this article, we explore the extent to which exposure to heavier peers and parents affects misperception of their own weight status by adolescents. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we estimated instrumental variable models with school-level fixed effects to account for bidirectionality of peer influence and environmental confounders. Our results indicate that individuals who live in an environment that exposes them to overweight/obese parents and heavier peers tend to misperceive their weight status and think of themselves to be of lower weight than they actually are. Our analysis also revealed differential effects by gender and type of peers.","[Ali, Mir M.; Amialchuk, Aliaksandr] Univ Toledo, Dept Econ, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Renna, Francesco] Univ Akron, Dept Econ, Akron, OH 44325 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Ali, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Toledo, Dept Econ, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",mir.ali3@utoledo.edu; aamialc@utnet.utoledo.edu; frenna@uakron.edu,,,,,,,33,41,52,0,21,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The empirical analysis shows that a sizeable dispersion of HICP inflation rates across euro-area countries arises mostly in the components based on non-traded goods. There is also a significant cross-country heterogeneity in the response to changes in a common latent factor which accounts for a large fraction of the dispersion in national inflation rates. A stylized model of a currency area is used to understand the interrelation among shocks, structures and policies in driving the data generating process. The model shows that the dynamic of the inflation differentials is largely driven by the variability of productivity in the non-tradable sector of the more flexible economy. Conversely, the output differentials is largely driven by the variability in the productivity of the tradable sector, also of the more flexible economy. Optimal policy is investigated together with an analysis of the optimal adjustment to adopting a common currency with initial incorrect real exchange rate parity.","[Benigno, Pierpaolo] LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy; [Altissimo, Filippo] Brevan Howard AM LLP, London, England; [Benigno, Pierpaolo] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Palenzuela, Diego Rodriguez] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Luiss Guido Carli University; European Central Bank,"Benigno, P (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy.",pbenigno@luiss.it,,"BENIGNO, PIERPAOLO/0000-0003-3332-7213",,,,,52,16,16,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This article uses a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to investigate the appropriate monetary policy response to a natural disaster. We show that the standard Taylor rule response in models with and without nominal rigidities is to increase the nominal interest rate. That finding is unchanged when we consider the optimal policy response to a disaster. A nominal interest rate increase following a disaster mitigates both temporary inflation effects and output distortions that are attributable to nominal rigidities.","[Keen, Benjamin D.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Pakko, Michael R.] Univ Arkansas, Inst Econ Advancement, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock,"Keen, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 329 Hester Hall,729 Elm Ave, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",ben.keen@ou.edu; mrpakko@ualr.edu,,,,,,,17,15,17,0,15,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Exchange rate volatility is modeled as a stochastic variable whose process is determined by a Markov chain with two states: one with low volatility and the other with high volatility. The estimated model allows us to identify the existence of two regimes or states in the volatility of the Mexican currency but the volatility of the peso-dollar exchange rate is less persistent when compared with the volatility observed in other exchange rates. Also a high probability for the low volatility regime is observed, which could be regarded as consistent with a relatively stable exchange rate.","[Lopez Herrera, Francisco] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Contaduria & Adm, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rodriguez Benavides, Domingo] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Div Ciencias Sociales & Adm, Unidad Azcapotzalco Uam Az, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ortiz Arango, Francisco] Univ Panamer, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico,"Herrera, FL (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Contaduria & Adm, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",francisco_lopez_herrera@yahoo.com.mx; domr@economia.unam.mx; fortizar@up.edu.mx,"López-Herrera, Francisco/F-9634-2010; ARANGO, FRANCISCO ORTIZ/H-6543-2017","López-Herrera, Francisco/0000-0003-2626-9246; ARANGO, FRANCISCO ORTIZ/0000-0003-2707-4459",,,,,61,1,2,0,8,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The notions of independent strategies as well as of common priors are amended to render them applicable to games in which players lack probabilistic sophistication. Within this framework the equilibrium predictions of two-player games with ambiguity-averse and with ambiguity-neutral players are observationally equivalent. This equivalence result does not extend to the case of games with more than two players. A translation of the concept of equilibrium in beliefs to the context of ambiguity aversion yields substantially different predictions - even for the case with just two players.

From this perspective, historical paths are important insofar as knowledge about them shapes current decisions, for better or worse. A key consideration is the extent to which relevant information is fully inscribed in the existing configuration of state variables, including organizational structures and institutional norms. Using a chess analogy, path dependency arises whenever a decision maker's 'move' depends not only upon existing state variables, but also knowledge of the path by which this configuration came about. This chess analogy is then extended to various institutional contexts such as legal expungement of criminal records, patient privacy rights, and corporate executive succession strategies. A formal notation is introduced to specify this definition more precisely, and to compare it with other perspectives on path dependency, such as lock-in effects, increasing returns to scale, ergodic equilibria, and generalized notions that 'history matters'.","Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Heikkila, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",heikkila@sppd.usc.edu,,,,,,,26,7,7,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Both fiscal consolidation and fiscal reorganization often create spillover effects and thereby induce free-riding problems. It is thus important to cope with the free-riding behaviour of interest groups. It is often argued that in order to attain successful outcomes, a good macroeconomic situation is needed, since we expect positive income effects. In this paper, we first explain the dynamic aspects of insufficient fiscal consolidation due to free-riding problems in the framework of private provision of public goods. Then, using a static model between central and local governments, we examine the sign of income effects for reform attempts to pursue fiscal reorganization. It is shown that good economic circumstances do not necessarily enhance reform of reorganizing fiscal expenditures, although it could enhance fiscal reconstruction.","Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Ihori, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22243028] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,36,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The policy had substantial impacts on the new administrative entities, including more discretionary power and fiscal independence. Such county-to-city upgrading provided the central government with an instrument to reward localities. Using a large dataset covering all counties during 1993-1997. I show that upgrading is not an automatic procedure that endorses the high urbanization levels in existing counties. Although official guidelines for upgrading counties to cities were published, these requirements were largely ignored in practice. Instead, economic growth rate was the key factor in determining which counties obtained city status. This paper interprets the creation of county-level cities through upgrading as part of the incentive structure of Chinese local officials. The importance of both fiscal and political incentives facing the local government in promoting economic growth is highlighted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A Difference-in-difference (DID) approach is employed to estimate NCMS effects. The overall effects of NCMS were modest, but differed for adults and children. We find that adults were 2.1% more likely to purchase private health insurance when NCMS became available. NCMS had a larger positive effect on adult private coverage in higher income groups and in communities with a preexisting health care financing system, known as the Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS). We also find evidence suggesting that NCMS crowded out child private health insurance, especially in lower income groups. However, this finding is not robust to controlling for other covariates including household characteristics and availability of private insurance in the community. For both adults and children, risk preferences and socio-economic status, including income and education, are important predictors of private insurance take-up. We find no evidence for adverse selection in the demand for private health insurance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Strachan, N",,,,"Strachan, Neil",,,Business-as-Unusual: Existing policies in energy model baselines,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Baselines; Policy; Energy modelling,SCENARIOS; SYSTEMS,"Baselines are generally accepted as a key input assumption in long-term energy modelling, but energy models have traditionally been poor on identifying baselines assumptions. Notably, transparency on the current policy content of model baselines is now especially critical as long-term climate mitigation policies have been underway for a number of years. This paper argues that the range of existing energy and emissions policies are an integral part of any long-term baseline, and hence already represent a with-policy baseline, termed here a Business-as-Unusual (BAuU). Crucially, existing energy policies are not a sunk effort; as impacts of existing policy initiatives are targeted at future years, they may be revised through iterative policy making, and their quantitative effectiveness requires ex-post verification. To assess the long-term role of existing policies in energy modelling, currently identified UK policies are explicitly stripped out of the UK MARKAL Elastic Demand (MED) optimisation energy system model, to generate a BAuU (with-policy) and a REF (without policy) baseline. In terms of long-term mitigation costs, policy-baseline assumptions are comparable to another key exogenous modelling assumption that of global fossil fuel prices. Therefore, best practice in energy modelling would be to have both a no-policy reference baseline, and a current policy reference baseline (BAuU). At a minimum, energy modelling studies should have a transparent assessment of the current policy contained within the baseline. Clearly identifying and comparing policy-baseline assumptions are required for cost effective and objective policy making, otherwise energy models will underestimate the true cost of long-term emissions reductions.

Each firm chooses its demand for working hours and number of vacancies, and the earnings profile is determined by Nash bargaining. The earnings profile is generally nonlinear in hours of work, and defines the trade-off between employment and hours of work. Concave production technology induces firms to overemploy and, as a result, hours of work are below their optimal level. The Hosios condition is not sufficient for efficiency. When there are two industries, workers employed by firms with higher recruitment costs work longer and earn more. That is, good jobs require longer hours of work.

By using patents and patent citations from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we trace sectoral knowledge flows from G-5 countries to LACs. We study the impact of three channels of knowledge flows: foreign R&D, patent citation-related spillovers, and face-to-face contact spillovers. Our results, based on data for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, suggest that international knowledge spillovers from the G-5 countries were a significant determinant of inventive activity during the period 1988-2003. We find that the stock of ideas produced in the USA has a strong impact on the international patenting activity of these countries. Moreover, controlling for US-driven R&D effects, bilateral patent citations and face-to-face relationships between inventors are both important additional mechanisms of knowledge transmission.

This article reviews the philosophical, psychological and neurological basis for moral values, showing that they are consistent and measurable. I demonstrate that values play a role in social interactions, including market exchange. Indeed, market exchange in moderately regulated economies is predicated on the notion that most people, most of the time, behave morally - albeit in the shadow of enforcement. This idea is of ancient origin, but is most clearly articulated in Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments. The moral nature of social decisions is used to identify modifications of the standard expected utility model, and implications for a value-based approach to human decisions are elucidated for law, regulation, business organization, economic growth, and happiness. The conditions that lead to moral market failures like the Enron debacle are also described. Not only do morals underpin markets, but intriguing new evidence suggests that markets may strengthen moral values. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

And what do these optimal policies imply for the evolution of government debt over time? To provide an answer, this paper studies a standard monetary policy model with nominal rigidities and monopolistic competition and adds to it a fiscal authority that issues nominal non-state contingent debt, levies distortionary labor income taxes and determines the level of public goods provision. Higher government debt levels make it optimal to reduce public spending, so as to dampen the adverse incentive effects of distortionary taxes, but also strongly influence the optimal stabilization response following technology shocks. In particular, higher debt levels give rise to larger risks to the fiscal budget and to tax rates. This makes it optimal to reduce government debt over time. The optimal speed of debt reduction is missed when using first-order approximations to optimal policies, but is shown to be quantitatively significant in a second-order approximation, especially when technology movements are largely unpredictable in nature.

The models are applied to test the hypothesis of existing structural supply-side constraints versus demand-side constraints impeding the economic growth and development of the country. A review of the historical performance of the Nigerian economy reveals significant socio-economic constraints as the predominant impediments to high and sticky levels of poverty in the economy. Thus, a model which is suitable for policy analyses of the Nigerian economy needs to capture the long-run supply-side characteristics of the economy. A price block is incorporated to specify the price adjustment between the production or supply-side sector and real aggregate demand sector. The institutional characteristics with associated policy behaviour are incorporated through a public and monetary sector, whereas the interaction with the rest of the world is represented by a foreign sector, with specific attention being given to the oil sector. The models are estimated with time-series data from 1970 to 2006 using the Engle-Granger two-step co-integration technique, capturing both the long-run and short-run dynamic properties of the economy. The full-sector models are subjected to a series of policy scenarios to evaluate various options for government to improve the productive capacity of the economy, thereby achieving sustained accelerated growth and a reduction in poverty in the Nigerian economy.

The optimal maximin (respectively maximax) scoring rule takes the optimal utilitarian scoring rule and applies a factor that shifts it towards negative voting (respectively plurality voting).","[Apesteguia, Jose; Ferrer, Rosa] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Ballester, Miguel A.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,,,"Ferrer, Rosa/H-6518-2013","Ferrer, Rosa/0000-0001-7912-7802",,,,,30,17,18,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Any organisational unit, notwithstanding it is an institution or agency performing one or several of these functions, is considered as a part of a marketing channel. The structure of the channel determines what functions and which organisational unit performs. A proper selection of product traffic channels requires the information where buyers are, and the number of buyers; besides it is necessary to learn the market conditions. While making decisions on marketing channels one must identify the existing situation and reason why the company should choose a certain strategy for the distribution of the production to buyers (the number and types of marketing channels, the point of production sale). The selection of the marketing channel scheme and structure takes longer than any other decision related to marketing mix elements (Svensson, 2002). Therefore, it is very important to make the right choice of the type of the channel, intermediaries and evaluate all elements of the environment which affect formation of a marketing channel. The necessity of the distribution as a specific economic activity arises from the gap, mismatch between the production of products and consumption place, time, quantity and quality (product range) (Pranulis, Pajuodis, Urbonavicius, Virvilaite, 2008). The speed of delivery, guaranteed supply and a possibility to purchase products, convenience for buyers and other things may improve the relationship between buyers and sellers and enhance consumer satisfaction. That is why companies more and more focus on marketing channel management in order to deliver products and services required by consumers on time, in the proper place and at a fair price (Frazier, 1999). Each marketing channel generates different revenues; thanks to intermediaries products are supplied to target markets in a more efficient way. By using their relationship, experience, specialisation and economy of scale, intermediaries create a value added to the product to be sold. Therefore, competitive and development possibilities of the company as well as consumer satisfaction are very much dependent on the marketing channels formed, and intermediaries chosen by the company. Benefits can be seen in reviewing marketing channels in the historical context as well. In the eighties and nineties of the last century multistage, detailed channel formation models were suggested. Recently simpler 4 - 6-step, more universal models are prevailing. The geography of marketing channels management is expanding too: empirical tests on the principles of marketing channel formation have been made in Central and Eastern European countries (Lorentz, Wong, Hilmola, 2007), in Asia (Liu, Tao, Li, El-Ansary, 2008). Channel formation is also affected by modern technologies: a possibility to purchase products on internet, various novelties in the area of logistics. A variety of retail trade forms offers the consumer wider opportunities of choosing the product and the producer to select the most appropriate marketing channel from a wider range of channels of various forms, length, and width (Yan, 2010). Moreover, the decision of a consumer is more and more influenced by the environmental aspects of the product or service, social responsibility of producers and intermediaries (Juscius, Snieska, 2008).","[Banyte, Jurate; Gudonaviciene, Rasa] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Grubys, Darius] Perfetti van Melle Baltics, LT-06327 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Banyte, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.banyte@ktu.lt; rasa.gudonaviciene@ktu.lt; Darius.Grubys@ru.pvmgrp.com,,,,,,,38,12,12,1,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

There are two models of convergence, sigma-convergence and beta-convergence. sigma-convergence expressed via correlation coefficient presents situation, when countries converge to the same level of economic performance (i. e. correlation coefficient is decreasing). beta-convergence result from Pears correlation coefficient presents situation, when the economic growth in poorer countries is higher than in richer ones.

Data sources: Administrative claims data from a US Medicaid fee for service plan. Study design: Matched two group analyses using both kernel-based matching and one-to-one propensity score matching. This comparison is applied to the estimation of diabetes disease management treatment effects. Principle findings: Kernel-based matching is found to be better than one-to-one propensity score matching when there is no sufficient number of potential controls from which to draw a matched cohort but similar when there is a sufficient number of potential controls. Matching was applied in the context of a diabetes disease management program that showed an increase in management of each person's medical care through the disease management program. Conclusions: The approach provides a methodology for researchers to evaluate healthcare service innovations without a randomized trial design and delineates the requirements for a matched analysis.

In his works, he explicitly deals with financial intermediaries and elaborates a 'new view' which, in contrast with the 'old view', maintains that there are no reasons to attribute a special role to the banks. This paper critically analyses Tobin's theory and shows that this theory overlooks an important function of banks highlighted by Keynes, and that the specification of this banks' function is the necessary condition to highlight the most significant aspects of what Keynes calls a monetary economy. These points enable us to draw some observations about the question of the financial system regulation.","[Bertocco, Giancarlo] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Econ, Varese, Italy; [Bertocco, Giancarlo] Univ Insubria, Fac Econ, Varese, Italy",University of Insubria; University of Insubria,"Bertocco, G (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Econ, Varese, Italy.",giancarlo.bertocco@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,72,5,6,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Using the European Social Survey, we find that there is a penalty to be paid for immigrants with a strong identity. Being a first generation immigrant leads to a penalty of about 17% while second-generation immigrants have a probability of being employed that is not statistically different from that of natives. However, when they have a strong identity, second-generation immigrants have a lower chance of finding a job than natives. Our analysis also reveals that the relationship between ethnic identity and employment prospects may depend on the type of integration and labour market policies implemented in the country where the immigrant lives.

Our analysis reveals five main results. First, the firm-level determinants of the propensity to apply are similar in Eastern and Western Europe: small and financially opaque firms as well as firms with alternative financing sources are less likely to apply for credit while firms with greater financing needs (exporters) are more likely to apply. The lower rate of loan applications by firms in Eastern Europe compared to Western Europe seems to be partly driven by the stronger presence of foreign banks and the lower level of credit information sharing. Second, while those firms which do apply for credit are rarely denied credit, foreign bank presence is associated with higher loan rejection rates among small firms. The high loan approval rates observed in Eastern and Western Europe result partly from a selection effect: those firms which are more likely to have an application rejected are less likely to apply in the first place. We find evidence that foreign bank presence is associated with higher loan rejection rates among small and government-owned firms. Third, the reasons why firms do not apply for loans differ strongly between the two regions. In Eastern Europe a higher fraction of non-applicants seem to be discouraged by lending conditions, that is, high interest rates and tough collateral requirements, while in Western Europe more firms simply do not need loans. Fourth, credit constraints in Eastern Europe softened in recent years. Firms which were discouraged from applying for credit or denied credit in 2005 were more likely to have a loan in 2008 than to still be credit constrained, especially in countries with better credit information sharing. Finally, credit constraints do affect firm performance in Eastern Europe. In particular, firms which are denied credit or discouraged from applying are less likely to invest in R&D and introduce new products. - Martin Brown, Steven Ongena, Alexander Popov and Pinar Yesin.","[Brown, Martin] Swiss Natl Bank, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Haliassos, Michael] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Swiss National Bank (SNB); Tilburg University; European Central Bank; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Brown, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.brown@snb.ch; steven.ongena@tilburguniversity.nl; alexander.popov@ecb.int; pinar.yesin@snb.ch,"Popov, Alexander M/D-7130-2012; Haliassos, Michael/AAH-3307-2021","Haliassos, Michael/0000-0002-6355-6896; , Pinar/0000-0003-4818-6951; Ongena, Steven/0000-0002-8381-0062",,,,,38,107,111,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0266-4658,,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

According to the literature analysis, effective and successful socialization is mutually advantageous for organizations and for individuals. It is agreed that the successor's socialization process has an impact for future organizational performance success. Among the outcomes of successful socialization there are newcomer's job satisfaction, commitment to the organization, longevity in the organization, performance proficiency and some others. Application of socialization theory allows to foresee why some CEO successions lead to a change in an organization's strategic direction while others do not. However, how the socialization process differs in differently sized organizations still requires further discussions and elaborations. The paper explores the stages of executive succession, executive integration process received as taking charge and socialization, and describes socialization outcomes. The authors revealed that a limited attention is paid to the analysis of executive's socialization differences in small, medium and large organizations. The paper aims to identify the elements of executive successor's socialization process and explore how they differ in small, medium and large organizations. After exploring the elements of executive socialization process, the conceptual model was developed. A quantitative research methodology was employed in order to identify the executive socialization differences in small, medium and large organizations. The survey was implemented in rapidly growing or/and most profitable Lithuanian organizations which experienced the CEO change within the last 3 years. The results of the survey revealed that the success of executive socialization was moderate in all differently sized organizations. Socialization process in organizations received a rank mean from 7.41 to 7.81 and indicated that there was room for improvement. However, the differences of executive's socialization process in differently sized organizations were revealed. In small organizations, proactive leadership effectiveness is higher than in medium or large organizations, i.e. newly appointed executives tend to more enhance their own transition experience. In a large organization, the selection and pre-hire planning process is better organized and implemented than in small and medium organizations. In medium size organization, selection and pre-hire planning, proactive leadership effectiveness and acculturation process received the lowest rank means comparing to small and large organizations. The results of the survey allowed identifying the differences of socialization process in small, medium and large organizations and indicating the gaps for improvement. Therefore, further research should be carried out identifying the executive socialization improvement elements in the context of executive succession.","[Buoziute-Rafanaviciene, Solveiga; Barsauskas, Petras] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sarapovas, Tadas] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; ISM University of Management & Economics,"Buoziute-Rafanaviciene, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",solveiga.boziute@ktu.lt; tadsar@ism.lt; petras.barsauskas@ktu.lt,,,,,,,60,0,2,3,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Instead, it allows the actual price and coefficient changes that occur between periods to identify the implicit elasticities and own-and cross-price derivatives. Using this model, it is shown how accurate measures of price effects, including the full array of own and cross-elasticities of demand, can be estimated for models comprising up to 15 sectors given data for only two time periods.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Econ, Meadville, PA 16335 USA",Allegheny College,"Casler, SD (通讯作者)，Allegheny Coll, Dept Econ, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",scasler@allegheny.edu,,,,,,,21,1,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

It is motivated by increasing theoretical and empirical evidence that credit market conditions affect the propagation of cyclical fluctuations in the economy. The relative contribution of each channel is determined by comparing the impulse responses when the relevant channel is suppressed with the impulse responses when all three channels are operating. The analysis shows that all three channels affect business cycle dynamics. But the interest rate channel has the largest effects in the transmission of shocks to the economy. The results suggest that it is substantially more important than the credit channel. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, meat products across species are likely stronger substitutes than some products from the same species. Further, demand for specific meat products would be expected to respond differently to market information about food safety or other events. This study uses monthly consumer panel data collected between 1992 and 2000 to estimate a disaggregated meat product demand system. The use of the expectations maximization algorithm is introduced to estimate a demand system that adjusts for the econometric problem of censored data resulting from purchased shares of some products by individuals often being equal to zero. Results indicate that certain individual meat products have noticeably different own-price elasticities than existing aggregate meat product estimates of their respective species. Some individual meat products have stronger substitutes across species than within species (e. g. beef steak and pork chops are substitutes, but beef roast and ground beef or not substitutes for steak).","[Coffey, Brian K.] Technol Univ Tajikistan, Dept Management & Int Econ, Dushanbe, Tajikistan; [Schroeder, Ted C.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Marsh, Thomas L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Technological University of Tajikistan; Kansas State University; Washington State University,"Coffey, BK (通讯作者)，Technol Univ Tajikistan, Dept Management & Int Econ, Dushanbe, Tajikistan.",bcoffey@coopstudies.org,,"Coffey, Brian/0000-0001-8936-2697",,,,,55,8,12,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We estimate a discrete time survival model with a probit specification for house price expansions and contractions. This model allows us to test for duration dependence.

Financial tools - requiring substantial adjustments - are usually used to determine risk and return. This article presents a novel approach to adjusting the conditional value at risk (CVaR) metric to the mix of contracts on the energy markets; the approach uses Mixture Design of Experiments (MDE). In this kind of experimental strategy, the design factors are treated as proportions in a mixture system considered quite adequate for treating portfolios in general. Instead of using traditional linear programming, the concept of desirability function is here used to combine the multi-response, nonlinear objective functions for mean with the variance of a specific portfolio obtained through MDE. The maximization of the desirability function is implied in the portfolio optimization, generating an efficient recruitment frontier. This approach offers three main contributions: it includes risk aversion in the optimization routine, it assesses interaction between contracts, and it lessens the computational effort required to solve the constrained nonlinear optimization problem. A case study based on the Brazilian energy market is used to illustrate the proposal. The numerical results verify the proposal's adequacy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, although having an existing bank relationship is not significantly related to the entry decision, it is positively related to the survival for new entrepreneurs and their employment creation. We also find a non-linear relationship between remittances and entry in that individuals not receiving remittances are more likely to enter self-employment; but, if they do receive them, the likelihood of starting a business increases in the fraction of wealth received from domestic remittances. Finally, people working in the informal sector are more likely to become viable entrepreneurs, particularly those provided with loans from micro-credit organizations.

First, the Pratt-Arrow coefficient of absolute risk aversion is generalized into a measure of interval risk aversion, suitable for analysing preferences over risks of any magnitude, and a corresponding interval measure of relative risk aversion is constructed from preference and risk parameters, without explicit reference to initial wealth or income.

I used a Swedish longitudinal data set containing married couples where the husband was either employed or made redundant in 1987 by an establishment closure. There was no evidence that husbands' job loss positively affected wives' annual earnings. Although husbands' utilization of unemployment insurance increased significantly, government transfers including also sickness insurance, disability insurance and means-tested social benefits, did not fully replace husbands' long-run earnings losses. Hence, displaced workers seem to suffer also from long-lasting losses in family income, which in many respects is a better measure of economic welfare than individual earnings or wages.","[Eliason, Marcus] Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat IFAU, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Eliason, Marcus] Univ Gothenburg, Ctr European Labour Market Studies, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Eliason, M (通讯作者)，Inst Labour Market Policy Evaluat IFAU, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",marcus.eliason@ifau.uu.se,,"Eliason, Marcus/0000-0002-7433-0681",,,,,37,15,18,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Trade liberalization lowers unemployment and raises real wages as long as it improves average productivity. We show that this condition is likely to be met by a reduction in variable trade costs or by entry of new trading countries.

This article analyses the various channels through which the Russian government and the state-owned Gazprom enterprise have sought to undermine the Nabucco pipeline's options: strengthening their position in Central Asia, proposing construction of Southstream and taking control of the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH) in Baumgarten (Austria). Analysis shows that in all three cases the measures have proved consistent with the objectives of the Russian gas export strategy. Therefore, it is not really precise to speak of a 'direct' reaction by the Russian government to the Nabucco project; rather, Russia has developed an export strategy that has 'indirectly' given an effective response to the project, leaving it in a considerably weakened position.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Complutense Estudios Int, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Fernandez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Complutense Estudios Int, Madrid, Spain.",rafernan@ccee.ucm.es,,"Fernandez, Rafael/0000-0003-0602-4233",,,,,36,5,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,1,,,,,69,85,PII 933668963,10.1080/14631377.2011.546976,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,723GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287493900005,0

We take advantage of the fact that, in France, many municipalities recently joined together, forming groups of municipalities (or communities) in order to achieve economies of scale. Using spatial econometrics, we find some evidence for the existence of a zoo effect in French communities. In other terms, larger communities provide a broader range of services than smaller ones.

From a policy viewpoint, this may help to alleviate some labour supply shortages and fiscal pressures, especially in the context of the ageing population. Factors such as health or pension provision may influence a person's decision to work PT. This article considers the impact of health on the work decision of people aged 50 and over in the UK and Ireland. Methodological issues are discussed and the impact of unobserved individual effects is estimated using the Mundlak (1978) estimator applied to the multinomial probit model. We find that health problems increase the probability of retirement for this age group in both countries. In Britain, those with health problems are less likely to work full time and more likely to work PT, however in Ireland, health problems appear to have no effect on the probability of PT work.

We use an applied general equilibrium model with a set of scenarios showing an improvement in tax compliance rates and its effects on productive sectors and households. Enhancing the tax compliance moves the effective Value-Added Tax (VAT) rates closer to the nominal rates. A revenue neutral assumption is applied in some scenarios where social contributions rates are lowered. There is also other scenario where the VAT rates increase is complemented with a lump-sum transfer and other scenario with a non-revenue-neutral rule. The results show that the drop in tax evasion would affect positively the main macroeconomic variables. For example, with the revenue neutral rule and a fall in evasion in the most fraudulent productive sectors, an increase in 1.4 percentage points in effective VAT rates would raise GDP by 1.33%, employment by 1.57%, real wages and rents by 0.76% and 0.06%, respectively, VAT revenue around 20%, and national welfare by 0.48%.

In many situations, estimation of price elasticities of demand may be impossible due to difficulties in defining demand or missing data on sales. However, even without information on price elasticities, in certain situations it is possible to test for the static noncooperative Nash-Bertrand equilibrium, which in the case of rejection, may be important screening information for antitrust authorities. The static noncooperative Nash-Bertrand equilibrium may be rejected when demand is linear and in the estimation of best-response functions, the coefficients on the competitors' prices are statistically greater than 0.5. The application of this method is illustrated by the example of German mobile telephony using monthly data between January 1998 and December 2002. According to the estimation results, the observed prices in the segment of low-users cannot be the outcome of a static noncooperative Nash-Bertrand equilibrium.","Competit Commiss, London WC1B 4AD, England",,"Grzybowski, L (通讯作者)，Competit Commiss, Victoria House, London WC1B 4AD, England.",lukasz@mushroomski.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper applies the mechanism to the analysis of a contraction and convergence type climate policy focusing on China. The mechanism of international technology diffusion leads to an increase in China's energy productivity an a decline in China's economic growth rates in a convergence process. In this case, inter-regional emissions trading could (more than) compensate China's welfare losses due to climate policy. Otherwise, China's welfare losses due to climate policy could be significant.

Emerging markets accounted for 20-43% of global exports during the period 1970-2005, and held 70% of global foreign reserves in recent years. More than 50% of the exports from the Euro area, Japan and the United States go to emerging markets and other developing countries. The globalization of capital flows is facilitated by technological innovations and excellent information networks, coupled with sharp increases in savings that are directed into financial instruments across borders. The use of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) as a benchmark in exchange rate policy reforms assumes the existence of a stable relationship between the exchange rate and the ratio of price levels in two countries. This article investigates whether or not long-run PPP holds in emerging markets. Johansen's cointegration technique is used with annual data in analysing the relationship between exchange rates and the CPI during the period 1951-2005. We found overwhelming support for long-run PPP in emerging markets, thus, PPP is a reliable guide for exchange rate determination and exchange rate policy reforms in these countries.","RiverSource Life Insurance Co, Ameriprise Financial Serv Inc, Falls Church, VA USA",,"Kargbo, JM (通讯作者)，RiverSource Life Insurance Co, Ameriprise Financial Serv Inc, Falls Church, VA USA.",jkargbo@infionline.net,,,,,,,88,3,3,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In addition to reducing individual income, it also creates nonpecuniary and psychological costs. We quantify these nonpecuniary losses by using the life satisfaction approach. In contrast to previous studies, we apply Friedman's (1957) permanent income hypothesis by distinguishing between temporary and permanent effects of income changes. This allows us to account for intertemporal spillovers of income compensations. Our results show that the nonpecuniary costs of unemployment are only half as large compared to a standard estimation without this distinction. Nevertheless, the nonpecuniary costs of unemployment calculated with this modified quantification method are still about two times higher than its pecuniary costs. This confirms the high value of work for life satisfaction.","[Knabe, Andreas] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Raetzel, Steffen] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Fac Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Otto von Guericke University,"Knabe, A (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",Andreas.Knabe@fu-berlin.de,,"Knabe, Andreas/0000-0003-1298-0416",,,,,30,34,37,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Results from panel econometric applications of the Krugman model yield low levels of real exchange rate undervaluation in the GCC countries, although indicating persistence of undervaluation - albeit statistically low - into the medium term. They also show that the recent real exchange rate undervaluation could be characterized as due to 'short-run frictions and adjustment costs' associated with continued depreciation of the US dollar to which GCC countries' currencies are pegged. Further, failure to find supporting evidence for the Marshall-Lerner condition underscores the propriety of using fiscal policy rather than exchange rate policy to address recent inflationary pressures and help resolve lingering global financial imbalances.","IMF, Middle E & Cent Asia Dept, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kumah, FY (通讯作者)，IMF, Middle E & Cent Asia Dept, Washington, DC USA.",fkumah@imf.org,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper examines eight East Asian economies, employing a Bayesian dynamic factor model that allows the decomposition of aggregate shocks into country-specific, regional and world common business cycles. It therefore allows the identification of causes for major events experienced by these countries. Empirical evidences show that country-specific factors are the most important in determining the major events for all the countries examined here, implying the need for each country to rely more heavily on its own independent counter-cyclical policies. Although the regional factor plays a less important role than the country-specific factor, it accounts for a sizeable share in the output fluctuation of the region. The regional factor is most prevalent for Singapore, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, indicating that a regional coordinated policy is rather more effective for these economies to respond to disturbances. The world factor explains only around 7% of the output variation in East Asia, which might explain why the East Asian economies are relatively insulated from the recent global financial crisis.","Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Selangor, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Lee, GHY (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Selangor, Malaysia.",grace.lee@buseco.monash.edu.my,,"Lee, Grace HY/0000-0002-5989-6513",,,,,28,0,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This has a negative impact on the balanced development in the European Union. It affects also the level of global EU performance and competitiveness in the world economy because the competitiveness is highly related with the imbalance development in economic, social and territorial cohesion. Support of coherent and balanced development of EU countries and regions represents, together with the increasing competitiveness of the European territory, two main development objectives of the EU which are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary. Development of the Central European countries in the Visegrad Group (Czech, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) after the accession to the EU was affected by the objectives of the EU Lisbon Strategy and particular after 2010 by new growth concept of Strategy Europe 2020. The objective of paper is to analyze the cohesion of the European Union on the example of the Visegrad Four (V4) countries. Theoretical background of the paper sets out the methodological concept of cohesion in the EU and is further focused on the possibility of its evaluation at national level. The empirical part of the paper deals with multi-criteria evaluation of cohesion in the V4 countries by selected EU Structural indicators and indicators of Strategy Europe 2020, which appropriately reflect the level of economic, social and territorial cohesion. The analysis of selected indicators of national disparities in the V4 countries uses selected scaling and statistical methods, especially the traffic light method and point method. On the basis of the point method application in a final part of the paper, the cross country comparison of scores for all selected indicators in examined countries is surveyed and all scores are summarized in a given time. This approach can determine the overall level of disparities between V4 countries and to provide assessment of achieved level of their development potential.","[Melecky, Lukas; Skokan, Karel] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,lukas.melecky@vsb.cz; karel.skokan@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015","Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400",,,,,12,13,13,0,11,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,314,326,,,,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200035,0

In the presence of social learning, we should see different box-office sales dynamics depending on whether opening weekend demand is higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature of the movie industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the number of screens dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week 1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality, further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting for 32% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This implies the existence of a large social multiplier such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand.","[Moretti, Enrico] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Moretti, Enrico] NBER, Cambridge, MA USA; [Moretti, Enrico] CEPR, London, England; [Moretti, Enrico] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Moretti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,21,172,222,4,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

By applying Johansen-Juselius (J-J) cointegration analysis, we find evidence of single common stochastic trend, to which spot and futures prices move together in a long-run equilibrium path. The vector error correction model (VECM) and Granger causality test find that there is unidirectional causality running from futures to spot market. To examine the volatility spillovers between the markets, this study has used bivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) (1, 1) model with Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (BEKK) parameterization and finds evidence of bidirectional volatility spillovers between spot and futures markets. However, there is pronounced spillover effect of a previous shock and volatility from the futures market to spot market. Hence, we conclude that Nifty futures prices lead spot prices and futures market largely contributes to price discovery. These findings have significant implications for traders in implementing hedging and arbitrage trading strategies, for portfolio managers in managing risk and also for policymakers in assessing market stability.","[Pati, Pratap Chandra] PGP, Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad 500032, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Rajib, Prabina] Indian Inst Technol, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian School of Business (ISB); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Pati, PC (通讯作者)，PGP, Indian Sch Business, Hyderabad 500032, Andhra Pradesh, India.",pratap_pati@isb.edu,"Pati, Pratap Chandra/ABA-1379-2020","Pati, Pratap Chandra/0000-0001-6066-5889",,,,,28,24,24,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

I study a model of sequential learning in which the decision maker infers unknown properties of an object from information about other objects. The decision maker may use the following heuristics: divide objects into categories with similar properties and predict that a member of a category has a property if some other member of this category has this property. The environment is symmetric: the decision maker has no reason to believe that the objects and properties are a priori different. In symmetric environments, categorization is an optimal solution to an inductive inference problem. Any optimal solution looks as if the decision maker categorizes. Various experimental observations about similarity-based reasoning coincide with the optimal behavior in my model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In order to do this, we employ an augmented gravity model and use a panel data set covering bilateral trade and FDI between Vietnam and its 17 most important partner countries, over the period 1990-2008. Firstly, we find that WTO accession has a significantly positive effect both on Vietnam's imports and on inward FDI. Secondly, even though we find no evidence to demonstrate convincingly that WTO accession influences Vietnam's exports, this accession seems to indirectly encourage Vietnam's exports through the FDI channel due to a strong connection between these two.","Univ Rouen, CARE EMR, Fac Laws Econ & Management, F-76186 Rouen 1, France",Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Hanh, PTH (通讯作者)，Univ Rouen, CARE EMR, Fac Laws Econ & Management, 3 Ave Pasteur, F-76186 Rouen 1, France.",thihonghanh.pham@univ-rouen.fr,,,,,,,24,6,6,4,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Motivated by a model of conditional demand, I consider the extent to which a temporary shock that increases an individual's donation to one cause by a particular amount displaces her gifts to other charitable causes. I use the 2001-2007 waves of the PSID/COPPS, the first data set of its kind, to identify this. Households that give more to one type of charity tend to give more to others. However, many of the correlations between the residuals after fixed-effects regressions are negative and significant, particularly for larger donors and for certain categories of charitable giving. Given plausible econometric assumptions, the negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution. Overall, these results suggest heterogeneous motivations for giving: small givers may be mainly driven by temporary shocks and personal appeals while larger givers may have concave multi-charity warm-glow preferences.pcv","Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Reinstein, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",daaronr@gmail.com,"Reinstein, David/AAD-2454-2020",,,,,,46,30,30,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Namely, a common stochastic trend in neutral and investment-specific productivity. We document that in U.S. postwar quarterly data total factor productivity (TFP) and the relative price of investment are cointegrated. We show theoretically that TFP and the relative price of investment are cointegrated if and only if neutral and investment-specific productivity share a common stochastic trend. We econometrically estimate an RBC model augmented with a number of real rigidities and driven by a multitude of shocks. We find that in the context of our estimated model, innovations in the common stochastic trend explain a sizable fraction of the unconditional variances of output, consumption, investment, and hours.

We consider the extent to which the impacts of oil price shocks depend upon the economy's internal production structure and its access to the world financial market, and find that the long-run impact depends much more on the former than the latter. Two critical quantities summarizing the long-run effects are (i) the relative share of oil to labor in output and (ii) the elasticity of substitution in production. We supplement the formal analysis with numerical simulations, thereby enabling us to characterize the short-run dynamics. Overall, the simulations can replicate much of the empirical evidence used to characterize the effects of the recent oil price increases on the economy. They also highlight the sensitivity of the effect of the oil price to the elasticity of substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It works based on table adjustments to trace the effects of any initial price shock through an iteration process. It has the same accuracy and all the capabilities of the popular Standard Leontief Price (SLP) model. A distinct advantage of the new approach compared with the SLP model, however, is its ability to measure the impact of the initial price shock on all value-added components if and when it is required. This capability enables researchers to use interindustry price analysis to tackle problems of a more real-world nature. Other advantages of this approach are its simple computational implementation, especially relevant for larger size interindustry tables, the unified way to deal with all kind of different price issues, and the yielding of an adjusted interindustry table reflecting all endogenous price adjustments in response to the initial price shock.

Yet fiscal policy underwent dramatic shifts in the 1970s and economic theory makes clear that in an environment of uncertainty about future fiscal policy, monetary policy instruments may lose potency or have perverse effects. This paper documents the vagaries of fiscal policy in this period and argues that people at the time must have been uncertain about fiscal policy's future course. It also lays out a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of fiscal uncertainties on monetary policy and shows that fiscal variables have predictive value in dynamic models, even if traditional monetary policy indicators are included in the system.

The data indicate that changes in the number of buyers in the market have no significant effect on exclusion rates but the likelihood of inefficient exclusion is decreased both when a larger fraction of signed buyers are needed to deter a rival's entry and when buyers engage in non-binding communication. These results have antitrust implications both in terms of helping to identify at-risk market characteristics and suggesting potential competition-enhancing strategies. A subgame of the experiment where buyers make signing decisions can be illustrated as a coordination game with the unique feature that payoffs are affected by a separate but interested party (the incumbent seller). I find that the height of the potential function and relevant basin of attraction, especially when combined with quantal response estimation, have larger predictive power in this sub-game than several other equilibrium selection criteria.

We ask whether those differences are related to disadvantageous locational conditions in East Germany or could be found in the characteristics of the people living there. This article analyses income adjustment of East-West migrants based on the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), 1990-2008. Because migrants earned their income in both East and West Germany, the effect of the location can be identified.

The form of expansion chosen in this process has an impact on the pace and volume of the funds needed for it. Other items are incorporated to observe different behaviour among hotel companies in relation with their indebtedness process. Among analysed factors, we can observe the importance of solvency, liquidity, and asset structure. The hotel industry's means to explain individual indebtedness is also relevant, demonstrating the fact that firms usually follow the sector's benchmark when determining the level of indebtedness.

However, these formulas were derived under the assumption of a normal distribution. Thus, the capital requirement estimated by the Basel formula may be incorrect when the asset distributions are not normal. Using an analysis of qualifying revolving retail exposures as an example, this paper introduces a formula based on the Extreme Value Theory to calculate the capital requirement. This formula is more general and accurate than its predecessors, because it can be used with any type of distribution. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the capital requirement estimated by the Basel formula is less than by our formula when the asset distribution has a heavy tail, and more than by our formula when the distribution has a short tail. Our formula is also more sensitive to risk than competing models in the context of the recent financial crisis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One of these companies was characterized as carrying out most of its activities in accordance with the principles of the business cluster. Other one had only a few features of a cluster. The third one was identified as conforming to the corporate development principles, but is willing to join the cluster networks, and the last company, was found, is utterly autonomous and operates on the basis of the corporate development model in the market. The research was oriented to explore the clustering phenomenon in the Lithuanian grain sector. In this paper the potential clustering resources were investigated and possible elements and specific features of the cluster phenomenon were identified. For achievement of this task, Structured Interview, designed for the investigation of the clustering phenomenon and its features; and Dialectic & Phenomenological Hermeneutic methods, selected for scientific interpretation of the provided answers, were used. Facts found by this research, leads to the understanding that clustering can become the transitory activity of group of companies, which leads to the reinforcement of companies positions in the market up to the time when companies will be able to act independently.

First, when there is a nearby deadline, optimistic players delay the agreement to the last period before the deadline, replicating a broad empirical regularity known as the deadline effect. Second, there cannot be a substantial delay under persistent optimism; i.e., excessive optimism alone cannot explain delays. Third, when optimistic players are expected to learn during the negotiation, they delay the agreement in order to persuade their opponents.

J,"Acosta, P",,,,"Acosta, Pablo",,,Promotion dynamics the Peter Principle: Incumbents vs. external hires,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Promotions; Internal-external hires; Job mobility,RECRUITMENT; PERFORMANCE; FIRM; WAGE,"The Peter Principle (Peter and Hull, 1969; Fairburn and Malcomson, 2001; Lazear, 2004) suggests that individuals are promoted to their level of incompetence. A corollary of the Peter Principle prediction is that external hires should have an advantage when competing with incumbents for a higher position. Using five years of personnel records from a single large U.S. corporation, this paper contributes to the literature on internal labor markets and intra-firm job mobility by testing this prediction for career advancement. Results support the idea of differences in promotion dynamics among incumbents and external hires, since past career advancement within the firm result in a lower probability of subsequent promotion, even after controlling for workers' heterogeneity and tenure on the current job. The advantage for external hires does not hold once other job changes (lateral transfers, task reorganizations) are considered, highlighting that promotions are a very different job placement mechanism than transfers.

Our results, based on state soft drink sales and excise tax information between 1989 and 2006 and the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey, suggest that soft drink taxation, as currently practiced in the United States, leads to a moderate reduction in soft drink consumption by children and adolescents.

I demonstrated that with a number of different, plausible non-neoclassical hypotheses on technology we can dispense with the process of creative destruction and the steady-state growth rate. We modified the technological hypotheses including in the Aghion-Howitt type model with heterogeneous goods, used as means of production of other goods, the concave trend of the techniques envelope (1992; 1997; 1998) in a significant part, and considered increasing returns in the Cobb-Douglas functions proposed by the authors (1992; 1998), so as to have a positive relation between wage and labour (for the 1992 and 1998 versions) and between rate of interest and capital (for the 1998 version). As a result we found that with these non-neoclassical hypotheses on the technology, which appear in principle hard to rule out, process of creative destruction and positive steady-state growth rate do not exist. The intention here is in fact to demonstrate that the widely acclaimed endogenous growth models like the Aghion-Howitt model are liable to the above criticisms, given that the results turn out very differently with the introduction of non-neoclassical hypotheses. Such hypotheses must therefore be taken into due consideration when studying these models in terms of their implications for theory and policy.",,,,giulio.guarini@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

However, competition on all goods can simultaneously be dampened when market-share contracts are feasible.

But twice during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the commercial paper market nearly dried up and ceased being perceived as a safe haven. Major interventions by the Federal Reserve, including large outright purchases of commercial paper, were eventually used to support both issuers of and investors in commercial paper. We will offer an analysis of the commercial paper market during the financial crisis. First, we describe the institutional background of the commercial paper market. Second, we analyze the supply and demand sides of the market. Third, we examine the most important developments during the crisis of 2007-2009. Last, we discuss three explanations of the decline in the commercial paper market: substitution to alternative sources of financing by commercial paper issuers, adverse selection, and institutional constraints among money market funds.","[Kacperczyk, Marcin; Schnabl, Philipp] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Kacperczyk, M (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA.",mkacperc@stern.nyu.edu; schnabl@stern.nyu.edu,"Kacperczyk, Marcin/AGG-9764-2022",,,,,,27,129,146,1,29,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We extend the gender-gap model of Galor and Weil (Am Econ Rev 86(3):374-387, 1996) by adding a third use of time, non-market work, into household time allocation. Our model can explain the joint evolution of production structure, household time allocation, and fertility broadly observed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the Western world as part of a single process of economic development: (i) production shifted out of households and into the market, (ii) there was first an increase in the supply of male labor to the market, followed by an increase in the female labor supply; married-female participation in paid work outside the home dramatically increased in the latter half of the twentieth century, and (iii) there has been a two-century long secular decline in fertility, interrupted by a temporary rise in the mid-twentieth century (a baby boom).

Of particular concern to these observers are that credit default swaps trade in the largely unregulated over-the-counter market as bilateral contracts involving counterparty risk and that they facilitate speculation involving negative views of a firm's financial strength. Some observers have suggested that credit default swaps would not have made the crisis worse had they traded on exchanges. I conclude that credit default swaps did not cause the dramatic events of the credit crisis, that the over-the-counter credit default swaps market worked well during much of the crisis, and that exchange trading has both advantages and costs compared to over-the-counter trading. Though I argue that eliminating over-the-counter trading of credit default swaps could reduce social welfare, I also recognize that much research is needed to understand better and to quantify the social gains and costs of derivatives in general and credit default swaps in particular.","[Stulz, Rene M.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Stulz, Rene M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Stulz, RM (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",stulz@cob.osu.edu,,"Stulz, Rene/0000-0003-2956-4806",,,,,23,195,229,4,56,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This paper examines U.S. electricity distribution utilities in the years 1993-1999, several of which were subject to incentive regulation. Controlling for other possible influences, including possible endogeneity of the regulatory regime, the data and model indicate that incentive regulation is indeed associated with significantly longer duration of service outages, although not necessarily more frequent outages. Importantly, this quality reduction is offset in cases where regulation incorporates service quality standards. We also examine the causal chain connecting incentive regulation, cost expenditures, and service quality. We conclude that careful design of quality standards can allow incentive regulation to achieve cost savings without quality degradation.","[Kwoka, John] Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ter-Martirosyan, Anna] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Northeastern University; International Monetary Fund,"Kwoka, J (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",j.kwoka@neu.edu,,,,,,,36,34,41,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Prior theory has shown that the effect of information transparency is ambiguous. Our study is based on two insights. Where signal space is finite, increased transparency usually destroys uniqueness of equilibria; and increasing transparency can reverse the risk-dominance ordering of equilibria. Our experiments show that increasing transparency improves coordination only when transparency makes the efficient equilibrium risk dominant. Coordination is degraded when increased transparency causes the secure equilibrium to be risk dominant. These results are consistent with subjects holding level-1 beliefs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We focus on Italy, which, based on cross-country comparisons, stands out as the country with the highest markups in nonmanufacturing industries among the OECD countries. We propose a two-region (Italy and the rest of the euro area) dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model where we introduce nontradable goods as a proxy for services and we allow for monopolistic competition in labor, manufacturing, and services markets. We then use the model to simulate the macroeconomic and spillover effects of increasing the degree of competition in the Italian services sector. According to the results, reducing the markups in services to the levels prevailing in the rest of the euro area induces in the long run an increase in Italian GDP equal to 11% and an increase in welfare (measured in terms of steady state consumption equivalents) of about 3.5%. Half of the GDP increase would be realized in the first three years. The spillover effects to the rest of the euro area are limited: consumption, investment, and GDP increases are relatively small.","[Forni, L.; Gerali, A.; Pisani, M.] Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Gerali, A (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",lorenzo.forni@bancaditalia.it; andrea.gerali@bancaditalia.it; massimiliano.pisani@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,26,28,29,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Evidence from Africa,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; Income growth; Poverty reduction; Policy; African economies,INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; BASIC NEEDS; FULFILLMENT; ABSOLUTE,"Examined in the present study is the extent to which inequality influences the effectiveness of income growth in poverty reduction, based on 1990s data for a sample of African economies. An analysis-of-covariance model is derived and estimated, with the headcount, gap, and squared gap poverty ratios serving as the respective dependent variables, and the Gini coefficient and PPP-adjusted income as explanatory variables. The study finds that the responsiveness of poverty to income is a decreasing function of inequality. The results imply a large variation across African countries in the amount of growth required to meet a unit of poverty reduction, as in the case of the MDG1, depending on the level of inequality. For efficient policymaking, therefore, a country-specific strategy with varying emphases on inequality relative to growth is warranted. (c) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling.

This mechanism allows parties to trade off their voting power across issues and extract gains from differences in the intensities of their preferences. The appealing properties of such a mechanism may be negated by strategic interactions among individuals. We test its properties using controlled laboratory experiments. We observe that equilibrium play increases over time and truthful/honest play decreases over time. The subjects almost reach the welfare predicted by the theory even when their behaviour is far from equilibrium. The fact that deviations from equilibrium do not do much damage to its welfare properties is a further argument in favour of the use of this mechanism in the real world. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This may happen if older and younger workers are substitutes. Nowadays policies are aimed at increasing employment of older people to counter the economic consequences of an aging population. Opponents of such policies argue that these will adversely affect youth employment. This paper revisits the nexus between employment of older and younger workers, if only to put any concerns for adverse effects of later retirement on youth employment to rest. To empirically investigate this issue we estimate a dynamic model of employment of the young, prime age and old people using panel data of 22 OECD countries over the time period 1960-2008. Our empirical analysis does not support the hypothesis that employment of the young and old are substitutes and finds some minor complementarities. This suggests that encouraging later retirement will have no adverse effect on youth employment.","[Kapteyn, Arie] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [de Vos, Klaas] Tilburg Univ, CentERdata, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",RAND Corporation; Tilburg University,"Kalwij, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.s.kalwij@uu.nl,,,,,,,24,27,35,3,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,NOV,2010,158.0,4,,,,,341,359,,10.1007/s10645-010-9148-z,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,667CV,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283171100001,0

We also introduce an extension to the linear ARMA model which allows the initial convergence in the long run to be different from that implied by the conventional ARMA model. This is particularly important for unit root tests, which are actually tests of a composite of two independent hypotheses. We fit to a variety of statistics including most of those considered by previous investigators. We use a sample drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and focus on white males with a high-school degree.

Using a unique panel dataset on firm hierarchies of large US firms (1986-1999) and a quasi-natural experiment (trade liberalization), we find that competition leads firms to flatten their hierarchies: firms reduce the number of positions between the CEO and division managers, and firms increase the number of positions reporting directly to the CEO. The results illustrate how firms redesign their organizational structure through a set of complementary choices in response to changes in their environment.

By doing so, these poorer students complement the weaknesses of the richer students through peer effects and receive financial aid in return.

In every period, the policy maker makes a non-binding inflation announcement before setting the actual inflation rate. It updates its decisions using individual evolutionary learning. The private agents can choose between two different forecasting strategies: They can either set their forecast equal to the announcement or use an adaptive learning scheme to (potentially) forecast the true inflation. They switch between these two strategies as a function of information about the associated payoffs they obtain through word-of-mouth, choosing always the currently most favorable one. While all agents using the first strategy make the same forecast, those using the second strategy may generate different individual forecasts. In spite of the complexity of the environment, the boundedly rational policy maker learns to sustain a situation with a positive but fluctuating fraction of believers. This outcome is Pareto superior to the outcome predicted by standard theory. Interestingly enough, the actions taken by the policy maker undergo marked qualitative changes as a function of the prevailing heterogeneity among and learning characteristics of the private agents.

This evolution sheds a new light on the old debate between the Beckerian model of fertility and the synthesis model of fertility. In this paper, I propose a fertility model making the evolution of culture endogenous. The whole population is divided into two cultures corresponding to specific preferences for fertility. Parents decide their fertility rate and try to transmit their culture to their children. Differential fertility between cultures gives rise to an evolutionary process while differential effort to transmit the parental culture gives rise to a cultural process. The long-run distribution of preferences and the average total fertility rate both result from interactions between these processes. As a result, a fertility transition cannot appear without productivity shocks in favor of the culture that is not biased toward quantity of children. However, asymmetric productivity shocks are not always sufficient to cause a fertility transition.",,,"Baudin, T (通讯作者)，Bur B 117, Voie du Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",thomas.baudin@uclouvain.be,"Baudin, Thierry/A-1046-2011","Baudin, Thierry/0000-0002-6765-360X",,,,,41,20,20,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The persistence of the effect of shocks on the time-varying correlations is strongest for foreign exchange and stock markets, indicating a tendency toward contagion.

Finally, using a pool model, we investigate the impact of euro area, US, and CEEC-3 news on the correlations.

The model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods. For a system of bilateral prices non-congestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart. Hence, the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under non-congestion and a bivariate price process under congestion. At the same time, it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory, and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegrated. Analysis of Nord Pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under non-congestion, the prices are not, in general, fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state. Hence, in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism. Finally, the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These were deep recessions, comparable to that of 2008-9, but the recoveries were very different. In the UK the recovery of the 1920s was incomplete, but that of the 1930s was rather less protracted than in the US. By contrast the US experienced very strong recovery in the 1920s but weaker recovery from the much deeper recession of the 1930s. A key ingredient to understanding these patterns is the interaction between economic shocks and labour-market institutions. Here we survey the large literature on interwar labour markets to identify the key elements that underpinned labour-market performance. We find that developments in wage-setting institutions and in unemployment insurance inhibited a return to full employment in interwar Britain, while, in the US, New Deal legislation impeded labour-market adjustment in the 1930s. We conclude with an assessment of the policy responses to labour-market crises in the past and in the present.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Thomas, Mark] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Essex; Australian National University; University of Virginia,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",hatton@essex.ac.uk; mt4w@virginia.edu,,"Thomas, Mark/0000-0002-1790-2495",,,,,91,13,13,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

A group of players who are dissatisfied with the play of their current partners can join together and play a new equilibrium. This imposes new refinements on equilibrium play in games, and we show how play depends on the relative populations of players in different roles, among other things. We also introduce finitely repeated social games where players may choose to rematch in any period. Some equilibria of fixed-player finitely repeated games cannot be sustained as equilibria in a finitely repeated social game. Conversely, the set of repeated matching equilibria includes some plays that are not part of any subgame perfect equilibrium of the corresponding fixed-player repeated games. We explore existence of finitely repeated matching equilibria, the relationship to renegotiation-proof equilibrium, and show how new predictions are made in trust and centipede games.

I explore three phenomena made possible by utility from anticipation, and prove that if the decisionmaker's behavior is distinguishable from a person's who cares only about physical outcomes, she must exhibit at least one of these phenomena. First, the decisionmaker can be prone to self-fulfilling expectations. Second, she might be time-inconsistent even if her preferences in all periods are identical. Third, she might exhibit informational preferences, where these preferences are intimately connected to her attitudes toward disappointments.

In most cases, the criteria on the basis of which scarce funds are to be allocated are imprecisely specified, leaving agents with considerable discretionary power. This paper reports results from an experiment that explores the manner in which such power is exercised. Using a sample of public servants working in education, health, child care, and nutrition programs in Colombia, and a sample of potential and actual beneficiaries of such programs, we attempt to identify the set of recipient attributes that induce the most generous responses from officials. This is done using a design we call the distributive dictator game, which requires officials to rank recipients, with the understanding that a higher ranking corresponds to an increased likelihood of getting a voucher convertible into cash. We find that women (especially widows), individuals with many minor dependents, and refugees from political violence are generally favored. We also find significant interaction effects between ranker and recipient attributes, with rankings varying systematically by ranker age and gender.","[Cardenas, Juan Camilo] Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Sethi, Rajiv] Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Columbia University,"Cardenas, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia.",jc-carden@uniandes.edu.co; rs328@columbia.edu,"Sethi, Rajiv/AAH-3961-2020; cardenas, juan-camilo/B-4658-2009","cardenas, juan-camilo/0000-0003-0005-7595; Sethi, Rajiv/0000-0003-2631-5644",,,,,33,1,1,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In particular, we compare the welfare function conditional on the presence and age of children and assess how recent reforms of in-kind childcare transfers affect the welfare function. Our analysis is based on a discrete model of optimal taxation. We apply this framework using microsimulation and microeconometric techniques. In general, we find that marginal welfare weights are relatively high for non-working single women. Further, we show that the reform of in-kind childcare transfers is only optimal if society increases the marginal welfare weights for the working single women.","[Haan, Peter; Wrohlich, Katharina] DIW Berlin, FU Berlin, IZA Bonn, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Haan, P (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, FU Berlin, IZA Bonn, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",phaan@diw.de,,,,,,,19,6,8,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

In this paper, we analyze how the size of the choice set influences which alternative is selected. We present both laboratory experiments and field data that suggest larger choice sets induce a stronger preference for simple, easy-to-understand options. The first experiment demonstrates that, in seeming violation of the weak axiom of revealed preference, subjects are more likely to select a given sure bet over non-degenerate gambles when choosing from a set of 11 options than when choosing from a subset of 3. The second experiment clarifies that large choice sets induce a preference for simpler, rather than less risky, options. Lastly, using records of more than 500,000 employees from 638 institutions, we demonstrate that the presence of more funds in an individual's 401(k) plan is associated with a greater allocation to money market and bond funds at the expense of equity funds.

We examine whether the success of this solicitation ordering in part can be attributed to the fact that it enables individuals to select organizations that have a high-status donor base. Assuming that individuals prefer to associate with individuals of higher social ranking we use a simple linear model to show that both aggregate donations and earnings are larger when high-status donors are solicited first. We investigate the predicted comparative statics using the experimental laboratory. Inducing a status differential we reverse the contribution ordering between participants of high and low status. Consistent with current fundraising practice, we find that low-status followers are likely to mimic donations by high-status leaders and this encourages high-status leaders to give. Donations are therefore larger when individuals of high status give before rather than after those of low status.","[Kumru, Cagri S.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Vesterlund, Lise] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Kumru, CS (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",cs.kumru@unsw.edu.au; vester@pitt.edu,,"Kumru, Cagri/0000-0002-7158-6243",,,,,44,79,96,0,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The present paper develops a simple three-passenger-type model to examine the passenger's decision of whether to pass through the green or red channel, as well as to derive the optimal inspection policy for a revenue-maximizing customs authority. The analysis reveals that if net revenue collection when inducing truthful declaration is positive, it is never optimal for the customs authority to provide incentives for passing through the green channel, although it may be optimal to provide incentives for cheating at the red channel. However, if the penalty for evasion is large enough to wipe out passengers' income, providing incentives for passing through the green channel may be the optimal policy.","COM Acad Studies, IL-75190 Tel Aviv, Israel",College of Management Academic Studies,"Yaniv, G (通讯作者)，COM Acad Studies, 7 Yitzhak Rabin Ave, IL-75190 Tel Aviv, Israel.",gidyan@colman.ac.il,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Using a newly released data set we estimate a multinomial logit duration model including different measures capturing the economic incentives embedded in the social security system. Our results show that social security incentives determine individual retirement decisions.

In these models, production exhibits constant returns to scale, households maximize expected discounted utility, and firms rent capital and labor from households to maximize period by period profits. This paper considers the case in which infinitely lived firms, rather than households, make the intertemporal investment decisions. Under this assumption, it shows that there exists an objective function for firms that results in the same equilibrium allocation as in the standard setting with one period lived firms. The objective requires that firms maximize their asset value, which is defined as the discounted value of future cash flows using present value processes that do not allow for arbitrage opportunities.

For highly persistent processes, the methods require a large number of discrete values for the state variables to produce close approximations which leads to an undesirable reduction in computational speed, especially in a multivariate case. This paper proposes an alternative method of discretizing multivariate autoregressive processes. This method can be treated as an extension of Rouwenhorst's (1995) method which, according to our finding, outperforms the existing methods in the scalar case for highly persistent processes. The new method works well as an approximation that is much more robust to the number of discrete values for a wide range of the parameter space. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Incentives stemming from differences in pension wealth accrual patterns between DB and DC plans directly induce up to a one-year difference in expected retirement age and are indirectly responsible for up to a two-year difference due to workers sorting into plans based on preferences over career length. The results imply that failing to account for worker sorting leads to an overestimation of the transition's effect on the average retirement age of Americans.

We show also that these empirical limitations can be overcome by replacing real wage rigidities with nominal wage rigidities, without sacrificing other appealing features of the model.

In an additional real-effort laboratory experiment we show that explicit cost and surplus information that enables an exact calculation of an employer's surplus from the work contract is a crucial prerequisite for a positive wage-effort relation.

There is delay in equilibrium, and the seller slowly screens out buyers with higher valuations. The seller payoff equals what he can achieve by simply awaiting an arrival. In applications, when buyer valuations fall, average prices drop and delay increases.

First, we found that among 20 high external debt countries, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth rates, indicating that excessive debt is detrimental to the growth of an economy. Second, we introduced the simultaneous GMM equations between financial sector development and economic growth to evaluate the interaction effects among economic growth, external debt, and financial sector development. In empirical results, we find that the negative impact of high debt on growth appears to operate through a strong negative effect, in terms of compulsion to resort to financially repressive policies.

The empirical findings indicate that economies in both regions increasingly agglomerated in large cities; the marginal products of domestic capital and labor in the western region were, respectively, two-thirds and half of those in the eastern region; FDI was more productive than domestic capital. Spatial econometric analysis reveals that the central cities in Western China had mild spread effects on each other and backwash effects on the nearby rural counties and, in contrast, the central cities in the eastern region competed with each other and had backwash effects on nearby rural counties but spread effects on neighboring county-level cities.

We study the profit and welfare effects of reducing program duplication, against the background of a funding system reform in Flanders (Belgium). We find that dropping duplicated programs at individual institutions tends to be socially undesirable, due to the students' low willingness to travel to other institutions and to the limited fixed cost and variable cost savings. Furthermore, we find that the financial incentives offered to drop programs may be very ineffective, leading to both undesirable reform and undesirable status quo. These findings emphasize the complexities in regulating product diversity in higher education, and serve as a word of caution towards the various decentralized financial incentive schemes that have recently been introduced.

This is manifest in particular in areas of intertemporal choice, like personal finance and health-related behavior. Policy makers can develop policies that help citizens to make choices that are more in line with their normative preferences. In this paper we summarize the behavioral evidence, discuss the motivations for interventions, and show how recent behavioral insights can help to improve upon existing policies. These new policies could be described as libertarian paternalism, and include setting defaults thoughtfully and using unorthodox commitment mechanisms.","[Kooreman, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Prast, Henriette] Sci Council Govt Policy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Prast, Henriette] Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Kooreman, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.kooreman@uvt.nl,,,,,,,63,24,29,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2010,158.0,2,,,,,101,122,,10.1007/s10645-010-9141-6,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,627VW,,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280072800001,0

This paper adds to the accumulating evidence that network formation and network integration are no panacea: similarly to the much-researched and analysed phenomena of market failure or government ( state) failure, there is such thing as network failure. Combining theoretical arguments with Hungarian fieldwork experience originating from the author's past investigations, cases of network failure and network misalignment both within the innovation system and within producer networks are examined. Another focus of this paper is institutional and policy (mis) alignment, i.e. the question, how the institutional set-up facilitates or works against achieving developmental goals in Hungary.

The government, in addition to investing in infrastructure, spends on health services, which in turn raise labor productivity and lower the rate of time preference. Infrastructure affects the production of both commodities and health services. As a result of network effects, the degree of efficiency of infrastructure is nonlinearly related to the stock of public capital itself. Provided that governance is adequate enough to ensure a sufficient degree of efficiency of public investment, an increase in the share of spending on infrastructure (financed by a cut in unproductive expenditure or foreign grants) may facilitate the shift from a low growth equilibrium, characterized by low productivity and low savings, to a high growth steady state.

Using these data, we compute two measures of product similarity, which allow us to investigate the determinants of strategic product differentiation in a multi-characteristics space. Our evidence is consistent with the idea that the degree of product differentiation between theatre pairs reflects a balance between strategic concerns and contractual constraints. Similarity in one dimension is offset by differentiation in others. Our results further suggest that the degree of product differentiation is negatively related to market size. Finally, we find that ownership matters: theatres under common ownership make more similar programming choices than theatres with different owners.","[Chisholm, Darlene C.] Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [McMillan, Margaret S.; Norman, George] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Suffolk University; Tufts University,"Chisholm, DC (通讯作者)，Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",darlene.chisholm@suffolk.edu,,"Norman, George/0000-0002-9888-6326",,,,,30,18,20,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This response differentiates the empirical validity of major New Keynesian explanations of business cycles. The empirical evidence, across industrial countries, highlights a moderate positive correlation between nominal wage and price flexibility in response to various demand shocks. Nonetheless, higher price flexibility moderates the effect of demand shocks on real output, while higher nominal wage flexibility increases, or does not determine, the effects of demand shocks on real output across countries. An increase in the response of the real wage to demand shocks therefore exacerbates their real effect on output, as predicted by sticky-price models. Further, demand shocks do not determine the difference in wage variability. Nominal wage variability increases, in turn, output variability across countries. In contrast, demand shocks differentiate price variability. Price variability moderates, in turn, output variability across countries.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,9,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

In its investigation, it focuses on the question of in what way the various courses of action open to the buyer are unfolded in each jurisdiction, and what individual requirements must be satisfied for the exercise of each remedy. In addition, it attempts to compare and evaluate all the relevant rules under Korean law and the PELS in light of the discipline of comparative law. It overall finds that, although the hierarchial two-tier remedial scheme adopted by the PELS appears very different from Korean law, they are not as much different as one expects, particularly when all the requirements for each remedy are examined in a comparative way. Nevertheless, there are some dissimilarities which are mostly based on the PELS' different treatment in accordance with the distinction between general commercial sales and sales involved with either a consumer or a private seller. The comparative study argues one needs to re-examine the legal nature of the seller's guarantee liability and to introduce the unified liability system into Korean law in order to overcome any unclear and complicated position in Korean law.","Soongsil Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Seoul, South Korea",Soongsil University,"Lee, BM (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,4,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of mechanism outcomes to perfect competition at the linear rate in tau, which is shown to be the fastest possible among all bargaining mechanisms. The condition requires that buyers and sellers always retain some bargaining power. The bargaining mechanisms that satisfy this condition are called nonvanishing bargaining power (NBP) mechanisms. Simple random proposer take-it-or-leave-it protocols are NBP, while k-double auctions (k-DA) are not. We find that k-DAs have equilibria that converge to perfect competition at a linear rate, converge at a slower rate or even do not converge at all. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The main result of cross-sectional regression analyses suggests that informed and educated voters prevent political parties from catering to special interests, diminishing the number of lobby registrations, the total amount of campaign contributions as well as groups' overall influence. Electoral competition is believed to exert a curvilinear effect on groups' importance within the political decision making process of each state. Another finding indicates that, in a situation of high electoral competition, voters' level of information plays a pivotal role in determining interest groups' activities. Parties seem to increasingly value median voter's concerns whenever the electorate is informed and political races are expected to be close. An environment of competitive elections and uninformed voters, in contrast, furthers interest groups' activity and strengthens their position within the political arena. This is explained by the rationale that, under such circumstances, politicians increasingly exchange narrowly targeted policies for campaign contributions in order to buy the votes of impressionable citizens.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Management, D-70457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Wegenast, T (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Management, Box D 86, D-70457 Constance, Germany.",tim.wegenast@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,73,7,8,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2010,63.0,2,,,,,271,300,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00473.x,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,581AI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276492000007,0

We attempt to quantify the contributions of better monetary policy and smaller structural shocks (including demand, supply and policy impacts) on the reduced inflation uncertainty. Empirical results in the present paper suggest that improved monetary policy accounts for only a small fraction of the reduction in inflation uncertainty from the pre-1997 period to the post-1997 period in China. The bulk of the significant moderation in inflation uncertainty arises from smaller shocks. This finding indicates that the quiescence of inflation in China over the past decade could well be followed by a return to a more turbulent inflation era. Therefore, the use of preemptive monetary policy to anchor inflationary expectations and keep moderate inflation uncertainty is warranted.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Zhangchengsi@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,6,7,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2010,18.0,3,,,,,40,55,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01195.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,597ZO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277801400003,0

Borrowing-constrained households are not able to rebalance their financial portfolio when inflation varies, and thus adjust their money holdings differently compared to unconstrained households. This heterogeneity leads to a new precautionary savings motive, which implies that inflation increases capital accumulation. We quantify the importance of this new channel in an incomplete market model where the traditional redistributive effects of inflation are also introduced. We show that this model provides a quantitative rationale for the observed hump-shaped relationship between inflation and capital accumulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It explains the velocity cycles through shocks constructed from a DSGE model and annual time series data (Ingram et al., 1994). Model velocity is stable along the balanced growth path, which features endogenous growth and decentralized banking that produces exchange credit. Positive shocks to credit productivity and money supply increase velocity, as money demand falls, while a positive goods productivity shock raises temporary output and velocity. The paper explains such velocity volatility at both business cycle and long run frequencies. With filtered velocity turning negative, starting during the 1930s and the 1987 crashes, and again around 2003, results suggest that the money and credit shocks appear to be more important for velocity during less stable times and the goods productivity shock more important during stable times.

This might provoke some changes in the policy approach to dealing with spatial disparities.","[Villaverde, Jose; Maza, Adolfo] Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Ramasamy, Bala] China Europe Int Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Universidad de Cantabria; China Europe International Business School,"Villaverde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",jose.villaverde@unican.es; adolfo.maza@unican.es; bramasamy@ceibs.edu,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,36,16,17,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,APR,2010,18.0,2,,,,,73,95,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01190.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,569WR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275634000005,0

Clearly, each invariance condition imposes a specific value judgment on polarization measurement. In inequality and poverty measurement, B. Zheng suggests rejecting these invariance conditions as axioms, and proposes replacing them with the unit-consistency axiom. This property demands that the inequality or poverty rankings, rather than their cardinal values, are not altered when income is measured in different monetary units. Following Zheng's proposal we explore the consequences of the unit-consistency axiom in the bipolarization field. We introduce a new family of Krtscha-type intermediate bipolarization indices, and also propose and characterize a class of intermediate polarization orderings which are unit-consistent. Finally, a short empirical application using data from Spain is also provided to illustrate how the bipolarization orderings proposed may be used in practice.","[Casilda Lasso de la Vega, Ma] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 4, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"de la Vega, MCL (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 4, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",casilda.lassodelavega@ehu.es,"de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/GQY-5927-2022; de la Vega, Casilda Lasso/AAA-1597-2019; de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/H-7175-2015","de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/0000-0002-4326-0457; de la Vega, Casilda Lasso/0000-0002-4326-0457; de la Vega, Casilda Maria Lasso/0000-0002-4326-0457; DIEZ SANCHEZ, MARIA HENAR/0000-0003-2752-2370; Urrutia, Ana/0000-0001-7691-5483",,,,,29,14,15,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We present a model of consumer and firm behavior in mobile markets in order to identify the role of termination charges in determining the market equilibrium. Our model predicts a waterbed effect, that is, high termination rates will be associated with low subscription prices, if preferences are the primary source of variation in termination rates. If costs are the main driver of termination rates our model predicts a tide hypothesis in which high termination rates exist alongside high subscription prices. We test these and other predictions from our model using international data on mobile subscriptions per person. We find results which are broadly consistent with our model. More specifically, we find evidence that mobile termination rates are positive and significantly related to mobile phone adoption. This result is robust to the inclusion of a variety of other structural, institutional, demographic, and income controls. We also find that competition, internet subscriptions, and a free press are positively associated with mobile phone adoption while fixed termination rates and inequality slow the adoption of mobile technologies.

Our findings suggest that since the early 1980s. cyclical movements in the U.S. economy affect other economies with a lag, rather than contemporaneously.

Demonstration of this relationship is given as a test case for the Western Danish price area of the Nord Pool's Elspot market. Impact on the average price behaviour is investigated as well as that on the distributional properties of the price. By using a non-parametric regression model to assess the effects of wind power forecasts on the average behaviour. the non-linearities and time variations in the relationship are captured well and the effects are shown to be quite substantial. Furthermore, by evaluating the distributional properties of the spot prices under different scenarios, the impact of the wind power forecasts on the price distribution is proved to be considerable. The conditional price distribution is moreover shown to be non-Gaussian. This implies that forecasting models for electricity spot prices for which parameters are estimated by a least squares techniques will not have Gaussian residuals. Hence the widespread assumption of Gaussian residuals from electricity spot price models is shown to be inadequate for these model types. The revealed effects are likely to be observable and qualitatively similar in other day-ahead electricity markets significantly penetrated by wind power. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using Samuelson's (1987) model, which is similar but allows for unobservable costs, we show that increased variance does not always imply increased information rent.

These results are largely unaffected by controlling for physical health, or (in the case of BMI) instrumenting with the BMI of biological family members. A survey of previous instrumental variables studies shows little indication of systematic biases, suggesting that OLS may provide a reasonable estimate of the causal impact of BMI on wages.","[Leigh, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Econ Program, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Kortt, Michael] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Australian National University; University of Sydney,"Leigh, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Econ Program, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",andrew.leigh@anu.edu.au,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509; Kortt, Michael/0000-0002-3556-3001",,,,,43,25,30,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The model hinges upon turnover in the productive technology-leading firm, price dispersion resultant of Stigler's logic of rational search, and limited excludability of knowledge. Price dispersion, traditionally viewed as an efficiency loss derivative of imperfect information in the market protects competition from being destroyed by innovation and increasing returns to scale. Bankruptcy occurs in a form similar to the gambler's ruin. The model requires no entry or replacement of failed firms. The number of active firms in a market reaches a stationary state increasing with, and contingent on, search costs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that this argument holds in the late medieval period by using an extensive form of punishment and sanctions game.

The aim of this research was to determine the long-term EER of the South African rand using the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) methodology. This paper used a panel of data from South Africa's main trading partners to estimate the relationship between the EER and its fundamental determinants using dynamic ordinary least squares (OLS) and fully modified OLS. The average coefficients obtained describe the long-term behaviour of the individual countries' real exchange rates. Substituting the observed fundamental time series into the estimated equation derives the EER for each country and over- and undervaluation can be determined. The results indicated that the fundamental value of the exchange rate was driven by economic growth, the openness of the economy, its foreign reserves, the real gold price and capital expenditure. The exchange rate also fluctuated considerably around its equilibrium level but there is not long sustained periods of over- and undervaluation.","North West Univ, Sch Econ, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Saayman, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom Campus,Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",andrea.saayman@nwu.ac.za,"Saayman, Andrea/A-1603-2018","Saayman, Andrea/0000-0002-9506-8141",,,,,36,4,4,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In a basic competitive case, the optimal tax equals the Pigou rate, equivalent to the present discounted value of marginal damage costs. We consider two separate types of tenure insecurity for resource owners, and their impact on the tax implementing the optimal policy. When insecure control is with respect to future ownership to the resource, competitive extraction is higher than otherwise, and the efficiency-implementing tax exceeds the Pigou rate. When tenure insecurity instead implies possible expropriation (holdup) of investment in extraction capacity, it deters extraction, and the optimal tax is lower than the Pigou rate.

Even though the nonlinear models are theoretically well-motivated, some of the recent findings cast doubts on their relevance for real exchange rates. In particular, the nonlinear models do not necessarily yield improved out-of-sample forecasts over linear models and add little value in resolving the well-documented PPP puzzle. Utilizing a nonparametric entropy measure of dependence proposed by Granger et al. (2004), we show, in this study, that the real exchange rates from four major countries had exhibited quite strong nonlinear serial dependence, which linear autoregressive models fail to replicate. Furthermore, the nonlinear TAR and ESTAR models estimated for the real exchange rates also have some difficulty in generating significant serial dependence structure actually observed in the data. Overall, other nonlinear models than the currently entertained TAR and ESTAR should be considered to study the dynamics of the real exchange rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the following country-specific variables are important distance from the equator, government effectiveness, the low-middle income group countries and regional blocs that countries belong to. In contrast, the following variables are not statistically significant: geographical size of the country; upper-middle or high-income group countries; languages and other institutional variables such as political aspects and stability, law, regulation and national corruption level. The important implication of the findings is that the current expansion of RTAs may not be linked to a global free trade system because of the peculiarity of countries having multiple RTAs.","[Hur, Jung] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea; [Song, Backhoon] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136742, South Korea",Sogang University; Sungshin Women's University,"Hur, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Shinsu Dong, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",ecsjhur@sogang.ac.kr; bsong@sungshin.ac.kr,"Hur, Jung/AAV-7700-2021","Hur, Jung/0000-0002-6013-0056",,,,,17,1,1,0,5,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

It employs annual data covering the period 1968-2005. The study also explores the causal relationship between these variables in terms of the three error-correction based Granger causality models. The empirical results are as follows: i) Both variables are nonstationaty in levels and stationary in the first differences with/without structural breaks, ii) there exists a long-run relationship between variables, there is unidirectional causality running from the electricity consumption to economic growth. The overall results indicate that growth hypothesis for electricity consumption and growth nexus holds in Turkey.

This critical review of axiomatic analyses of preferences over infinite streams evaluates different kinds of intergenerational social preferences by comparing their axiomatic basis as well as their performance in simple present-futuer conflicts.

In 2002 it was renamed as Human Resource Development Limited (HRDL). All registered employers with HRDL are eligible for the employees training grants. The total approved training places and disbursement of training grants had increased over the years. This paper investigates to what extent the training programs improve employee knowledge, skills, works behavior and job performance, and what are the significant training related factors influencing job performance. The paper is based on data collected through self-reported survey on 1200 employees (458 responded) at hotels, resorts and ICTs companies in four selected states. Out of the responses, 73 percent attended various training programs coordinated by HRDL. The result shows that, in general, the training programs improve knowledge, skills and positive work behavior of employees. Multiple linear regression analysis supports the hypothesis that training related variables have positive impact on employees' job performance except cognitive competence.","[Awang, Abd Hair] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ctr Social Dev & Environm Studies, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Ismail, Rahmah; Noor, Zulridah Mohd] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Ctr Econ Studies, Fac Econ & Business Management, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Awang, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ctr Social Dev & Environm Studies, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",hair@ukm.my; rahis@pkrisc.cc.ukm.my; oe@pkrisc.cc.ukm.my,"Awang, Abd Hair/AAA-1806-2019","Awang, Abd Hair/0000-0002-0837-7975",,,,,39,7,11,8,99,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

To start, the treatment of money in 20th century Keynesian economics is reviewed, including that provided by Keynes. Then the current theory of endogenous money is briefly summarised as it developed towards the end of the century and into the current century. The chapter continues by elaborating the extensions to the consensus Post Keynesian theory in the literature. Money is defined in terms of seven characteristics: 1. trust, 2. divisibility, 3. invariance in value over space and time, 4. limitation in supply, 5. acceptance as a unit of account, 6. convenience and 7. attractiveness. The chapter goes on to elucidate the concept of economic invariance. The role of money in spatial and temporal economics is briefly addressed, so that the essential symmetry between exchange rates (exchange rates for different moneys at a point in time) and interest rates (costs of or return to holding one money over time) is highlighted. There is a brief discussion of the role of money in the current crisis.

We provide evidence for a nonlinear time trend in the volatility of GDP growth and give support for the hypothesis that the 1970s were special in the sense of Blanchard and Simon (2001).","[Burren, Daniel; Neusser, Klaus] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Neusser, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",klaus.neusser@vwi.unibe.ch,,,,,,,7,2,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Despite the large risk implied by this undiversified investment they do not seem to require any extra return on a diversified public equity index. In light of the large public equity premium, this fact poses a new asset pricing puzzle. In the present paper, I use a quantitative model to explore the issue and find that the choice to become entrepreneur can be rationalized even with a negative private equity premium when the full return on entrepreneurial investment is properly accounted for. The key assumption is that the quality of a business project is not precisely known upon entry and is learned over time. As long as it is possible to switch back to paid-employment, it is worth experimenting with entrepreneurship to find out if the project is good even if initially the expected return is low.","Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Alicante 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Campanale, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Campus San Vicente del Raspeig, Alicante 03690, Spain.",claudio@merlin.fae.ua.es,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

While the ideological location of an incumbent political party is a powerful predictor of its policy position, the role of a political party in the globalization-growth nexus has never been fully empirically investigated. By applying Pedroni's panel cointegration technique instead of a time-series or traditional panel data approach, this paper aims to empirically re-examine the co-movement and the causal relationship among economic growth, the overall globalization index, and its three main dimensionseconomic, social, as well as political integrationsby using panel data for 23 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries for 1970 to 2006. Certainly, the political party variable is taken into account as the advanced test is promoted, and we finally discover that all variables move together in the long run. Based on the results of the panel causality test, though the evidence of short-run causality is very weak, it does show long-run unidirectional causality running from the overall index of globalization, economic globalization, and social globalization to growth. Finally, the critical role of the political party is deeply discussed in relation with our results.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Shih Chien University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,68,62,66,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The Czech Republic as an EU member and a candidate country for EURO adoption should experience a similar development as other EU members in key macroeconomic indicators. Net export is one of them; this characteristic has a high importance especially because the future possibility of adopting EURO and a very close relationship between international trade and exchange rates. There was available quarterly data from Q1 1999 to Q3 2009 about export, GDP, export price, consumption and central bank interest rate for the EU27 and the Czech Republic. Four different econometric techniques were used to find the most suitable model explaining the net export of both economies. Firstly the SUR method was used and the results suggested that just OLS is sufficient for the estimate. So secondly the OLS method was implemented, which gave very good results after dealing with autocorrelation. The Wald tests then suggested that the both models could converge to the same parameters. Thirdly estimating a panel model provided insufficient results, since there are just two economies in the dataset. The last method was running a vector autoregression, which uncovered that the most suitable model has 3 lags and contains just GDP, consumption and central bank interest rate. The conclusion is that a relative convergence of the net export of the both economies could exist, but probably not the absolute one.","[Chrobok, Viktor] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,viktor.chrobok@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,283,288,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900049,0

In particular, one agent experiences extinction relative to another (that is, the wealth ratio of the two agents goes to zero) if and only if she has a smaller survival index. We consider a simple complete market model and show that the survival index is more complex if there are more than two agents in the economy. In fact, the following phenomenon may take place: even if agent one experiences extinction relative to agent two, adding a third agent to the economy may reverse the situation and force the agent two to experience extinction relative to agent one.

We show how these two elements can be integrated in a tractable framework to offer a convincing overall account for the history of U.S. asset prices. Our main explanation for the high equity premium is that there is a small persistent component to changes in dividend growth. This component, driven by the 'business cycle,' makes equity prices very volatile, and hence a poor insurance instrument. The model also explains the extreme volatility of stock prices: the price-dividend ratio predicted by the model based on U.S. consumption data from 1891-2001 has a correlation of 72% with the actual price-dividend ratio in the S&P 500.

We find evidence of the influence of labour market behaviour, and sectoral and occupational mobility in particular, on longevity. The detrimental role of smoking to health is found to be comparable with the role of excess alcohol consumption, which is novel in the Russian context where the influence of smoking is typically downplayed in comparison with alcoholism.

Although the benefits exclude accommodation and food expenditure, they are noticeable within the following segments: tourism promotion (broadening the scopes of Vojvodina Province as a receptive area for the foreign market through its cultural heritage and natural values); increase in foreign tourist turnover, visitor's expenditures; new job opportunities (adequate infrastructure and superstructure rendering services to ships, crew and passengers) - harbors, carriers, souvenir shops, etc. / new products, business net, exchange money, invisible export, etc. The results of the research may initiate further studies on the cause and effect connections between this type of travelling and resources of receptive countries, upon which the travels are based, both aiming at adequate design and launching of the tourist offer, i.e. the optimal development of receptive countries through sustainable tourism.

But in the real world, we frequently observe the existence of an equilibrium price dispersion instead of one price of equilibrium. This article discusses the effects of price dispersion on two price indexes: the cost of living index and the consumer price index. With price dispersion and consumer searching for the lowest price, these indexes cannot be interpreted as deterministic indicators, but as stochastic indicators, and they can be biased if price dispersion is not taken into account. A measure for the bias of the consumer price index is proposed and the article ends with an estimation of the bias based on data obtained from the consumer price index calculated for the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from January 1988 through December 2004. The period analysed is very interesting, because it exhibits different inflationary environments: high levels and high volatility of the rates of inflation with great price dispersion until July 1994 and low and relatively stable rates of inflation with prices less dispersed after August 1994.","Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05439010 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Fava, VL (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05439010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",verafava@usp.br,,,,,,,31,2,3,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

An assessment of the baseline or 'business-as-usual' scenario for emissions from this process is therefore crucial to current debate about the relationship between national forest policy and measures taken to mitigate the impacts of climate change. This paper shows that the PNG government's own attempts to construct a baseline scenario for the contribution made to this process by logging and agribusiness companies have ignored a number of significant supply-side constraints on their economic activities, both in the past and in the future. This can be understood as the result of a perverse incentive for the governments of 'rainforest nations' to exaggerate the past, present and future rates of deforestation or forest degradation in order to claim a reward for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a fictitious or exaggerated baseline to a level which approximates the real trajectory.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Resource Management Asia Pacific Program, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Filer, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Resource Management Asia Pacific Program, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,"Filer, Colin/0000-0001-7503-4377",,,,,25,6,6,0,11,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

That is, does there exist a test, defined on the type structure alone, so that the structure passes this test only if it contains all hierarchies of beliefs? This paper investigates one such test.

By the 1990s, there is a wage penalty resulting in a 20 percent decline in the relative wages of HBCU graduates between the two decades.

In this context, its aim is to quantify the external cost of greenhouse gases (specifically carbon dioxide) generated during electricity production in the thermal power plants in Greece and to estimate the impact on the electricity production cost and on the electricity prices of a possible internalisation of this external cost by the producers. For this purpose, this paper applies the EcoSenseLE online tool to quantify the examined externalities. This research finds that the calculated external cost is significantly high (compared to the corresponding production cost) mainly in lignite-fired power plants. Specifically, a possible internalisation of this external cost would increase the production cost by more than 52% (on average), which, in turn, would affect similarly the electricity prices. This finding could be important for decision makers in the electricity sector to develop strategies for emission reduction and to develop environmental and energy policies. The general limitation of the external cost methodology applies to this work as it uses the standard method developed for the Externe project. Similarly. the data limitations as well as assumptions related to the costs and exclusions/ omissions of cost elements affect the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A well-known drawback of such models is that to obtain marginal effects that pertain to the arithmetic mean, rather than the mean of logs, we must exponentiate, and this retransformation is complicated in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This article presents a simple method for correcting estimated elasticities for the effects of heteroskedasticity, in both log-linear and log-log (constant elasticity) equations. An example, drawing on Bulgarian farm survey data, demonstrates that this correction leads to significantly different estimates of the elasticity of expenditures on agricultural inputs with respect to land area and the age of the household head.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Hertz, T (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",hertz@american.edu,,,,,,,6,5,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The econometric approach involves an application of the recently developed Global Vector Autoregression methodology of Dees et al. (2007) to 12 manufacturing industries over the period 1977-2003. The framework allows us to analyse the response of a standard set of labour-market related variables (employment, real compensation, productivity and capital stock) to exogenous factors (a sector-specific measure of trade openness, a common technology and oil price shock), along with industry spillovers using specific measures of manufacturing-wide variables for each sector. Generalized impulse responses indicate that increased trade openness negatively affects real compensation, has negligible employment effects and leads to higher labour productivity. These impacts, however, are relatively weaker than those induced by technology shocks, with the latter positively and significantly affecting both real compensation and employment. There is also evidence of positive spillovers across industries from sector-specific employment and productivity shocks. Impact elasticities suggest strong intra-sectoral linkages for employment and capital stock formation, contrasting with weak linkages for what concerns real compensation and productivity.","[Hiebert, P.; Vansteenkiste, I.] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Vansteenkiste, I.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Louvain, Belgium",European Central Bank; KU Leuven,"Hiebert, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",paul.hiebert@ecb.int,,,,,,,34,15,18,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We argue that experience with total war, namely, the First World War, induced democratic constraints on conflictual foreign policies via significant change in military manpower systems. Experience with total war led democratic governments to recognize each other's sensitivity to public concerns about the burdens imposed by conscription. Thus, democratic peace in the modern era can be traced to (1) total war experience for 'old' democracies; and (2) the level of violence in foreign policies exceeding a threshold that induces public concerns about the burden of conscription. Empirical testing based on the Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) data set shows a significantly different effect for democratic dyads on the onset of militarized disputes before and after the First World War. Democratic dyads, however, do not reduce the likelihood of disputes in cases with a low level of violence regardless of the era in question. This implies that conflict-averse behavior between democracies is a product of learning from the experience of total war that leads to greater government awareness of public concern about more intense foreign policy actions.","[James, Patrick] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,,kwagkai@gmail.com,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,89,0,0,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

There is a need of public support of building backbone broadband networks for regional development but because of possible disturbance on competitive conditions of broadband market, notification of EC is necessary. The analysis was made by team from College of Polytechnics Jihlava for the Office of the Regional Council NUTS 2 South-East in comparison with the experts from the University of Economics, department of Econometrics, which solved the multicriteria decision problem. The area, the analysis was made for, consists of two separated regions. The aim of the analysis was to approve which parts of these two regions provide demographic, geographic and infrastructural conditions for possible market failure, i.e. these parts are not attractive for business to build commercial broadband infrastructure. According to the parameters that influence the decisions of the commercial investors in the broadband and also with regard to the relevant and accessible data, the 8 criterions for each municipality in each region were selected.

Cost-effective access relies in turn on efficient market functioning and on appropriate polices towards the role of markets at national and international levels. This article argues that current international policy frameworks for promoting access to essential medicines lack coherence and display weak empirical foundations for proposed market interventions. A study of medicines markets in Tanzania questions some assumptions about market functioning underlying international policy, and shows how exploratory field studies can reduce the knowledge gap. Medicines policy should aim for rational use of essential medicines and for universal access free at the point of use to medicines essential to treat endemic diseases and other major causes of death. Unregulated retail market competition in essential medicines should be progressively constrained by government and NGO action. Wholesale market competition, in contrast, should be promoted, while the rebuilding of African pharmaceutical manufacturing is important for promoting and sustaining access. At each market level, public and non-governmental non-profit traders and providers can play a regulatory role alongside greater citizen information and civic activism.","[Mackintosh, Maureen] Open Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Mujinja, Phares G.

Open-economy models with price stickiness and local-currency pricing often require an average duration above 4 quarters to approximate those stylized facts. I argue that limited and asymmetric information introduces a lag in the consumption decisions, and as a result the real exchange rate becomes more volatile to ensure that goods markets clear at all times. Hence, informational frictions can explain the volatility of the real exchange rate without imposing price stickiness above the available estimates (e.g., Gali et al., 2001). I also find that differences in price stickiness across markets weaken the correlation between the nominal exchange rate and the CPI ratio between countries. This can increase the persistence of the real exchange rate, but often by worsening the model along other dimensions (e.g., by lowering the correlation between nominal and real exchange rates).","[Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",enrique.martinez-garcia@dal.frb.org,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X",,,,,25,1,1,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Critical issue in the UIG-relations model is the role of entrepreneurship: is enterprise integrated into all (education and not only intra-) university activities or is entrepreneurship support system targeted as a function for university R&D commercialization system only? From the literature it is known that the patterns of entrepreneurial university as a knowledge creator for society are more frequently represented in applied science oriented technology universities. The main aspects in entrepreneurial pattern of university are creation and implementation of transferable new knowledge and behaviour of actors in that process. All these aspects contain topics related to R&D funding, inventorship and ownership of patents. Patenting alone is not the evidence of entrepreneurial behaviour of the university, but this is one of the first steps targeted to implement created new knowledge into real business. The aim of the paper is to explore knowledge creation, especially patented intellectual property (IF) created by university staff targeted on commercialization of university research. Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial environment in UIG network have been identified as critical success factor in knowledge production by university. Based on previous publications university business model in the University-Indushy-Government framework has been described. The author's position is that the (state) government is playing a very specific role in university entrepreneurship domain via governmental order as it has been in the fields of education and research. Empirical survey of knowledge production is based on the sample of five European universities from Sweden, Finland, Estonia and the Netherlands. The main research questions are general data about sample universities, like number of researchers, funding of R&D, creation of IF as well as indicators of efficiency of knowledge production. Results demonstrate growth in a number of publications abstracted in ISI Web between 1.2 and 2.0 times in the period 2000-2008. Productivity of publication per researcher differs maximum 1.9 times between universities and productivity of patenting figure differs approximately 13.5 times, partly as a result of Swedish professors' privilege IP regime. That points on the need to learn more non-university patenting by academic personnel of other countries, but it obviously raises the question related to employment and patent ownership regulation in European countries generally. This regulation seems to be absolutely inefficient to protect new knowledge produced for national public R&D funding.","Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ctr Entrepreneurship, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Mets, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Narva Rd 4, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia.",tonis.mets@ut.ee,"/AHD-4125-2022; Mets, Tõnis/AAH-2926-2019; /ABA-9691-2021; Mets, Tõnis/A-8428-2008","Mets, Tõnis/0000-0003-3972-5204;",,,,,38,11,12,0,52,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Second, we find positive autocorrelation in the frequency of price adjustments, implying that there tends to be clustering where price adjustments occur in succession. In contrast, there is no such autocorrelation in the size of price adjustments.

This process was contradictory to tendencies in majority of EU countries. The impact of recession on labour force was diverse: the number of lower-educated employed persons fell substantially, in the same time the number of terciary educated employed persons grew (in spite of sharp GDP decline). This tendency was similar to employment restructuring in most EU countries, however in Slovakia it was more obvious.

We find that price elasticity increased rapidly during the late 1970s and then decreased until 1987. After a relatively small-scaled increase-decrease cycle from 1987 to 2000, the price elasticity rose again after 2000. The time-varying change of the elasticities may be explained by the proportion of gasoline consumption to income and fluctuation of the degree of necessity. The result of the error correction model shows that a deviation from a long-run equilibrium is corrected quickly, and the welfare analysis illustrates there may be a gain by shifting the tax scheme from income tax to gasoline tax.

The test is based on a state-space model to determine when each country has followed the principle; then a threshold unit root test is used to verify if the stationarity of the deviation of the expected inflation from its target depends on compliance with the Taylor principle. The results show that such compliance leads to the stationarity of the deviation of the expected inflation from its target in all cases. Furthermore, in most cases, non-compliance with the Taylor principle leads to nonstationary deviation of the expected inflation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The original Markowitz optimization model represents a convex quadratic programming problem. Almost any efforts to its reformulation involving the above-mentioned facts lead to the loss of a positive semi-definiteness of the matrix occurring in the model's structure. This leads to a non-convex programming problem whose solution is generally problematic. By refinement of the merits of the original model, we get into trouble with its computational, formal aspect. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to the reconvexification of the reformulated model.

We find that firms optimally avoid costly cash shortfalls, only experiencing these events after serious negative shocks to profits. We also find that commonly used regression tests for the presence of finance constraints can produce false positives.

Differently from existing models of cultural transmission of values (such as Bisin and Verdier, 2001; Tabellini, 2008) we assume that parents are exclusively concerned with their children's material welfare. If parents coordinate their educational choices, a child would look at her system of values to predict the values of her contemporaries, with whom she may interact. A parent may thus choose to instill pro-social values into his child in order to signal to her that others can generally be trusted. This implies that parents may optimally decide to endow their children with values that stand in contrast with maximization of material welfare, even if their children's material welfare is all they care about.

The bursting of the housing bubble forced banks to write down several hundred billion dollars in bad loans caused by mortgage delinquencies. At the same time, the stock market capitalization of the major banks declined by more than twice as much. While the overall mortgage losses are large on an absolute scale, they are still relatively modest compared to the $8 trillion of US stock market wealth lost between October 2007, when the stock market reached an all-time high, and October 2008. This paper attempts to explain the economic mechanisms that caused losses in the mortgage market to amplify into such large dislocations and turmoil in the financial markets, and describes common economic threads that explain the plethora of market declines, liquidity dry-ups, defaults, and bailouts that occurred after the crisis broke in summer 2007.",RISK; ARBITRAGE; BANKING; DEBT; EQUILIBRIUM; MARKETS; LIMITS; RUNS,,"Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Brunnermeier, MK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",markus@princeton.edu,"Brunnermeier, Markus K/C-4473-2012",,,,,,44,1440,1653,5,365,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The essence of structured finance activities is the pooling of economic assets like loans, bonds, and mortgages, and the subsequent issuance of a prioritized capital structure of claims, known as tranches, against these collateral pools. As a result of the prioritization scheme used in structuring claims, many of the manufactured tranches are far safer than the average asset in the underlying pool. This ability of structured finance to repackage risks and to create safe assets from otherwise risky collateral led to a dramatic expansion in the issuance of structured securities, most of which were viewed by investors to be virtually risk-free and certified as such by the rating agencies. At the core of the recent financial market crisis has been the discovery that these securities are actually far riskier than originally advertised. We examine how the process of securitization allowed trillions of dollars of risky assets to be transformed into securities that were widely considered to be safe. We highlight two features of structured finance products - the extreme fragility of their ratings to modest imprecision in evaluating underlying risks, and their exposure to systematic risks - that go a long way in explaining the spectacular rise and fall of structured finance. We conclude with an assessment of what went wrong and the relative importance of rating agency errors, investor credulity, and perverse incentives and suspect behavior on the part of issuers, rating agencies, and borrowers.","[Coval, Joshua; Stafford, Erik] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Jurek, Jakub] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Harvard University; Princeton University,"Coval, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",jcoval@hbs.edu; jjurek@princeton.edu; estafford@hbs.edu,,,,,,,42,289,338,2,65,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Given the mixed results of these studies, our paper analyzes eight banks in Malaysia offering both conventional and Islamic banking operations. Our comparison is conducted via discussions of profitability, liquidity, and asset quality. It is illustrated via this micro-level analysis that Islamic modes of finance may generally equal or surpass the quantitative measures of performance describing traditional capitalist finance systems and simultaneously encourage higher levels of social equity and economic stability in the era of financialization.","[ElGindi, Tamer; Said, Mona; Salevurakis, John William] Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Econ, Cairo 11511, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo,"ElGindi, T (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Econ, 113 Kasr el Aini St, Cairo 11511, Egypt.",tamerelgindi@gmail.com; mona_said@aucegypt.edu; jalevurakis@aucegypt.edu,,,,,,,55,14,14,0,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

As the crisis developed, liquidity vanished, and the interbank market collapsed, central banks had to inject much more liquidity at low interest rates than predicted by standard monetary policy models.

Furthermore I present empirical evidence at the firm level on the relationship between age, wage and productivity. In particular I address the potential wage-productivity gap that might occur at higher ages. I conclude that the productivity of older workers indeed decreases with their age.

In a simple asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs the introduction of additional Arrow securities may destabilize markets, and thus increase price volatility, and at the same time decrease average welfare. We also investigate whether a fully rational agent can employ additional hedging instruments to stabilize markets. It turns out that the answer depends on the composition of the population of non-rational traders and the information gathering costs for rationality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that homogeneous leagues in which all clubs are profit maximizers dominate all other leagues. Mixed leagues in which small-market clubs are profit maximizers and large-market clubs are win maximizers (type-I mixed leagues) are dominated by all other leagues. From a welfare perspective, large-market clubs win too often in (purely) win-maximizing and type-I mixed leagues; whereas, small-market clubs win too many games in (purely) profit-maximizing leagues and in mixed leagues in which large-market clubs are profit maximizers and small-market clubs are win maximizers (type-II mixed leagues). These results have important policy implications: Social welfare will increase if clubs are reorganized from non-profit member associations to profit-maximizing corporations. Moreover, we show that revenue sharing decreases (increases) social welfare in mixed (homogeneous) leagues.","[Dietl, Helmut M.; Lang, Markus; Werner, Stephan] Univ Zurich, Inst Strategy & Business Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Lang, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Strategy & Business Econ, Plattenstr 14, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",helmut.dietl@isu.uzh.ch; markus.lang@isu.uzh.ch; stephan.werner@isu.uzh.ch,"Lang, Markus/AAD-2995-2019","Lang, Markus/0000-0002-6837-790X",,,,,34,33,35,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Our results suggest that shocks to unemployment rates are temporary and soon converge when we control for breaks.

We show that while giving incentives has no cost in for-profit MFIs, it is costly in pro-poor MFIs: When repayment and wealth are positively correlated, a pro-poor MFI cannot obtain the selection of poor clients in the proportion it wishes with incentives based solely on repayment. It then becomes necessary to audit the share of very poor borrowers selected by an agent in order to provide the latter with adequate incentives. When audit costs are large, pro-poor MFIs may have to forego selection on wealth - and use other targeting devices such as working in impoverished geographical locations. Driven by donor concerns with 'mission drift' away from the poor, audits on the wealth status of clients have been introduced at the level of MFIs. We show that introducing pro-poor incentives requires extending such audits to the level of credit agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

For that purpose, we simply assimilate the working of the invisible hand mechanism with the existence of a social preference such that individual and social optimalities are consistent. In introducing the possibility of interaction among individuals, we then suggest that the standard singleton case, or atomistic individualism, is just an extreme feature of a more general requirement that we call the network agreement. Our main result is that the invisible hand mechanism does keep on working when there is an interaction between Robinson and Friday if the former (respectively, the latter) is sensitive to the latter (respectively, the former) in such a way that they exhibit some agreement in preferences. Hence, the singleton case naturally satisfies this property because neither Robinson nor Friday can disagree with himself. Further cooperative situations are also allowed in order to extent the invisible hand mechanism to cases with interactions.","[Billot, Antoine] Univ Pantheon Assas, Dept Econ, Paris 2, France; [Billot, Antoine] PSE Ecole Econ Paris, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Billot, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, Dept Econ, Paris 2, France.",billot@u-paris2.fr,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1742-7355,,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Generically the pivotal group member with the median valuation of the rent will not act himself but will want to send a group member that has preferences different to her own into the contest. The delegation can be either to more or less radical group members. The direction of delegation depends on the order of moves and the relative aggressiveness of the group medians. We show that almost certainly very asymmetric equilibria arise, even if the median group members value the rent (almost) equally.

This paper studies one of the links between remittances and growth, in particular how local financial sector development influences a country's capacity to take advantage of remittances. Using a newly-constructed dataset for remittances covering about 100 developing countries, we find that remittances boost growth in countries with less developed financial systems by providing an alternative way to finance investment and helping overcome liquidity constraints. This finding controls for the endogeneity of remittances and financial development, does not depend on the particular measure of financial sector development used, and is robust to a number of robustness tests, including threshold estimation. We also provide evidence that there could be an investment channel trough which remittances can promote growth especially when the financial sector does not meet the credit needs of the population.

Using a firm-level data set that spans the population of China's large and medium-size industrial enterprises, this paper explores the factors that account for China's rising patent activity. While the intensification of research and development in the Chinese economy tracks with patenting activity, it explains only a fraction of the patent explosion. The growth of foreign direct investment in China is prompting Chinese firms to file for more patent applications. Amendments to the patent law that favor patent holders and ownership reform that has clarified the assignment of property rights also emerge as significant sources of China's patent boom. These results are robust to alternative estimation strategies that account for over-dispersion in the patent counts data and firm heterogeneity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cross-country data for developing countries provide evidence for this hypothesis, using a World Bank indicator on efficiency of revenue mobilization. Aid's negative effects on quality of tax systems are robust to correcting for potential reverse causality, to changes in the sample, and to alternative estimation methods. Revenues from natural resources are also associated with lower-quality tax systems, but results are somewhat sensitive to the choice of resource dependence indicators, and to a few extreme values in the data. Disaggregating by resource type, revenues from fuel exports are found to be more strongly associated than revenues from metals and ores exports with inefficient tax systems.

For one-shot choices, in contrast, there can be no behavioral distinction between indifference and incompleteness. Applications include: an isomorphism for incomplete preferences that indicates when weak and strict preferences contain interchangeable information, a characterization of the (possibly incomplete) preference relations consistent with a one-shot choice function, and an equivalent definition of incompleteness that relies on the philosophical theory of incommensurability.

For these reasons, initial transition steps should allow for future flexibility, where we define flexibility as robustness regarding changing evidence and changing preferences.

In particular, in less financially developed economies (South), trade and capital mobility are complements in the sense that trade integration increases the return to capital and thus the incentives for capital to flow to South. This interaction implies that deepening trade integration in South raises net capital inflows (or reduces net capital outflows).

We find that in the 1950s IBM followed what today would be called an open-source model - its software source code was open, free of charge, and written collaboratively with its users. By the mid 1980s, all of these attributes had been reversed - IBM's software was closed source, sold or leased independently of hardware sales, and written without the collaboration of its users.

At first glance it is tempting to conclude that slotting allowances should be particularly prevalent for product categories where the manufacturer's scope for undertaking noncontractible sales effort is relatively large. At odds with this, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) among other organizations, reports that slotting allowances are more commonly used for product categories where the scope for noncontractible effort by the manufacturer is presumably relatively small. To scrutinize this puzzle we set up a simple model with one manufacturer and one retailer, where the manufacturer undertakes noncontractible demand-enhancing investments.

The Ramsey equation for the discount rate has three components: the pure rate of time preference, a measure of relative risk aversion, and the rate of growth of per capita consumption. Much of the attention on the appropriate discount rate for long-term environmental problems has focussed on the role played by the pure rate of time preference in this formulation. We show that the other two elements are numerically just as important in considerations of anthropogenic climate change. The elasticity of the marginal utility with respect to consumption is particularly important because it assumes three roles: consumption smoothing over time, risk aversion, and inequity aversion. Given the large uncertainties about climate change and widely asymmetric impacts, the assumed rates of risk and inequity aversion can be expected to play significant roles. The consumption growth rate plays multiple roles, as well. It is one of the determinants of the discount rate, and one of the drivers of emissions and hence climate change. We also find that the impacts of climate change grow slower than income, so the effective discount rate is higher than the real discount rate. Moreover, the differential growth rate between rich and poor countries determines the time evolution of the size of the equity weights. As there are a number of crucial but uncertain parameters, it is no surprise that one can obtain almost any estimate of the social cost of carbon. We even show that, for a low pure rate of time preference, the estimate of the social cost of carbon is indeed arbitrary-as one can exclude neither large positive nor large negative impacts in the very long run. However, if we probabilistically constrain the parameters to values that are implied by observed behaviour, we find that the expected social cost of carbon, corrected for uncertainty and inequity, is approximate 60 US dollar per metric tonne of carbon (or roughly $17 per tonne of CO2) under the assumption that catastrophic risk is zero.

The forward looking information is extracted using implied risk-neutral density functions estimated by a mixture of two-lognormals and several alternative risk adjustments. Our results show that, between October 1996 and March 2000, we can reject the hypothesis that the risk-neutral densities provide accurate predictions of the distributions of future realisations of the IBEX 35 index at 4- and 8-week horizons. When forecasting through risk-adjusted densities the performance of this period is statistically improved and we no longer reject that hypothesis. We show that risk adjustments based on a power specification for the stochastic discount factor-which is the approach used so far in the literature that derives the objective density function from option prices- generates an excessive volatility of risk premia. We use alternative risk adjustments and find that the forecasting performance of the distribution improves slightly in some cases when risk aversion is allowed to be time-varying. Finally, from October 1996 to December 2004, the ex-ante risk premium perceived by investors and that are embedded in option prices is between 12 and 18% higher than the premium required to compensate the same investors for the realised volatility in stock market returns.","[Alonso, Francisco; Blanco, Roberto] Banco Espana, Serv Estudios, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Rubio, Gonzalo] Univ CEU Cardenal Herrera, Valencia, Spain",Banco de Espana; Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera,"Alonso, F (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Serv Estudios, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",falonso@bde.es; rblanco@bde.es; gonzalo.rubio@uch.ceu.es,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-5469,1435-5477,,SPAN ECON REV,Span.

If consumers do not foresee future changes in their income, price always decreases. However, greater disutility contributes to softening the price fall in the present, never reaching marginal cost at that moment. Consumers' perspective for future changes to income has two major implications: 1) the durable goods monopoly, depending on disutility, can set a price equal to marginal cost at the present time if the perspective is for income growth in the future, something which never happens if reduced income is foreseen; and 2) it increases the tendency of a rise in price depending on disutility. We conclude that a price rise may be obtained for quite small disutility when the predicted increase in income is moderate and for moderate disutility, when the predicted increase in income is high.","Univ Beira Interior, Dept Gestao & Econ, P-6200209 Ernesto Cruz, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Nunes, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Dept Gestao & Econ, P-6200209 Ernesto Cruz, Covilha, Portugal.",macas@ubi.pt,,"Macas Nunes, Paulo/0000-0001-9399-2528",,,,,35,1,1,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The focus is on the role of local governments under decentralization. Exploiting variation in the level of innovation in a large sample of US school districts, the impact of yardstick competition on the choice of public sector technologies is identified. It is shown that the impact of other districts' innovation activity on a district's innovation score is much stronger in communities where incumbents face a high risk of being elected out of office. This finding suggests that under decentralization, yardstick competition is an important force shaping the decisions of local governments to adopt new technologies.","Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Rincke, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",johannes.rincke@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,27,9,11,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

This contrasts supply-side indeterminacy that is driven by externalities in the production function as exemplified by Benhabib and Farmer (Journal of Economic Theory, 1994). For the one-sector models considered, I find that indeterminacy arises more easily from the demand than from the supply side. In addition, demand and supply-side indeterminacy generate different cyclical patterns of wages, a feature that is useful for identifying episodes of self-fulfilling prophecies within the two types of indeterminacy.","Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Sim, NCS (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",nicholas.sim@bc.edu,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Innovations in the financial market appeared to have led to lower output variability. Further, when the real interest rate is made a function of financial disintermediation, the real interest rate appeared to have lost its significance in influencing real variables in the post-1990: 3 period. This study did not, however, find evidence in support of the significance of the real interest rate in affecting real variables through the direct financing channel via the capital market.","[Tan, Anthony C.

Through these channels, rising longevity can be conducive to long-run economic growth.

Yet, the speed, magnitude and timing of shakeouts are somewhat puzzling from the perspective of conventional entry models. In this paper, we argue that shakeouts are likely to occur as a result of the stochastic dynamics of the entry process, when firms are uncertain about their competitors' decision to enter. We show that the magnitude of such endogenous shakeouts can be quite large and sudden, in particular in highly competitive industries or markets with low-investment cost, low impatience and high liquidation values.

In a multidimensional setting the direct link between income (or any other attribute) and individual well-being is absent. We interpret the social welfare level of a distribution in which each individual has the same bundle as the individual wellbeing level. We define regressivity on the basis of this individual well-being ranking. In a setting with both transferable and non-transferable attributes, the imposition of the ensuing consistent Pigou-Dalton principle forces individual well-being to have a quasi-linear structure in the transferable attributes. Since we allow for transferable and non-transferable attributes, our result provides a normative underpinning for criteria in the distinct literatures of multidimensional inequality measurement (only transferable attributes) and of needs (one transferable and one non-transferable attribute).

This paper has two objectives. One is to identify discrepancies between objectivity and subjectivity in evaluating national competitiveness. The other is to analyze cultural attributes in the measurement of national competitiveness. We found four interesting results. First, there exists a distinctive difference between hard and survey data among ten countries. Second, a high coefficient of internal consistency was found when measuring six items Of each culture variable. Third, as a result of factor analysis using measurement items of culture variables, most items were classified as possessing a few common factors. Fourth, from the cluster analysis, the cluster group of culture variables coincides with the recognition type of competitiveness evaluation for the most part. These findings mean that national competitiveness is closely related with culture variables, and that cultural attributes actually influence the evaluation and measurement of national competitiveness.","[Kim, Yong-Yul] Hongik Univ, Coll Business Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jong-Won] Suwon Univ, Coll Business Adm, Suwon, South Korea",Hongik University,"Kim, YY (通讯作者)，Hongik Univ, Coll Business Management, Seoul, South Korea.",yykim@hongik.ac.kr; jwlee@suwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,4,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

While these results generally hold when measured on averages, empirical evidence Suggests that trade liberalization is unlikely to produce beneficial results across all households. This study adds to the literature by providing an analysis of the distributive effects of tariff liberalization in Mexico. The paper examines the effect of tariff liberalization from the perspective of households both as consumers and factor owners allowing for imperfect domestic price transmission. The results indicate the overall positive effect of tariff liberalization masks significant differences in the distribution of gains both across income levels and across geographic regions. Richer households are found to have gained relatively more. Urban areas, as well as Mexican states closest to the United States border, are also found to be larger beneficiaries while southernmost states have been largely bypassed by the effects of tariff liberalization. Those results can be explained not only in relation to the different endowments of the households, but also by the diverse effects on local prices that has resulted from Mexican trade liberalization.

This paper investigates the effects of the most recent EU enlargement on convergence among countries and regions in the EU-27. Departing from a new economic geography framework, we focus on integration effects caused by changes in market access, released by a reduction of trade impediments. Special attention is paid to the catching-up process of the new member states (NMSs) and the development of regional disparities within the East European countries. Front 1995 to 2004, the EU integration process was marked by an economic catching-up of the NMSs. At the same time, regional within-country disparities in the NMSs have been increasing. Our simulation analysis shows that trade integration has a strong effect on market potentials in East European regions. Comparatively strong changes in market access are supposed to foster the East European catching-up at the national and regional levels. However accounting for these integration effects does not significantly alter the findings of our convergence analysis.","[Schlitte, Friso] HWWI, Hamburg Inst Int Econ, Hamburg, Germany",,,,,"Niebuhr, Annekatrin/0000-0001-8218-0954",,,,,37,24,25,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

As a first step, the paper derives the collusive equilibrium that requires the lowest discount factor in the infinitely repeated game when one firm is vertically integrated. It turns out this is the joint-profit maximum of the colluding firms. The discount factor needed to sustain this equilibrium is then shown to be unambiguously lower than the one needed for collusion in the separated industry. While the previous literature has found it difficult to reconcile raising-rivals'-costs strategies following a vertical merger with equilibrium behavior in the static game, they are subgame perfect in the repeated game studied here.

In the following article the crucial impact parameters of forward electricity prices and the relationship between forward and future spot prices will be assessed by an empirical analysis of electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange and the Nord Pool Power Exchange. In fact, price formation in the considered markets is influenced by historic spot market prices yielding a biased forecasting power of long-term contracts.

The results obtained from Granger causality tests in a vector autoregression framework indicate that: (i) China actually conducted independent monetary policy during the fixed exchange rate period; and (ii) market-oriented policy measures are impotent in influencing real output and prices. The framework of the investigation into the autonomy of monetary policy adapts to the Chinese economic condition that primary loan and deposit rates are set by the central bank.

Unlike in models with exogenous discount rates, steady state equilibria are indeterminate and the set of equilibria is a continuum parameterized by an index of income inequality.

Heckman's classic treatment of selectivity is extended to deal with both heterogeneity and simultaneity. In order to exploit the actual working hours data available in GSOEP, we develop the case of a censored tobit participation model.

Participants are paired in matches with stochastic endings. Each period they receive fixed endowments and one of the pair (randomly-drawn) also receives an additional amount; they can then make voluntary transfers to each other. While smoothing consumption is attractive, only self-enforcing risk sharing is possible. We find evidence supporting the theory: transfers provide insurance to individuals, a higher match continuation probability raises transfers and more risk-averse individuals make larger transfers.

The approach is specifically designed to account for two typical features of aggregate data sets in real options: the endogeneity of firms' decisions; the unobserved heterogeneity of firms. The approach extends the nested fixed point algorithm by Rust [1987. Optimal replacement of GMC bus engines: an empirical model of Harold Zurcher. Econometrica 55(5), 999-1033; 1988. Maximum likelihood estimation of discrete control processes. SIAM journal of Control and Optimization 26(5), 1006-1024] because both the nested optimization algorithm and the integration over the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity are accommodated using a simulation method based on a polynomial approximation of the value function and on recursive least squares estimation of the coefficients. The Monte Carlo Study shows that omitting unobserved heterogeneity produces a significant estimation bias because the model can be highly non-linear with respect to the parameters.

Using the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group, the premium is found uncorrelated with contemporaneous output and lags the business cycle. To account for this observation, the article develops a framework that features search frictions. Agents are either high or low educated, and Firms post two types of vacancies: the complex, which can be matched with the high educated, and the simple, which can be matched with the high and the low educated. On-the-job search for a complex occupation is undertaken by the high educated in simple occupations. An aggregate technological shock induces firms to increase their posting of simple and complex vacancies. As complex vacancies are more costly to create than simple ones, the increase in the former lags that of the latter. As the number of complex vacancies increases with a lag, on-the-job search intensity increases on the expense of the hours of work of the high educated in simple occupations. On the other hand, the total hours of the high educated in complex occupations increases. This lagged cyclical increase in the labor input Of the high educated in complex occupations causes the skill premium to increase with a lag as well.","Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Khalifa, S (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",skhalifa@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We analyze corporate strategies in the emerging global market for liquefied natural gas. First, following Porter, we identify three strategic target market positions: chain optimization, flexibility strategy, and national oil companies (NOCs). Each target market position is supported by an underlying resource profile. Second, following transaction cost economics, we hypothesize that specific investments under uncertainty provide incentives to integrate vertically. We test these economic relationships empirically applying a two-stage procedure. Estimation results show that the three strategic choices of target market position, resource profile, and organizational structure are interrelated. We show that NOCs rely on less idiosyncratic assets than companies following a flexibility strategy and companies following a flexibility strategy rely on less idiosyncratic assets than chain optimizers. An increase in hold-up potential results in a higher probability of a firm organizing transactions within its own hierarchy.","[Ruester, Sophia; Neumann, Anne] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Ruester, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany.",sophia.ruester@tu-dresden.de,"Neumann, Anne/D-8932-2013",,,,,,30,10,11,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Because institutions in developed political economies are interrelated through a complex network of complementarities, institutional change has consequences beyond the area concerned in a reform. This also implies that there are complementarity effects in reforms themselves. A challenge of reform programmes is therefore to achieve a new type of complementarity between reformed institutions. The paper presents empirical evidence questioning the compatibility of the ongoing structural reforms in product and labour markets with the existing institutional structures in some OECD countries. The coherence of the flexicurity strategy, i.e. a combination of labour-market flexibility and a generous welfare state, is also questioned, from the point of view of both economic efficiency and political economy.","[Amable, Bruno] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Amable, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",bruno.amable@ens.fr,,,,,,,32,29,30,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The data include questions about sexual orientation, lying in cyberspace, and a broad range of demographic information. According to the theoretical framework of Gneezy (Am Econ Rev 95: 384-395, 2005) on the economics of deception, individuals conceal or falsify information when the expected benefit of lying exceeds its costs in terms of psychic disutility. If non-heterosexuals expect to benefit more by falsifying information, then this theory predicts higher rates of lying among non-heterosexuals. The data show that gays and lesbians do indeed report lying more often than heterosexuals, both unconditionally in bivariate correlations and after controlling for demographic and geographic differences. These empirical results are consistent with the conclusion that non-heterosexuals expect higher benefits from concealing personal information because of anti-homosexual discrimination.","[Berg, Nathan] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Lien, Donald] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd,GR31, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",nberg@utdallas.edu; don.lien@utsa.edu,,,,,,,29,9,10,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

As a strategy to detect human capital externalities I use Dutch survey data to estimate the impact of the average human capital stock in a region on individual wages, considering regional human capital as a local public good. Indeed, the regional fraction of high-skilled workers or the region's average educational attainment appears with a positive and statistically significant coefficient in an augmented Mincer specification. However, the impact on individual wages completely vanishes when the firm's human capital stock is included as an additional control. This may suggest that human capital externalities predominate within firms, though alternative explanations, in particular selection of high-skilled workers in high-productive companies and imperfect substitutability across skill groups, cannot be ruled out.","[Canton, Erik] European Commiss, Enterprise & Ind Directorate Gen, Unit Econ Anal & Evaluat B4, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Canton, Erik] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Canton, E (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Enterprise & Ind Directorate Gen, Unit Econ Anal & Evaluat B4, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",erik.canton@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,28,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2009,157.0,1,,,,,79,105,,10.1007/s10645-009-9118-5,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,474AQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268255000003,0

For the case of models with one variable we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for uniqueness of a bounded equilibrium and we relate this condition to an alternative, the generalized Taylor principle, suggested by Davig and Leeper. We provide examples of models with multiple bounded and multiple stationary equilibria which suggest that it might be more difficult to rule out non-fundamental equilibria in MSRE models than in the single regime case where the Taylor principle is known to guarantee local uniqueness.","[Farmer, Roger E.

Whereas previous oil price shocks were primarily caused by physical disruptions of supply, the price run-up of 2007-08 was caused by strong demand confronting stagnating world production. Although the causes were different, the consequences for the economy appear to have been similar to those observed in earlier episodes, with significant effects on consumption spending and purchases of domestic automobiles in particular. Absent those declines, it is unlikely that the period 2007Q4-2008Q3 would have been characterized as one of recession for the United States. This episode should thus be added to the list of U.S. recessions to which oil prices appear to have made a material contribution.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Hamilton, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,36,692,800,1,69,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper studies the robustness of the Coase conjecture with respect to these beliefs of consumers. In particular, there is uncertainty over whether the monopolist is committed to a price (i.e. she may be a commitment type). Consequently, consumers are no longer certain that the price will change over time. I consider two kinds of commitment types. A behavioral commitment type charges an exogenously given price, while the rational commitment type optimally chooses a price. I show that the Coase conjecture is robust with regard to uncertainty over the monopolist's commitment. When the probability of behavioral types is sufficiently small, as in the original Coase conjecture, the monopolist earns the competitive profit. When the probability of behavioral types is positive, unlike in the original Coase conjecture, there is positive delay. But the delay disappears as the probability approaches zero. When the commitment type is rational, unless the probability of the commitment type is sufficiently high, both normal and committed monopolists charge the competitive price, and thus there is no delay.","Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kim37@econ.upenn.edu,,"Kim, Kyungmin/0000-0002-7382-4882",,,,,17,4,4,1,10,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We prove that under complete information, payoff vectors of equilibria with truthful schedules coincide with the set of smooth equilibrium payoffs, including non-truthful schedules. We next consider whether the presence of arbitrarily small amounts of asymmetric information is enough to refine this payoff set. Providing that the extensions of the equilibrium schedules beyond the equilibrium point are flatter than truthful schedules, the set of equilibrium payoffs is strictly smaller than the set of smooth (equivalently, truthful) equilibrium payoffs. Interestingly, some forms of asymmetric information do not sufficiently constrain the slopes of the extensions and fail to refine the payoff set. In the case of a uniform distribution of types and arbitrary out-of-equilibrium contributions, the refinement has no bite. If, however, one restricts out-of-equilibrium behavior in a natural way, the refinement is effective. Alternatively, we may consider an exponential distribution with unbounded support (and hence no out-of-equilibrium choices) and we find that the refinement selects a unique equilibrium payoff vector equal to Lindahl prices. As a separate contribution, equilibria with forcing contracts are also considered both under complete and asymmetric information. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This was important for our analysis since, as sometimes happens in finite samples, the estimated variance-covariance matrix was not positive semi-definite.

Because the margins on energy commodities can be substantial, ignoring these domestic margins has important consequences when analyzing the impacts of policies designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. This paper incorporates domestic trade and transport margins into the GTAP-E model. which has previously been used to analyze climate change policies. Models that do not explicitly incorporate domestic margins over-estimate the reduction in CO(2) emissions from a given carbon tax or under-estimate the level of a carbon tax needed to achieve a specific abatement target when domestic margins are fixed or when the carbon tax is treated as a consumption tax with variable domestic margins. However, this result can be reversed when the carbon tax is treated as an output tax with variable domestic margins. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, when stock prices approach the floor limits, we observe lower than normal market conditions' trading volume and trade size but a wider spread. The panic selling psychology of individual investors for fear of illiquidity and the strategic trading decisions of discretionary traders during periods prior to price limit hits at the floors are conjectured as possible explanations for the observed price behaviors. Post-limit-hit analysis reveals evidence of delayed price discovery at the ceiling limit but price reversal at the floor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

First, firms choose their coverage. Then, they choose the quality of the mail. Finally, firms choose the price. I modify the traditional model of product differentiation proposed by Mussa and Rosen [Mussa, M., Rosen, S., 1978. Monopoly and product quality. Journal of Economic Theory 18, 301-317] in order to consider that firms decide their quality and coverage. Valletti et al. [Valletti, T., Hoernig, S., Barros, P., 2002. Universal service and entry: the role of uniform pricing and coverage constraints. Journal of Regulatory Economics 21 (2), 169-190] show that when an incumbent is regulated by a uniform pricing constraint the entrant will choose a low level of coverage to increase the incumbent's uniform price and weaken competition. In this paper, I show that by increasing product differentiation, the entrant can obtain the same price increase with a smaller reduction of coverage. Acknowledgement of the strategic link between quality and coverage can be very useful in the design of a regulatory policy. The paper also considers a mixed duopoly in which the public firm covers the entire market and offers high quality service. In this context, I explain that the mixed equilibrium implements the first-best qualities and coverage levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This effect is pronounced for routes with consumers characterized by relatively heterogeneous elasticities of demand. On routes with a homogeneous customer base, the effects of competition on price dispersion are smaller. Our results contrast with those of Borenstein and Rose, who found that price dispersion increases with competition.

This article first describes a conventional production function approach to the creation of knowledge of African countries in terms of a relative and indirect measure of the quantity of dissertations (D). Second, it assesses the imputed values of knowledge. In the first instance it finds that relative income (Y), population (N), openness (Z), and technical factors (A) are central to the production of knowledge of African countries. In the second instance, the imputed values of knowledge are positive, but of modest magnitude. The results recommend more investment in the production of knowledge of African countries, improved openness, and especially reduced opportunity cost of knowledge creation which now differs widely across countries, and averages 10.7%.

Using a novel dataset of regional inflation rates from six euro area countries, we examine the size and persistence of their differentials and find that they appear to be related to factor market distortions and other structural characteristics, rather than to cyclical and growth dynamics. Our empirical analysis shows that only about half of inflation rates variation is accounted for by area-wide factors such as monetary policy or oil price developments. National factors (such as labour market institutions) still play a very important role, and a regional component accounts for about 18% of inflation variability.","[Beck, Guenter W.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany; European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Frankfurt, Germany; Bocconi Univ, European Univ Inst, Mainz, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; European Central Bank,"Beck, GW (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany.",,,"Marcellino, Massimiliano/0000-0002-8737-2768",,,,,45,59,62,2,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Essentially, the allocation under the Shapley value solution rewards each time period of the asset's useful life with a share of the earnings that corresponds to its responsibility in the earnings-generating process. The latter is thus consistent with the developments in accounting standards, which maintain that the depreciation and amortization methods should reflect the pattern in which the asset's economic benefits are consumed by the enterprise. We show that the Shapley solution always conforms to a set of fundamental accounting requirements such as the matching principle and the impairment test. Moreover, unless the asset is associated with constant revenues and/or extremely profitable investments, the Shapley value solution can never coincide with the prevalent straight-line depreciation method. Finally, we identify the family of earnings patterns for which the Shapley solution coincides with the equal surplus and the economic depreciation methods.","[Ben-Shahar, Danny] Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Sulganik, Eyal] Interdisciplinary Ctr, Herzliyya, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Reichman University,"Ben-Shahar, D (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",dannyb@technion.ac.il; sulganik@idc.ac.il,,"Ben-Shahar, Danny/0000-0002-9077-993X",,,,,20,2,2,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We employ a GARCH model with a smoothly time-varying correlation to estimate the date of change and the speed of the transition between the low and high correlation regimes. Our test produces strong evidence of greater comovement across the board for both stock markets and government bond markets. Dates of change and speeds of adjustment vary widely across country linkages. Stock market integration is a more gradual process than bond market integration. The impact of European monetary union (EMU) is rather limited, as it has mainly affected the timing of bond market correlation gains (but hardly their size) and has had little discernible effect on stock market integration.","[Berben, Robert-Paul] Nederlandsche Bank, Econ & Res Div, Ansterdamr, Netherlands; [Jansen, W.

We argue that the missing political support for anti-corruption policies is due to a lack of economic and financial reforms. Our model is based on the fact that corrupt officials have to pay entry fees to get lucrative positions. In a probabilistic voting model, we show that this, together with the lack of economic opportunities, makes anti-corruption policies less likely. Compared to a reformed economy, more voters are part of the corrupt system and, more importantly, rents from corruption are distributed differently. Economic liberalization increases the support for anti-corruption measures. The additional effect of financial liberalization is ambiguous.","[Boerner, Kira] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Boerner, K (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",kira@dr-boerner.de; hainz@ifo.de,,,,,,,33,15,17,1,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The model is segmented according to trip purpose, and a mixed - or error component - logit model is estimated. Estimation draws on stated preference data collected from drivers travelling toward the city centre during morning peak hours. The study uncovers drivers' preferences for scheduled delay, unexpected delay, travel time and cost as well the patterns of substitution between mode and time of day alternatives. The result indicates that disutility of unexpected delay depends on the scheduled deviation from preferred arrival time. The preference for scheduled delay is roughly proportional to the time shift and varies in the population, but is much more consistent within an individual. Another finding is that constraints at the destination mainly restrict late arrival, whereas constraints at the origin mainly restrict early departure.","[Borjesson, Maria] Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Börjesson, M (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",maria.borjessonn@wspgroup.se,,"Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232",Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA); Swedish Road Administration,Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA)(Vinnova); Swedish Road Administration,"This research was funded by the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) and the Swedish Road Administration.

In this work, an analysis of the number of wine types consumed by residents of Tenerife is carried out, with an aim to observe which characteristics determine the exclusivity in its consumption, given the current context of increased competition in this sector. The specific characteristics of the considered variable allow the study to cover two aspects. The first is methodological, and is seen by the variety of models that may be considered in this case. This focus consists in comparing several possibilities, which fit the type of count data involved. The second aspect is clearly empirical, and is based on the description of not only the most appropriate decision-making mechanism for the study but in the identification of those factors that explain the diversity in wine consumption.","[Cano Fernandez, V.

The seminal article of Mankiw, Miron and Weil (1987) argues that changes in the behaviour of nominal interest rates is best explained as a monetary regime shift that occurred with the founding of the Federal reserve in 1914. This explanation is rejected by Newbold, Lehybourne, Sollis and Wohar (2001) who show that fiscal and regulatory changes (driven by the needs of World War1 financing) best explain the changing behaviour of interest rates that they identify as beginning in mid-1917. We find, using three different statistical procedures that a structural break in the second moment of interest rates occurred in early 1915. This supports the monetary regime shift argument of MMW by illustrating that the interest rate smoothing policies of the FED can be observed as a variance break in short term interest rates.","[Caporale, Tony] Univ Dayton, Dept Econ & Finance, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Choi, Kyongwook] Univ Seoul, Seoul 130743, South Korea",University System of Ohio; University of Dayton; University of Seoul,"Caporale, T (通讯作者)，Univ Dayton, Dept Econ & Finance, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",caporale@udayton.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

[Landsberger, M., Rubinstein, J., Wolfstetter, E., Zamir,S., 2001. First-price auctions when the ranking of valuations is common knowledge. Review of Economic Design 6, 461-480] identified optimal bidder behavior in first-price private-value auctions when the ranking of valuations is common knowledge, and they derived comparative-statics predictions regarding the auctioneer's expected revenue and the efficiency of the allocation. The experiment reported here tests the behavioral components of these comparative-statics predictions. The results support the prediction that buyers are inclined to bid more aggressively when they learn they have the low value. Contrary to the theory, buyers are inclined to bid less when they learn they have the high value.

Potential SME benefits and firm and sector-specific strategies drive the adoption and use of ICT. Furthermore, sectors are increasingly global and dominated by large firms and the structure of their values chains and operations shape opportunities for SMEs. Principal reasons for non-adoption are lack of applicability and little incentive to change business models when returns are unclear. SMEs also face generic barriers to adoption including trust and transaction security and IPR concerns, and challenges in areas of management skills, technological capabilities, productivity and competitiveness. The issues for governments throughout the European Union (EU) are to foster appropriate business environments for eBusiness and ICT uptake, and target programs to overcome market failures to the extent that they are needed in particular areas (e.g. skill formation, specialized information). Governments have a range of SME eBusiness and internet use programs. However, commercial considerations and potential returns are the principal drivers of SME adoption and profitable use. The key drivers for enabling eBusiness development are commitment and support of industry associations, in particular in sectoral initiatives, synergies by having access to resources from other initiatives or organizations, competitive pressure and ease of participation. The key barriers slowing ICT adoption are competition among companies in the target group, Lack of awareness, often combined with mistrust regarding ICT and ICT service providers, costs, lack of internal ICT and management knowledge, Network infrastructure issues: access and interoperability, Legal uncertainties. The European Commission has identified 3 factors that make it difficult for SMEs, in particular, to engage more fully with ICT and develop sustainable business practices: 1) the relatively high costs associated with investments in ICT; 2) the lack of technical and managerial skills and; 3) reluctance on the part of SMEs to network with other enterprises. The proposed frame-work summarizes the main policy directions derived from the analysis and the key areas of eBusiness support - Business environment, Skills upgrading, Network infrastructure, Trust infrastructure, Digital products and information services, Intangible investments and assets, Information, Government on-line. Finally the paper maps proposed key eBusiness support areas around key dimensions of eBusiness (functional, sectoral, and regional/spatial) on three distinct levels (micro: the level of the firm, meso: the level of the region, and macro: national/international).","[Gatautis, Rimantas; Vitkauskaite, Elena] Kaunas Univ Technol, Econ & Management Fac, Dept Mkt Management, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gatautis, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Econ & Management Fac, Dept Mkt Management, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rgataut@ktu.lt; elevitk@ktu.lt,"Vitkauskaitė, Elena/A-7574-2010","Vitkauskaitė, Elena/0000-0003-3421-4093",,,,,26,13,16,0,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This methodological approach would be expected to yield an exact analog, in terms of optimal levels of public good provision, to efficient provision of private goods in a perfect market setting. There is, however, a potentially serious flaw in the approach as actually practiced, since initial incomes are implicitly-and wrongly-taken to be optimal. From a given income, the output demand revelation problem has long been recognized-that there will be difficulty inferring true demands for public goods at that income (the traditional `free rider' problem). But what has failed to receive widespread recognition among theoreticians, and especially among practitioners, is that there will also be a concomitant `input demand revelation' problem. In any situation where workers cannot individually increment a class of goods by increasing their income (e.g. public goods), they will have no incentive to generate the income that would have been devoted to that class of goods. They will only generate income that is optimal to pay the higher taxes or prices associated with whatever initial public goods levels are provided. As a consequence, the benefit-cost practitioner will, even if somehow able to accurately guess marginal willingness-to-pay out of current income, observe only one apparent optima. There are an infinite number of such optima, one for each level of free riding in input markets, where aggregated marginal willingness-to-pay will appear to equal marginal provision cost. The one true Samuelson `optimum optimorum' occurs when there is free riding in neither output nor input markets (that is, when the `full' demand revelation problem is solved). As a consequence, pure public goods, as well as other `non-incrementable' goods and goods for which non-use values are of importance will be undervalued, hence under-provided. Evidence is presented that the problem raised here might be of importance, undermining the practical significance of the Coase theorem vis-a-vis Pigouvian taxation.","Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Graves, PE (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",philip.graves@colorado.edu,"Graves, Philip E/N-4552-2013",,,,,,15,8,9,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The nature of supply obviously also influences local housing-market dynamics. Recent research has shown that differences in the elasticity of housing supply can account for the wide variation in new construction volatility (but not price volatility) across markets over time.

The implication of this argument being that movements in the money supply provide little useful information about medium-to-long-term inflationary developments. We argue otherwise. Our basic premise is that there is a stable demand-for-money function but that the models that have been used to estimate South African money demand are not well specified because they do not include a measure of wealth. Using two empirical methodologies-025EFa co-integrated vector equilibrium correction approach and a time-varying coefficient approach-025EFwe find that a demand-for-money function that includes wealth is stable.

A major impediment to economic development, especially in the poor, remote Western region, is the shortage of a transportation infrastructure. The Chinese government has committed to substantial investment for improving the accessibility of this vast, land-locked region as a mechanism for promoting its development. The paper examines the impacts of the intended transportation infrastructure build-up on the Western region's comparative advantage and its interregional trade. The World Trade Model is extended to represent this investment and applied to determine interregional trade in China based on region-specific technologies, factor endowments and prices, and consumption patterns as well as the capacities and costs of carrying goods among regions using the interregional transportation infrastructure in place in the base year of 1997 and that planned for 2010 and 2020. The model is implemented for three regions, 27 sectors, and seven factors. The results indicate that the planned infrastructure build-up will be cost-effective, will increase benefits especially for the Western region, and that it can conserve energy overall at given levels of demand but substitute oil for coal. Based on these and other model results, some recommendations are offered about strategies for regional development in China.","[He, Lining; Duchin, Faye] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"He, LN (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",lininghetroy@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,28,30,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The investment decisions maximise social welfare while observing a probabilistic guardrail for global mean temperature rise under uncertain technology and climate parameters. Such a guardrail constitutes a chance constraint, and the resulting optimisation problem is an instance of chance constrained programming, not stochastic programming as often employed. Our analysis of a model of economic growth and endogenous technological change, MIND, suggests that stringent mitigation strategies cannot guarantee a very high probability of limiting warming to 2 degrees C since preindustrial time under current uncertainty about climate sensitivity and climate response time scale. Achieving the 2 degrees C temperature target with a probability P* of 75% requires drastic carbon dioxide emission cuts. This holds true even though we have assumed an aggressive mitigation policy on other greenhouse gases from, e.g., the agricultural sector. The emission cuts are deeper than estimated from a deterministic calculation with climate sensitivity fixed at the P* quantile of its marginal probability distribution (3.6 degrees C). We show that earlier and cumulatively larger investments into the renewable sector are triggered by including uncertainty in the technology and climate response time scale parameters. This comes at an additional GWP loss of 0.3%, resulting in a total loss of 0.8% GWP for observing the chance constraint. We obtained those results with a new numerical scheme to implement constrained welfare optimisation under uncertainty as a chance constrained programming problem in standard optimisation software such as GAMS.

Recent U.S. home price growth closely tracked increases in other developed economies. The analysis distinguishes among market regions in terms of supply elasticity and localized transactions-costs. A series of user-cost models are presented which imply that interest rate fluctuations must figure prominently in any explanation of movements in price/rent ratios. National factors such as the expansion of subprime credit must also be accounted for. The paper concludes with policy prescriptions addressing rapid price declines and elevated interest-rate spreads. We argue that the federal government should play a leading role in helping to reduce interest rates on new mortgages and cushion against underwriting losses on the existing balance sheets of lenders.,"[Hubbard, R.

Yet there are still countless debates as to some fundamental questions that refer to the thorough understanding of a world developing under the sign of globalization: what it is? Can it be defined? What are the factors that influence it? And maybe the most interesting, how are these factors influenced by it? This essay aims at critically discussing the factors that have shaped and influenced processes of globalization, multinationalization and trade flows since 1980. The three notions are interrelated, as globalization is characterized by three main routes: international trade, foreign direct investment and international cooperative agreements. The essay will start by trying to define the concept of globalization, seen from different perspectives as to what it entails and when it has begun. The essay will then continue by analyzing the views on the main factors - political, economic, social, technological - that have impacted globalization: of particular importance are the technological revolution and the economic revolution that have taken place in the last decades. The factors presented in this essay are interrelated. Furthermore, they do not simply influence globalization, but are also influenced in return by it.

Administrative methods for running an economy, with economic planning foremost among them, were inseparably linked to the collapse of the socialist system and, in essence, were held responsible for it. Thus, although the dominant economic paradigm has once again failed to deliver in recent years, the research for other methods fell into oblivion along with the system they were attached to. This work represents an attempt to reconsider the potential of economic planning as a means of organizing an economy at various levels, at various degrees and in various environments. I shall try to illustrate that the blame for the collapse of different socialist systems should not have fallen on the systemic deficiencies of economic planning but, instead, on the political institutions responsible for its application. In addition, I will stress that economic planning has been condemned by non-economic parameters and the application of wrong planning methods.

The motive is to see if standard conjectures about possible determinants have broad support across these countries. While the evidence provides some support to theoretical predictions, statistical significance appears limited. Given mixed results, a large component of fluctuations in the trade balance and financial flows appears to be random in developing countries. Such randomness limits the ability of policy makers to interpret cyclical variations in components of the balance of payments. Moreover, this randomness raises concerns about the sustainability of a widening trade deficit and sources of financing in many developing countries.","Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Mkandil@imf.org,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

To achieve this, the causes of severe accidents on construction sites have been analyzed factors which cause accidents at work in construction companies have been studied; a comprehensive literature review has been made, assesing all statistical data and employee health and safety improvement perspectives as well as their application in construction practice. The selection problem is stated as a mathematical multipurpose solution making task. It expresses the management solution making problem mathematically. Investigation of severe accidents on construction sites shows that over two thirds of accidents are caused by poor work organization, lack of supervision and control as well as underestimation of professional risks. This high level of injuries is brought about not only by noncompliance with employees' health and safety requirements, but also by factors and violations having to do with traffic, noncompliance with fire and electricity safety requirements, lack of work discipline, which is mainly displayed by usage of alcohol at work, as well as other causes. Other important factors that directly impact the number of accidents in the construction sector are the lack of training and knowledge as well as the lack of awareness of safe execution of assigned work. Studies of the dependencies between workplace accidents and their causes show that the prevailing accidents are the following: high falls, collisions with vehicles, stumbling and falling as well as falling objects. They usually result in severe and lethal outcomes. The paper emphasizes that work safety in various building construction activities can be achieved not only by collective and individual means, evaluation of professional risk, employee briefing on safety measures, but also by efficient work organization and appropriate working environment. To implement the above mentioned, the most effective solution must be found. One of the methods used to determine the priorities of safe operation in a construction company is the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method The effectiveness level of safety solutions for a construction process depends on numerous quantitative and qualitative indices affecting the process; their impact is evaluated in terms of their value and significance. Since the significance of quantitative and qualitative indices depends on their values, the latter should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, it is necessary to coordinate the significances of quantitative and qualitative indices in terms of their value and significance. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, the authors developed an integrated index significance determination method, in view of their quantitative and qualitative characteristics. The paper discusses the selection of objects and indicators that are under consideration. An anonymous survey was carried out with the help of questionnaires designed for the purpose. Six average-size construction companies engaged in constructing individual dwelling-houses participated in the survey. A single-storey house with an attic and no basement was selected as a study object.","[Liaudanskiene, Rita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Studentu Str 48, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ustinovichius, Leonas; Bogdanovicius, Aleksejus] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Liaudanskiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Studentu Str 48, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rita2290@gmail.com; leonasu@st.vgtu.lt; a.bogdanovicius@gmail.com,"Ustinovičius, Leonas/AAH-8369-2020","Ustinovicius, Leonas/0000-0002-0027-5501",,,,,52,36,37,1,37,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Hence doctors' efforts to help patient understand and interpret medical information by efficiently communicating with patient might enhance the patient's ability to utilize relevant medical information by which the patient's use of medical care would be affected. Furthermore, by manipulating doctor's payment method, doctor's effort of effectively communicating with patient would be affected and in turn patient's medical care use would be affected. This research seeks to determine whether a doctor's effort mentioned above can affect the patient's use of medical care, and in the policy perspective, whether the doctor's payment method can affect effort level provided to patients. The empirical results suggest the doctor's rate of supply-side cost sharing, representing a doctor's financial constraint, has a statistically significant positive effect on doctor's effort level and the doctor's effort level in turn has a statistically significant negative effect on medical care use of those patients who are prone to overuse it.","Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lim, JY (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",jylimecon@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,12,1,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

For this purpose, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model that captures empirical links between CO2 emissions associated with energy use, the rate and direction of technical change and the economy. We specify CO2 capture and storage (CCS) as the backstop technology whose arrival is anticipated or not. We find a negative value of information in that the discounted welfare loss associated with the emission reduction is lower if CCS is not anticipated. CO2 shadow prices are then relatively high in the years before the CCS has arrived. By not simply waiting with the emission reduction until CCS has arrived, one relies more on economy wide technical change and its welfare enhancing technology externalities in turn allowing for a higher steady state. We believe that policy makers should thus be prudent in designing CO2 emission reduction policy and be careful not to let polluters become complacent by postponing some of their emission reduction efforts awaiting the silver bullet technology on the horizon.

However, existing analytical solutions of stochastic fisheries models have been produced only under highly simplified economic and biological conditions. The main contribution of this paper is to derive under general conditions a policy function for the management of a stochastic fishery. Our model includes general specifications of demand and cost relationships and a stochastic biological growth function with serially-correlated shocks. Applying methods from the theory of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling and multivariate linear expectational difference equations, we derive a linear approximation of the solution to the model. Our main result is a reduced-form expression for an approximation to optimal escapement, which is shown to be a function of the current stock, past environmental shocks, and model parameters. This theoretically-grounded policy function has intuitive appeal, yields insights into comparative statics, and provides a theoretically-grounded, practical starting point for fisheries management.","[McGough, Bruce; Plantinga, Andrew J.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Oregon State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"McGough, B (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",bruce.mcgough@oregonstate.edu; plantinga@oregonstate.edu; costello@bren.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,36,10,10,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This appears to suggest that prices are overvalued. However, alternative valuation models based upon comparing bond and equity yields suggest that, if anything, prices are undervalued. This paper seeks to provide answers to this seeming paradox. Preliminary results suggest non-stationarity of the dividend yield and bond yield-equity yield differential, although the yield ratio is possibly stationary, casting doubt on mean reversion. Evidence from structural breakpoint testing suggests that all measures have been subjected to several mean level shifts throughout the sample period, and notably within the last decade, such that each series now fluctuates around a mean level lower than that experienced previously. Thus, the lower dividend yield and lower bond-equity ratio do not necessarily imply equity mispricing but that concepts of pre-existing normal levels no longer apply. In explaining why higher equity prices are supported, we note that the last decade has seen a period of historically low and stable inflation and interest rates. Further, there is a strong positive relationship between inflation and the dividend yield. This more stable economic environment has led to more accurate valuation of stocks and lower required rates of return, thus supporting higher prices.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"McMillan, DG (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, Gateway, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland.",dgm6@st-andrews.ac.uk,"McMillan, David/H-5211-2019","McMillan, David/0000-0002-5891-4193",,,,,50,4,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A well-known cost structure and cost generators represent significant pre-conditions for defining cost optimization strategy in an airline company. Airline company management has a limited set of tools for cost managing, which include the following documents: Performance Engineers' Manual and Aircraft Flight Manual. In this particular paper review we discuss the problem of vertical flight path of turbo-fan aircraft, where we point out the impact of the choice of climb technique on the overall en route flight profile costs. In temporary aircraft flight preparation process, there is no stressing out the significance of the climb phase in minimizing costs of this particular flight phase. in the paper we show the procedure of defining optimal climbing resulting minimum costs, but also optimal function operational adjustment to the climb schedule. This way of the approximation of optimal function and its adjustment to the operational use enables the application of minimal cost climbing technique in operational use of transportation aircraft. On short-haul flights, climb phase can reduce cruise flight length up to 60% of total range. in the paper, we show the impact of climb regime on flight profile of turbo-fan aircraft considering the usage of time, fuel and costs. The impact is shown according to the data taken from the Performance Engineers Manual. The impact stresses the importance of minimum costs climbing regime to cutting down total flight costs. it also shows the conditions which need to be fulfilled in order to apply minimum costs climbing technique. We identify the scope of CAS speed during climb and TOC for flight's minimum total expenses by using minimum costs climbing technique. Conditions for achieving minimum costs climbing technique are the results of the logarithmic differential. In order to achieve optimal numerical results we used Newton-Raphson formula.","[Mirosavljevic, Petar; Gvozdenovic, Slobodan; Cokorilo, Olja] Univ Belgrade, Fac Traff & Transport Engn, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Mirosavljevic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Traff & Transport Engn, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",perami@sf.bg.ac.rs,"Cokorilo, Olja/AAT-8864-2020","Cokorilo, Olja/0000-0002-3871-504X",,,,,14,2,2,0,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The first has to do with the scale-effects these matrices suffer from. The second refers to the need of dichotomising the matrices. Through an illustrative application to six OECD countries in the mid-1990s, the paper shows that, as for the former problem, different relativisation procedures can be, and have been, used, which either tend to alter the actual meaning of standard SNA indicators, or do not properly take into account the actual composition of countries' final demand. As for the latter problem, the paper shows that the choice of discrete cut-offs is extremely sensitive, as comparative results actually change along the continuum of the matrices values. In order to overcome the scale problem, a new relativisation procedure is put forward that measures innovation flows embodied in a unit value basket of final demand and thus properly retains all the information provided by the original matrix of intersectoral innovation (embodied) flows. In addressing the problem of dichotomisation, the paper suggests, as a second best, to work with density distributions that can make the choice of discrete cut-off values less arbitrary.","[Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Vittucci Marzetti, Giuseppe] Univ Trent, Dept Econ, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Trento,"Montresor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",sandro.montresor@unibo.it,"Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/AAG-2246-2020; Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019","Marzetti, Giuseppe Vittucci/0000-0003-3093-8000; montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",,,,,37,20,24,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

From another perspective, hedge funds are heavily using crack spread to speculate in oil markets. Based on the high volume of crack spread futures trading in oil markets, the question we want to raise is whether the crack spread futures can be a good predictor of oil price movements. We investigated first whether there is a causal relationship between the crack spread futures and the spot oil markets in a vector error correction framework. We found the causal impact of crack spread futures on spot oil market both in the long- and the short-run after April 2003 where we detected a structural break in the model. To examine the forecasting performance, we use the random walk model (RWM) as a benchmark, and we also evaluate the forecasting power of crack spread futures against the crude oil futures. The results showed that (a) both the crack spread futures and the crude oil futures outperformed the RWM: and (b) the crack spread futures are almost as good as the crude oil futures in predicting the movements in spot oil markets.

The returns to experience lag behind in the East German labour market, even almost 20 years after unification, with significant differences particularly for high-skill workers. The results are robust when only individuals who started their labour market career in the market economy are considered.

Defining a series of indices aimed at capturing the speed, magnitude and efficiency of employment reallocation, the work assesses the extent to which these countries have succeeded in converging towards distributions of sectoral employment similar to those in the old EU members. The work shows that, overall, the CEE countries have made progress towards reallocating jobs from the oversized labor intensive sectors, characteristic of the early years of transition, such as agriculture and heavy industries, towards the services sector. However, convergence has been relatively slow and its pace has been different from country to country. Bulgaria emerges as the country where the fastest restructuring has taken place, and in the right direction. Romania, in particular, appears to have made least progress, although it is also moving in the right direction. The still large agricultural sector, which continued to hire around 30% of the occupied population in 2007, remains an area which will require further and massive restructuring. As of 2007, in the case of Romania, around 40% of the jobs expected to be created in the growing sectors, computed by benchmarking actual job destruction and job creation against the comparator economy, have occurred. The figure increases to over 50%, when the distortive effect of agriculture is removed. At the same time, over 90% of the job destruction and creation took place in the appropriate direction, towards the comparator EU employment distribution.",,,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In this paper, we have investigated the manner in which price and non-price factor affect these three criteria, based upon a model of rational variety choice. The model is empirically implemented using translog profit functions and a switching regression framework, and applied to a cross-sectional farm-level dataset of Bangladeshi farms for the 1996 crop year. Results indicate that rice prices, land availability, irrigation, rural infrastructure, labour wages and prices of animal power services are important factors, while fertilizer price plays a marginal role. Given these results, the policy of liberalization of agricultural inputs (particularly fertilizers) and reforms to maintain high rice prices during harvest seasons appear sound since these allow producers to receive rice prices close to world levels without burdening the government with input subsidies. Result also shows that educated Bangladeshi farmers substitute their time inputs away from agriculture, resulting in lower HYV adoption, farm profitability and rice supply.","[Rahman, Sanzidur; Shankar, Bhavani] Univ Plymouth, Fac Social Sci & Business, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Rahman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Plymouth, Fac Social Sci & Business, Sch Geog, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",srahman@plymouth.ac.uk,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020; Embrett, Mark G./H-4466-2014","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191; Embrett, Mark G./0000-0002-3969-0219",,,,,30,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Using a panel of US import data between the years of 1997 and 2005, I find that reductions in preference margins will significantly diminish imports of some products, particularly from lower-middle and low income countries; for example, a 1% reduction in the US tariff on a product that is currently imported duty-free from developing countries will decrease imports of that product from lower-middle income countries by an average of 2.6%. However, many products produced by developing countries fail to qualify for preferential tariffs, thus a gradual reduction in all US tariff rates is expected to have only a modest impact on trade flows from developing countries.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Reynolds, KM (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",reynolds@american.edu,,"Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384",,,,,15,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper uses a Computable General Equilibrium simulation model to construct long-run taxable income elasticities. The model differs from most previous simulation analyses of tax policy by its inclusion of endogenous, profit-motivated Research and Development and innovation. The results indicate that (i) taxable income elasticities can be relatively large, even if tax rate changes initially have only modest effects on labor supply and saving; (ii) total taxable income could be much more responsive to the corporate tax than to the individual taxi and (iii) the elasticities are substantially larger under endogenous innovation than under exogenous innovation. Together the results indicate an increase in the likelihood that the incidence of capital income taxes shifts away from capital as economies evolve toward higher levels of innovation.","Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Russo, B (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",brusso@uncc.edu,,,,,,,64,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Rising sophistication of stakeholders and environment, sharp competition, growing demand for corporate transparency and social responsibility determined increase in caring about corporate reputation with new challenge of 21st century: not just caring intuitively of it, but managing it- an issue that was considered for a long time to be unmeasurable and unmanageable - systematically and purposefully. In academic world corporate reputation is rather a fresh concept with scare comprehensive researches both in theoretical and empirical levels. It should be admitted that, despite universal acknowledgment of the importance of corporate reputation and its great potential to impact corporate strategy success, corporate reputation as a research object still lacks deeper conceptualizing. Due to fragmentary research and lack of multidisciplinary approach, the question what is reputation, and what is not, may appear not so clear and simple as it may seem (Mahon, 2002). Therefore, ascertaining principal definitions in this field is the first step towards starting up further researches of corporate reputation, its measuring and managing. The paper presents discussion and critical review of the interpretations of the concept of corporate reputation in different disciplines - psychology, sociology, impression management, economy, marketing, public relations, business strategy, human resource management - and highlights its exceptional multidisciplinary richness and bare agreement among researchers on what its real range is. Obviously, every discussed discipline brings meaningful input to seeking integrative approach to corporate reputation: from explaining its role and potential in the market up to researching the processes of establishment and analyzing a company's abilities to shape its reputation. On the base of retrospective analysis of definitions of corporate reputation, some trends in development of the definition are presented and the principal keywords ascertained. With reference to them, corporate reputation is defined as a socially transmissible overall company's evaluation settled among stakeholders over a long period of time, that represents expectations for the company's actions and level of trustworthiness, favorability and acknowledgement in comparison with its rivals. Revealing relational differences between corporate reputation and image is presented as another step in seeking comprehensive definition of corporate reputation for the two constructs are the fuzziest ones. The differences and links between the two constructs are interpreted by researchers far not alike. Yet the following key dimensions separating the constructs might be pointed out: duration of establishment, target, and instruments of creating ones, deepness of perception and abilities to change it. Corporate image is due to one's sudden associations of a company, whereas reputation is deep, settled over a period of time belief in a company's abilities to act in one or another way.","[Smaiziene, Ingrida; Jucevicius, Robertas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Smaiziene, I (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 20, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ingrida.smaiziene@ktu.lt; robertas.jucevicius@ktu.lt,,,,,,,39,30,33,3,42,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It also documents that the timing strategies do not increase firm value and do not affect announcement effects of long-term debt offerings.

Unqualified statements about the costs and merits of diversity are unwarranted, as racial heterogeneity increases productivity within many, but not all, industries. Sectors employing a large number of workers responsible for creative decision making and customer service experience gains from diversity, while industries characterized by high levels of group effort suffer losses.

This paper advances an alternative explanation, rooted in the ideas of Veblen, that emphasises the role of lifestyle conformity: Because people tend to adopt lifestyles common to their social group and modify them in standard ways as they age, lifecycle norms impart a certain order to the accumulation of assets and liabilities, which enables people to 'do' lifecycle saving via habitual thinking. After laying out the argument conceptually, the paper provides empirical evidence on the role of conformity in lifecycle saving and discusses its contribution to the current low saving rate in the USA.","American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Starr, MA (通讯作者)，American Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mstarr@american.edu,,,,,,,42,8,10,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Stakeholder approach in the organization integrates stakeholder relationships within a company's resource base, industry setting, and sociopolitical arena into a single analytical framework. The key relationships for a business go far beyond the relationships with its customers and include the relationships with its employees, as well as those with suppliers and partners, investors and market analysts, and even government regulators, trade associations and other entities that influence the general business climate in which a given business operates. In all cases stakeholders are inseparable part of management strategy. This concept helps people and organizations to agree upon joint goals, participation, boundaries and benefit, i.e. flexibly to plan the activity. Organizations generate intellectual, environmental, and social capital in addition to financial capital. In successful organizations, the three core elements of strategy, structure, and culture are aligned and respond to external forces and changing expectations. The relationships among core elements are dynamic and adaptive, both in relation to each other and in relation to the overall fit between the organization and its environment. A comprehensive orientation toward stakeholder management penetrates the core of the organization; in the redefined organization, all the three elements and their alignment reflects the underlying humanistic commitment to the organization's stakeholders. A clear demonstration that management possesses and intends to implement a compelling vision of the enterprise - who we are, and what we stand for - provides the essential foundation for effective stakeholder management. Organization-stakeholder relations lead to new ideas about the responsibilities of organizations, the role of managers, and the most appropriate management style. Seeing organizations and their relationship with stakeholders from a systems perspective helps us understand that organizations, as organic systems, undergo self-regulation and renewal through interactions with diverse parts of their environment. The more dynamic view of organization-stakeholder relations acknowledges the interdependence that exists between companies and their stakeholders and asserts that stakeholder relationships can be a source of opportunity and competitive advantage rather than simply threat or drain on organizational resources. However, for most companies, the attention of management has been focused on one stakeholder group at a time. Collaborative approaches are often confined to specific parts of an organization. Rare is the company that adopts a comprehensive and strategic approach to relationship building that is governed both by deep social values and by recognition of the bottom line.","[Susniene, Dalia; Sargunas, Gediminas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Susniene, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Klaipedos Str 1, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania.",dalia.susniene@ktu.lt; g_sargunas@panko.lt,"Susniene, Dalia/A-1626-2016","Susniene, Dalia/0000-0003-1639-7180",,,,,30,8,13,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Our estimates suggest that, for the six countries, long-term RER behaviour depends essentially on economic specificity of each country and in particular on their degree of financial integration and trade opening.

Both the preliminary analysis performed by examining time series plots of real exchange rates and the results of the panel unit root tests indicate that the PPP does not hold for PNG.

Via conjoint analysis, we can know what attribute is important to the consumer and what attribute combination of game is the most desirable in the consumer's mind. The results can be further used in enterprises' decision-making to promote the development of industry.","[Zhang Zhiyuan] Xiamen Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,thecraneinsky@163.com,"zhang, zhiyuan/GRS-2141-2022; zhang, ZY/HJH-6535-2023",,,,,,3,0,0,0,8,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-071-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,76,79,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQC52,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280689800018,0

Since 1973, landowners have not been permitted to use ALR land for nonagricultural purposes, prompting some to seek recovery of development option value by applying for exclusion from the ALR. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and a binary choice (logit) model, this study examines factors that impact the acceptance of ALR exclusion applications. With data from two regions in southwestern BC, we find that applications are more likely to be approved when the land is closer to the major highway, has a smaller parcel size, consists of a smaller portion of the total parcel area, or has poorer quality soils. Therefore, as intended by public policy, agricultural capability is a key determinant in exclusion decisions, retaining properties of greater agricultural value in the ALR. Even though public opinion has suggested otherwise, the political party in power at the time of the decision was only a weak factor, mostly moderated by the number of applications in a given year. A spatial-effects model found no evidence of spatial autocorrelation, supporting the conclusions drawn from the nonspatial model estimations.","[Eagle, Alison J.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Inst Environm Policy Solut, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stobbe, Tracy E.] Trinity Western Univ, Sch Business, Langley, BC V2Y 1Y1, Canada; [Cotteleer, Geerte] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Kooten, G.

This paper uses establishment-level data to test the hypothesis that Canadian beef packers use oligopsony power to pay lower prices for cattle than those which would prevail in a competitive market. A four-equation econometric system is estimated using generalized method of moments. No evidence is found that beef packers behaved in an anticompetitive manner on a national basis when procuring cattle during the period examined. This reinforces conclusions reached by previous studies using different data sets and estimation methods. However, given the lack of assurances that the U.S. slaughter market will remain open to Canadian cattle exporters, regulators must remain vigilant in monitoring the procurement practices of beef packers. There is also a need for greater levels of data disaggregation to allow fed and cull cattle procurement markets to be studied separately, perhaps even on a regional basis.","[Rude, James] Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Harrison, Darryl] Victoria Farmers Federat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Carlberg, Jared] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Manitoba,"Rude, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Rural Econ, 569 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",James.Rude@ualberta.ca; dharrison@rff.org.au; jared_carlberg@hotmail.com,,,,,,,31,8,11,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This paper identifies two key economic elements that determine both the costs and the benefits of mandating agriculture in an ETS. These are: the costs of reducing GHG emissions in agriculture, and the transactions costs pertinent to covering agriculture in an ETS. Published data on these elements is used to derive a likely range of the overall social costs of mandating the agricultural sector in a GHG ETS. Current indicators of those costs for agriculture, and for the other sectors of the economy, do not offer evidence that mandating agriculture in an ETS would be socially beneficial. Alternative approaches to engaging the agricultural sector in GHG emission reduction, e. g. through voluntary opt-in or through offsetting credits, are likely to be more beneficial.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Ancev, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",tiho.ancev@sydney.edu.au,,"Ancev, Tihomir/0000-0002-3521-7782",,,,,45,16,18,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The analysis of the sample of 101 farms revealed that the return to scale effect is not significant compared to other effects so that the real increase of the production volume may not determine the dynamic of the profit. The massive shift of farms with increasing cost efficiency to the category of the decreased cost efficiency reflects a significant influence of external conditions to the profit/loss of farms. A positive development of prices in 2007 has influenced an increased cost efficiency of the majority of sample farms. In 2008, the increased prices of agricultural inputs intensively influenced the development of the revenue function. The increase of variable costs influenced by increased input prices has wasted reserves resulted from the production use of fixed costs and the return to scale and caused a significant decrease of profit.","[Strelecek, Frantisek; Zdenek, Radek; Lososova, Jana] Univ S Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Strelecek, F (通讯作者)，Univ S Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",strelec@ef.jcu.cz; zdenek@ef.jcu.cz; lososova@ef.jcu.cz,"Lososová, Jana/D-6237-2016; ZDENĚK, Radek/D-6217-2016","Lososová, Jana/0000-0001-9610-1436; ZDENĚK, Radek/0000-0001-6945-6485","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6007665806]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6007665806).",,24,3,3,0,14,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Private control of invasive insect species is likely to be insufficient due to negative externality and weaker-link public good problems. In this study, we compare a system of Pigouvian taxes with tradable permits for invasive species control. While the emissions control literature shows that taxes are preferred to permits under cost uncertainty, invasive-species control involves correlated cost and benefit uncertainty. Hence, we expect a quantity-based system to be preferred.

In this article. I review some of the structural variables that have been found to affect the likelihood of collective action. Then, I address the need to base future work on collective action on a more general theory of human behavior than has been used to model collective action over the last five decades. In the last section, I discuss how structural variables affect the core relationships of reputation, trust, and reciprocity as these affect levels of cooperation.","[Ostrom, Elinor] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ostrom, Elinor] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Study Inst Divers, Tempe, AZ USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ostrom, E (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,"currie, morgan/G-1449-2011",,,,,,79,242,297,17,228,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Results suggest that the sale price of a residential property within a flood prone area is lower than an equivalent property outside the flood prone area.

An output distance function is employed and estimated together with an inefficiency effects model to capture the effects of CAP subsidies and farmer characteristics on farm efficiency. The model is applied to FADN data (period 1995-2004) of crop farms in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The study shows that the 10-year average technical efficiency is 64% in Germany, 76% in the Netherlands and 71% in Sweden. The average annual changes in technical efficiency are 0.1%, 0.4% and 2.3%, respectively. The share of crop subsidies in total subsidies has a negative impact on technical efficiency in Germany but a positive impact in Sweden, although insignificant in the Netherlands. The share of total subsidies in total farm revenues has negative impacts on technical efficiency in all three countries, consistent with income and insurance effects. Positive (negative) change in technical efficiency is mainly attributable to farm size (degree of specialisation) in Germany, and degree of specialisation (degree of subsidy dependence) in the Netherlands and Sweden.","[Zhu, Xueqin; Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Zhu, XQ (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands.",xueqin.zhu@wur.nl,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090",European Commission [022653],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Xueqin Zhu and Alfons Oude Lansink are with the Department of Social Sciences, Wagen-ingen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.

The theoretical model relaxes several important assumptions such as factor price equalization, firm heterogeneity, and introduces technological differences into the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model. Based on the agricultural production and trade data for the CEE, we examine empirically three hypotheses, which relate cross-country differences in technology, relative factor abundance and transaction costs and market imperfections to the factor content of trade. We find that the first two hypotheses are confirmed by the majority of the developed EU countries, but rejected by roughly one half of the CEE transition country pairs. Second, we find that when accounting for the transaction costs of farm (re)organization, both hypotheses are confirmed by the majority of the CEE country pairs. These findings provide indirect evidence of market imperfections, and particularly, of transaction costs of farm (re)organization in the CEE.","[Ciaian, Pavel] Slovak Univ Agr, EERI, Commiss European Communities, DG Joint Res Ctr IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ciaian, Pavel] Catholic Univ Leuven LICOS, Commiss European Communities, JRC IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain; [Kancs, d'Artis] Catholic Univ Leuven LICOS, Commiss European Communities, DG Joint Res Ctr IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain; [Kancs, d'Artis] IPTS, Commiss European Communities, JRC, EERI, Seville 41092, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; European Commission Joint Research Centre; European Commission Joint Research Centre; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, EERI, Commiss European Communities, DG Joint Res Ctr IPTS, Edificio Expo 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850; Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors acknowledge helpful comments from Rafal Raciborski and Susan Chun Zhu as well as GTAP, EAAE, and IAAE conference participants in Helsinki, Ghent, Santiago, and Beijing.

First, we explore the role of agriculture in the broader development process from a macroeconomic and political economy perspective.

Domestic oligopolists compete in a market for a homogenous good with importing firms who enjoy the same level of market power as the domestic producers. Within an EDM framework, we investigate how the market adjusts to a new equilibrium in response to an external policy shock that improves access to foreign goods. Our empirical work consists of two steps. We first econometrically estimate the market demand elasticity and market power parameter. Then, using these estimates, we simulate our EDM model to assess the distributional effects of tariff cuts and other changes in marginal cost. Simulation results show that, with a lower market price and increased consumption, the change in consumer surplus resulting from tariff reduction is unambiguously positive, but that the change in social welfare can be in either direction, depending on who receives market rents associated with imports. When importing firms are domestic, the domestic welfare change is definitely positive. However, in the case of foreign importing firms, the direction of the welfare change crucially depends on the demand elasticity.","[Lee, Hyunok] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ahn, Byeong-Il] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Davis; Korea University,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",hyunok@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Ahn, Byeong-il/0000-0002-3504-2898",,,,,36,7,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The social and economic motivation to use value added reporting is linked to the general process of disclosing financial information in a certain business and cultural environment. In this framework, a question arises about the possible role of the value added statement as a way of accounting communication in the global economy. A survey of 211 published financial statements for the fiscal period 2003 of Italian listed companies shows that the publication of the value added statement in the annual reports is a marginal phenomenon. However, the industrial and services firms voluntarily present in their annual report and income statements rearranged to expose the (industrial) value added by only looking at the production perspective, with a possible interpretation in terms of cost efficiency.","Univ Tuscia, Fac Econ & Management, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Ianniello, G (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Fac Econ & Management, Via Paradiso 47, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",ianniell@unitus.it,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,25,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - A stochastic frontier model is employed on a total of 160 mills randomly selected across five states in south-western Nigeria in 2006. Findings - The results show an estimated average cost efficiency of 1262. This suggests that an average mill incurs about 26 per cent costs above the frontier cost when processing planks from logs. Further analysis indicates that a significant level of cost ineffisciency is present in Nigeria's sawmilling industry. Analysis of determinants of cost efficiency reveals that more years of education, experience, age, and level of capital investment reduce cost inefficiencies between 7 and 16 per cent. Sawmill operation is found to be associated with economies of scale in the study area. Originality/value - The paper contributes to existing studies on the efficiency of sawmill industries in Nigeria by taking a holistic assessment of the industry from a cost perspective.","Univ Kiel, Inst Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Ogundari, K (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",ogundarikolawole@daad-alunmi.de,"Ogundari, Kolawole/F-6700-2018","Ogundari, Kolawole/0000-0001-5714-4417",,,,,23,2,2,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Our focus is on economic and noneconomic reasons for farm exit. The impact of varying both the likelihood of succession and the initial farm operator age distributions is studied. An agent-based simulation model of structural change in agriculture is applied, which brings together farm-internal and -external determinants and creates a set of endogenous adjustment reactions. We show that the stepwise introduction of direct payments of the Common Agricultural Policy in Slovakia has a strong impact on its structural development. In the short- to medium-term, the dualistic farm structure together with a specific age structure of farms still persists as a response to the policy. The phasing-in of payments persuades SF to stay and potential successors to enter. In the longer run, the initially heterogeneous farm structure becomes increasingly homogeneous toward larger SF. The prevalence of small SF in the medium- to long-term is not necessarily a given. This may lead decision makers to reconsider the role of individual farms in rural development.","[Happe, Kathrin; Schnicke, Hauke; Sahrbacher, Christoph; Kellermann, Konrad] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Happe, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser St 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",happe@iamo.de; schnicke@iamo.de; sahrbacher@iamo.de; kellermann@iamo.de,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646;",,,,,29,19,22,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0008-3976,,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The analysis builds on the risk-sharing and imperfect market explanations of contract choice. Unique data from Ethiopia, which contain land contract information and experimental risk and rate of time preference measures on matched landlord-tenant partners, are employed in the empirical analysis. The results show that landlord and tenant time preferences are significant determinants of contract choice. For landlords (but not tenants), risk preference is also significant, indicating the importance of financial constraints and production risk in the determination of contract choice. The results are of particular relevance to land market policy in Ethiopia, where production is risk-prone, financial markets are imperfect, and where there is a major need for the development of vibrant land rental markets.",,,,mintewab.bezabih@port.ac.uk,,,Sida,Sida,"The author is a Research Fellow at the Centre for the Economics and Management of Aquatic Resources, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.

Among those with positive spending on farm inputs, the estimated elasticity of these expenditures with respect to nonfarm income is 0.14. Nonfarm income also has an effect on the number of households that purchase farm animals, with an estimated elasticity of 0.35. The use of nonfarm income for farm investment is consistent with the presence of credit constraints, as is the fact that less than one percent of farmers report outstanding debts for agricultural purposes. Yet many farm households take out large unsecured loans for other purposes, primarily to cover consumption expenditures, implying that credit is available, but that farmers prefer not to use borrowed funds to finance agricultural investment. This would suggest that increases in the availability of agricultural credit may have little effect on farm outcomes, whereas increases in nondebt-financed sources of liquidity, such as subsidies or transfers, may better stimulate investment.","Food & Agr Org United Nations, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Hertz, T (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",hertz.tom@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,30,36,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this context, different levels of premium for small farms should be paid, some inputs should be provided, and small producers should be assisted in marketing especially by promoting the farmers through co-operatives. Extension works organized for small farmers may have an informative and incentive role on the premium applications.

The analysis is based on household-level expenditure survey data for two cross-sectional surveys of Chinese households pertaining to food expenditure patterns during 1995 and 2003. Pre-committed components of commodity demands, that are insensitive to economic variables, are explored. We use the generalized quadratic almost ideal demand system (GQAIDS) for its empirical superiority to the generalized almost ideal demand system (GAIDS), and estimate the associated parameters via full information maximum likelihood procedure (FIML) accounting for endogeneity of total expenditures on food for home consumption (FAH). We also use quality-adjusted commodity unit values to control for quality differences resulting from commodity aggregation and food choice. Furthermore, we derive GQAIDS elasticity formulas, and estimate income elasticities without restrictions. The results partially support the hypothesis that an average Chinese household has incorporated elements of Western diet (fine grains) into traditional Chinese food diet over time. Moreover, the outcome of a simple test developed here points to possible preference changes for a majority of food staples under study.","[Hovhannisyan, Vardges; Gould, Brian W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hovhannisyan, V (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 319 Taylor Hall,427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",hovhannisyan@wisc.edu,,,,,,,27,32,38,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Two applications are investigated. The first is the adoption of organic systems in UK farming, and the second is the influence of farm and farmer characteristics on the use of a computer on the farm. While there is a correspondence between the conclusions we would obtain with and without model averaging results, we find important differences, particularly in smaller samples. Concerning the adoption of an organic system, we find that attitudes to the sustainability of the current system along with the ability of organic farms alone to satisfy society's needs for food are influential. Additionally, the source of management information used by the farmer has a significant impact. Regarding the adoption of computers, we confirm the findings of previous work that the level of education affects uptake and that age is a factor determining adoption. We also find that dairy and organic farms are more likely to use a computer. The physical size of the farm is positively associated with the probability of computer use while net farm income has a limited impact.","[Tiffin, Richard; Balcombe, Kelvin] Univ Reading, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Tiffin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Food Econ & Mkt, Reading, Berks, England.",j.r.tiffin@reading.ac.uk,"Balcombe, Kelvin G/F-8418-2010","Balcombe, Kelvin/0000-0001-7224-9233; Tiffin, Richard/0000-0002-4455-5572",,,,,22,32,32,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This could be associated with 'auspicious selection' of land into the Scheme, with greater 'value for money' provided by the higher entry of land with lower agricultural forgone income but higher environmental benefit within the region.","[Quillerou, Emmanuelle] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England; [Fraser, Rob; Fraser, Iain] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England; [Fraser, Rob] Univ Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Kent; University of Kent; University of Western Australia,"Quillérou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England.",emmanuelle_quillerou@yahoo.fr,"QUILLÉROU, Emmanuelle/F-8397-2010","QUILLÉROU, Emmanuelle/0000-0001-7541-0061; Fraser, Iain/0000-0002-4689-6020",,,,,37,16,17,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The research was targeted solely at legal entities due to a limited data base. The performance of organic farms (individual kinds of legal entities) was compared by regions with the agricultural enterprises farming conventionally. The organic farms economic profit was as well assessed in relation to their field of activity. Based on the analysis made, the economic situation is more favourable for the organically farming enterprises. Their economic results are actively influenced by subsidies without which an absolute majority of enterprises would be operating at a loss. (When including subsidies in the yields, 84.9% farms of the sample were profitable. On the other hand, while excluding subsidies, 95.7% of the enterprises were loss-making.) Economic success of the farms is influenced - together with subsidies - by the natural and climatic conditions as well as and by their field of activities. The enterprises farming permanent grassland (solely or in combination with a different culture) prevail. A lower intensity of this farming is reflected in the more favourable economic results.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Brozová, I (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",brozovai@pef.czu.cz,"Brozova, Ivana/H-4539-2018","Brozova, Ivana/0000-0002-2460-9481","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6046070906]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6046070906).",,11,10,10,1,14,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The study applies in the frame of methodology the economic model based on input-output analysis in CZ conditions. In majority of assessed indicators, there were used databases from 2000-2008, i.e. the period before and after the accession to the EU. The outcome of the study is the evaluation of the situation in the macroeconomic environment that influences food sector and the use of input and output in this sector. The SWOT analysis shows, among other, the occasions that could improve the current stagnant or rather decreasing situation of competitiveness of the assessed sector. The study also indicated new directions of the further development in this area. The analysis of the food sector development demonstrated that the sector competitiveness is not in a critical situation. However, the sector competitiveness assessed by the RCA index and foreign trade is not going to be improved. The stagnation has come. As it follows from the SWOT analysis, the reason is that the opportunities of the sector are not fully utilised. Food producers are facing the basic problems in the output sphere mainly in the domestic market.

Specifically, the authors analyze farmers' contract decisions for different types of contracts, their contract compliance behaviors, and their profitability affected by the contracts both analytically and empirically. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assume growers with alternative risk preferences make the contract decisions to maximize their expected utilities, under exogenous market price risks and contract terms determined by the processor or wholesaler. Both fixed price and floating price contracts are analyzed. Two surveys of 185 and 85 farm households, respectively, are obtained in Shandong province in 2010, and econometric analyses with both Logit and least square regressions are conducted. Findings - The results indicate that the determining factors for contract farming are related to farmers' risk attitude, gender, yield, farm size and labor availability. However, contrary to the common belief that contracts are a risk management tool for risk averse farmers, the risk lovers tend to use contract farming instead of risk averters. Female household heads and farms with more labors tend not to use contracts, but larger farms with more acreage are more likely to contract. These suggest Chinese farmers' primary motivation of contracting is not market price risk management, but rather seeking better offers and marketing transaction cost reduction. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first econometric study to analyze contract farming allowing different types of contracts in China. The scenarios include cases without contracts, with fixed price contracts, and with floating price contracts, where the contract price changes to reflect the market price, a very unique yet popular situation in China. Each of the cases is also considered under the situation whether default is possible.","[Zhang, Yanping; Wu, Laping] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yanping] Purdue Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, H.

For our fifteen sample countries, results indicate that the agricultural price incentive bias generally perceived to exist during the 1980s was largely eliminated during the 1990s. Results also demonstrate that general equilibrium effects and country-specific characteristics are crucial for determining the sign and magnitude of agricultural bias.

Hence, different patterns of trade liberalisation might have different consequences for both producers and consumers through changes in the composition of trade. We illustrate the issues at stake in the beef sector, focusing on Mercosur exports to the EU. We model import demand for different qualities in the presence of TRQs and derive comparative static results showing the consequences of different patterns of bilateral and multilateral trade liberalisation. If the EU treats beef as a 'sensitive product' in a possible WTO Doha Round Agreement, imports would be lower, despite the accompanying TRQ expansion, than with larger tariff cuts. TRQ expansion would, however, increase the high-quality bias in beef imports and welfare losses, whereas a cut in the specific tariff would reduce this bias.","[Ramos, Maria Priscila] CEPII, Paris, France; [Bureau, Jean-Christophe] AgroParisTech, Paris, France; [Salvatici, Luca] Univ Molise, Campobasso, Italy",AgroParisTech; University of Molise,"Ramos, MP (通讯作者)，Guemes 3646 9C, RA-1425 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ramos@agroparistech.fr,"Salvatici, Luca/H-4545-2019","Salvatici, Luca/0000-0003-1791-1663; Ramos, Maria Priscila/0000-0002-0552-9486",TradeAg; AgFoodTrade,TradeAg; AgFoodTrade,=The authors acknowledge the support from the TradeAg and AgFoodTrade projects funded under the 6th and 7th European Framework Programmes for Research and Development.

The farm households, as the direct user of cultivated land, play a key role in the cultivated land transfer. For this paper, a survey of 1 396 farm households in 74 villages, 64 townships, 42 counties in Jiangxi, the traditional agricultural province, was conducted. Using this information, a logistic regression model was employed and the attitudes of those farm households were analyzed using the family characteristics, the household economic factors and the resource endowments. The results showed that there is a little incentive for the cultivated land transfer and no macro-environment exists for the cultivated land transfer market because of the low economic benefits. Farm households which moved out to urban areas for employment play the most important role in the cultivated land transfer and become the largest force to drive the cultivated land transfer out. Family income also affects the cultivated land transfer; the income of farm households transferring cultivated land in is much lower than those of the cultivated land transferring out. In addition, the topographic characteristic of cultivated land is also an important factor influencing the cultivated land transfer; it is easier to transfer land out if the terrain is flat, but it is more difficult if the land is fragmented.","[Chen, Mei-qiu; Zhou, Bing-juan; Huang, Hong-sheng; He, Wei-jia] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Tai-yang] Nanjing Univ, Dept Territorial Resources & Tourism, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University; Nanjing University,"Huang, HS (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Agr Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",hhs16@vip.sina.com,"Zhong, Taiyang/G-5425-2015","Zhong, Taiyang/0000-0003-4780-7445","National Natural Science Fund of China [70663003, 40801063]",National Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supported by the National Natural Science Fund of China (Project No. 70663003, No. 40801063).",,30,19,23,11,84,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Governed by the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA), private crop insurance companies must designate an eligible crop insurance contract to the assigned risk, developmental, or commercial funds. While the SRA restricts the private sector delivery system in a number of ways, the assignment of contracts to crop insurance funds, however, is left solely to the discretion of individual crop insurance companies. Thus, as to the companies' profitability viewpoint, the optimal selection of the crop insurance funds is the most important task. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a decision framework for crop insurance companies to make optimal decisions regarding the purchases of crop reinsurance. This information and framework may also be useful for crop insurance firms in China when considering crop reinsurance decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper studied three commonly used parametric loss distributions and presented a general guideline to choose the most profitable fund within the company's risk bearing level. Findings - The paper finds many important features in the commonly used loss distributions, which are useful to maximize the company's underwriting returns. Originality/value - The paper provides a general decision framework for optimally ceding risks to reinsurance. While this paper focused on agricultural insurance decisions by firms, the concept could be applied to general reinsurance decisions.","[Pai, Jeffrey S.] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Boyd, Milton S.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba,"Pai, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",jpai@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,Beijing Office; Department for International Development,Beijing Office; Department for International Development,"This paper was completed under the China Crop Insurance Project, with funding provided by the DelPHE Program (Beijing Office), sponsored by the Department for International Development and managed by the British Council, UK.

Contrary to most national regulations, the current solution of the IAS and US GAAP require a completely different recording of operative and financial leasing in financial statements, and consider the transfer of risks and leasing rewards as the main criteria for their division. Such an approach, however, has been repeatedly criticized by many users of financial statements, because transactions that are very similar or even identical economically are caught up in a completely different manner depending on whether the recording entity evaluates the leasing subjectively. It may even lead to the manipulation of recording according to the requirements and intents of the recording entity. This contribution analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of some discussed procedures, in particular of those which could replace the current standards in the future (recording based on the use of the concept of right to use), and various effects on the report on the financial situation and profit or loss development when using the current methods or the newly suggested methods during the existence of leasing. The impact is demonstrated on a specific example of business premises leased by an entity conducting business in agriculture. We also focus on different approaches of the IASB and FASB to some related issues, for example concerning the update of the applied incremental interest rates, the conditioned parts of rent and the guarantees for the residual value.","Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svoboda, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",patrik.svoboda@mendelu.cz,"Svoboda, Patrik/AAE-1145-2020","Svoboda, Patrik/0000-0002-2274-4778","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [MSM 6215648904/02]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Project No. MSM 6215648904/02).",,6,2,2,1,33,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Farmers, therefore, do not have additional incentives to adjust to desired paddy planted area. This scenario is further illustrated by farmers' inelastic response to government supports (incentives). Paddy planted area is not likely to be responsive to the incentives. Paddy price is found associated with higher production cost and may result in a shrink of paddy planted area in Malaysia. All the emerging findings from this study provide an important message for an imperative need to correct paddy related policies so as to reduce the distortions and increase economic efficiency.","[Tey, (John) Yeong-Sheng; Darham, Suryani; Noh, Aswani Farhana Mohd; Idris, Nurjihan] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Agr & Food Policy Studies, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Tey, YS (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Agr & Food Policy Studies, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",tyeong.sheng@gmail.com,"Tey, Yeong Sheng/AAV-5900-2021; idris, nurjihan/AAU-9687-2020",,,,,,8,3,3,2,6,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This partly involves use of genetic modification. Yet, relatively little is known about consumer acceptance of such second-generation genetically modified (GM) foods in developing countries. Here, we analyse consumer attitudes towards provitamin A GM cassava in the north-east of Brazil. Based on stated preference data, mean willingness to pay is estimated at 60-70% above market prices for traditional cassava. This is higher than the results from similar studies in developed countries, which is plausible given that micronutrient malnutrition is more severe in developing countries. GM foods with enhanced nutritive attributes seem to be well received by poor consumers. However, the results also suggest that acceptance would be still higher if provitamin A were introduced to cassava through conventional breeding. Some policy implications are discussed.","[Gonzalez, Carolina] CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Gonzalez, Carolina] Univ Hohenheim, D-7000 Stuttgart, Germany; [Johnson, Nancy] ILRI, Livelihoods & Poverty Project, Nairobi, Kenya; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University Hohenheim; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of Gottingen,"González, C (通讯作者)，CIAT, Cali, Colombia.",c.gonzalez@cgiar.org,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Gonzalez, Carolina/0000-0003-3613-1769",International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); HarvestPlus Program,International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); HarvestPlus Program,Financial support from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the HarvestPlus Program is gratefully acknowledged.
