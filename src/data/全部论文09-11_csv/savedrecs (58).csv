Obvious problems arise, such as data availability and data quality. A less obvious issue is that such sets and indices do not permit the inclusion of specific characteristics or discourses that are important in a country or region. This paper investigates the possibility of comparing regional sustainability assessments in four case studies, where the indicators vary from region to region, but the method of making the assessment is similar. The concepts of weak and strong comparability were used in this analysis. Comparability of sustainable development between different regions is not an issue of rigid comparison of indicator by indicator. It should take into account regional specifics. The resulting shift from strong to weak comparability should not be seen as a lessening of the quality of the assessment and decreasing comparability. Rather than focusing on individual indicators within frameworks that do not permit inclusion of regional developments, this approach allows to look at the broader picture of regional dynamics. It reveals specific regional weaknesses that need attention, and possible areas for building alliances between regions, thus creating a more sustainable Europe. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This has been partly driven by a wave of concern about conduct and governance of business and partly reflects a growing interest amongst consumers, policy makers and businesses, in forms of production and consumption that are more sustainable and more ethically oriented. This is typified by growth in demand of products encompassing ethical values such as organic and Fair Trade products. However, research knowledge base about consumers and their behaviour and attitude from an ethical perspective is relatively weak. Consumer attitude to foods is mainly influenced by concerns (e. g. food safety, human health, environmental impact) and commodity attributes (e. g. quality, taste, freshness and packaging). The objective of this paper is to get an insight on Serbian consumer attitude towards agro-food products with ethical values (AFPEV) namely organic, Fair Trade and typical/traditional products. This paper is based on the literature and an online self-administered questionnaire, carried out from December 2010 through June 2011 with 104 Serbian adult consumers, dealing with understanding of and knowledge about AFP and relationships with ethical values; AFPEV buying frequency; main criteria and reasons for buying AFPEV; opinion about AFPEV price and consumer willingness to pay; potential impacts on animal health and welfare as well environmental, economic social and civic impacts of buying AFPEV; purchasing channels; and main sources of information about AFPEV. Serbian consumers have a good knowledge about AFPEV that are bought by 98% of the sample. Most of the respondents relate ethical values to the respect of environment (73.5%) and organic production (49.0%). The main reasons for buying AFPEV are quality (35%), organic certification (17%), and taste (15%). Price seems less important. The main sources of information about AFPEV are mass media, newspapers and magazines (summing up 46%). However, the majority of Serbian consumers prefer to get information directly from the supply chain actors mainly sellers and/or producers. AFPEV are bought mainly from the specialized shops (34%) and supermarkets (26%) to achieve personal satisfaction, for health, safety, natural resources conservation, and environment protection. Consumers do not always buy sustainable products as consequences of environmental concern or to benefit the community or due to personal beliefs but mainly to give priority to health. Ethical factors are important in some cases, but they may be overstated. Results indicated that most Serbian consumers perceived that AFPEV as healthier and portray a positive attitude towards AFPEV thus showing a high willingness to pay higher prices. Serbian consumers seem to have a positive attitude towards organic, fair trade and typical products due to the sustainable benefits that they can bring about. Therefore, institutional and domestic market conditions should be improved for insuring long-term market development and information campaigns should be organised to increase Serbian consumers' awareness and consciousness and to strengthen their positive attitude towards AFPEV.","[Driouech, Noureddin; El Bilali, Hamid] Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, CIHEAM, I-70010 Bari, Italy; [Berjan, Sinisa; Radovic, Mirjana] Univ East Sarajevo, Fac Agr, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Terr, Viterbo, Italy; [Despotovic, Aleksandra] Univ Podgorica, Biotech Fac, Podgorica, Montenegro",CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI; University of East Sarajevo; Tuscia University,"Driouech, N (通讯作者)，Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, CIHEAM, I-70010 Bari, Italy.",driouech@iamb.it; elbilali@iamb.it; sinisaberjan@yahoo.com; miraradovic84@gmail.com; alexd@t-com.me,"El Bilali, Hamid/I-1898-2019","El Bilali, Hamid/0000-0002-0322-2034",,,,,29,1,1,0,30,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,37,43,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000005,0

Design/methodology/approach - Lactobacillus acidophilus BT 1088, L. fermentum BT 8219, L acidophilus FTDC 8633 and L. gasseri FTDC 8131 were investigated for their bioactive potential and enhanced bioconversion of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with individual B-vitamins at a concentration of 1 mg/L. Findings - The supplementation of thiamine, riboflavin, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, biotin and folic acid enhanced the ACE-inhibitory activity of lactobacilli in soymilk accompanied by a lower IC50 value compared to the control (P < 0.05). The beta-glucosidase specific activity of lactobacilli was also enhanced on supplementation of B-vitamins, leading to increased bioconversion of isoflavones in soymilk. The concentration of genistein was decreased, accompanied by an increased concentration of genistein on fermentation in the presence of thiamine, niacinamide, biotin, calcium pantothenate and folic acid. Additionally, the supplementation of niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, biotin and folic acid also led to lower concentrations of malonyl daidzin, indicating increased hydrolysis of malonyl daidzin to daidzin. Results from the present study indicated that the supplementation of B-vitamins could enhance the bioactive potential and bioconversion of isoflavones in lactobacilli-fermented soymilk. Originality/value - This work has shown that the supplementation of B-vitamins in lactobacilli fermented soymilk has exerted in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity and increased the accumulation of bioactive isoflavone aglycones.

The main objective of this research was to determine self-purification processes from total phosphorus in small streams and evaluate the main factors of influence. Research was carried out in the streams and drainage channels with the average discharge up to 0.2 m(3)/s. Water samples were taken in the dry period of the year to avoid additional attenuation and pollution with drainage water from agricultural areas. Sampling was carried out above the settlement or wastewater discharger and downstream every certain distance according to relief and peculiarity of the river flow until the nearest tributary. Data analysis showed that the change of total P concentration downstream was more intense in less watery streams compared to more watery ones. Moreover, the correlation dependence revealed that the change in total P concentration near the pollution source was little dependent on stream discharge. Increasing the distance from the pollution source the dependence on discharge also increased. It was also noticed that given low stream discharge, total P concentration changed more intensively with an increasing distance than in the case of higher discharge. Usually smaller streams are characterized by much higher relative load according to total P than more watery ones. The correlation dependence showed that total P removal was more efficient in smaller streams compared to bigger ones. Relative stream load near the pollution source had a stronger influence on total P removal efficiency than the distance from the pollution source, especially when relative load of the stream was low.","[Lysoviene, Jelena; Gasiunas, Valerijus] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Vilainiai, Lithuania; [Ziemelnieks, Reinis] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Vytautas Magnus University; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Lysoviene, J (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Vilainiai, Lithuania.",j.lysoviene@gmail.com; v.gasiunas@water.omnitel.net; reinis.ziemelnieks@llu.lv,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,303,308,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500054,0

The case study methodology has been implemented to show the main features of mentioned impacts. The conversion of arable land into building (residential) land and its impact to the conditions to use the remaining arable land was the main research question. The outcomes of the case studies showed that the conversion of arable land into the building land is not only the loss of surface area of valuable agricultural land. It can happened that the areas under the land development projects split the large and compact fields of arable land into smaller fields with less compact shape. The land development project which located inconveniently on the territory of arable land can reduce remarkably the compactness of large fields and worsen the land tillage conditions. The simultaneous start of too many land development projects have been lead to the situation that on the market are mach more new residential plots than the real need is. The outcome is that many residential plots created on the agricultural land will be not used in the near future and perhaps ever but for agriculture this land is lost. The carried out case studies showed also that the readjustment of land development area can reduce their negative impact on the land use conditions in agriculture.,"[Hass, Helena; Juergenson, Evelin] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Maasikamaee, Siim] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Geomat, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences; Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Maasikamäe, S (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Geomat, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",Siim.Maasikamae@emu.ee; Helena.Hass@emu.ee; Evelin.Jyrgenson@emu.ee,"Jürgenson, Evelin/N-8095-2019; Jürgenson, Evelin/B-7047-2011; Maasikamae, Siim/H-7951-2016","Jürgenson, Evelin/0000-0003-2103-4333; Jürgenson, Evelin/0000-0003-2103-4333; Maasikamae, Siim/0000-0003-4721-2329",,,,,20,3,4,0,12,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,446,451,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500077,0

To the first group of factors determining the current state of water measures should be include the general state of agriculture and the efficiency of farms. Production restrictions related to the Polish accession to the European Union, the need of competition in the market for agricultural products and poor economic condition of farms undoubtedly shape the process of degeneration of the water facilities and the demand for precision water management. Forcing factors is the need achievement of the objectives of European Union directives, between others Frame Water Directive. In case of checking the predictions of climate change, and in particular global warming very seriously to be implemented programs to combat drought, including investments in water retention, water-saving irrigation, upgrading drainage systems etc. Water management in rural areas, carried out mainly by local government on the regional or local level differ significantly from the objectives and tasks of water management implemented by the government for the whole country or major river basins. Nowadays the main attention should be concentrated on implementing of concepts of such activities that could show the most appropriate ways of special planning of agricultural areas in catchments scale in aspect of possibility of improving existing environmental status and water resources. The costs of the protective infrastructure are considerable in the scale of a farm, and their low effect for the farm creates the need for reasonable participation of the public funds. Obviously, awaking the social consciousness that this function should be carried out by the society as a whole, not only the farmers. The extent and the sources for support of the farms ( mainly those specialising in milk and meat production) is an open issue. It is important to answer the question: as to what kind of infrastructure is needed in rural areas to assure a balance between social and economic growth. At the same time, the resources of the environment should not be degraded. The development of infrastructure in rural areas is supported by structural funds from the European Union within its regional policy. Actions should be aimed at improving the quality of life by creating employment while showing respect to the social and economic aspects of these actions and multifunctional development of rural areas.

This research contributes to a wider understanding of that phenomenon, aiming to explore the characteristics of Polish consumers' national and regional ethnocentric attitudes and behaviours, especially symptoms of those attitudes in relationship with locally produced brands of beer. Design/methodology/approach - All the data were collected on a university campus in Poland in late autumn 2007 in a group of ten university students. Purposive sampling was used to establish two focus groups within the industry's main target Market age group, each of which met on two occasions, three weeks apart. Findings - The main identified issues broadly covered two main categories: national ethnocentrism and regional ethnocentrism. The findings point to the relative importance of elements such as brand image (based on Polish culture and referring to its symbols), local brands as contributors to local identities and the form of their expression, as well as a moral obligation to buy local brands. Originality/value - Indicative findings suggest that several areas need to be further investigated in future research in order to better understand the characteristics of national and regional ethnocentric tendencies, and the contribution they make to local identities.","[Kubacki, Krzysztof] Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England; [Siemieniako, Dariusz; Glinska, Ewa; Krot, Katarzyna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Kleosin, Poland",Keele University,"Kubacki, K (通讯作者)，Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England.",k.kubacki@mgnt.keele.ac.uk,"Krot, Katarzyna/M-1062-2019; Siemieniako, Dariusz/C-7013-2018; Krot, Katarzyna/AAA-6844-2021","Siemieniako, Dariusz/0000-0002-9373-3558; Krot, Katarzyna/0000-0002-7404-1724",,,,,49,48,50,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The series was built with the aim of identifying and characterizing the most significant phases in the process leading up to the current welfare state system in this country. The establishment of a social insurance (Previdencia) in 1935 was one of the founding pillars of the Estado Novo (New State). Reforms to Social Welfare (Previdencia Social) in 1962, while in the full throes of the New State, policy measures taken after the revolution of 1974 and a new orientation for social policy following the accession of Portugal to the European Economic Community (EEC) in the mid-1980s brought about significant transformations in the institutional organizational structure that provided welfare and conferred social rights in Portugal. To understand this process, knowledge is needed of the transformations to the institutional structures governing the organizations that provided welfare, welfare coverage in terms of the type of benefit and the population entitled to social risk protection, the magnitude of spending on benefits associated with these risks, as well as how benefits were allocated between the institutions. We built a data series for the period 1938-1980, which can then be matched to data already published in the OECD Social Expenditure Database from 1980 onwards. As a result, a consistent series for social expenditure from 1938 to 2003 was obtained. The methodology used to create the series enabled us to measure the impact of the variation in population coverage for social risks and the average generosity of benefits on the relative share of social expenditure in GDP. We present an interpretive reading for the full period, covering the New State and the Democracy from 1974, of the process of building the welfare state in Portugal.","[Carolo, Daniel Fernando] Univ Lisbon, ICS, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Pereirinha, Jose Antonio] Univ Tecn Lisbon, ISEG, Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Carolo, DF (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ICS, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",daniel.carolo@ics.ul.pt; pereirin@iseg.utl.pt,"Pereirinha, José António/HKE-3452-2023","Pereirinha, José António/0000-0001-6218-0113; Carolo, Daniel/0000-0002-3290-1458",,,,,40,8,11,0,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

We reassess the fiscal position of Habsburg Castile, deriving comprehensive estimates of revenue, debt, and expenditure from new archival data. The king's debts were sustainable. Primary surpluses were large and rising. Debt-to-revenue ratios remained broadly unchanged during Philip's reign. Castilian finances in the sixteenth century compare favorably with those of other early modern fiscal states at the height of their imperial ambitions, including Britain. The defaults of Philip II therefore reflected short-term liquidity crises, and were not a sign of unsustainable debts.","[Drelichman, Mauricio] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Voth, Hans-Joachim] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain",University of British Columbia; Pompeu Fabra University,"Drelichman, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, 997-1873 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",drelichm@interchange.ubc.ca,"Voth, Hans-Joachim/D-7180-2013","Voth, Hans-Joachim/0000-0003-4518-3149; Drelichman, Mauricio/0000-0002-1457-3235",,,,,78,33,41,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

While current approaches may effectively tackle some of them, they often fail to combine them together. The paper presents the integrative agent-centred (IAC) framework, which aims at filling this gap. It functions in accordance with these three pillars and provides a conceptual structure to understand farmers' behaviour in agricultural systems. The IAC framework is agent-centred and supports the understanding of farmers' behavior consistently with the perspective of agricultural systems as complex social-ecological systems. It combines different behavioural drivers, bridges between micro and macro levels, and depicts a potentially varied model of human agency. The use of the framework in practice is illustrated through two studies on pesticide use among smallholders in Colombia. The examples show how the framework can be implemented to derive policy implications to foster a transition towards more sustainable agricultural practices. The paper finally suggests that the framework can support different research designs for the study of agents' behaviour in agricultural and social-ecological systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using estimated parameters from the red throat emperor fishery from the Great Barrier Reef, simulations show that an optimal switching strategy can be preferred to a fixed reserve regime, but is dependent on spillovers from reserves to harvested areas, the nature of shocks to the environment, the size of the non-consumptive values and how they change with the biomass. and the sensitivity of profits to the harvest and biomass.

Politicians may feel reluctant to allow permit trading and/or may prefer that abatement is undertaken domestically because of moral concerns. This will have an effect on the initial permit allocations, and, therefore, on global emissions. The impact on global emissions depends on the precise formulation of the moral concerns, but under reasonable assumptions, we show that global emissions may increase. Thus, doing what is perceived as good does not always yield the desired outcome. However, this can be offset by restrictions on permit trading when governments have moral concerns about this trade.

The exact impacts, however are difficult to quantify and are often neglected in policy making. The evaluation of ecosystem services is conducive to clarifying the ecological and environmental changes caused by urbanization. The objective of this study is to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to land use changes during urbanization. The aim is to provide useful information and advice for policy makers concerned with sustainable development. Shenzhen, one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in China, is selected as the study area. A fast evaluation method for ecological service values based on land use change was proposed and applied to the city for 1996, 2000 and 2004. The total value of ecosystem services in Shenzhen was 2776.0 million Yuan in 1996, 2911.4 million Yuan in 2000 and 2544.7 million Yuan in 2004 respectively, with a decrease of 231.3 million Yuan from 1996 to 2004 mainly due to the decreasing areas of woodland, wetland and water body. The combined ecosystem service value of woodland, wetland, water body and orchard was over 90% of the total value. Water supply and waste treatment were the top two service functions with high service value, contributing about 40% of the total service value. The results suggest that a reasonable land use plan should be made with emphasis on protecting wetland, water body and woodland, which have the highest ecosystem service value. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the decline over most of the 20(th) was neither continuous nor was it distributed evenly among different commodity groups. The far-reaching changes that the world economy underwent around 1920 and again around 1979 led to a stepwise deterioration which, over the long term, was reflected in roughly a halving of real commodity prices. Tropical agriculture fared the worst, whereas minerals had the best performance, with non-tropical agriculture in an intermediate situation.

A major flaw in Walrasian economics is the assumption of self-regarding agents-economic actors make decisions independently of social context and without regard to the behavior of other consumers and firms. Truly other-regarding behavior, such as altruism and altruistic punishment, cannot be fully captured in the standard economic model. Standard economic assumptions about human behavior make pure altruism an irrational anomaly that cannot survive the evolutionary selection process. However, recent findings from neuroscience, behavioral economics evolutionary game theory and animal behavior have paved the way for a realistic, science-based, and policy-relevant foundation for economic theory. Other-regarding emotions such as altruism, love, and envy are an essential part of the human experience. We use the Price equation, showing the feasibility of the evolution of group selection of altruistic preferences, to explore some of the implications of this phenomenon for economic theory and policy. We explore evidence that the human capacity for empathy evolved from primates and suggest that this was the precursor for human morality. We suggest that if we drop the assumption that fitness is equated with the consumption of market goods, pure altruism is no longer fitness reducing, particularly in western societies. We also examine individual preferences for altruism in terms of their effect on well being.

Measuring how social and economic systems are progressing to sustainability, is therefore a critical need. But it is dependent upon the development of analytical and methodological tools to measure progress, particularly, we argue, at the regional level. Achieving sustainability at the regional scale is important since it's at this scale where social institutions and ecological functioning are most closely linked. However, our recent study that evaluated the effectiveness of current sustainability, assessment methods at the regional scale found methods developed for the global, national and state scales are not entirely effective at assessing sustainability at this spatial scale. Following on from this critique, we developed and tested a new method for assessing sustainability, which we believe is applicable at the regional scale. The framework, Sustaining Human Carrying Capacity (SHCC), evaluates the sustainability of regional human activities by considering the pressures these activities have on regional ecosystems. SHCC was tested and evaluated at the regional scale, demonstrating its potential to be an effective method for monitoring sustainability. It also has potential to be used to inform the community and decision makers about the sustainability of their region, and help guide strategic planning to progress sustainability.

Another reason of this study was to find out the ways how to improve the performance of life insurance division of insurance sector in Pakistan which is comparatively low among Asian countries. This paper suggests that support of top management of organisation is a critical factor to continue the process of new product development and innovation in long term. This study found that insurance industry in Pakistan is still offering the limited number of innovative products in the category of life insurance; which is not sufficient to serve all consumer segments available in the market. Therefore, a gap exists in the market which needs to be addressed and this is a good opportunity for new insurance companies to enter the market with new product offerings to customers. The analysis will show the relationship between NPD and marketing innovation. The paper discusses the different types of innovation. This study is based on using qualitative interview technique with a sample size of 200 respondents in equal proportion of male and female. The convenient sampling procedure is used for this study because of a large number of policy holders; and therefore it was not possible to use random sampling.

The results showed that Yishuibao could restrain the growth of blue algae efficiently, and improve the biomass of green algae, and showed obvious dose-response relationship. The value of pH of each test group increased gradually in the whole experiment, and it has a less variation range (8.82-9.38). The content of ammonia nitrogen in the control ponds (Ck) had risen perpendicularly, and was significant higher than Eland E2 in the end of experiment (p<0.01). Concentration of COD increased slowly with culture time in the control ponds, but decreased by degrees in the treatment ponds, and the difference between Ck and three treatments were significant in the end of experiment (p<0.01). Concentration of NO(2)(-)-N and DO of each test group had increased slowly in the experiment, but the difference of the concentration of NO(2)(-)-N between Ck and three treatments were not significant (p>0.05), probably due to the high level value of pH inhibited denitrification in the experiment. Concentration of PO(4)3(-)-P of each test group had decreased slowly in the whole experiment. The conclusion base on the above factors showed that Yishuibao could significantly increase algae biodiversity, and decreased the contents of COD, ammonia nitrogen and PO(4)(3)-P in different degree, and increased the concentration of DO significantly (p<0.01), but no significant differences of concentration of NO(2)(-)-N were found between Ck and E1,E2 and E3 when in the high value of pH.","[Bi Xiangdong; Zhang Shulin; Xing Kezhi] Tianjin Agr Coll, Dept Fisheries Sci, Key Lab Aqua Ecol & Aquaculture Tianjin, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",Tianjin Agricultural University,"Bi, XD (通讯作者)，Tianjin Agr Coll, Dept Fisheries Sci, Key Lab Aqua Ecol & Aquaculture Tianjin, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China.",YL801123@Yahoo.com.cn,"xing, k/JEP-6928-2023",,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-17-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,352,359,,,,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BYF00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298334500055,0

The pressing need for a national policy response stems from a variety of sources, including increasing scarcity, evidence of climate change, jurisdictional ranging amongst states and a history of generous allocations to agriculture that are now proving unsustainable. Collectively, these forces have promoted a policy stance that embodies serious contradictions. On the one hand substantial public investments are being made to upgrade irrigation infrastructure on the grounds that this will 'save' water that can then be allocated to satisfy environmental demands. On the other hand, governments have been actively repurchasing water rights, in the hope of striking a better balance in severely stressed systems, such as the Murray-Darling Basin. This paper traces the contradictions in this policy approach and argues that greater emphasis on the market purchase of water rights would give rise to a more efficacious outcome.","[Crase, L.; O'Keefe, S.] La Trobe Univ, Reg Sch Business, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,,,"Crase, Lin/L-2072-2016","Crase, Lin/0000-0002-3615-7152",,,,,23,1,1,0,3,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

Design/methodology/approach The project was organized into eight interrelated but independent work packages (WPs) using semi-structured interviews, structured questionnaires and food diaries. Each interview took approximately one hour and was complemented by a background questionnaire (SF36) and seven day food diaries (shopping and consumption). The data from the interviews were transcribed and analysed using MaxQDA. Data from the Portuguese sample are presented and complemented by the eight country samples in the case of meal patterns, functional and convenience products. The sentences used to illustrate the memories of older people are quoted. Findings Health problems and physiological restraints along with social changes, loss of a partner and/or loneliness were identified as major factors behind the elderly food choice. Functional and convenience products are still not familiar to the elderly in Europe. Research limitations/implications More research on determinants of healthy ageing, especially in what concerns foods, and satisfaction with food, is required since efficient policies are needed to enable older populations to maintain their independence and a good satisfaction with food-related life. Originality/value This cross-cultural qualitative research provides important information about elderly food choice and the factors behind that choice.","[de Morais, Cecilia; Afonso, Claudia; de Almeida, M.

The efficient exploitation poses new demands on the information technology systems in general and on the underlying information models in particular. This paper aims to introduce a generic information model where functionality for handling RTIs with unique identification is included. Design/methodology/approach - Functional requirements are analysed based on process descriptions and use case examples from a real production environment. Detailed information modelling was then done in several iterations using entity-relationship diagrams. Validation of the model was done based on use cases typical for the food industry. Findings - The model described is developed within the broad scope of looking at opportunities for using wireless technology to improve business processes and traceability. This includes RFID, RF based sensors, sensor networks and real time location system (RTLS). It is vital that these large amounts of data are linked to identifiable entities for later retrieval and analysis. Unique identification of RTIs can be utilised to ensure that sensor data can be linked both to the RTI and to the content of the RTI. The links between the RTI and the content of the RTI are a basis for improving traceability. Research limitations/implications - Based on the information model, the next step is to develop a detailed specification for the implementation of the model. The results from the implementation will be used for further evaluation of the model, and might lead to improvements and changes in the model. Practical implications - Enabling technologies like RFID often lead to changes in existing processes and systems. This work is a contribution to developing more stable and application-independent information models in food processing companies. Originality/value - The paper shows that leveraging unique identification of returnable transport items to provide a finer meshed granularity and increased operational visibility of traceable units will not only improve traceability but will also give a more precise basis for process improvements and product differentiation in a food business.","[Senneset, Gunnar; Foras, Eskil] SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Trondheim, Norway; [Midtstraum, Roger] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Vevle, Geir] Matiq AS, Trondheim, Norway; [Mykland, Ingvill H.] Nortura ASA, Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Senneset, G (通讯作者)，SINTEF Fisheries & Aquaculture, Trondheim, Norway.",gunnar.senneset@sintef.no,,,Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This research project was funded partly by the Research Council of Norway.,,17,9,11,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

After controlling for environmental variables and hospital case-mix, inefficiency is negatively associated with specialization and positively associated with capitalization. Capitalization is typical of private structures which, on average, use resources less efficiently with respect to public and not-for-profit hospitals.

Based on various proposals in the literature, this article adopts a global master-plan perspective, leaving executive architecture to sovereign participants. Transparent, flexible and fair top-down rules must synchronize the numerous bottom-up initiatives while addressing the diversity of national circumstances in the drastic transformation of the world's energy economies. Plan B refutes absolute emission reduction targets on old or speculative baselines. It criticizes global tax and permit trade instruments for being ineffective, inefficient and unfair when uniformly applied on a tremendous differentiated world. Plan B is built on three annually observed variables measuring percentage progress against rolling baselines (the variables' values in the previous year): the ratio of net climate tax revenues to GDP, the commercial energy intensity of GDP, and the carbon intensity of commercial energy use. The three variables together indicate countries' progress affecting emissions per person, a metric that must converge to lower bands when climate change is addressed seriously. Long-term scenarios of global convergence funnels serve as guidance to frame near-term actions rich and poor countries individually propose to take. The global regime is common for all countries, and is ranked by GDP per person to determine whether a nation is a donor or a beneficiary in a Global Climate Transfer Fund. Fund payments and drawing rights depend on that ranking but also on the performances of the countries in realizing committed progress. The transparent mechanisms of the design and of the fund persuasively invite countries to participate in a fair, self-enforcing agreement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the role of risk management and financial intermediation in creating value for financial institutions by analyzing U.S. property-liability insurers. Our main goal is to test how risk management and financial intermediation activities create value for insurers by enhancing economic efficiency through cost reductions. We consider these two activities as intermediate outputs and estimate their shadow prices. Insurer cost efficiency is measured using an econometric cost function. The econometric results show that both activities significantly increase the efficiency of the property-liability insurance industry.","[Cummins, J.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to deal with physical input-output table (PIOT) measured in a single mass unit, by which the structure of PIOT need not be changed. The new approach yields consistent and reasonable results. It not only is simpler than the existing approaches but also can reflect the physical reality of economic systems. We first discuss and clarify the concept of different kinds of inputs and outputs of economic systems. We then present the details of the new approach. During the process we define a new multiplier, which builds a bridge between the total input and the final demand in PIOT, just like the traditional Leontief inverse in MIOT. We select the three-sector PIOT for Germany 1990 as a case study to show the validity of the new approach. Finally, we prove the equivalence between the new approach, Suh's approach and Dietzenbacher's approach and the equivalence of non-waste part and waste part multiplier of the new approach and Dietzenbacher's approach.

In Britain, Cornish engineers took the lead in the exploration of this specific technological trajectory. Notwithstanding its superior fuel efficiency was immediately widely discussed, the high-pressure expansive engine did not find widespread application in other steam-using regions (in particular in Lancashire), where the Watt low-pressure engine continued to be the favourite option. This article provides a reassessment of the factors accounting for the precocious adoption of the high-pressure steam engine in Cornwall and for its delayed fortune in the rest of Britain.","[Nuvolari, Alessandro] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy; Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Maastricht University,"Nuvolari, A (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy.",,"Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020; Nuvolari, Alessandro/F-3151-2011","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141; Nuvolari, Alessandro/0000-0002-7275-4827",,,,,54,19,19,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The general to specific modeling (top down approach) starts with a general model and subjects it to a sequence of restrictions to determine an acceptable specific model. This approach can start with a series expansion and the concavity or homotheticity conditions can be imposed to modify it into a cost or a production function. The simple to general modeling (bottom up approach) starts with a well known simple model and extends it until a complete system is formed. This approach can start with a Cobb-Douglas function (which satisfies the concavity and homogeneity conditions) and extends it to include the desired complexity. Relative advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches are discussed and tabulated.

The results show that the energy-related carbon intensity in China decreased by about three-fourths between 1992 and 2006 and reduced carbon emissions by about two billion tons. The decline in the energy-related carbon intensity was mainly caused by changes in production pattern, especially changes in energy intensity within each sector between 1992 and 2002. However, the most important driving force of carbon intensity from 2002-2006 was not the energy intensity within each sector but the input mix. On the other hand, changes in demand pattern pushed up the carbon intensity. To further decarbonize the economy in the future, it is important for China to further enforce policies on shaping the production pattern, such as reducing energy intensity, and pay more attention to increasing the sustainability of the demand pattern at the same time.

Given the ineffectiveness of command-and-control policies to curb the problem of illegal logging in Guatemala, the experiment assesses the potential viability of market-oriented solutions. Local consumers in developing countries are generally believed to be too poor to pay a premium for green/ethical products. Therefore, little information has been gathered on willingness-to-pay (WTP) for such products and its determinants in non-affluent consumer markets. While our experiment on firewood consumption in central Guatemala only implies a weak and indirect test of WTP for green products, the results indicate that it is premature, if not unwarranted, to assume that the poor are not ready to make pro-ethical choices in the marketplace. Moreover, we find that information on the legal procedures for firewood extraction significantly affects consumer choice between legal and illegal firewood. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The paper observes large differences among the WFs for specific types of primary bio-energy carriers. The WF depends on crop type, agricultural production system and climate. The WF of average bio-energy carriers grown in the Netherlands is 24 m(3)/GJ, in the US 58 m(3)/GJ, in Brazil 61 m(3)/GJ, and in Zimbabwe 143 m(3)/GJ. The WF of bio-energy is much larger than the WF of fossil energy. For the fossil energy carriers, the WF increases in the following order: uranium (0.1 m(3)/GJ), natural gas (0.1 m(3)/GJ), coal (0.2 m(3)/GJ), and finally crude oil (1.1 m(3)/GJ). Renewable energy carriers show large differences in their WF. The WF for wind energy is negligible, for solar thermal energy 0.3 m(3)/GJ, but for hydropower 22 m(3)/GJ. Based on the average per capita energy use in western societies (100 GJ/capita/year), a mix from coal, crude oil, natural gas and uranium requires about 35 m(3)/capita/year. If the same amount of energy is generated through the growth of biomass in a high productive agricultural system, as applied in the Netherlands, the WF is 2420 m(3). The WF of biomass is 70 to 400 times larger than the WF of the other primary energy carriers (excluding hydropower). The trend towards larger energy use in combination with an increasing contribution of energy from biomass will enlarge the need for fresh water. This causes competition with other claims, such as water for food. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Gerbens-Leenes, P. W.; Hoekstra, A.

People are often divided into various groups that have different social factors, sometimes leading to differences in the degree to which they cooperate in environmental conservation. This obstructs the social consensus needed to solve the environmental problems. Here we study the coupled dynamics of human socio-economic choice and lake water pollution, and examine the magnitude of the difference in cooperation levels between two groups. In the model, many players choose between a costly but cooperative option and a selfish option. The former results in a reduced phosphorus discharge into the lake. Each player's choice is affected by an economic cost and social pressure. Social pressure is a psychological factor that promotes cooperation: it becomes stronger when more players in the society are cooperative (conformist tendency) and when the problem at hand is a greater concern to society. In the model, two groups sometimes show large differences in their cooperation levels even when both have exactly the same social factors. However, cooperation levels are more likely to differ between groups that have different social factors. Enhancement of the cross-group conformist tendency is the most effective way to minimize differences in cooperation levels and to mitigate conflict between groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The data set consists of almost 17,000 observations from Local Labor Offices (LLOs) in Finland. According to the results, there are notable differences in matching efficiency between regions, and these differences contribute significantly to the number of filled vacancies. If all regions were as efficient as the most efficient one, the number of total matches per month would increase by over 23%. The heterogeneity of the job-seeker stock is an important determinant of matching efficiency: the weight of the composition of the job-seeker stock in the inefficiency terms is on average 85%.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Hynninen, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",sanna-mari.hynninen@econ.jyu.fi,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper sees that selected bacteria were subjected to laboratory simulations of commercially used heat treatments. In the case of sodium benzoate preservation, the bacteria were grown in the presence of a sub-lethal dose of this preservative. Cells and debris were subjected to LPS extraction, GC-MS analyses and endotoxicity measurement with the chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay. Findings - The heat treatments and preservation method influenced the LPS-related toxicity of each organism in a different manner. Increases in LPS-related toxicity were noted in the LPS liberated from UHT-treated E. coli and S. enteritidis and pasteurized E. coli and P aeruginosa. Toxicity of the membrane associated LPS of UHT-treated E. coli and pasteurized S. enteritidis was also elevated. Sodium benzoate resulted in E. coli cells with LPS with related toxicity levels almost double compared to that of the control cells. S. enteritidis LPS also demonstrated an increase in toxicity, while that of P aeruginosa was rendered less toxic. Practical implications - Toxicity could still be detected even after sterilization treatments like UHT, suggesting that viability and toxicity are not necessarily connected and that the toxicity of LPS molecules that remain in food products after treatment should be considered. Although ingestion of LPS originating from Gram-negative bacteria is a fairly new concept, the effect that these toxins might have on members of society with compromised immune systems and individuals suffering from gastrointestinal diseases cannot be ignored. Originality/value - The paper introduces a unique insight into food safety treatment-induced toxicological changes related to LPS originating from food-borne organisms, a factor that is currently unexplored in the South African food industry.","[Abraham, M.; Venter, P.; Lues, J.

Ornamental pineapple crops are present in several states of the Brazilian Northeast, as well as in the States of Goias and Tocatins. The micropropagation technique has helped to multiply plants with better uniformity and phytosanitary quality. These characteristics, as well as the use of adequate substrates contribute to plantlet growth in nursery and to reduce losses during field establishment. The aim of this work was to evaluate nursery growth of micropropagated ornamental pineapple plantlets in different substrates. Plantlets with a height between 3 cm and 5 cm and cylindrical containers (capacity 120 cm(3)) were used in this experiment carried out under screenhouse conditions with 50% of shading. The experimental design was in completely randomized blocks with six treatments, four replications and 18 plantlets per plot, with a factorial scheme of 3 (substrates) x 2 (presence or absence of fertilizer). The following substrates were used: carbonized rice husk (50%) and vermicompost (20%) with 30% of the following components: (S1) - ripe coconut mesocarp dust; (S2) - Plantagro (R); (S3) - vermiculite. Each substrate was supplemented with or without slow liberation fertilizer (Polyon 14: 14: 14 - 3,6 kg/m(3)). After a 120-day experimental period, the following was observed: a) average leaf number was larger in substrates supplemented with fertilizer than in its absence; b) larger root and shoot dry mass were achieved in S2 and S3 with fertilizer; c) easier plantlet withdrawing from the container was observed for S2 and d) the best root aggregation to the substrates occurred in S3 and S2.","[Correia, D.] Embrapa Trop Agroind, Rua Dra Sara Mesquita 2270, BR-60511110 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Rocha, M.

The studied environmental impacts are related to land use efficiency, organic matter content in the soil, nitrate and phosphate leaching to the water system, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretic framework uses the driver-state-response framework and literature data were analysed using meta-analysis methodology. Meta-analysis is the statistical analysis of multiple study results. Data were obtained by screening peer reviewed literature. Findings - From the paper's meta-analysis it can conclude that soils in organic farming systems have on average a higher content of organic matter. It can also conclude that organic farming contributes positively to agro-biodiversity (breeds used by the farmers) and natural biodiversity (wild life). Concerning the impact of the organic farming system on nitrate and phosphorous leaching and greenhouse gas emissions the result of the analysis is not that straightforward. When expressed per production area organic farming scores better than conventional farming for these items. However, given the lower land use efficiency of organic farming in developed countries, this positive effect expressed per unit product is less pronounced or not present at all. Original value - Given the recent growth of organic farming and the general perception that organic farming is more environment friendly than its conventional counterpart, it is interesting to explore whether it meets the alleged benefits. By combining several studies in one analysis, the technique of meta-analysis is powerful and may allow the generation of more nuanced findings and the generalisation of those findings.","[Mondelaers, Koen; Aertsens, Joris; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Mondelaers, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",koen.mondelaers@ugent.be,"Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017",,,,,,101,237,263,7,359,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The conclusions are that in an indirect tax regime, an increase in the administrative cost coefficient warrants an increase in the tax evasion coefficient in order to maintain the welfare obtained at the lower administrative cost. However in a direct tax regime, an increase in the administrative cost coefficient must be accompanied by a decrease in the tax evasion coefficient in order to maintain the level of profit or the level of worker utility obtained at the lower administrative cost.

Brazil is one of the largest growers of pineapple in the world, but is insignificant as industrial processor. The Asian producers focus on the total usage of pineapple, that is primarily fresh fruit combined with canning and juice production, where juice is basically a byproduct. In South America, fresh fruit is also the main usage, but the canning industry is not well developed and juice is produced from the whole fruit. Pineapple juice concentrate is applied to produce ready-to-drink pineapple juice or nectar and as main constituent in blends for multi fruit juices, nectars and juice drinks. The reason for that is that pineapple juice is considered as cheap juice solids compared to other fruit juice concentrates available, and as the concentrate is relatively neutral, it fits very well for blending with other tropical and exotic fruit juices of higher added value. Prices for juice concentrates on the international market are historically in the range of 1.000 to 1.300 US$/ton CFR Rotterdam, which means a huge challenge for efficiency in the whole industrial chain. Considering an annual world production of pineapple around 18 million t, we estimate that only roughly 1/3 is being industrially processed, mainly by canning (similar to 30%) and to juice (4%), being 2/3 consumed as fresh fruit. To further promote pineapple for industrial processing and value addition, several factors are crucial: integration of grower and processing industry, fruit type versus application, product portfolio, processing technology, logistics, marketing and promotion, and long term planning.","[Reinhardt, A.; Rodriguez, L.

A special attention is paid to the state of the environment and its relevance for security in SEE. Within this context, an assessment is provided and critical elements in the fields of nature protection, biodiversity, waste management, water management, agriculture, energy, transport, harmonization of national regulations with those of the EU are pinpointed. The central thesis is that the specific combinations of social, economic and environmental characteristics of countries of the region are causing (or can cause) serious instability and threaten security.

Using a single-year, monthly simulation model, it is found that under conditions of scarcity. households using smaller amounts of water are better off with a uniform rate than an increasing block. Large water users have opposing preferences. Similar results arise for those household characteristics which are correlated with water use, such as income, property value, number of residents, and outdoor area of the property. For example, low-income households prefer scarcity-inclusive uniform rates over increasing block rates when scarcity is present. Therefore, in contrast to popularized opinion, increasing block rates do not place the welfare burden of conservation on large water users, nor do such rates favor low-income people in scarce-water circumstances.

If firms fall into several groups, it is natural to allow each group to have its own distribution. This paper considers a method for nonparametrically modelling these distributions using Dirichlet processes. A common problem when applying nonparametric methods to grouped data is small sample sizes for some groups which can lead to poor inference. Methods that allow dependence between each group's distribution are one set of solutions. The proposed model clusters the groups and assumes that the unknown distribution for each group in a cluster are the same. These clusters are inferred from the data. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are necessary for model-fitting and efficient methods are described. The model is illustrated on a cost frontier application to US hospitals.","Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Griffin, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",J.E.Griffin-28@kent.ac.uk,,"Griffin, Jim/0000-0002-4828-7368",,,,,36,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It is thus important to examine how central governments provide funds for such local medical needs. In Japan, local governments finance all medical costs for the poor through their Public Assistance (PA) programs. Using the unique mechanism of the Japanese system of central grants, I construct a measure of transfer deficit which shows the portion of the PA expenditures that fails to be secured by the central grants. The distribution of such a measure provides important information to assess the regional equity in financing local programs. The results suggest a compromise on the regional equity in financing medical care for the indigent. Then, I explore the determinants of the deficit measure by performing a quantile regression analysis. Since no effects of potential determinants imply that the central grants well accommodate changes in local needs, finding such effects helps evaluate the performance of the transfer system. The results shows that, among others, the number of PA households and the factors related to mental illness of PA recipients have positive impacts that attenuate toward the top of the conditional quantile of the transfer deficit. I elaborate on plausible causes of such attenuating responses.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Hayashi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",hayashim@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Hayashi, Masayoshi/A-2845-2015","Hayashi, Masayoshi/0000-0001-7455-8873",,,,,44,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

We argue that the previous studies of the trade flows during these conflicts have not paid enough attention on smaller actors. Even though the Peninsular War caused severe disruption of agricultural production in Portugal, the United States, despite its strained relations with an ally of Portugal, Great Britain, became a key supplier for the Portuguese market. Clearly, the threatened position of the peninsula, and the need to supply the troops, awarded the Portuguese some room to manoeuvre in the international markets. Total war was not a constraint for all states - economic necessities trumped political and diplomatic concerns during the era of the first real-world wars. This situation was a temporary one, only to change after the conflict.","[Moreira, Cristina] Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Eloranta, Jari] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Hist, Boone, NC 28608 USA",Universidade do Minho; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Moreira, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",mcristina@eeg.uminho.pt; elorantaj@appstate.edu,"Moreira, Maria Cristina/N-8692-2013","Moreira, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-4783-0410; Eloranta, Jari/0000-0002-8572-5902",,,,,49,4,7,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Concerns over accountability and legitimacy pertain to all levels of governance, from the local to the global, and cover the spectrum of public and private governance arrangements. This conceptual article elaborates on the sources, mechanisms and reform options relating to more accountable, legitimate and democratic earth system governance. We proceed in four steps. First, we conceptualize accountability and legitimacy in earth system governance. Second, we place questions of accountability and legitimacy within the larger context of earth system transformation, which, we argue, poses special challenges to the pursuit of accountability and legitimacy. Third, drawing on the contributions to this special section, we analyze different sources and mechanisms of accountability and legitimacy and their effects on the democratic potential and effectiveness of governance.

Yet we know relatively little about the networks of supply and purchasing patterns of rural elites, or about how their practices related to broader changes in material culture. Drawing on a large sample of bills and receipts of the Leigh family of Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, this article recreates the processes through which the material culture of the family home was constructed. These reveal London as the source for many high-quality goods, although the pattern of supply was not a simple dichotomy of local-everyday and metropolitan-luxury purchases. They also show the large number of shopkeepers patronized as the Leighs spread their purchases through choice, convenience, and expediency. Relating this to wider conceptions of consumption, the Leighs emerge as engaging in layered and sometimes conflicting consumer cultures. They were concerned with fashion as novelty and a marker of rank; but they also valued traditional markers of status. Social distinction was achieved through a continued emphasis on title and lineage as much as fashion or taste-value systems that were unavailable to the middling sorts.","Univ Northampton Hist, Northampton, England",University of Northampton,"Stobart, J (通讯作者)，Univ Northampton Hist, Northampton, England.",,,"Stobart, Jon/0000-0002-9771-4741",AHRC [AH/H008365/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/H008365/1] Funding Source: researchfish,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,57,15,17,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Because of a big variety of agricultural land prices throughout the EU, two major groups were selected for thorough analysis - one with the highest land prices (old member states) and one with the lowest (mostly new member states). Land prices in those groups were tested for the relationship with various macro level factors of economic development or national agriculture using multiple regression analysis methods. Despite differences in scale the analysis revealed similarities in price determination. The analysis of prices in 2000-2002 which represent prices at rather steady stage of price development revealed the key determinants of agricultural land price both for old and for new member states, namely, the GDP per capita in purchasing power standard and density of agricultural labour force (persons) in area utilised for agriculture. Price development curves indicated different behaviour in both groups during the research - the slope of price curves in 2004 in most of the new EU member states changed as they had joined the EU, while the development of prices in old member states continued their previous pace of development. The analysis of agricultural land market prices in old member states during the whole period of research (2000-2008) revealed the following determinants of price at the price growth stage: simple ratio (or more complex expression in some models) of utilised agricultural area to the total area of land, negative influence of higher GDP per capita in some models, density of annual working units (labour force) in area utilised for agriculture (or more complex expression in some models) and the time factor. According to the analysis of prices in new member states from 2004 on, the average price of agricultural land was determined by the following factors: GDP per capita in PPS and density of annual working units in area utilised for agriculture, as in model of previous years, producer price index of total agricultural production and the time factor. Although models of price development in steady stage are very accurate, accuracy of simple multiple regression models in price growth stage is a little lower. However, the autoregressive models feature accuracy acceptable for modelling price development in time.","[Aleknavicius, Marius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Land Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,amarius@takas.lt,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,385,390,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500068,0

This study aims to explore how consumers undergoing rapid socio-economic transition manage their conflicting values in making choices concerning functional foods. Design/methodology/approach - Data for this study were collected qualitatively using ethnoconsumerist and grounded-theory methodologies. In combination, these two approaches enabled the researcher to conduct research at the emic-level (within culture). Findings - The exploratory model was developed to illustrate how the main three ethnic groups in Malaysia manage their values in terms of functional food consumption. The results showed that participants did not spend much time consciously considering their consumption choices or their values until they were faced with choices or personal values that were inconsistent with cultural, physical and product characteristics. Values are managed by prioritisation and balancing to suit the participant's health needs and situation. Research limitations/implications - The study's findings are based only on the Malay, Chinese and Indian ethnic groups in Malaysia. Practical implications - The model can be used to help food practitioners, policy-makers and educators evaluate practices aimed at improving dietary behaviour. Originality/value - The finding gives new insight into how consumers in developing multicultural society consume functional foods.","Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Hassan, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden, Malaysia.",siti.hassan@usm.my,"Hassan, Siti Hasnah/E-3199-2012","Hassan, Siti Hasnah/0000-0003-4954-3674",,,,,71,15,16,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Nowadays it is a commercially viable species and keeping up sustainable deliveries of birch timber to the domestic plywood industry is of essential importance. Although the total growing stock of birch exceeds 153 million m(3), the uneven age structure of birch stands suggests that we may face a shortage of domestic birch logs in some 30 ... 40 years. Greater use of genetically superior reproductive material in forest regeneration, forest establishment on farmlands, and an intensive treatment of young stands have a potential to improve the productivity and quality of birch forests, thus increasing the availability of birch timber resources in the future. Because of the fact that at present the private forest owners, mainly to economize on funds, prefer natural regeneration the proportion of birch and other broadleaves in Latvian forests is expected to go up. That is why intensive management of naturally regenerated stands is of special importance to maintain and increase the value of forests.","[Liepins, Kaspars; Baumanis, Imants; Gailis, Arnis; Allis, Janis] Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, Riga, Latvia",Latvian State Forest Research Institute Silava,,kaspars.liepins@silava.lv; imants.baumanis@silava.lv; arnis.gailis@silava.lv; janis.allis@silava.lv,"Liepiņš, Kaspars/E-8017-2018","Liepiņš, Kaspars/0000-0002-1179-8586",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,69,73,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500012,0

One of such obligations is the compensation that customers receive in the case of service degradation or interruption. This obligation exposes the service provider to the risk of paying large amounts of money in the case of massive disruptions. The evaluation of such risk is preliminary to any countermeasure the service provider may wish to take to mitigate the risk. In this paper we evaluate the probability distribution of economical losses associated to service failures under a Markovian ON-OFF service model. We provide expressions for such distributions under three compensation policies, linked respectively to the number of failures, the number of outages lasting more than a prescribed threshold, and the cumulative downtime over a finite time horizon. In order to provide a single measure of risk, we compute the Value-at-Risk (VaR) for those compensation policies. We show that the VaR provides an accurate view of the risk incurred by the service provider, and allows to differentiate compensation policies, even when they lead to equal average losses.","[Mastroeni, Loretta] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Naldi, Maurizio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Informat, Sistemi Prod, I-00133 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Mastroeni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",mastroen@uniroma3.it; naldi@disp.uniroma2.it,"Naldi, Maurizio/GXW-3240-2022; NALDI, MAURIZIO/M-5612-2015","MASTROENI, LORETTA/0000-0001-8926-8924; NALDI, MAURIZIO/0000-0002-0903-398X",,,,,9,13,13,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-642-24546-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2011,6995.0,,,,,,2,+,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BBA18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306259200002,0

The immobilization efficacy of the amendment was evaluated according to heavy metal concentration in edible tissue of fast growing crop romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) as an indicator of metal phytoavailability. Vegetative pot experiments were conducted on metal-treated sandy loam soil mixed with lime-mud at a ratio of 5% and 10%. Soil spiking significantly increased DTPA-extractable concentration of heavy metals in the soil. Lime-mud amendment reduced metal availability in artificially contaminated soils effectively, while DTPA-extractable Cu concentration increased in the lime-mud amended soils. Soil spiking with metals caused a significant increase of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn concentration in lettuce leaves, being by 4-52 times higher as compared with control, while addition of lime-mud amendment to metal salt-spiked soils generally lowered metal concentrations in lettuce edible tissue. Lime-mud additive decreased accumulation ability of heavy metals in lettuce leaves significantly. Accumulation coefficients of Zn and Cd decreased as metal treatment level increased. Studied metals according to their accumulation capacity can be ranked in the following order: Zn>Cd>Cu>Pb. The highest correlation between metal DTPA-extractability from soil and metal concentration in lettuce aboveground tissue was in the case of Zn (R=0.94) and Cd (R=0.91), lower relationship was in the case of Pb (R=0.75), and the weakest relationship was in the case of Cu (R=0,53).","[Paulauskas, Valdas; Vaicikauskaite, Alfreda] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Chem, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,valdas.paulauskas@asu.lt; alfreda.vaicikauskaite@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,3,4,2,4,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,411,415,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000067,0

All live organisms are destroyed in a high temperature environment. It is very important to find optimal treatment time of high temperature so that pathogenic organisms would be destroyed but germination characteristics of the seeds would remain unaffected. Investigation performed on 2009-2010 in Forest's Seeds and Plantings Quality Department laboratory and Siauliai Forest Enterprise nursery.

We examine the origin of the Exchange and follow its evolution over the first half-century of existence. To this end we introduce some of the stock exchange indexes we have calculated for Bilbao and put them into comparative perspective with the existing series on general economic and industrial activity and the indexes for other Spanish exchanges for the period considered. These comparisons show Bilbao's evolution from a public debt-dominated market to an industrial exchange very much tied to regional development. Finally, we contrast the degree of financial market integration associated with the existing Spanish exchange indexes. Our analysis finds strong support for considering the BSE index as an industrial index and little evidence of capital market integration between the principal Spanish exchanges before the 1920s.","[Houpt, Stefan; Rojo Cagigal, Juan Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Houpt, S (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",shoupt@clio.uc3m.es; jcrojo@clio.uc3m.es,"HOUPT, STEFAN/F-8449-2016","HOUPT, STEFAN/0000-0001-7994-7114",,,,,50,1,1,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Currently, international trade offers trillions of dollars in incentives for countries to convert natural capital into marketable goods and services, and few payments to entice countries to conserve natural capital in order to sustain critical non-marketed ecosystem services. We examine the biophysical characteristics of climate change and biodiversity to understand the obstacles to developing effective IPES schemes. We find that none of the existing schemes for providing GES are adequate, given the scale of the problem. A cap and auction scheme for CO2 emissions among wealthy nations could fund IPES and simultaneously deter carbon emissions. To disburse funds, we should adapt Brazil's ICMS ecologic, and apportion available funds to targeted countries in proportion to how well they meet specific criteria designed to measure the provision of GES. Individual countries can then develop their own policies for increasing provision of these services, ensured of compensation if they do so. Indirect IPES should include funding for freely available technologies that protect or provide GES, such as the low carbon energy alternatives that will be essential for curbing climate change. Markets rely on the price mechanism to generate profits, which rations technology to those who can afford it, reducing adoption rates, innovation and total value. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A stylised theoretical model is used to explore the conditions by which both agrobiodiversity and conventional input intensification may increase through optimal adjustments of input use in agrobiodiversity-poor agroecosystems. The model shows that this result can arise in quite general circumstances where there is (1) an agricultural production technology that allows a positive relationship between ecological integrity of a given agricultural area and agricultural productivity, and (2) decision maker preferences that recognise this positive relationship and generate resource allocation decisions that support it. While increase in agrobiodiversity conservation is a necessary condition for optimal resource adjustments, whether input use will increase or decrease along this optimal path depends on the buffering effect of agrobiodiversity on ecosystem damage and the relative societal welfare impacts of agricultural output (e.g., food and fibre) reductions and ecosystem damage. Thus we identify conditions that promote agrobiodiversity as a supporting service for the sustainable intensification of agricultural production. A provocative hypothesis derived from the model points at the possibility that ecosystem damage (agrobiodiversity loss) can optimally decline even when agriculture undergoes an intensification process.

The paper seeks to extend current socio-economic statistics and analysis by including environmental considerations in a 'triple bottom line' or 'sustainability assessment' approach. Further, a life-cycle approach is employed for a number of indicators so that both direct and indirect impacts are considered where applicable. Whereas urban populations are generally doing better against most quantitative economic and social indicators, environmental indicators show the opposite, reflecting the increasing market-based environmental impacts of urban populations. As we seek to value these environmental impacts appropriately, it would be beneficial to start incorporating these results in policy and planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The urban environmental sustainability of 46 typical Chinese cities in 2007 was evaluated with Data Envelopment Analysis in this paper, and the Malmquist Productivity Index was used to identify the change within 2006-2007. This analysis employed indicators from economic, environmental, and resource sub-systems which are frequently involved in the concept of environmental sustainability. We introduced projecting and benchmarking as two possible approaches for less sustainable cities to refer to their peers, Based on the computed results and empirical analysis, the roles of GDP per capita, city scale, and industrial structure as influence factors of environmental sustainability were explored; and the regional disparity of urban environmental sustainability was also investigated. The results show: (1) 24% of the sample cities (e.g. Beijing, Hohhot, etc.) are relatively environmentally sustainable. The efficiency scores of Urumqi rank the last. (2) GDP per capita, city scale, and industrial structure factors all exert significant influence on urban environmental sustainability. (3) The environmental sustainability of southeast cities leads the 6 major Chinese regions, and cities around the Bohai area are rapidly approaching environmental sustainability.

However, the implemented strategies for the conservation of biodiversity may differ from those adopted for the maintenance of natural capital: consequently, planning for natural capital might require a different strategy from that used in conservation policies The aim of this paper is to assess the 'conservation effect' of different conservation policies on the maintenance of NCF in three natural parks in Apulia Region (southern Italy). The assessment of natural capital flow variation has been carried out investigating the temporal dynamics of land-use/land-cover mosaics, and using Costanza et al's economic coefficients as surrogates of NCF. Results showed that not all environmental conservation management strategies have played an equal role in fostering NCF This research highlights that the recognition of the natural value of a site according to the European Directives (e g NATURA 2000 network) is not sufficiently effective for the conservation of the NCF, while It is necessary to identify a management authority that can appropriately drive landscape transformations, and sets, if necessary, the appropriate limitations. In addition, the management of these areas as part of a network of natural parks seems to be more effective for the maintenance of NCF. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the choice experiment (CE), the improvement is described in terms of four water quality attributes: water clarity, abundance of coarse (non-attractive) fish, status of bladder wrack (a type of seaweed), and mass occurrences of blue-green algae blooms. The data are analysed with multinomial logit (MNL), random parameters logit (RPL), and latent class (LCM) models. The results from MNL and RPL show that, on average for Finns, clear water is, relatively speaking, the most important water quality characteristics followed by desire for fewer occurrences of blue-green algae. The results also show that the probability of expressing willingness to contribute to improvement of the water quality increases with residential or recreational contact with the Gulf of Finland, a higher income than average. a younger than average age, and lack of dependent children in the household. The LCM reveals that opinions about the order of relative importance of attributes depend on age, household income, coastal residence, and vacation home ownership. The present values for three nutrient reduction scenarios of different intensities ranging from 28,000 million euro to 54,000 million euro were calculated using mean welfare estimates, discounted for perpetuity with a 2% rate.

It seeks to highlight the relative importance attached by the experts to key explanatory variables in the consumers' purchase process of organic food. It attempts to integrate with the relevant consumer survey findings published in India in recent times in organic food category. Design/methodology/approach - The list of experts was prepared by including regular and well-known speakers in different agri enclaves and summits and who are members of different food industry bodies. Experts were contacted through judgmental sampling method. Feedback on the expert questionnaires was collected from July to October 2007 from 33 highly knowledgeable senior experts primarily through face-to-face personal surveys and through e-mail surveys. Findings - Importance placed on health motivation has the highest average rating and is one of the lowest standard deviations among the explanatory variables in the expert survey. Experts also rate the importance of the three mentioned attitudes (about conviction about utility of organic food, reputation of store and certification process-related information), organic food-specific consumer innovativeness, organic food-specific consumer opinion leadership, word of mouth (WOM) (activity), WOM (praise) and affective commitment about the store to be high in the consumers' purchase process. Originality/value - The novelty of the paper lies in the fact that it addresses the key issues facing the organic food category in India from an expert survey point of view.","Inst Management Technol, Mkt Area, Ghaziabad, India","Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad","Chakrabarti, S (通讯作者)，Inst Management Technol, Mkt Area, Ghaziabad, India.",somnath_chakrabarti@rediffmail.com,"Chakrabarti, Somnath/AAG-4373-2020","Chakrabarti, Somnath/0000-0001-7625-4814",,,,,50,72,73,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Under the background of global warming, the increases of climatic instability will have a direct impact on crop yield and its stability. Long-term experiment is the best platform to test the crop yield changes. In this paper, winter wheat yield data were analyzed with three long-term experiments from different climatic zones in China. The results showed that treatment NPK with organic manure or straw obtained the highest yield in three different long-term experiment stations. The treatment lack of P obtained the lowest yield in Beijing of the north and Qiyang of the south, but the treatment lack of N was the lowest in Zhengzhou of the central. The effect of P, K was not the same. The effect of fertilizer P was greater than K in the three stations, comparison of yield stability index, yield stability of NPK and NPK with organic manure or straw was the highest in the three stations. Especially in the south of the Qiyang station, the yield stability of NPK with organic manure significantly increased. The effect of fertilizer organic manure was less obvious in the northern. Thought the stability analysis of linear regression, the treatments of NP, NPK, NPKM, 1.5NPKM and NPKS belonged to the same stable yield type, and had the less impact on yield on the conditions of environment change. While the treatments of CK,N,NK,PK had greater impact and belonged to unstable yield type.","[Chen Changqing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Nanjing Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil Science, CAS","Chen, CQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,National Basic Research Program of China [2005CB121108]; Chinese Natural Science Foundation [30771278],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Chinese Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2005CB121108), the Chinese Natural Science Foundation (30771278).",,18,0,0,1,10,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-17-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,162,+,,,,,,2,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BYF00,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298334500025,0

Foreign tourist arrivals have declined in recent years and local visitors exceeded foreigners (Department of Wildlife National Park Report, DWNP 2006). Travel destination selection can become a complex phenomenon because it is influenced by several factors. There is no differentiation as many leading destinations are offering excellent attractions, services and facilities. As a result, there is a need for destinations to portray a unique identity and servicescape and it is becoming more critical than ever. Tourists perceive destinations in many ways, looking for different 'signs', culture and the whole experience and adventure at a national park (Backhaus, 2003). Visitors to TN are looking for authenticity with untainted, natural environment in harmony with local traditional culture. Understanding nature-based tourists through segmentation is deemed important for park management. This paper explores segmenting nature-based tourism at TN. This has significant value for nature-based segmentation strategy for TN. Few researches have embarked on environmental dimensions of servicescape in a tourist setting specifically on how tourists perceive servicescape in nature-based tourism. This study fills the gap by exploring tourist perceptions on the importance and satisfaction of servicescape at TN. Service quality on tourist-related and park support services is also examined. Methodology involved qualitative studies using personal and focus group interviews with park stakeholders. Quantitative study entails on-site survey questionnaire approach to 265 park visitors. Findings revealed extreme sport, leisure, fun and educational adventures as core segments of tourist activities at TN. The main tourist segments identified are hedonist, fun, leisure seekers and nature lovers. Tourists perceived servicescape as very important at TN. Overall servicescape satisfaction was fair. Service quality of transportation, hotels and restaurants, tour guide, public services were rated for reliability, quality, consistency and ease of use.

Although such policies, often called, nativization programmes, come in different forms depending on their aims and motives they are always about encouraging the indigenous population to take up jobs in the economy and about entreating employers to cooperate in this process by offering training and opportunity to locals. More often than not this means substituting indigenous workers for expatriate or imported labour a process which rarely attracts the cooperation of industry. Whatever way the policy is constituted is it creating favourable market conditions for local nationals. In this paper we explore the issues that surround the implementation of a nationally-orientated employment policy and then take them into the context of the tourism industry. We outline the uncomfortable position which such policies usually inhabit within social and economic environments and highlight the questions which such policies have to address. Our analysis theoretically explores the compatibility of nationalization employment policies with the normal functioning of tourism and hospitality labour markets. More specifically our analysis looks at entrance level conditions for skilled and unskilled occupations and questions firstly, whether junior management, and particularly entrance level management from vocational education in tourism and hospitality, have a marginal position in relation to both average earnings and the boundary of the country's primary labour market. And, secondly, whether pay in tourism employment may not offer a sufficient reserve wage to encourage nationals into its secondary labour market. We see these issues as particular problems which the tourism sector presents to the implementation nationalization policies. Based on this analysis we suggest some criteria by which policies can be evaluated and point to the key areas of data.","[Szivas, Edith M.; Riley, Michael] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-026-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,199,202,,,,,,4,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BSB91,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284085200041,0

Thus economies with organized and visionary small and medium business firms appeared to have a budget surplus and therefore provide basic support (e.g. education, health and other social securities) to every citizen within jurisdiction. For instance in United State, United Kingdom and Canada, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the acknowledged generators of significant economic growth, employment and business development. in Tanzania small and medium agri-firms provides about 80% of total workforce, contributes 40% to growth domestic product and has a 25% share in the country's exports. That is, small and medium sized service firms such as small independent restaurants, souvenir shops and village cultural tours contribute a small portion to employment and government coffer. Depending on agriculture alone is not good for the prosperity of Tanzania as the agricultural productivity is continuously declining. The benefits of developing small tourism businesses were argued early 1980's on by many authors and it seems that foreign investments is likely to produce a net gain to the local small projects. In this paper, the impact of Foreign Direct Investment on development of small and medium tourism enterprises is examined. Factors that hinder foreign direct investment spillover to small and medium tourism enterprises in Tanzania are assessed. Specifically, the role of foreign direct investment in improving small and medium tourism firm's efficiency in Tanzania and structural and policy reforms required for more incubation of small and medium enterprises in tourism are examined. The study uses literature review, questionnaires, interviews and personal observation to draw its conclusions and policy recommendations. It is observed that foreign direct investment has a positive impact on efficiency and productivity especially to small and medium tourism enterprises which normally have problem of adapting new technology and poor means of accessing the market. The study recommends reviewing of the small entrepreneurship institutional setup for increasing productivity and foreign direct investment flow to the tourism sector. An important implication of the results is that foreign direct investment to Tanzania and specifically to tourism provides much more far- reaching economic and social impact than in other sectors.","[Ui, Ussi M.; Wei Jiangguo] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,,,"yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022; wei, jiang/GRX-7907-2022",,,,,,10,0,0,1,11,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-026-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,271,277,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BSB91,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284085200055,0

Analysis includes descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations of factors such as product category, type of FOP scheme, company, and year. Findings - Private label brands dominate food innovations in the UK. The use of FOP labels is selective among companies and across food categories. Guideline daily allowance (GDA) labelling is more widely adopted than the traffic light labelling system (TLS). Both systems have been more broadly adopted in target food categories when compared to non-target food categories. Research limitations/implications - The database used to conduct this research provides detailed data on food product innovations released in the UK. However, this is not linked to sales data and therefore cannot be used to analyse changes in consumption due to FOP labelling systems. Nevertheless, the response of food manufacturers and retailers in their innovation strategies is a critical piece to understanding how voluntary labelling polices may impact public health. Originality/value - The paper presents evidence of dynamics of supply-side responses to increasing consumer demand for healthier foods.","[Van Camp, D. J.; Hooker, N.

Global warming and peak oil undermine globalization by their effects on both transportation costs and the reliable movement of freight. Countering the current geographic pattern of comparative advantage with higher transportation costs, climate change and peak oil will thus result in peak globalization, after which the volume of exports will decline as measured by ton-miles of freight. Policies designed to mitigate climate change and peak oil are very unlikely to change this result due to their late implementation, contradictory effects and insufficient magnitude. The implication is that supply chains will become shorter for most products and that production of goods will be located closer to where they are consumed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines firm incentives to invest in R&D to compete for patents in makets where consumers rely on word-of-mouth information and have expectations about the new products before launch. When its loss due to a possible entry is above a threshold, an incumbent has more incentives than a potential entrant to invest in R&D for patents. Moreover, if the current product is more profitable, its true quality is above consumer priors and the quality of the new product is below a threshold, it is optimal for the incumbent to launch the new product after a time lag. The later the optimal time of launch, the greater is the incumbent's potential loss if entry occurs and greater its incentives is to invest in R&D versus that of the entrants. While potential entrants are generally thought to have more incentives to invest in a drastic innovation which results in a race to launch the new products, we show that the more drastic the innovation, the later the optimal time of launch and greater are the incumbent's incentives to invest in R&D when the value added of the new product can be conveyed to all the consumers. Only when consumers are uncertain about the value added of the new product, the incumbent's incentives are lower. We also demonstrate that by promoting consumer expectations about the new product before launch, an incumbent has more time to launch and higher probability of dominating its market.","[Banerjee, Sumitro] ESMT European Sch Management & Technol GmbH, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Sarvary, Miklos] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France",European School of Management & Technology; INSEAD Business School,"Banerjee, S (通讯作者)，ESMT European Sch Management & Technol GmbH, Schlosspl 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",sumitro.banerjee@esmt.org; miklos.sarvary@insead.edu,"Banerjee, Sumitro/JXW-8331-2024","Banerjee, Sumitro/0000-0002-8589-3439",,,,,31,5,5,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Based on the explanation that SDC can be viewed as community, it develops SDC (monetary value) structure by analogy with community (trophic) structure. As energy flow in ecology follows the first and second laws of thermodynamics, monetary value flow in business follows two laws that are similar to the laws of thermodynamics. Based on these laws, as well as throughput accounting and traditional cost accounting, it puts forward a general monetary value flow model in SDC (i.e. in demand chain and in supply chain respectively). Based on the value flow model in SDC, it conceives an SDC evolution model with a case study on the maturity of Toyota Motor Corporation. Based on these two models, it develops an SPMS for firms across SDC with procedural and structural frameworks. The discussion about monetary value flows in business from nature to the final consumers or converse gives a chance to coordinate business with nature. The SPMS that rationally integrates effective evaluation of tiers in SDC and practical product development plans in firm will help firms create a sustainable commerce (e.g. product-service system).

In hospital reimbursement, prospective payments for patient discharges, based on their classification into diagnosis related group (DRGs), are complemented by outlier payments for long stay patients. The outlier scheme fixes the length of stay (LOS) threshold, constraining the profit risk of the hospitals. In most DRG systems, this threshold increases with the standard deviation of the LOS distribution. The present paper addresses the adequacy of this DRG outlier threshold rule for risk-averse hospitals with preferences depending on the expected value and the variance of profits. It first shows that the optimal threshold solves the hospital's tradeoff between higher profit risk and lower premium loading payments. It then demonstrates for normally distributed truncated LOS that the optimal outlier threshold indeed decreases with an increase in the standard deviation.","Duisburg Essen Univ, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Felder, S (通讯作者)，Duisburg Essen Univ, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",stefan.felder@uni-due.de,,,,,,,7,13,13,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Knowledge about the magnitude of the in situ benefits provides no guide for policy about conservation management. Simply knowing that people are willing to pay a large amount each year to protect a species says nothing about whether one should manage habitat to protect or enhance the species' numbers, unless the species is in imminent danger of extinction. If willingness to pay is to be a guide. it needs to be better tied to population numbers, especially the minimum viable population. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate a Ricardian model of net livestock incomes and further estimate the marginal impacts of climate change. We also simulate the impact of different climate scenarios on livestock incomes. The Ricardian results show that livestock production in Kenya is highly sensitive to climate change and that there is a non-linear relationship between climate change and livestock productivity. The estimated marginal impacts suggest modest gains from rising temperatures and losses from increased precipitation. The predictions from atmospheric ocean general circulation models suggest that livestock farmers in Kenya are likely to incur heavy losses from global warming. The highest and lowest losses are predicted from the Hadley Centre Coupled model (HADCM) and Parallel Climate Model (PCM) respectively, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. The paper concludes that in the long term, climate change is likely to lead to increased poverty, vulnerability and loss of livelihoods. Several policy interventions are recommended to counter this impact. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For the goal of limiting SUVs and trucks, results indicated that participants favored voluntary actions over hard regulations, and soft regulations over voluntary actions. For the goal of increasing green energy, results indicated that participants preferred both voluntary actions and soft regulations over hard regulations, but had no significant preference between voluntary actions and soft regulations. How the problems were framed did not significantly affect participants' willingness to accept voluntary actions or regulations. Participants' environmental attitudes (as assessed using the New Ecological Paradigm scale) had a strong positive relationship with support for regulatory strategies intended to change the behaviors in question.

In addition to their interest in comparing different management systems on an indicator by indicator basis, land managers are often interested in comparing individual indicators against a threshold, or, in order to study trade-offs, against each other. To this end it is necessary to (1) transform the original indicators into a comparable format, and (2) score these transformed indicators against a sustainability function. This paper introduces an evaluation method for land-use-related impact indicators, which was designed to accomplish these tasks. it is the second of a series of two papers, and as such it links into a larger framework for sustainability assessment of land use systems. The evaluation scheme introduced here comprises (1) a standardisation procedure, which aims at making different indicators comparable. In this procedure indicators are first normalised, by referencing them to the total impact they contribute towards, and then they are corrected by a factor describing the severity of this total impact in terms of exceeding a threshold. The procedure borrows conceptually from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Impact Analysis methodology; (2) a valuation procedure, which judges the individual standardised indicators with regard to sustainability. This methodology is then tested on an indicator set for the environmental impact of a spinach production system in Northwest Germany. The method highlights mineral resource consumption, greenhouse gas emission, eutrophication and impacts on soil quality as the most important environmental effects of the studied system. We then explore the effect of introducing weighting factors, reflecting the differing societal perception of diverse environmental issues. Two different sets of weighting factors are used. The influence of weighting is, however, small compared to that of the standardisation procedure introduced earlier. Finally, we explore the propagation of uncertainty (defined as a variable's 95% confidence limits) throughout the standardisation procedure using a stochastic simulation approach. The uncertainty of the analysed standardised indicator was higher than that of the non-standardised indicators by a factor of 2.0 to 2.5. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our objective is to investigate how much of the interregional inequality in aggregate productivity per worker is imputable to each component. A methodology for identifying and analyzing sources of inequality from a decomposed perspective is developed in the growth framework by combining a shift-share based technique and a SUR model specification for the conditional-convergence analysis. The proposed approach is employed to analyze aggregate interregional inequality of per worker productivity levels in Italy over the period 1970-2000. With respect to the existing empirical results, our approach provides a more comprehensive and detailed examination of the contribution of each identified component in explaining the regional productivity gaps in Italy. It is argued that region-specific productivity differentials, uniform across sectors, explain a quite large share of differences in productivity per worker. However, sectoral composition plays a non negligible role, although decreasing since the end of 1980s, and very different productivity patterns emerge within geographical areas.","[Bernardini Papalia, Rosa] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bertarelli, Silvia] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ Ist Territorio, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Ferrara,"Bernardini Papalia, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",rossella.bernardini@unibo.it; silvia.bertarelli@unife.it,,", Silvia/0000-0001-7478-9014",,,,,44,5,5,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We complement the common practice of linking firm performance indicators to regional characteristics with survey evidence on the perceived importance of locational factors. While the former approach assumes that location characteristics affect all firms in the same way, the survey allows us to model how firms judge the attractiveness of locations using a heterogeneous set of criteria. It turns out that the availability of highly skilled labor and the proximity to suppliers matter for firms' innovation performance.

Since mid 1990s select Project Tiger Reserves in India were chosen for intensive funding by the Global Environment Facility, the International Development Agency (IDA) and the Government of India under the 'India Eco-Development Project'. This project marked a modest shift towards debt based funding. The GEF Project has become a benchmark for tiger conservation in India both in terms of management outcomes and scale and scope of funding. However in the absence of large-scale budgetary support or self-generating income flows, it becomes difficult for the GEF type of project to be replicated in other tiger reserves of the country. Debt instruments hold promise as enablers of conservation finance. The paper proposes issue of 'tiger bonds' to meet the financial requirements of tiger reserves. Though attractive as a debt instrument, a 'tiger bond' could nevertheless entail interest rate and default risks. Bioprospecting activities form good revenue sources for tiger reserves to pay off their debts. However bioprospecting activities do not provide assured returns to tiger reserves. Pharmaceutical companies that prospect for genetic resources and practice 'real options' approach to R&D investment planning, adopt multi-phased investment systems and sequential searches that gives them the flexibility to abandon R&D projects. From the point of view of genetic resource providing entities like Project Tiger Reserves, the 'postponement value' generated by real options, enables a drug company to tap substitutes for the genetic resources that form the subject matter of bioprospecting contracts. To obviate possible repayment risks by tiger reserves, the paper advocates the institution of 'putbonds' as a risk management tool for Project Tiger Reserves in order to hedge themselves against loan defaults arising from possible loss in bioprospecting income. The paper also brings out the mechanics of the issue of tiger bonds in the Indian context. It is argued that a put bond not only hedges default risks but would also aid 'value discovery' and payment for ecosystem services as far as the Project Tiger Reserves of India are concerned.

In the case of India, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, requires firms that employ 50 or more workers to pay compensation to any worker who is to be retrenched. This paper builds a theoretical model to analyze the effects of such anti-retrenchment laws. Our model reveals that an anti-retrenchment law can cause wages and employment to rise or fall, depending on the parametric conditions prevailing in the market. We then use this simple model to isolate conditions under which an anti-retrenchment law raises wages and employment. In a subsequent section we assume that the law specifies exogenously the amount of compensation, s, a firm has to pay each worker who is being dismissed. It is then shown that as s rises, starting from zero, equilibrium wages fall. However beyond a certain point, further rises in s cause wages to rise. In other words, the relation between the exogenously specified cost to the firm of dismissing a worker and the equilibrium wage is V-shaped.","[Basu, Kaushik] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fields, Gary S.] Cornell Univ, Sch Ind & Labor Relat, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Debgupta, Shub] Corp Execut Board, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Basu, K (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kb40@cornell.edu; gsf2@cornell.edu; debguptas@executiveboard.com,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-941-1,STAT SCI INTERDISC R,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,181,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Mathematics,BMY19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273874600009,0

The main objective of the paper is to test the hypothesis whether health consciousness and environmental attitudes influence the consumer's attitude toward organic foods through an individual's healthy lifestyle. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in Taiwan by means of a national self-administered consumer questionnaire survey in this study. A series of regression models are used to detect how the mediating role of the healthy lifestyle construct plays in the relationships between the determinant factors (i.e. health consciousness and environmental attitudes) and the consumer's attitude toward organic foods. Findings - The results are consistent with previous studies, which assert that concern for one's health and for the environment are the two most commonly stated motives for purchasing organic foods, with the former exceeding the latter in importance. In addition, the healthy lifestyle indeed exerts effective mediating effects on the positive relationships between health consciousness and environmental attitudes and the consumer's attitude toward organic foods. Therefore, a healthy lifestyle should be advocated to render the consumer's attitude toward organic foods more positive. Practical implications - Based on the findings, the selection of advertising messages, social interaction and so forth should revolve around the issues of health consciousness, environmental attitudes, and healthy lifestyle in the future. Originality/value - This study is one of the first to examine the mediating effect of a healthy lifestyle that bears on organic foods. The empirical findings from this study are expected to benefit the continued development of the organic. sector in Taiwan's food industry.","Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan",Tatung University,"Chen, MF (通讯作者)，Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan.",mfchen@ttu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council, Republic of China [NSC 95-2416-H-036-001]","National Science Council, Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was partially supported by a grant from the National Science Council, Republic of China (NSC 95-2416-H-036-001).",,42,257,277,8,79,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic advantage negates the norm of equality of opportunity. This inequality in opportunities or unequal chances is further strengthened tinder marital sorting, as assortative marriage matches the affluent with the rich and vice versa. Parental investments in the human capital of children are in part motivated by the prospects of attracting a better partner for their children. Parents care about the earnings capacity or the combined income of the married partners while deciding the marriage of their children. The status of his/her own parents as well as that of the parents of his/her partner influences the economic status of children. This paper explores the intergenerational links in the transmission of economic advantage under such marital sorting. We estimate the intergenerational transmission of education and income between parents and children, and between parents-in-law and daughters-in-law and sons-in-law. The estimated intergenerational transmission is quite substantial and more pronounced in the case of daughters. The elasticity of children's income is strongly positive with respect to ill-laws income. The empirical results for education also reveal strong positive assortative mating pattern.

This contribution turns to virtue ethics in order to reframe the self in more reflexive, relational and environmental terms. We explore the significance of understanding humans' sense of responsibility that is quintessentially relational, and of their capacity and need to relate to nature as well as community and society. We begin by reviewing the main arguments in the thriving debate in ecological economics, around what the characteristics of the human being can contribute to implement an ecologically sustainable development. Our aim is then to draw a link between this debate and that of virtue ethics, that leads to a different understanding of the human being, of what can contribute to individual wellbeing (and a good life): responsibility, we argue, is not only a value but a virtue, that enables individuals to find meaning in acting responsibly towards the environment, emphasising the multiple benefits that arise from framing good lives in active terms.

Recovery - thanks to improved aggregate productivity - was not possible after 1940.

We find that increasing returns to scale are not due to market power but to labor and capital hoarding.","[Inklaar, Robert; de Jong, Herman; Gouma, Reitze] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Inklaar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",r.c.inklaar@rug.nl; h.j.de.jong@rug.nl; f.r.gouma@rug.nl,"Inklaar, Robert/G-8253-2011","Inklaar, Robert/0000-0003-3852-067X; de Jong, Harmen J./0000-0002-5213-4356",,,,,55,11,12,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

Empirical evidence for northwestern Germany,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Innovation diffusion; Solar thermal systems; Consumer motivations; Consumer knowledge,SELF-GENERATED VALIDITY; INTENTIONS; ATTRIBUTES,"In Germany, solar thermal systems (STSy) have only diffused to a minor extent as yet. This paper analyzes which demand side factors are decisive for the further proliferation of this environmentally benign technology. Making use of a consumer survey in northwestern Germany in 2007, we examine the following parameters: positive environmental attitude, knowledge of the applicability of STSy to satisfy consumer needs, and the presence of STSy among peer consumers. Drawing upon theoretical foundations from innovation economics and social psychology, we posit that these variables play a different role at distinct stages of the systems' diffusion process. Among nonowners, concrete plans to purchase such a system within the next two years are distinguished from the general interest to invest in this technology within the next five years. Probit models are estimated to test our hypotheses. Our results do not indicate a strong take-off of product diffusion within the next few years. By generating interest for the product, environmental attitude and knowledge as well as household income are important determinants of prospective adoption on the part of nonowners. However, it is only peer group behavior that appears to function as a trigger for the diffusion of this technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study quantitatively evaluates the water footprint of Beijing in an interregional input-output framework with a focus on blue water resources and uses. The inter-connections of water resources between Beijing and other provinces are analyzed with a sectoral specification. The results show that the total water footprint of Beijing is 4498.4 10(6) m(3)/year, of which 51% is from the external water footprint acquired through virtual water import. Agriculture has the highest water footprint of 1524.5 10(6) m(3)/year with 56% coming from external sources. The main virtual water provider for Beijing is Hebei, another water scarce region, from which Beijing receives virtual water of 373.3 10(6) m(3)/year with 40% from agriculture. The results of this study suggest that the interregional trade coordination, especially for the main sectors with high water use intensity, is important for enhancing the efficiency of regional and national water resource utilization.

It discusses, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the increasing use of green IT and their applications (IT for green). IT and sustainable development have had a concomitant rise and reach. The future world emerging from their respective interpretations enables, in both cases, a shift from today's questionable industrial capitalism towards post-industrial capitalism. This paper addresses the following questions: What is known about green IT and IT for green? Are smart solutions (buildings, energy grids, transport) always beneficial to an ecological economy? And, if so, in what ways? In the first part of this article, we analyse the economic, social and environmental impact of IT and argue for the need for green applications of green IT in order to achieve sustainable outcomes. The second part focuses on the managerial dimension of eco-innovation theory and presents one of the distinctive features of green applications of green IT: the collective organisation of innovation. A typology of eco-innovation aimed at reconciling IT development and green growth is then proposed explicitly addressing four kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social, institutional and organisational innovation.

The democracy-enhancing potential of such mechanisms and rights - which in the national context have proved to be beneficial in strengthening citizens' participation and the acceptance of decisions - can be limited in the global arena, by a number of factors. One of these factors is legal imperialism, understood as the grafting onto the global level rules and institutions that impose the hegemony of western values. In fact, administrative law mechanisms, being a construct of a certain type of western, liberal model of the state (and its capitalist model of development), could be perceived, in developing countries as an instrument to reproduce the dominant position of advanced industrialized countries and their economic actors. The analysis suggests that in order to realize their democracy-enhancing potential, these mechanisms should draw, as far as possible, on cross-cultural principles, and be supported by financial and technical instruments enabling developing countries and marginalized groups to engage in dialog with the most powerful actors.

In this paper we explore differences in cooperation behaviour between communal farmers in Namibia and South Africa, who share the same ethnic origin but have had different historical and ecological constraints. We report on a series of field experiments based on a common-pool resource model. Our experimental design is framed according to the grazing situation in semi-arid rangelands. Dependent on the behaviour in previous rounds, participants are facing different states of resource availability with varying need to cooperate, coordinate and to be patient. While only 4% of the grazing areas in South Africa remain in good quality, Namibians achieve a level of 42%. We analyse the different experimental states and find that Namibians behave in all states more cooperatively. We argue that the large difference between the two regions is due to a combination of different historical developments and ecological preconditions: Namibian resource users have a longer experience in cooperative resource management and intact traditional norms. Moreover, the real-life payoffs to cooperation are higher in Namibia stemming from ecological factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As far as country location is concerned, the results show a moderating effect on the paths of integration and internal stakeholder groups and on the paths of integration with, respectively, efficiency, image, risk (as economic performance variables) as well as emissions and inputs (as environmental performance variables). It also shows a negative moderator effect of age on the relationship between integration and inputs and that profitability has a positive moderator effect on the relationship between the pressure from public actors and integration.

The economics of tiger farming in China,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Endangered species; Extirpation; Wildlife farming; Bioeconomics,IVORY TRADE; IMPACT,"Tigers are a threatened species that might soon disappear in the wild. Not only are tigers threatened by deteriorating and declining habitat, but poachers continue to kill tigers for traditional medicine, decoration pieces and so on. Although international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1987 and domestic trade within China since 1993, tigers continue to be poached and Chinese entrepreneurs have established tiger farms in anticipation of their demise. While China desires to permit sale of tiger products from captive-bred tigers, this is opposed on the grounds that it likely encourages illegal killing. Instead, wildlife conservationists lobby for more spending on anti-poaching and trade-ban enforcement. In this study, a mathematical bioeconomic model is used to investigate the issue. Simulation results indicate that, unless range states are characterized by institutions (rule of law and low corruption) similar to those found in the richest countries, reliance on enforcement alone is insufficient to guarantee survival of wild tigers. Likewise, even though conservation payments could protect wild tigers, the inability to enforce contracts militates against this. Our model indicates that wild tigers can be protected by permitting sale of products from tiger farms, although this likely requires the granting of an exclusive license to sellers. Finally, it is possible to tradeoff enforcement effort and sale of products from captive-bred animals, but such tradeoffs are worsened by deteriorating tiger habitat. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses a contingent valuation method to estimate the public's willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid loss in the number of marine species in the waters around the Azores archipelago. We estimated the marginal value associated with increased levels of species loss (10% and 25%) in five marine taxa (mammals, fish, algae, birds and invertebrates) and all marine species considered as a whole, via a face to face survey of residents and visitors to two Azorean islands. The results suggest small but statistically significant differences in the WTP to prevent losses in the different taxa (mammals = fish> birds = invertebrates = algae). The results also suggest a greater WTP to preserve all marine taxa as a whole, than for a series of individual marine taxa. The valuation of the ecosystem and taxa may be influenced by the maritime culture of the respondents, but despite this, the findings challenge the commonly held premise that charismatic taxa have a disproportionately strong influence on WTP, and they provide important insights into human preferences for biodiversity conservation.

It is shown that the proposal that northern Pennine mines were the principal source of the silver in the late twelfth-century English currency is untenable. Welsh mines supplied limited amounts of silver to local mints around 1200. Devon silver made a significant but not predominant contribution to mint output at times of bullion scarcity in the 1290s and the mid-fifteenth century. Imported silver was usually a greater source of the metal in the English currency than locally mined silver, and gold coins constituted most of England's money supply from the mid-fourteenth century onwards.","Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Allen, M (通讯作者)，Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,81,18,20,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

While there is a well documented growth of initiatives and interest in the establishment of commercial kitchen technologies to develop value-added products in many rural communities, such growth has not been accompanied by research, particularly relating to the producers' perspective on such developments. This study seeks to examine the extent to which small farm operators in one rural Alabama community are interested in becoming involved with value-adding their product line. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 33 small growers from Chilton County, Alabama, participated in this study by completing a questionnaire. Findings The findings demonstrate that much of what respondents grow could be further processed into value-added products. Also, while almost one-fourth of the participants acknowledge the need for a commercial kitchen, the majority are interested in both selling blemished/unmarketable produce for processing and forming a group to work towards adding value to their produce. The findings also point to the fact that the concept of value-adding produce and the implications for the same area are little understood amongst many rural farmers. Research limitations/implications - Both the chosen geographical/physical location of the farms that is, in one single farming community and the low number of participating businesses limit the generalisability of the findings. However, the study's overall findings could be of assistance to future research efforts and, in particular, replication studies in other rural areas. Practical implications - Many farmers could maximise their produce by means of developing value-added products and could potentially increase their revenues in the process. However, other gains may be of equal or more importance. For instance, extending an area of their business and fully utilising their produce's intrinsic rewards, learning experiences and increased motivation could have important implications for many rural communities and farming industries. Originality/value - This study seeks to fill the existing gap of knowledge with regard to small farmers' perceptions on maximisation of their produce, an area closely related to value-added product development. To date, research on the farm operator perspective with regard to these dimensions continues to be limited.","[Alonso, Abel D.] Edith Cowan Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia; [O'Neill, Martin A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Hotel & Restaurant Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Edith Cowan University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,52,6,10,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Long lasting noise effect has detrimental effects on humans and can be described as having toxic consequences, such as disturbed constitutional effects and annoyance. These questions are of common interest in agglomerations which are located near highways in suburbs, where the traffic flow is intensive. Constantly intensifying transport flows in highways radiates noise which is believed will increase by 2 ... 3 dB until the year 2015. This clearly shows that the area polluted by noise is going to increase under the dependence 10.lg R, which indicates that it will approximately double. One of the technical solutions for the reduction of noise is the installation of lightweight acoustic barriers between the noise source (highway) and the area which is being protected. Together with the attenuation effect, acoustic barriers or earth berms significantly distorts the amplitude frequency characteristic of noise which leads to the changes of acoustical comfort. The aim of this work was to investigate the acoustic climate in the barrier shelterbelt. Acoustical climate was assessed using the data which was adopted by measuring sound pressure levels in the various distances perpendicularly and longitudinally the acoustic barrier. Several metrics, such as speech interference level (SIL), quality assessment index (QAI) and psychoacoustic sharpness were used as indicators of acoustic comfort. It was found that acoustic climate in the shadow zone of lightweight barrier was poor according to above mentioned measures. It was concluded, that psychoacoustic measure of sharpness is a better indicate of acoustical climate in near distances while QAI - further from barrier.","[Butkus, Ricardas; Merkevicius, Stanislovas; Nadzeikiene, Jurate; Vasiliauskas, Gediminas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Occupat Safety & Engn Management, Fac Agr Engn, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,ricardas.butkus@asu.lt; sauga@asu.lt; jurate.nadzeikiene@asu.lt; gvasiliauskas@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,314,318,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000050,0

Design/methodology/approach - The sample is drawn from the qualified appellation of origin (DOCa) Rioja wine market. A binomial logit was used as the primary technique for investigation of the hypothesis for the final sample size of 68 observations (34 oral contracts and 34 written contracts). Findings - The evidence presented in this paper points to the fact that asset specificity, the most important characteristic in transaction cost economics, will not be a strong predictor of the level of contract formalisation for transactions that enjoy a high level of trust. Research limitations/implications - This study has important limitations that imply caution in generalising the findings. First, the agrarian legal framework is likely to alter the effectiveness of formal contracts as governance devices. Another limitation of this analysis is that it is not a dynamic analysis and, hence, it does not consider the possibility of trust emerging over time. Practical implications - It is suggested that the possession of trust between contractual parties allows them to reduce transaction costs without resorting to a high level of contractual formalisation. Originality/value - This paper is useful for practitioners and academics in the field of contractual choice. The research provides some initial insight into the moderating influence of trust on the relationship between asset specificity and level of contractual incompleteness in the viticulture sector.","[Fernandez-Olmos, Marta] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Business & Econ, Zaragoza, Spain; [Fernandez-Olmos, Marta] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ & Business, Res Grp, CREVALOR,Res Grp Excellence Govt, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Fernández-Olmos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Business & Econ, Zaragoza, Spain.",maferna@unizar.es,,"Fernandez Olmos, Marta/0000-0002-5623-2391",,,,,53,14,15,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The UCD Food and Health Survey is a monthly online survey, which began in November 2008. In March 2009, participants were asked a series of questions pertaining to nutrition and health claims and 665 completed questionnaires were included for analysis. Participants' level of nutrition knowledge was measured using a combined and modified version of Parmenter and Wardle's General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (1999) and that of Hawkes and Nowak (1998). Perceived credibility was gauged using a semantic differential scale and the questionnaire was designed to also assess participants' purchasing behaviour of functional foods. Findings - Females scored significantly higher than males for nutrition knowledge (p = 0.004) but there was no significant difference in nutrition knowledge between age groups. Reduces feelings of hunger was deemed the most credible claim. With the exception of This yogurt drink will strengthen your bones and teeth, there was no difference in credibility between high and low nutrition knowledge groups. Health claims were more credible to participants when found on yogurt and breakfast cereal when compared with pasta and chocolate. Products claiming to reduce cholesterol were purchased more in the previous month than any of the other products and the same product was purchased statistically more often by those participants in the older age group. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study was that the panel were younger and more formally educated than the general public. They were also more likely to be female. The gender bias may be because the survey was food and health-based and therefore may not have appealed to men as a more generally themed survey might have done. The results of this study should be considered therefore with this limitation in mind. Practical implications - People do not consider products with health claims to be a uniform category of foodstuffs and participants' level of nutrition knowledge does not have a significant impact on their behaviour towards products carrying health claims. Originality/value - Knowledge of nutrition does not impact on people's reactions to products with health claims and different foods demonstrate different levels of credibility as carriers for health claims.","[Lalor, Fiona; Wall, Patrick G.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Publ Hlth & Populat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Kennedy, Jean] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Lalor, F (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Publ Hlth & Populat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland.",fiona.lalor@ucd.ie,"Lalor, Fiona/AAM-7128-2021","Kennedy, Jean/0000-0002-0121-5260",,,,,42,12,12,0,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It allows the hope that Polish rural areas could be an important element demonstrating the European development paths. It is expected that Membership of Poland in the Union structures as well as processes of globalization are not only the passive background for Polish agriculture but they also determine the conditions of necessary changes allowing improvement of its competitiveness.

Data on stitches per minute, an objectively quantifiable measure of innovation, confirm these findings.","[Lampe, Ryan] Depaul Univ, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Moser, Petra] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Moser, Petra] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",DePaul University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lampe, R (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Dept Econ, 1 E Jackson Blvd,Suite 6200, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",rlampe@depaul.edu; pmoser@stanford.edu,,,,,,,63,48,60,2,40,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,,,J ECON HIST,J.

Therefore, a comparison of the equity in health care utilization for those health systems with different financing arrangements has important policy implications for health care policymakers. The concentration index (CI) and the horizontal inequity index (HI) are commonly used to measure inequality and inequity in health care utilization. In this paper, we propose simple methods to decompose the difference between two CIs and two HIs into two factors: one factor reflects the difference between the means, and the other factor reflects the difference between the distributions. The proposed decomposition method might be useful since the means are likely to be caused by factors that do not constitute unfair inequalities (inequities). We also present two empirical applications of the decomposition methods for the purpose of illustration.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhong, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 S Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",haizhong@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,42,10,10,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The approach is applied to the study of land use strategies on commercial ranches in Namibia. First, we compare two models differing in their structure: the first one is an inter-temporal optimization model (forward-looking with perfect foresight) while the second is recursive and it explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the decision making process. Second, we point out the structural advantage of the recursive optimization model in its ability to simulate how decision makers' perceptions on the occurrence of stochastic events alter land use strategies and their economic and ecological outcomes. Both models make use of a State-and-Transition conceptual framework to depict the bio-economic feedback. We found that the incorporation of rainfall uncertainty in decision making is crucial when modeling land use strategies in highly variable ecological-economic systems such as ranches in arid rain-fed areas. Where knowledge of rainfall distribution is inaccurate (due to lack of experience or climate change) both, farmers and rangelands, would be better off by precautiously expecting low rainfalls. Finally, our results show that minimizing herd size adjustment costs would support the establishment of sustainable land use strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Even though there are many startups, it is not very common to reach the point of the initial public offering (IPO) and the post-IPO performance of the firms is mostly declining. Since it is rather difficult to apply conventional performance measures to very young firms, IPO has been used as a tool for performance evaluation. This study adopts the IPO as an early-stage measure for the performance of high technology startups. It is important to find out whether an earlier IPO of firms leads to a better performance and capability of firms. We investigate the relationship between the time to IPO of firms and their post-IPO performance for 3 years after their IPO by adopting samples of 79 information technology hardware firms founded after 1996 and listed between 2000 and 2004 in the KOSDAQ. Four determinant factors, including entrepreneurs' experience, venture capital investment, startups' technology sourcing, and technology portfolios which determine the firm's time lag to getting to the IPO, are identified. The findings contain several results. First, the patent has positive effects on the firms' performance after an IPO and on the firms' growth before the IPO. Second, a faster technology acquisition via technology alliance has a positive influence on the firms' IPO regardless of internal technologies. Third, concentrating on core technology, instead of diversifying can mature the startup firms faster. These indicate that a startup's efficient initial strategy is critical for its performance and it enhances the credit and confidence of the market.","[Heshmati, Almas] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Kim, Yunhee] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Korea University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Heshmati, A (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, East Bldg,Room 217, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",heshmati@korea.ac.kr,,,,,,,50,9,12,1,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Yet techniques have long been known for incorporating both these rates in a shadow price of investment funds. Assumptions about the proportion of investment revenues saved and reinvested are crucial in determining whether a low discount rate favours or discriminates against long-term environmental values. Even a moderate saving rate may make the shadow price of funds indefinitely large. The conceptually correct discount rate then becomes the growth rate of investment funds, and the relative value of environmental effects becomes zero. Stochastic variation in rate of return makes this result more likely. Such an outcome may be avoided by setting reinvestment to zero, or assuming convergence of rates of return and discount, but no firm justification exists for these stratagems. However, various reasonable assumptions about environmental costs - especially, that they embody an investment element, or require adequate compensation to be paid - may make such costs indefinite also, and therefore capable of standing against indefinite values of investible funds.

This paper constructs Tornqvist-Thiel indices of agricultural outputs, inputs and total factor productivity (TFP) to examine the sources of growth in Indonesian agriculture over this period. The paper extends previous work on measuring productivity change in Indonesian agriculture by assembling more complete data on cropland and expanding the commodity coverage to include cultured fisheries in addition to crops and livestock. It also accounts for the contribution of the spread of rural education and literacy to agricultural growth. Results show that Indonesia pursued both agricultural intensification to raise yield, especially for food crops, and extensification to expand crop area and absorb more labor. Productivity growth accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s but stagnated in the 1990s once Green Revolution food crop varieties had become widely adopted. TFP growth resumed in the early 2000s led by diversification into non-staple commodities such as tropical perennials, horticulture, livestock and aquaculture. Agricultural extensification continued to be an important source of growth in many of parts of the archipelago where previously forested areas were converted to cropland. Human capital deepening, in the form of the spread of literacy and education in the farm labor force, made a modest but sustained contribution to agricultural productivity growth.","Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20036 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Fuglie, KO (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 1800 M St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kfuglie@ers.usda.gov,,"Fuglie, Keith/0000-0002-7601-0542",,,,,40,23,27,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Then, we use original data on educational attainment in the nineteenth century presented in Morrisson and Murtin (J Human Cap, in press) in order to estimate the educational level of US immigrants by age and by country. As a result, our series are consistent with the first national estimates of average schooling in 1940.

Until now, only a static approach for analyzing the MPI was available in the literature. However, this hides a potentially valuable information given by the evolution of productivity over time. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic procedure for forecasting the MPI. We compare several approaches and give credit to a method based on the assumption of circularity. Because the MPI is not circular, we present a new decomposition of the MPI, in which the time-varying indices are circular. Based on that decomposition, a new working dynamic forecasting procedure is proposed and illustrated. To construct prediction intervals of the MPI, we extend the bootstrap method in order to take into account potential serial correlation in the data. We illustrate all the new techniques described above by forecasting the productivity index of 17 OECD countries, constructed from their GDP, labor and capital stock.","[Van Bellegem, Sebastien] Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Daskovska, Alexandra; Simar, Leopold] Univ Catholique Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Van Bellegem, S (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France.",svb@tse-fr.eu,,"Van Bellegem, Sebastien/0000-0002-5648-5460",,,,,15,10,10,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Drawing from a large sample of residences in Auburn. Alabama, we develop a statistical model that produces specific estimates of the electricity savings generated by shade-producing trees in a suburban environment. This empirical model links residential energy consumption during peak summer (winter) months to average energy consumption during non-summer/non-winter months, behaviors of the occupants, and the extent, density, and timing of shade cast on the structures. Our estimates reveal that tree shade generally is associated with reduced (increased) electricity consumption in the summertime (wintertime). In summertime, energy savings are maximized by having dense shade. In wintertime, energy consumption increases as shade percentage in the morning, when outdoor temperatures are at their lowest, increases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Emphasis is placed on the role of the institutional setting, social perceptions about economic fairness (or distributive justice of the payments), uncertainty and interactions between agents, including power relations. We introduce the heuristic concept of the 'efficiency-equity interdependency curve' to illustrate potential combinations between equity and efficiency that may be theoretically possible. The paper argues that different types of institutional factors determine which equity-efficiency combinations may be potentially feasible, influence the actual combination that will be achieved on the ground, and condition possible changes in that combination due to exogenous factors. By stressing the role of institutional aspects in shaping the equity-efficiency relationship, the paper attempts to go beyond the dominant Coasean vision of PES. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Many investments are centred on the modernisation of inefficient irrigation delivery systems and the purchase of consumptive water for environmental flows In this study, we applied spatial targeting within a cost-benefit framework to reconfigure agricultural land use in an irrigation district to achieve a 20% reduction in agricultural water use to increase environmental flows, and improve the provision of other ecosystem services. We demonstrate a targeted land use reconfiguration policy approach using spatial planning and optimisation models Our model estimates a potential increase in the net present value of ecosystem services of up to SA 347 million. The increase in ecosystem services include recovering 62 GL of water for environmental flows, the sequestration of 10.6 million tonnes of CO2e/year, a 12 EC (mu S/cm) reduction in river salinity, and an overall 9% increase in the value of agriculture. Without a spatially targeted approach to planning, a 20% reduction in water for irrigation could result in the loss of SA 68 7 million in economic returns to agriculture which may be only marginally offset by the increased value of ecosystem services resulting from the return of 62 GL of water to the environment.

The average TEs for Argentina and Uruguay are not significantly different from each other but are significantly higher than the value for Chile. The production frontiers for Argentina and Uruguay are relatively close to the MF, which suggests that these two countries might need to increase investments to promote local research to generate new technologies and/or search for technologies to adapt from more distant areas.

Potential CO2-e above base line sequestration was determined for two forest sites on commercial eucalyptus plantations in northern Brazil (Bahia). Compensation values for silvicultural regimes involving rotation lengths greater than economically optimal were computed using the Faustmann formula. Mean values obtained were US$8.16 (MgCO2-e)(-1) and US $7.19 (MgCO2-e)(-1) for average and high site indexes, respectively. Results show that carbon supply is more cost-efficient in highly productive sites. Annuities of US$18.8 Mg C-1 and US$35.1 Mg C-1 and yearly payments of US$4.4 m(-3) and US$8.2 m(-3) due for each marginal cubic meter produced were computed for high and average sites, respectively. The estimated value of the tonne of carbon defines minimum values to be paid to forest owners, in order to induce a change in silvicultural management regimes. A reduction of carbon supply could be expected as a result of an increase in wood prices, although it would not respond in a regular manner. For both sites, price elasticity of supply was found to be inelastic and increased as rotation length moved further away from economically optimal: 0.24 and 0.27 for age 11 years in average- and high-productivity sites, respectively. This would be due to biomass production potential as a limiting factor; beyond a certain threshold value. an increase in price does not sustain a proportional change in carbon storage supply. The environmental service valuation model proposed might be adequate for assessing potential supply in plantation forestry, from a private landowner perspective, with an economic opportunity cost. The model is not applicable to low commercial value forest plantations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Applications of several unit-root tests as well as a stationarity test uniformly reject the global convergence hypothesis.

The aim of this paper is to identify a food safety culture that can be used in addition to more traditional risk factors. Design/methodology/approach - A parallel is drawn between the use of the term emerging pathogen and the emergence of food safety culture as a risk factor in food poisoning outbreaks. The evolution of the term starting with organizational culture is developed via the literature on health and safety culture. The concept of food safety culture and reservations over the use of the term are examined along with possible distinctions between food safety culture and climate. Findings - The concept of food safety culture has direct parallels with safety culture and in the prevention of healthcare associated infections. The use of food safety culture is useful as part of outbreak investigation. It is likely that more than one food safety culture exists within large organizations or those with multiple sub units. A definition of food safety culture is proposed. Originality/value - Increasing interest is being shown in the use of food safety culture to understand and, in turn prevent, food poisoning outbreaks and this is the first time a definition has been proposed. This paper will be of great interest to industry, academics and public health officials and can be used to answer questions on the topic, which are increasingly being asked by hygiene examining bodies.","[Griffith, C.

Therefore, adequate decision support tools are needed. The present study is embedded in a project that has the objective to develop an operational simulation tool particularly adapted to manage a crisis situation provoked by accidental marine pollution on the French Mediterranean coast. So as to deal with such a risk, our study is intended to contribute to the analysis of the coastal vulnerability. The vulnerability depends on the exposure to risk factors often linked to human activities, as well as on the environmental and socio-economic characteristics. It is intended to determine these characteristics, to estimate their values and to assess the sensitivity of the coastal environment, while the overall aim is to anticipate possible impacts. As demonstrated in various past cases, e.g. an accidental hydrocarbon release impacts different ecosystem types and the environmental services they deliver and that sustain considerable socio-economic activities, such as fishery and tourism. The sensitivity to such impacts has been evaluated for the French Mediterranean coastal environment and sensitivity indices have been attributed to defined coastal zones. Taking seasonal variations into account, here we present sensitivity maps of two emblematic coastal activities that are directly or indirectly linked to seawater quality, fishery and lodging.","[Scheurle, C.; Thebault, H.; Duffa, C.] IRSN, LERCM, La Seyne Sur Mer, France",,,,"surname, name s/A-2183-2010",,,,,,10,1,1,0,13,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-436-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,,,2010,131.0,,,,,,135,145,,10.2495/EEIA100121,0.0,,,11,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,BQH16,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280992200012,0

This is with a view to harnessing the quality attributes of the different cultivars of cashew. Parameters investigated include pH, refractive index, specific gravity,. vitamin C content, juice astringency, chlorophyll and juice yield. Design/methodology/approach - The methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) are employed in assaying the physicochemical properties, while the astringency is determined spectrophotometrically according to standard methods. Findings - Results showed that percentage juice yield increases linearly with maturity for both cultivars. A maximum of 79.5 per cent is obtained for the yellow apple cultivars, while 74.1 per cent juice yield is obtained in the red apple cultivar. The pH ranged from 3.73-4.5 and 3.64-4.55 for red and yellow apple cultivars, respectively, with a marked fall between seven and eight weeks after pollination (WAPo). Specific gravity and refractive index are of the order 0.999-1.007 and 1.34-1.89 for both selected samples. Highest refractive index is obtained in red and yellow cultivars at seven and eight WAPo. The changes in ascorbic acid followed a linear pattern and the maximum values of 249.5 mg/100 ml and 185.5 mg/100 ml are obtained for yellow and red apple cultivars, respectively. Meanwhile, the juice astringency level decreased steadily with maturity and at the ninth WAPo, values obtained are 0.47 and 0.86 mg/100 ml tannin for yellow and red apple cultivars, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach - Orange juice was enriched with Pinus brutia, Pinus pinea bark extracts, Pycnogenol (R). In vitro release kinetics was determined in pH 1.2 and pH 7.4. Ascorbic acid content, pH, titratable acidity, and colorimetric analyses were analyzed monthly for eight months to determine shelf life. Additionally, total phenol contents and radical scavenging activities were analyzed. Subsequently a consumer acceptance test was conducted among 200 participants. Findings - The release of all extracts in orange juices in pH 1.2 were slower than pH 7.4. The release results were fitted to Higuchi square root of time kinetic model with high determination coefficients. Although total titratable acidity values were in agreement with the trend of minor pH changes, prominent losses in antioxidant capacities, ascorbic acid contents and color were observed for the last two months suggesting a shelf life of six months. Female participants and young people had a greater tendency to consume such a beverage. Health concerns and flavor were the primary factors affecting their purchasing decisions. Research limitations/implications - Findings of the study demonstrated the effects of fortification with a plant-based extract as a substitute to the present practice of fortifying beverages with vitamins and minerals for a potential future market. Originality/value - The paper shows that juices fortified with pine bark extracts show higher antioxidant capacities and ascorbic acid contents compared to the control, thereby providing improved functionality.","[Yesil-Celiktas, Ozlem; Isleten, Muge; Vardar-Sukan, Fazilet] Ege Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Bioengn, Izmir, Turkey; [Cetin, E.

It accounts for (a) human-induced changes in biological productivity and (b) biomass harvest. This study presents an analysis of aboveground HANPP in the Philippines between 1910 and 2003, a period characterized by massive deforestation and increases in land use intensity and biomass extraction. Results show a steep increase of aboveground HANPP from just below 35% of potential productivity in 1910 to slightly above 60% in 1970 and constant values since then. Large-scale changes in land cover and agricultural practices were the main direct determinants of this trajectory in HANPP. Remarkably, HANPP grew at much slower pace than population did: While the amount of NPP appropriated by humans doubled throughout the period, population increased by a factor ten. Increasing efficiency in terms of biomass extraction per unit of area, relying on ever-increasing inputs, and changes in the nation's physical biomass trade balance were of major importance for this difference in growth rates. In the coming decades, the Philippines will have to face the challenge to meet increases in biomass demand without putting even higher strains on the ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses the MAT model (where I=Impact representing CO2 emissions, P=Population, A=Affluence, and T=emission intensity) to analyze how these main drivers contributed to the growth of CO2 emissions over this time period. Affluence or lifestyle change has been variously recognized as one of the key factors contributing to CO2 emissions. Through comparative analysis of the development of five regions in China, we trace lifestyle changes since the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 until 2002. We find that household consumption across the five regions follows similar trajectories, driven by changes in income and the increasing availability of goods and services. although significant differences still exist between and within regions due to differential policies in China and different possibilities for social mobility. There are considerable differences between the southeast and northwest and between urban and rural areas. We also found that technological improvements have not been able to fully compensate for the increase of emissions due to population growth and increasing wealth, which is also in line with results from other studies. Finally, this paper emphasizes that developing countries such as China, which is home to 22% of the world population and a growing middle class. and which is on a fast track to modernization, need to ensure that people's lifestyles are changing towards more sustainable ways of living. China has been investing heavily in infrastructure and thus creating the emissions of tomorrow. Thus investing, for example, in public transport and low energy building today will help reduce emissions in the future and will support more sustainable lifestyles. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We study the factors that explain whether or not people have installed residential solar energy equipment or have subscribed to green-electricity programs, and the factors that influence the intensity of buying organic food. In addition to demographic characteristics and environmental attitudes, we consider the following categories of determinants: economic and cognitive factors (income, estimated price premium, level of information on environmentally-friendly goods); consumption pattems of reference persons; own consumption patterns in the past. Using a unique data set from a survey conducted in the region of Hanover, Germany, we find the following: (1) Economic and cognitive factors are significant covariates of all three kinds of pro-environmental consumption. Their influence is greatest in the case of green electricity. (2) Consumption patterns of reference persons are significant covariates of all three kinds of pro-environmental consumption. Their influence is greatest in the case of organic food. (3) The intensity of buying organic food is greater the longer people have been consumers of these goods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, such interaction dilutes cultural identities and reduces the consumption of culture-specific goods and services. We show that the two groups segregate in different cities when diaspora members find it hard to communicate at distance whereas they integrate in multicultural cities when communication is easy.

This paper focuses on this little addressed question. Based on the author's primary data on communities managing their local forests in parts of India and Nepal, it statistically assesses whether the gender composition of a local forest management group affects forest conservation outcomes, after controlling for other characteristics of the management group, aspects of institutional functioning, forest and population characteristics. and related factors. It is found that groups with a high proportion of women in their executive committee (EC)-the principal decision-making body-show significantly greater improvements in forest condition in both regions. Moreover, groups with all-women ECs in the Nepal sample have better forest regeneration and canopy growth than other groups, despite receiving much smaller and more degraded forests. Older EC members, especially older women, also make a particular difference, as does employing a guard. The beneficial impact of women's presence on conservation outcomes is attributable especially to women's contributions to improved forest protection and rule compliance. More opportunity for women to use their knowledge of plant species and methods of product extraction. as well as greater cooperation among women, are also likely contributory factors.

Since old people display different consumption patterns than young people. an increase in the proportion of old people affects overall consumption patterns. Micro data from a household survey are used to identify age-specific consumption patterns and to project the impact of demographic change on the structure of total consumption expenditure up to the year 2030. The resulting final demand vectors are entered into an environmental input-output model, which allows the calculation of sectoral production, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The model results suggest that until 2030, demographic change raises the share of methane in total greenhouse gas emissions and does not contribute to reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. The model is also used to explore the effects of redistributing income between age groups and a policy-induced switch from motor vehicle use to public transport. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Irigoin, MA",,,,"Irigoin, Maria Alejandra",,,Gresham on horseback: the monetary roots of Spanish American political fragmentation in the nineteenth century1,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EMPIRE,"This article deals with the political economic consequences of the disappearance of the Spanish silver peso standard in Spanish America, the longest monetary union that ever existed. With the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, the fiscal and political structure of the empire imploded and most colonies became independent. Regional competition for revenues exacerbated budget shortfalls driven by military expenditure. Local elites established in former colonial Treasury districts started highly diverse monetary experiments to procure funds. Those in control of mint houses started minting their own coins or debased existing silver currency. Elsewhere, inconvertible paper currency was also created to meet budget deficits. As a result, the most valuable feature of the Spanish American silver peso, its quality standard, was broken and the standard that had organized the early modern international economy for more than 300 years ceased to exist altogether. In Spanish America, as diverse monies co-existed within a formerly highly integrated economic space, a widespread Gresham's law effect exacerbated the conflict among local and regional elites. This fostered the political fragmentation of colonial Spanish America into an increasing number of political and monetary sovereign entities during the nineteenth century.","Coll New Jersey, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA",College of New Jersey,"Irigoin, MA (通讯作者)，Coll New Jersey, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA.",,,,,,,,48,12,14,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Deforestation is considered as a risk management strategy: property rights insecurity reduces the present value of forests and fosters forest conversion into agricultural and pasture lands. Moreover, deforestation is the consequence of strategic interactions between landowners and squatters. Landowners clear the forest preventively in order to assert the productive use of land and to reduce the expropriation risk. Squatters invade land plots. clear the forest and may afterwards gain official recognition with formal property titles. A particular attention is paid to the measure of land property rights insecurity in the Brazilian context. It is assumed that property rights insecurity has a multidimensional character taken into account by the number of homicides related to land conflicts and expropriation procedures. Principal component analysis allows synthesising such information. An econometric model of deforestation is estimated on a panel dataset on the 1988-2000 period and the nine states of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The hypothesis that insecure land property rights contribute to higher rates of deforestation is not rejected when the simultaneity bias between insecure property rights and deforestation is addressed. This result questions the modality of the Brazilian land reform that considers forested areas as unproductive and thus open for expropriation procedures. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

According to the EKC, empirical evidence would support the hypothesis that economic growth, through a deterministic sequence of phases, would produce cross-country convergence in per capita output and, as a by-product, convergence in (the demand for) environmental quality. However, factual analysis seems to reject the general hypothesis of convergence in per capita output, limiting the validity of such an assessment to the case of homogeneous groups of countries. This is why, to test the DCH, the paper focuses on the original group of OECD countries for which the economic convergence turned out to be true. This allows us to verify whether green beta and sigma convergence follows as a consequence of economic convergence. The paper also tests for a more equitable distribution of protection policies among countries. Unlike other studies, which do not make the DCH explicit and have focused on pollutant emissions, this research explicitly tests for the double convergence using, as a proxy for the demand for environmental quality, the territory set aside for protected areas. The results confirm that, for the selected homogenous group of countries, growth has accompanied the demand for environmental quality. This happens both in terms of conditional and stochastic convergence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a translog production frontier framework the technical and scale efficiency at farm level is analysed by following a time trends as well as a general index model specification. Further this study tries to analyse the significance of subsidies for promoting long term growth in organic production by estimating a bootstrapped bivariate probit model with respect to factors influencing the probability of organic market exit. The results revealed significant differences in the organic farms' technical efficiencies, no significant total factor productivity growth and even a slightly negative rate of technical change in the period investigated. Evidence has been found for a positive relationship between subsidy payments and an increase in farm efficiency, technology improvements and a decreasing probability of organic market exit which was also confirmed for off farm income.

Recently, economists have started to look at the optimal size of countries and forces influencing the creation of local political jurisdictions like school districts. This paper provides the first analysis of the missing middle level of political jurisdictions common to all countries. We empirically examine how country size, natural transportation infrastructure, location, population fractionalization, and level of development affect the number of first-order subdivisions. The number of first-order subdivisions is shown to be associated in a nonlinear way with measures of fractionalization-exhibiting a U-shaped Kuznets curve for ethnic heterogeneity and an inverted Kuznets curve for lingual and religious heterogeneity. This is a different and more complex relationship than that found for local political jurisdictions where greater heterogeneity is associated with more districts suggesting that first-order political subdivisions may serve a different role.","[Auffhammer, Maximilian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Carson, Richard T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Auffhammer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",auffhammer@berkeley.edu; rcarson@weber.ucsd.edu,,"Carson, Richard/0000-0002-3273-8224",,,,,17,5,7,0,3,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4146,,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Shocks are classified into generic types that affect the natural interest rates. Since parameters depend on features of the labour market and on consumption inequality, the natural rates and the impact of shocks differ from those in a mature small open economy. Subsistence consumption is found to have the largest effect oil the natural rates. It reduces the interest rate, raises natural output and the terms of trade. Technology and infrastructure backwardness reduce natural output. The implications for monetary policy are derived. The effect of managed exchange rates combined with different types of inflation targeting is examined through Simulations. Endogenous terms of trade make the supply curve steeper in a SOEME, so partial stickiness of the real exchange rate can be beneficial. In general, domestic inflation targeting, with some weight on the output gap, delivers lower volatility. Output response is higher and volatility lower with fixed terms of trade, demonstrating the flatter supply curve. CPI inflation targeting also does well when terms of trade are credibly fixed.","[Goyal, Ashima] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,,ashima@igidr.ac.in,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-941-1,STAT SCI INTERDISC R,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,333,368,,,,,,36,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Mathematics,BMY19,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273874600015,0

Design/methodology/approach - Proximate, minerals, amino acids and anti nutritional factors of each of the processed food samples were investigated using AOAC methods. The results of the study were as follows: For the proximate analysis, moisture content ranged between: 1.50-2.16 g/100 g; fat 6.02-6.57 g/100 g; protein 20.00-20.49 g/100 g; ash 1.17-3.46 g/100 g; carbohydrate 65.82-68.74 g/100 g and energy 400.2-412.18kcal. For the minerals composition, calcium ranged between 14.12 +/- 0.01-18.26 +/- 0.01 mg/100 g, potassium 57.61 +/- 0.01-80.62 +/- 0.02 mg/100 g, magnesium 50.47 +/- 0.01-69.34 +/- 0.02 mg/100 g, sodium 19.05 +/- 0.01-25.97 +/- 0.01 mg/100 g, iron 0.15 +/- 0.01-0.48 +/- 40.01 mg/100 g, selenium 0.00 +/- 0.00-0.21 +/- 0.01. mg/100 g and phosphorus 164.73 +/- 0.01-187.13 +/- 0.01 mg/100 g, while the Ca/P and Na/K ratios of the food samples range between 0.10 +/- 0.01-0.19 +/- 0.01 and 0.30 +/- 0.01-0.35 +/- 0.01 respectively. The total amino acid and percentage of total essential amino acid for children and adults were higher in germinated BG seed flour than fermented and roasted BG flour respectively. Findings - The findings were that the antinutritional content of fermented bambara groundnut seed flour was low compared with germinated and roasted bambara groundnut seed flour. Research limitations/implications - The protein content of fermented bambara groundnut flour was higher and also had a low level of antinutritional factors compared with other processed bambara groundnut flour. In View of these, further study may be conducted to establish the suitability of incorporating the fermented bambara groundnut flour into weaning food. Originality/value - The study showed that these traditional processing methods, that is, fermentation, germination and roasting, influenced the nutritional composition of bambara groundnut seeds.","[Ijarotimi, Oluwole Steve; Esho, Taiwo Ruth] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Akure, Nigeria",,"Ijarotimi, OS (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Technol Akure, Akure, Nigeria.",soijarotimi2000@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,45,42,46,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although vaccination was crucial to the decline of smallpox, especially in urban areas, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, it remains disputed the extent to which smallpox mortality declined before vaccination. Analysis of age-specific changes in smallpox burials within the large west London parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields revealed a precipitous reduction in adult smallpox risk from the 1770s, and this pattern was duplicated in the east London parish of St Dunstan's. Most adult smallpox victims were rural migrants, and such a drop in their susceptibility is consistent with a sudden increase in exposure to smallpox in rural areas. We investigated whether this was due to the spread of inoculation, or an increase in smallpox transmission, using changes in the age patterns of child smallpox burials. Smallpox mortality rose among infants, and smallpox burials became concentrated at the youngest ages, suggesting a sudden increase in infectiousness of the smallpox virus. Such a change intensified the process of smallpox endemicization in the English population, but also made cities substantially safer for young adult migrants.","[Davenport, Romola] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Schwarz, Leonard] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Boulton, Jeremy] Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of Birmingham; University of Newcastle,"Davenport, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,53,34,37,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In contrast to previous studies, this paper examines effects on plants in all manufacturing industries, not just those in dirty industries. Further, this paper employs spatial-temporal variation in environmental compliance costs to identify effects, using a time-varying county-level index that is based on multiple years of establishment-level data from the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures survey and the Annual Survey of Manufactures. Results suggest that, for the average manufacturing plant, there is no statistically significant effect on productivity of being in a county with higher environmental compliance costs.

In this paper an analytical model of coexistence is developed that allows for endogenous derivation of efficient widths and allocation of pollen barriers to limit contamination of non-GM crops. To reflect the uncertainty that surrounds pollen dispersal mechanisms the model contains a stochastic contamination function and safety rule decision mechanism, constraining the level of contamination to remain below a tolerated adventitious presence with a given probability. Two policies are considered and their performance is tested: the tolerance level of adventitious presence, and the allocation of responsibility for implementing coexistence measures to either GM or non-GM farmers. The relative size of GM rents (the value of productivity gains and the non-pecuniary benefits from GM crops), rents for identity preserved non-GM crops (price premiums realised over the GM crop price), characteristics of farms, and possible variation in agricultural landscapes are also taken into account. The findings indicate that conventional adventitious presence tolerances can be met without ex ante mandating large widths of pollen barriers. At the policy level, the findings of this paper are relevant for setting region-specific pollen barriers widths, and/or for establishing institutions that facilitate cooperative coexistence.

Some EU member states such as Denmark are operationalising these two key stages using cost effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis. However, implementation guidelines encourage the active involvement of all interested parties in the implementation of the Directive. We discuss the potential benefits of actively involving non-state actors, which can be summarised as increasing the effectiveness of policy and improving its implementation. Criticising the emerging economic decision-making approach, we argue that economic analyses could result in a missed opportunity to capitalise on the potential benefits of involvement. The article discusses the appropriateness of actively involving the public during the two aforementioned decision-making stages and suggests concrete ways in which active involvement may be operationalised.

First, we describe the first best investment contract, we study the second best investment contract in the presence of private information, and then we examine the impact of an exogenous second-period income endowment (collateralizable income) on investment by entrepreneurs. Next, we analyze the interaction between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists when the regional government (RG) must pay off a per capita debt (debt overhang) which it finances by taxing successful second-period entrepreneurs. We show that a rise in the per capita debt has an effect on investment that is analogous to a fall in the second-period income endowment. In addition, the overhang of the RG's debt discourages entrepreneurial investment.","[Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Batabyal, AA (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",aabgsh@rit.edu; Hamid.Beladi@utsa.edu,,"Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519",,,,,32,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

However, their potential to contribute substantially to these aims has also been questioned. For partnerships working in the water sector, the implications of private sector participation for legitimate water governance have been disputed, for example regarding whether public-private partnerships can provide water that is affordable and accessible to all, and whether they provide opportunities for local stakeholder participation. In this article, these discussions are examined with respect to several examples of public-private partnerships registered with the UN Commission on Sustainable Development. The analysis indicates that these partnerships partially address these criticisms, but also have their own shortcomings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The current economic revival offers new opportunities and presents new challenges for the sustainable development of Russia. The paper employs the UN Sustainable Development framework of indicators and assesses sustainability of Russia using multi-criteria evaluation methods, namely the uncertainty randomization multi-criteria evaluation method Analysis and Synthesis of Parameters under Information Deficiency (ASPID). The analysis covers economic, environmental and social trends in Russia's development in 1985-2008 and assesses sustainability of this development from the point of view of multiple criteria. The results show the potential of employment of multi-criteria methods for the sustainability assessment at the macro level and offer useful insights into multidimensional nature of sustainability and the role of priority setting in the evaluation process. Such an analysis reveals the degree of harmoniousness of sustainable development policy. It shows how different sets of priorities determine the outcome of multidimensional analysis of sustainability and could potentially help in assessing progress and designing new policy instruments. This paper is one of the first to apply multi-criteria methods to the macro sustainability analysis in the dynamic setting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores the industrial effects of the species in Portugal, the gateway by which the bivalve entered Europe around 30 years ago. National waterworks, major power stations, cement plants, pulp and paper mills and irrigation systems were surveyed. The industrial impacts of the pest were shown to remain relatively mild; irrigation systems are those that seem to be facing more significant economic losses due to infestation. Possible reasons for the apparent discrepancy between this result and the species dispersal in natural ecosystems are discussed, and recommendations on adequate responses to the latent threat are provided. This study may assist the implementation of integrated pest management policies in countries at risk of invasion or recently invaded, and contribute to an understanding of the species' progression in industrial environments.

Analysis is informed by theories of political ecology and methods of environmental history; although very relevant, these have received relatively little attention within ecological economics. Empirical material includes communications from the City Archives of Matadepera (1919-1979), 17 interviews with locals born between 1913 and 1958, and an exhaustive review of grey historical literature. Existing water histories of Barcelona and its outskirts portray a battle against natural water scarcity, hard won by heroic engineers and politicians acting for the good of the community. Our research in Matadepera tells a very different story. We reveal the production of a highly uneven landscape and waterscape through fierce political and power struggles. The evolution of Matadepera from a small rural village to an elite suburb was anything but spontaneous or peaceful. It was a socio-environmental project well intended by landowning elites and heavily fought by others. The struggle for the control of water went hand in hand with the land and political struggles that culminated - and were violently resolved - in the Spanish Civil War. The displacement of the economic and environmental costs of water use from few to many continues to this day and is constitutive of Matadepera's uneven and unsustainable landscape. By unravelling the relations of power that are inscribed in the urbanization of nature (Swyngedouw, 2004), we question the perceived wisdoms of contemporary water policy debates, particularly the notion of a natural scarcity that merits a technical or economic response. We argue that the water question is fundamentally a political question of environmental justice; it is about negotiating alternative visions of the future and deciding whose visions will be produced.

This paper considers one set of regulating mechanisms - the buffering functions of wetlands - and considers the information needed to identify both the value of the services offered by wetlands, and their substitutes. Using data from a catchment discharging water and nutrients to the Kenyan segment of Lake Victoria, the Yala catchment, the paper models the interactions between agriculture and fisheries as mediated by wetlands at the lake margin. More particularly, it estimates the value of the forgone nutrient retention function involved in the conversion of the wetland to agriculture, and the scope for providing the same services through land use change elsewhere in the catchment. The total cost of the payments that would compensate farmers for on-farm nutrient buffering services is 3.86 M US$ year(-1), or 35% of the total gains from wetland conversion to crop production. This finding contributes to an understanding of both the value of regulating services and how they might most effectively be delivered in alternative ways. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses data from a 2003-2004 cross sectional supplemental survey of respondents to the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus to assess effects of education on health and mechanisms underlying the relationship. The supplemental survey provides rich detail on use of personal health care services (e. g., adherence to guidelines for diabetes care) and personal attributes which are plausibly largely time invariant and systematically related to years of schooling completed, including time preference, self-control, and self-confidence. Educational attainment, as measured by years of schooling completed, is systematically and positively related to time to onset of diabetes, and conditional on having been diagnosed with this disease on health outcomes, variables related to efficiency in health production, as well as use of diabetes specialists. However, the marginal effects of increasing educational attainment by a year are uniformly small. Accounting for other factors, including child health and child socioeconomic status which could affect years of schooling completed and adult health, adult cognition, income, and health insurance, and personal attributes from the supplemental survey, marginal effects of educational attainment tend to be lower than when these other factors are not included in the analysis, but they tend to remain statistically significant at conventional levels.","[Grossman, Daniel; Sloan, Frank] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Ayyagari, Padmaja] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Duke University; Yale University,"Sloan, F (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 236 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Padmaja.ayyagari@yale.edu; Dan.s.grossman@gmail.com; fsloan@duke.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG017473, 2R37-AG-17473-05A1, R37 AG017473] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,40,28,34,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

This study examines how bioenergy and marketed environmental rents for forestland potentially influence land use in the Midwestern US. We hypothesize that current land uses reflect market values for environmental benefits of forestland, so that the marketed component of the environmental value of land can be captured as the difference between Census land values and value of land as a timber asset. We use a multinomial logit model to estimate the land use shares of forests, crops and urban in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The results show that marketed environmental rents increase forestland relative to cropland. To examine the effects of biofuels on land use, we conduct policy analysis by altering future land rents. Our baseline scenario projects that urban development uses mostly cropland, but with higher crop rents resulting from increased demand for bioenergy, there will be significant losses of forestland to urban and cropland. On the other hand, if marketed environmental rents grow while crop rents are maintained at their baseline value, urban growth will occur, primarily at the expense of cropland. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we ask whether and how strongly an industry's investment responds to stringency in environmental regulation. Environmental regulation is measured as (i) an industry's total current expenditure on environmental protection, and (ii) a country-industry's revenue from environmental taxes. Focusing on European data of manufacturing industries between 1998 and 2007, we estimate the differential impact of environmental stringency on four types of investment: gross investment in tangible goods, in new buildings, in machinery, and in 'productive' investment (investment in tangible goods minus investment in abatement technologies). Both environmental variables enter positively, and their quadratic terms exhibit significantly negative parameter estimates. This, in turn, indicates a positive but diminishing impact of environmental regulation on investment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

What can be done to help consumers with positive attitudes towards green electricity to walk the talk, i.e. to behave consistently with their preferences? We developed a psychological model based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to design a large-scale behavioural intervention survey with 1163 Swiss electricity consumers. Our results show that by providing information targeted at the key factors influencing the intention to purchase green electricity, namely attitudes towards purchase, social norms and perceived behavioural control, a significant increase in green electricity market share can be achieved. Our results show that price is not the only barrier to purchasing green electricity, and that information to increase the perceived benefit of buying green electricity as well as targeted communication to overcome inertia among retail electricity consumers are equally important factors.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 12 distinct food choice motives, adapted from the Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) is posted on a questionnaire collection web site to collect research data. A total of 522 useful responses were elicited as the data input for analysis. Findings - The results indicate that mood, sensory appeal, price, and familiarity were found to have positive impacts on consumers' attitudes toward GM foods but natural content is observed to have a negative impact on consumers' attitudes toward GM foods. Moreover, female consumers have a more negative attitude toward GM foods than male consumers when they consider whether GM foods are healthy or not. Practical implications - The marketers of this GM foods sector in Taiwan should emphasize the price advantage and the appealing sensory aspects of GM foods. By doing so, consumers could familiarize themselves with such foods being promoted. However, how to prevent them from treating GM foods as unnatural and unhealthy is an important task for GM foods marketers. Originality/value - This is the first study to investigate the gender gap in food choice motives as a determinant of consumers' attitudes toward GM foods in Taiwan. Based on the empirical findings, some suggestions are provided here to benefit the marketers of this GM foods sector in Taiwan.","Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan",Tatung University,"Chen, MF (通讯作者)，Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan.",mfchen@ttu.edu.tw,,,,,,,59,23,27,2,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

To do this, three grounds are sprinkled with its own water. While these soils are irrigated with distilled water to simulate the effect of rain. We conclude that, in general, virtually no traceable elements are leached despite the significant increase in electrical conductivity which is due to macronutrients and other salts supplied through water containing soil.

This paper seeks to review the current research in this area with the aim of identifying common features of successful interventions and strengths and weaknesses in the current research methodology. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of interventions aimed at increasing breakfast-eating frequency in a non-clinical sample was conducted. Findings - A total of 11 interventions were identified and reviewed; of these, only three resulted in an increase in breakfast consumption at follow-up. The three studies that were successful in changing breakfast consumption all included a psychosocial component that was successful in increasing positive attitudes towards nutrition in the intervention protocol. Many of the breakfast-eating interventions included in this review have methodological weaknesses, including difficulties in implementing interventions, small sample sizes, and selection biases, which future researchers should consider when designing and evaluating their own interventions. Research limitations/implications - These findings highlight the importance of including psychosocial components in interventions designed to increase breakfast consumption, while also signalling issues that should be addressed when designing and reporting future interventions. Originality/value - This review was the first to investigate the efficacy of interventions aimed at increasing breakfast consumption.

Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected through a consumer survey (n = 1,319), conducted in November-December 2007 in three European countries: Belgium, Norway and Spain. The study describes personal and food characteristics, as well as consumer attitudes and knowledge related to fish origin. Further, these characteristics were analysed in terms of their impact on the choice of either farmed or wild fish, using bivariate analyses. Findings - In general, European consumers have little knowledge or awareness regarding the origin of fish. This results in uncertainty in consumers' perception of farmed fish in particular. The study is in line with previous ones suggesting that perceptions of aquaculture and farmed fish are based more on emotions than on rational considerations. Still, the perception of farmed fish is positive in general. Consumers do not prioritise fish origin as an information cue, although variation is present between different consumer groups. Consumers of predominantly farmed versus wild fish did not have a very distinct profile, which corroborates with the only modest significance of fish origin as a product-specific information cue during the fish purchase and consumption decision process. Originality/value - The strength of the paper pertains to its international scope, and to the diversity of countries selected in terms of relevant variables. Also, the growing relevance of aquaculture as a fish production method and farmed fish as a food product makes results and findings of the study topical and of practical relevance.","[Vanhonacker, Filiep; Verbeke, Wim] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Altintzoglou, Themistoklis; Luten, Joop] Nofima Marine, Tromso, Norway",Ghent University; Nofima,"Vanhonacker, F (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Filiep.Vanhonacker@ugent.be,"Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/AEO-3958-2022; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/0000-0002-9877-966X; Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104","European Commission [FOOD-CT-2005-513998, FA-0802]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support received from the European Commission through its Sixth Framework Programme Coordination Action CONSENSUS (FOOD-CT-2005-513998) and the COST Action FA-0802 Feed for Health.

Finally, an outlook on bargaining strategies based on these dependency indicators is given.","[Zwickl, Patrick; Reichl, Peter] FTW Telecommun Res Ctr Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Reichl, Peter] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, Rennes, France; [Ghezzi, Antonio] Politecn Milan, Dept Management, Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Zwickl, P (通讯作者)，FTW Telecommun Res Ctr Vienna, Vienna, Austria.",zwickl@ftw.at; reichl@ftw.at; antonio1.ghezzi@polimi.it,"Ghezzi, Antonio/D-4386-2013","Ghezzi, Antonio/0000-0002-2084-4521",European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [248567]; Universite Europeenne de Bretagne in the framework of the SISCom International Research Chair on Future Telecommunication Ecosystems,European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)); Universite Europeenne de Bretagne in the framework of the SISCom International Research Chair on Future Telecommunication Ecosystems,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Communitys Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 248567 for the ETICS project.

However, its concrete application has always been controversial. The Kyoto Protocol framed this allocation issue in terms of quantified emission reduction and limitation objectives (QERLOs) in its Annex B, but this also triggered the refusal of the United States to ratify the Protocol. This article identifies some of the problems associated with allocation, and its problems inter-linked with governance architecture, by examining the case of the allocation of reduction commitments for greenhouse gas emissions in the context of climate governance beyond 2012. Three broad criteria are used in the discussion, namely, responsibility, capability, and efficiency. Target numbers for individual countries differ with the criteria used, but they also differ even within the same criteria category, due to different ways these conceptual criteria are translated into quantitative calculation formulas. Sometimes this makes a large difference for individual targets. Our calculations using different criteria and formula to come up with medium-term targets for selected developed countries show that differences in results are caused by the choice of allocation principle, differences in allocation formula under a given allocation principle, and different calculation criteria used under a given allocation formula. Assumptions in modeling and the choice of data also affect results. Importantly, interests are often embedded explicitly or implicitly behind these different ideas. Although allocation and architecture seems to be different problems of governance at first glance, there is also a link between limited data availability for allocation calculations and the form of governance architecture proposed. This is an area where further scientific research is required.","[Kanie, Norichika] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Kanie, Norichika] SciencesPo, Paris, France; [Nishimoto, Hiromi] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan; [Hijioka, Yasuaki; Kameyama, Yasuko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology; Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Kanie, N (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Value & Decis Sci, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1-W9-43 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",kanie@valdes.titech.ac.jp,,,,,,,70,18,18,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This apparent increase in institutional strength has led to a corresponding increase of the behavioral effectiveness, or active compliance management of institutions as observed in the incidence of arbitral tribunal decisions. However, upon closer examination, it is apparent that this behavioral effectiveness has not been exclusively due to provisions for arbitral tribunal decisions within international environmental agreements. Rather, the incidence and enforcement of these arbitral tribunal decisions is linked to the institutional design of the enforcement mechanisms. Most international environmental agreements rely on parties to raise disputes and enforce commitments, causing individual countries to bear the cost of enforcement. In addition, bringing a dispute to an arbitral tribunal requires the accordance of the parties to the dispute. In contrast, the European Court of Justice allows for enforcement to originate from a strong central authority and for the cases of arbitration to be filed unilaterally. International environmental agreements that have been joined by the European Community and have a provision for an arbitral tribunal have stronger enforcement mechanisms, are more likely to result in enforcement action, and are more effective in generating behavioral change.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Matisoff, DC (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",daniel.matisoff@pubpolicy.gatech.edu,,"Matisoff, Daniel/0000-0003-4575-5282",,,,,51,7,7,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Still, most footprint studies are not yet sensitive to the specific locations on which the footprint falls and to the unique production characteristics of each supporting region. In recent years some studies have acknowledged the need to quantify the 'real land' footprints and particularly the share of the footprint embodied in trade. Our goal is to analyse the ecological footprint of grain-based consumption in the state of Israel during the last two decades. We present a detailed, place oriented calculation procedure of Israel's grain footprint on specific locations around the world. We document modes of production, major energy inputs in specific sources of supply, the energy required for shipping from each source, and the CO2 emissions from those operations. Our research reveals that most of Israel's grain footprint falls on North America followed by the Black Sea region. It also shows that while the overall consumption of grain products has increased throughout the research period, the size of the footprint has been dropping in recent years as a consequence of changing sources of supply and grain composition. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of the method presented here for future footprint calculations and environmental resource management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Besides the role of central modeling assumptions we investigate the implications of contracting bodies on the simulation results. Our analysis reveals the importance of unobservable study characteristics for the prospects of a double dividend in terms of lower emissions along with higher employment levels. While at first glance labor market assumptions and the contracting body seem to play a central role for the model outcome, these observable features are no longer significant when unobservable study features are controlled for. In contrast, we find the simulated employment impacts of environmental tax reforms to be determined by a joint set of explicit model assumptions as well as implicit characteristics of the respective studies.

In a case involving a dispute between Sweden and Finland over one another's contribution to the organochlorine pollution load to the Baltic Sea, indicators of environmental risk, including measures of allegedly toxic concentrations of organochlorines in Swedish and Finnish chemical pulp wastewater, did not bring the two sides closer to a settlement. Also, ironically, advances in technological solutions to the problem were unhelpful to the negotiation. For many months, the disputants failed to acknowledge that deliberations were slowed down by the parties' pride and confidence in their respective national scientific, technological, and regulatory institutions. In recent years, the problems caused by organochlorine emissions from Swedish and Finnish pulp mills have been all but solved-a comparatively rare transboundary environmental success story. With the tackling of the problem, the competition between Sweden and Finland's preferred engineering solutions has dramatically faded.","Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Auer, MR (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mauer@indiana.edu,,,,,,,70,4,4,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach is taken in the form of face-to-face and telephone interviews among 23 olive grove operators in Western Australia from a sample of 33 operations identified. Findings - Almost half of the respondents indicated being open to the public in some form, including cellar door sales and hospitality facilities, such as a cafe. Other respondents are currently in the process of developing hospitality facilities or plan to be associated to tourism. However, some responses identified existing marketing issues and outside competition from cheaper products as current constraints. Research limitations/implications - That only 23 respondents participated in the study does clearly limit the generalisability of the findings in regards to olive growing in Western Australian or elsewhere. Despite this limitation, this exploratory study provides first insights into an unexplored emerging and increasingly multifunctional industry. Practical implications - In view of some operators' concerns of being able to market their products in the future, the findings illustrate that the mix of strategies combining the olive products, hospitality and/or tourism could have several positive impacts on this emerging industry for those operators willing and able to pursue such paths. Originality/value - The current developmental stage of olive growing and its potential for further extending into olive tourism or related concepts suggests opportunities for future research.","Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,37,30,33,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

By establishing a set of indicating factors of the enabling factors, this paper has done a fuzzy comprehensive analysis related to the enabling factors, and tested the set of enabling factors of the pre-stage credit risk.

Design/methodology/approach - Apple juice was fortified with calcium lactate, calcium lactate gluconate, or anhydrous calcium gluconate and was processed along with an unfortified control juice. The bottled product was stored at 3 and 18 degrees C for 30 weeks, and was assessed for calcium ion concentration, colour and haze. Consumer acceptance of the juices was confirmed using sensory evaluation. Findings - Anhydrous calcium gluconate and calcium lactate gluconate are easily dissolved in apple juice and are as acceptable to consumers as the unfortified control juice. All three calcium salts remain in solution in apple juice after 30 weeks of storage. Originality/value - The paper shows that, unlike a number of commercially marketed, calcium-fortified beverages, these calcium salts stayed in solution in apple juice during extended storage. The ease of dissolution of anhydrous calcium gluconate and calcium lactate gluconate make them excellent candidates for commercial processing; their incorporation should cause minimal disruption to existing apple juice production practices.","[Russell, L.

Design/methodology/approach - The quantitative research was designed based upon previous qualitative analysis by Suwannaporn and Speece. A total of 114 questionnaires sent to medium and large food companies were returned (17.5 percent of companies). Findings - Managers' perceptions of the important success factors differ by job function, so that data about what is important cannot distinguish higher vs lower success rates. Manager perceptions of what factors are important do not match actual practice very closely, but they do report what is actually done in the NPD process consistently. Reported practices can distinguish success rates. Discriminant analysis shows that the use of marketing research is most critical in this industry. Internal communication in the NPD process and supplier linkages are also predictors of success rate, and strategy and planning plays a weak role. Practical implications - NPD is context-specific. The food industry is strongly market-driven, so rapid adaptation to customers is critical. Strategy and planning is less important than an ability to remain flexible and move quickly in response changing consumer tastes. Most local companies have strong business secrecy, which is likely to inhibit collaborative research and development (R&D). However, supplier linkages do contribute in distinguishing companies with higher vs lower success rates. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates that what managers involved in the NPD process believe to be the important success factors cannot always predict NP success rates.","[Suwannaporn, Prisana] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agroind, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Speece, Mark W.] Univ Alaska SE, Sch Management, Juneau, AK USA",Kasetsart University; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Southeastern,"Suwannaporn, P (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agroind, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand.",prisana.s@ku.ac.th,"Speece, Mark/AAD-8669-2021; Speece, Mark/AAP-5851-2021","Speece, Mark/0000-0003-4462-0896; Suwannaporn, Prisana/0000-0001-5688-6144",,,,,68,27,30,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They are simple and relatively easy to use, even for very complicated empirical models. That said, they can be computationally demanding, since these complicated models often need to be solved numerically, and these models need to be solved many times within an estimation procedure. This paper suggests methods that combine importance sampling techniques with changes-of-variables to address this caveat. These methods can dramatically reduce the number of times a particular model needs to be solved in an estimation procedure, significantly decreasing computational burden. The methods have other advantages as well, e.g. they can smooth otherwise non-smooth objective functions and can allow one to compute derivatives analytically. There are also caveats-if one is not careful, they can magnify simulation error. We illustrate with examples and a small Monte-Carlo study.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Ackerberg, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",ackerber@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,43,30,47,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The article distinguishes between integration of institutions, of organizations, and of their bureaucracies, and it addresses both internal integration (within the environmental policy domain) and external integration (between environmental policies and non-environmental policies). The overall focus is on one set of policy reform proposals that have been salient in the global environmental governance debate for the last decades: the question of whether the creation of a world environment organization would improve the effectiveness, legitimacy, and efficiency of global environmental governance. We revisit this debate and explore the options for organizational change, including clustering, upgrading, streamlining, and hierarchical steering, with a focus on whether the reform proposals can bring about environmental policy integration. We conclude that in the longer term, upgrading of the UN Environment Programme to a UN specialized agency, with additional and increasing streamlining of other institutions and bureaucracies, offers the most potential for environmental policy integration and does not appear to be unrealistic.","[Biermann, Frank; Davies, Olwen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1091 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Biermann, F (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1091 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",frank.biermann@ivm.vu.nl,"van der Grijp, Nicolien M/N-1646-2013; Biermann, Frank/D-4175-2013","Biermann, Frank/0000-0002-0292-0703; van der Grijp, N.M./0000-0002-5119-3514",,,,,57,71,78,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A short review of progress shows that effectiveness has so far been limited. Although there has been intense donor activity in relation to stating commitment to the EPI principle and developing a wide range of processes, institutions, and tools, a large part of ODA still is likely to have directly harmful impacts on the environment. The implications for EPI of the emerging governance framework for ODA, namely, the principles stipulated in the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, are then discussed. Both challenges and opportunities are presented, and these are empirically illustrated with a case study of the integration of climate change adaptation in ODA. Finally, this article proposes that at least four special conditions apply to EPI in the bilateral ODA context as compared with domestic EPI: two or more jurisdictions, electorates, and governments are involved; a negotiation context characterized by sovereign states but with a potential power asymmetry; potential conflicts of interest and equity concerns in cases where environmental objectives refer to global environmental problems primarily caused by developed countries; and a policy-making process characterized by a comparatively wide span of both strategic and operational decisions, where EPI can take on very different meanings. The initial exploration presented in this article suggests that these conditions hold, and that, as a consequence, EPI arguably involves more 'high-politics' decisions and questions than in a domestic policy context.","Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Persson, Å (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",asa.persson@sei.se,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",,,,,77,22,22,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It develops an analytical framework that integrates the effects of property rights evolution, natural resource attributes, agent characteristics, and production technology on the environment-income relationship. The substantive strength of this framework lies in its ability to rationalize a wide range of environment-income relationships. The model shows that the U-shaped environment-income relationship, which is consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, can arise only under specific model conditions. Thus the framework provides an additional explanation for non-universality of EKC. We provide evidence in support of our framework from case studies of various natural resources.

We present an assessment of the global use of materials since the beginning of the 20th century based on the conceptual and methodological principles of material flow accounting (MFA). On the grounds of published statistical data, data compilations and estimation procedures for material flows not covered by international statistical sources, we compiled a quantitative estimate of annual global extraction of biomass. fossil energy carriers. metal ores, industrial minerals and construction minerals for the period 1900 to 2005. This period covers important phases of global inclustrialisation and economic growth. The paper analyses the observed changes in the overall size and composition of global material flows in relation to the global economy, population growth and primary energy consumption. We show that during the last century. global materials use increased 8-fold. Humanity currently uses almost 60 billion tons (Gt) of materials per year. In particular, the period after WWII was characterized by rapid physical growth, driven by both population and economic growth. Within this period there was a shift from the dominance of renewable biomass towards mineral materials. Materials use increased at a slower pace than the global economy, but faster than world population. As a consequence. material intensity (i.e. the amount of materials required per unit of GDP) declined, while materials use per capita doubled from 4.6 to 10.3 t/cap/yr. The main material groups show different trajectories. While biomass use hardly keeps up with population growth, the mineral fractions grow at a rapid pace. We show that increases in material productivity are mostly due to the slow growth of biomass use, while they are much less pronounced for the mineral fractions. So far there is no evidence that growth of global materials use is slowing down or might eventually decline and our results indicate that an increase in material productivity is a general feature of economic development.

Studies on this topic have traditionally drawn not only on insights from economics, but also from such disciplines as sociology, anthropology and psychology. In recent years,a practice theory approach has emerged in sociological consumption studies, as part of a general wave of renewed interest in practice theory emanating from a desire to move beyond such dominant dualisms as the structure-actor opposition in sociology. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the practice theory approach in relation to studies of everyday life, domestic practices and consumption. and to argue that this approach can be fruitful for ecological economics and other fields interested in the environmental aspects of consumption. The paper emphasizes the immense challenge involved in promoting sustainable consumption, and the need for collective efforts supported by research into the co-evolution of domestic practices, systems of provision, supply chains and production.

The first theme concerns the emergence and continuation of the APP. The contributions show that the emergence of the APP can be attributed to international factors, including the United States' rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, and its search for an alternative arena for global climate governance, and other countries' wish to maintain good relations with the US; as well as domestic factors, such as the presence of bureaucratic actors in favour of the Partnership, alignment with domestic priorities, and the potential for reaping economic benefits through participation. The second theme examines the nature of the Partnership, concluding that it falls on the very soft side of the hard-soft law continuum and that while being branded as a public-private partnership, governments remain in charge. Under the third theme, the influence which the APP exerts on the post-2012 United Nations (UN) climate change negotiations is scrutinised. The contributions show that at the very least, the APP is exerting some cognitive influence on the UN discussions through its promotion of a sectoral approach. The introduction concludes with outlining areas for future research.","[Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia I.] Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Tampere 33100, Finland; [van Asselt, Harro] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Policy Anal, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Turku; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, S (通讯作者)，Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Pinninkatu 47, Tampere 33100, Finland.",sylvia.karlsson@tse.fi; harro.van.asselt@ivm.vu.nl,"Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia I/C-4889-2009","Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen, Sylvia I/0000-0001-7632-8545; van Asselt, Harro/0000-0003-3028-0659",,,,,45,38,39,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Lubeck and Danzig illuminate the difficulties experienced by old-style European towns where early modern guilds (and other privileged 'corporations') had a lot of political influence in making the transition to the new style of north-west European cities such as Amsterdam and Hamburg. The article refutes theories proposing that the special privileges awarded to a merchant elite enhanced economic growth; instead, it is argued that those privileges gave rise to 'club goods' that were beneficial only to a small number of merchants and were provided at the expense of society at large, resulting in economic decline.","Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Lindberg, E (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,,59,26,28,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Based around a quasi-multi-regional input-output (QMRIO) model, the study, in theory, takes into account all CO2 emissions that arise from energy used in production of goods and services to satisfy UK household demand, whether the emissions occur in the UK or abroad. Results show that CO2 emissions attributable to households were 15% above 1990 levels in 2004, and that although absolute decoupling occurred between household expenditure and CO2 during the UK's switch from coal to gas in the early 1990s. since then only slight relative decoupling is evident. The proportion of CO2 that arises outside UK borders in support of UK consumption is rising, and reducing these emissions is particularly problematic in a global trading system. Investigation into the carbon footprint of different segments of the UK population shows wide variation: the segment with the highest carbon footprint emits 64% more CO2 than the segment with the lowest. Results show that recreation and leisure are responsible for over one quarter of CO2 emissions in a typical UK household in 2004. We conclude that expanding lifestyle aspirations are significant factors in driving household CO2 emissions, but the study also emphasizes that attention must be paid to the infrastructures and institutions that result in considerable amounts of CO2 being locked up in basic household activities through which people meet their everyday needs for subsistence, protection, and communication with family and friends. The findings highlight the sheer scale of the challenge facing UK policy-makers, and suggest that policies should be targeted towards segments of society responsible for the highest carbon footprints.

This paper considers two different types, environmentally adjusted production efficiency models and frontier eco-efficiency models, and tries to find justification for incorporating the materials balance principle (MBP) in them. Similar importance is attached to the economic and environmental outcomes of a production process. Like economic outcomes can be derived from inputs and outputs and respective prices, some cases allow for deriving environmental outcomes from the production function with the MBP. After an overview of attempts to incorporate environmental issues in production efficiency models and some reflections why MBP has been neglected in environmental economics and production efficiency analysis, the paper gives basic principles to incorporate the MBP in conventional production efficiency methods and shows how this adjustment leads to a more diversified diagnosis of eco-efficiency. Finally, potentialities and bottlenecks are discussed. Exploiting the MBP in production efficiency and eco-efficiency analysis will facilitate more pro-active eco-efficiency research.

KARST.; NORWAY SPRUCE; MANAGEMENT; TRANSFORMATION; SEQUESTRATION; STANDS; EVEN,"The paper presents a combined simulation-optimization approach to model forest conversion planning taking the values of timber, carbon and biodiversity into account. The development of a virtual age-class forest was predicted by adopting a single tree forest growth tool, TreeGrOSS. The effects of different conversion regimes with continuous variables describing silvicultural prescriptions were monitored for a finite conversion period of forty years in stand level. Dynamic linear programming was employed to adaptively solve the multi-period large-scale optimization problem of a forest enterprise encompassing five different age-classes of pure Norway spruce (Picea abies, L. Karst) stands. The global net present values of biodiversity, carbon sequestration and timber production along with the wood even flow constraint, were considered simultaneously. The obtained optimal sylvicultural pathway differed not only among different stands but also sometimes within a given stand. The integration of the utility of biodiversity into the optimization procedure favoured conversion strategies that foresee the establishment of beech regeneration in all forest stands. The simultaneous consideration of all mentioned utilities resulted in a global utility of 27451 (sic)/ha consisting of 14499 (53%), 3412 (12%), 764 (3%), and 8777 (32%) (sic)/ha for the value of timber, carbon, biodiversity, and standing volume respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the threshold from which no major changes in the relevant silvicultural parameters occurred was observed at 30 (sic)/t carbon price with an interest rate of 2%.

However, they tend to be abstract and thus open to diverging interpretations. Conversely, scientists need concrete guidance to develop quantitative measures of the sustainability of agricultural systems, such as sustainability indicators. Bridging this gap between what policy provides and what scientists need involves strong normative elements. Many publications on sustainable agriculture suggest bridging the gap through participatory stakeholder processes. However, participatory stakeholder involvement is not always practicable, due to the high cost and time required. In addition, the outcome of such processes can lack transparency and validity to outsiders. In this paper (the first of a series of two, [Walter, C. and Stutzel, H., 2009-this issue. A new method for assessing the sustainability of land-use systems (II): Evaluating impact indicators. Ecological Economics]), we introduce an alternative method for concretising sustainability within a given context. It is based on a systematic inventory of potential issues through a structured literature review, and then uses a simple and transparent criterion to decide which of these potential issues is actually relevant within the given context. This approach yields a set of concrete issues against which to test the impact of agricultural production systems. It also makes transparent the normative and descriptive elements of the process, which helps to control value-driven biases. We demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach by testing it for an agricultural area in Northwest Germany. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggest that external military threats increased the appeal of nationalizations, while legal and political institutions influenced their costs.

In this paper an original, empirical framework called Factor Weighting Model (FWM) is proposed to integrate different indicators into a composite index. The FWM is able to work with variables depicting different themes (e.g. climate, soil, landscape, demography, economy) collected at various geographical and temporal scales. Three case studies carried out at different spatial scales were considered as examples of FWM application to a composite index of Land Degradation. It consists of several variables collected from various data sources and available at different temporal and spatial scales, which are aggregated into some thematic indicators. The FWM approach was applied separately for each case study to the single variables transformed into sensitivity indicators through standard procedures. A multiway factor analysis (MDA) was carried out to explore over time the relationships among indicators. The importance of the environmental indicators was estimated by attributing a percent weight to each of them according to MDA outputs. Climate and soil dimensions account for the highest weights in all the cases considered. These findings are in accordance with the results obtained in previous studies. The implications of FWM in the assessment of environmental quality are finally discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The fundamental difference between a universal and a fragmented regime is that the first involves a single comprehensive climate regime in which all countries participate, whereas the second involves either multiple treaties or a single treaty in which not all countries participate. This study assesses the literature on a wide range of different model studies concerning the environmental effectiveness and economic consequences of various universal and fragmented climate regimes. The most important conclusions (e.g. relative position of regions in terms of costs) are generally consistent across different studies, despite the differences in methodology. We conclude that stabilising GHG concentrations at low levels is more costly with a fragmented regime than with a universal regime, because reduction targets must be achieved by a smaller number of countries or because fragmented treaties may prevent reducing GHGs where it is cheapest to do so. However, establishing a universal regime will be challenging due to cost differences between regions if emissions are allocated based on specific allocation rules and incentives to free-ride on a universal regime. Even though alternative behaviours such as responsibility, the implementation of transfer schemes or exclusive membership can increase the likelihood of achieving a universal regime, a fragmented regime seems more feasible. Therefore, a transitional fragmented 'coalition of the willing' could be established first, which could provide the basis for a larger, universal regime in the long term.","[Hof, Andries F.; den Elzen, Michel G.

The paper seeks to conduct this analysis for a protected designation of origin (PDO) food product, the cured ham Jamon de Teruel. This analysis aims to distinguish perceived quality in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of PDO. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Specifically, consumers were asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements based on a seven-point Likert scale. After completion of fieldwork, an analytic process (exploratory and confirmatory reliability analysis) was performed to obtain 441 valid questionnaires. A multi-sample model was applied to analyse the effect level of consumer involvement in the proposed model. Findings - The results suggest that the influence of quality attributes on consumers' perceived risk, trust, satisfaction and loyalty is substantially different between consumers with a high involvement level and consumers with low involvement. In addition, substantial differences were also found in the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic quality attributes on the model being analysed. The results of the analysis show that for the group of highly involved consumers the influence of both intrinsic and extrinsic perceived quality on the consumers' loyalty level is clearly higher. Practical implications - Managers of PDO food products need to understand how consumer involvement level regarding their products influences consumers' decision-making processes. Thus, PDO managers should take advantage of the situation that those highly involved consumers in this kind of product are more receptive to their advertisements. Moreover, promotion of PDO food products based on the quality, tradition and know-how of certain brands may make the consumer reach higher attention levels in an easier manner, so that their loyalty levels towards the brands will be reinforced. Originality/value - The paper analyses the moderating effect of consumer involvement of a traditional PDO food product. There is a lack of literature that focuses on the influence of consumer involvement of food products in consumer behaviour patterns. The paper tries to advance this important research line.","[Espejel, Joel; Fandos, Carmina; Flavian, Carlos] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Mkt & Business Studies, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Flavián, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Mkt & Business Studies, Zaragoza, Spain.",cflavian@unizar.es,"Flavian, Carlos/G-4365-2013; Fandos, Carmina/H-4388-2015","Flavian, Carlos/0000-0001-7118-9013; Fandos, Carmina/0000-0002-2952-0750",,,,,143,34,36,0,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Primary data on consumer perception were gathered in 2006-2007 through a consumer survey with Flemish adults (n = 529) and compared with scientific evidence from literature. Consumers of organic and conventional vegetables were selected by means of a convenience sampling procedure. Subjects were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire concerning the perception of the nutritional and toxicological value of organic relative to conventional vegetables. Data processing and analysis included descriptive analysis (frequency distributions), data reduction (Cronbach's alpha test, factor analysis), bivariate analysis (correlations, t-test, ANOVA) and multivariate analysis (stepwise multiple regression). Findings - It was found that organic vegetables are perceived as containing less contaminants and more nutrients, and as such, being healthier and safer compared to conventional vegetables. However, not enough evidence is currently available in the literature to support or refute such a perception, indicating a certain mismatch between consumer perception and scientific evidence. The gap between perception and evidence is larger among older consumers with children. The perception is stronger when the consumption frequency is higher, but is independent of gender, place of residence (rural or urban), education and income level. Also non-users, on average, perceive that organic vegetables have a nutritional and toxicological advantage over conventional vegetables. Research limitations/implications - A non-probability convenience sampling method was applied which limits generalisation of the findings beyond the sample characteristics. Originality/value - This paper is original in comparing consumer perception and scientific facts related to both nutritional and safety aspects of organic versus conventional vegetables.","[Hoefkens, Christine; Verbeke, Wim; Aertsens, Joris; Mondelaers, Koen; Van Camp, John] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Hoefkens, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Christine.Hoefkens@UGent.be,"Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104",Ministry of the Flemish Community,Ministry of the Flemish Community,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of the Flemish Community (Department of Sustainable Agricultural Development - ADLO).

The basic premise is that for a class of business processes it is possible to specify a small number of essential constraints it design time, but allow for a large number of execution possibilities at runtime. The objective of this paper is to conceptualise a set, of constraints for process adaptation at, instance level.

Design/methodology/approach - Different influences from actors in the packaging design process are discussed in a conceptual model. A single case study based on five corporate stories about packaging development resulting in a new package are presented and analysed. Findings - The present study demonstrates influences on the design process of a package from external and internal factors. The outcome of the design process is, to a great extent, dependent on the interaction between the main actors in this process. The study argues for the importance of the interaction with customers for planning and conducting the design. The result of such a process is a package that can trigger customers make a purchase and/or re-inforce the brand name for a re-purchase of the product. Practical implications - The main implications for management are that packaging is a vital instrument in modern marketing activities for consumer goods, for example in the competitive food industry. The study highlights a few factors that trigger a customer to purchase a product by designing a suitable package for the product. Packaging design makes it possible to introduce new and better solutions for diverse marketing and logistic problems in a supply chain. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for contributions to more research on packaging and marketing strategy.","Karlstad Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Rundh, B (通讯作者)，Karlstad Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karlstad, Sweden.",bo.rundh@kau.se,,,,,,,27,102,119,15,134,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

J,"Hampicke, U",,,,"Hampicke, Ulrich",,,Climate change economics and discounted utilitarianism,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change economics; The Stern Review; Pure time discount rate; Elasticity of marginal utility; Discounted Utilitarianism,SUSTAINABILITY,"In the recent debate on climate change economics triggered by the Stern Review and his opponents, fundamental methodological issues emerge. It becomes obvious that different choices for some variables in the models applied lead to vastly different conclusions. Specifically, the choice of the pure time discount rate delta decides on whether immediate strong action (in the Stern Review) or a more moderate response (as in Nordhaus' writings) is the right strategy facing the climate change challenge. This contribution critically comments the use of both delta and eta, the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to income, as adjustment screws in models of climate economics. Often, the models remain ambiguous as to whether they apply empirical or normative variables; facts and value judgments are not sufficiently distinguished. Furthermore, Discounted Utilitarianism appears to be a questionable fundament for climate change economics. From a non-utilitarian, specifically a Rawlsian point of view, it is pointless to maximize the utility an abstract, eternally-long lived phantasm humanity where no human individuals are distinguished. The more persuading position in climate economics is to postulate a duty to do everything in order to avoid serious evil for future generations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, current wood consumption and welfare sensitivity parameter are also influenced by individual's environmental entitlements rather than economic entitlements. Resource scarcity induced by physical scarcity or institutional-legal constraints leads to resource conserving attitude, but not without loss in perceived well-being. Communal conservation of energy is also observed whereby large households are more energy conserving than small households. Regarding biomass use and consumption, monetary income does not guarantee satisfaction, but heightens people's wants.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the household level impacts of a small scale agro-forestry based carbon sequestration project in rural Mozambique. In 2006, questionnaire based interviews were conducted quarterly of 290 randomly selected households in the buffer zone of the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. We used the propensity score matching technique to assess the PES-project impacts on household cash income, consumption expenditure, forest resource use and crop yields. We found that, in contrast to nonparticipant households, PES-participant households earned more cash income, incurred more consumption expenditure, collected less forest products and, harvested lower quantities of agriculture crops. In addition, we found, through decomposition analysis, that there was a differential in PES income. Both male-headed and high-income households were being favoured as project benefit recipients. Future PES-projects should focus on a payment scheme that can better ensure the benefit to all the participant households and also pay extra attention on the benefits distribution to the vulnerable households.

Typically conservation programs operate under time-related (e.g. annual) budgets and purchase land over time in a sequential manner. The uncertainty of land development has been incorporated in a few dynamic reserve selection formulations using stochastic dynamic programming. However, the existing formulations do not explicitly deal with inter-temporal price and location linkages. We address this issue here and present a two-period linear integer programming model for conservation reserve design that incorporates amenity driven price feedback effects inherent in the reserve development problem. In addition, the model includes spatial and ecological criteria. We then use this model to answer the question How suboptimal is ignoring amenity driven price effects in reserve design models? We apply the model to artificially generated data sets and compare the results with the results of an iterated static model that considers only one period at a time. We find that the dynamic model with price feedback effects selects sites at a lower per-site cost. The policy implication of this finding is that conservation programs should avoid purchasing land in the same neighborhood over multiple time periods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Structural decomposition analysis, on the other hand, identifies the factors behind the changes in key variables over time. Extending the input-output subsystem model to account for the changes in these variables reveals the channels by which environmental burdens are caused and transmitted throughout the production system. In this paper we propose a decomposition of the changes in the components of CO2 emissions captured by an input-output subsystems representation. The empirical application is for the Spanish service sector, and the economic and environmental data are for years 2000 and 2005. Our results show that services increased their CO2 emissions mainly because of a rise in the emissions generated by non-services to cover the final demand for services. The decomposed effects show a decrease in CO2 emissions due to technological changes between 2000 and 2005 compensated by an increase in emissions caused by the rise in final demand of services. Finally, large asymmetries exist not only in the quantitative changes in the CO2 emissions of the various services but also in the decomposed effects of these changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using the E3IOT environmentally extended input output database developed in an EU study on Environmental Impacts of Products (EIPRO), this paper estimates the difference in impacts between the European status quo and three simulated diet baskets, i.e. a pattern according to universal dietary recommendations, the same pattern with reduced meat consumption, and a 'Mediterranean' pattern with reduced meat consumption. Production technologies, protein and energy intake were kept constant. Though this implies just moderate dietary shifts, impact reductions of up to 8% were possible in reduced meat scenarios. The slightly changed food costs do not lead to significant first order rebound effects. Second order rebounds were estimated by applying the CAPRI partial equilibrium model. This analysis showed that European meat production sector will most likely respond by higher exports to compensate for losses on the domestic meat market. Higher impact reductions probably would need more drastic diet changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Tukker, Arnold; Goldbohm, R.

We valued the most important ecosystem services through a market-based approach, revealed-preference and stated-preference methods to assess the conservation effectiveness of the Donana Protected Area, with consideration of existing human activities in surrounding lands. We also analysed the spatial distribution of the ecosystem services beneficiaries and the scale of their related markets. We found a clear trade-off between the local and global market values of ecosystem services because landscape management outside of the Donana Protected Area promotes the provision of ecosystem services associated with international markets. Our results suggest that a conservation against development model occurs in the Donana social-ecological system, in which land use intensification takes place outside of the Protected Area borders as a result of promoting marketed ecosystem services, while biodiversity conservation is the main activity inside the Protected Area. We conclude that protected areas should be part of a larger-scale, adaptive landscape management strategy in which conservation planning should be the focal element in coordinating sectoral policies in the context of social-ecological systems.

The introduction of interregional trading raises questions about how flexible state- or national-level authorities should be in allowing individual firms to trade with firms or authorities in other states or countries. This paper uses laboratory methods to evaluate the efficiency and pricing performance of linking trading across regions at the firm-to-firm level. In one treatment, individual firms trade directly with firms or authorities in other regions. We compare performance in this treatment to an intergovernmental trading treatment, where emissions trading is restricted to occur only between intermediaries. A baseline treatment of autarky, where firms only trade with other firms in their country or region, provides a benchmark to assess the efficiency benefits of allowing linking. Although efficiency and price discovery are both improved by allowing intermediation in linked permit markets, we find that further gains can be realized through direct firm to firm trading. Buyers in high cost regions and sellers in low cost regions benefit the greatest from linking. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines all available transboundary water agreements signed between 1900 and 2007 to determine the degree to which water resources data and information is exchanged in the world's regions, how the level of exchange has developed over time, and the different ways in which data and information sharing has been codified in practice. In doing so, we reveal important trends regarding the mechanisms, types, and frequencies of water resources data and information sharing-as well as differences across temporal and spatial scales, by treaty type and function, and regime type. The results indicate that data and information exchange as already practiced is more nuanced and, in some senses, widespread than may commonly be recognized. Further, the results reveal key linkages between democracy and data and information exchange and provide a basis to test analogous linkages related to data sharing and other variables in transboundary water settings.","[Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lautze, Jonathan; Giordano, Mark] Int Water Management Inst, Colombo, Sri Lanka",University of Arizona; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Gerlak, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, 324 Social Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",agerlak@email.arizona.edu; J.Lautze@cgiar.org; Mark.giordano@cgiar.org,,,,,,,98,76,79,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

State-owned banks accounts for a major part of the financial sector in East European countries before the transition period. Since the input prices of the sector are frequently under the control of those governments, the misallocated resources may incur the loss of economic efficiency. This paper attempts to gauge the technical and allocative efficiency using unbalanced panel data of 340 banks from 14 transition countries under the framework of the Fourier flexible shadow cost function. Accommodating technical and allocative efficiencies simultaneously, as suggested by Atkinson and Cornwell (Int Econ Rev 35:231-243, 1994a) and Kumbhakar and Wang (J Econom 134:317-340, 2006a), avoids potential specification errors and leads to consistent parameter estimates. The average total cost savings resulting from greater technical and allocative efficiency are around 28.31 and 7.13%, respectively. Foreign-owned banks are found to be the most economically efficient. The enforcement of financial liberalization does gradually improve upon the sample banks' technical efficiency. The allocative inefficiency arises from over capitalization and excess funds. Scale diseconomies appear to prevail in the sample states with a few exceptions.","[Huang, Tai-Hsin; Chen, Kuan-Chen] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Shen, Chung-Hua] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Tseng, Shen-Ju] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Chungli, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Taiwan University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Huang, TH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",thuang@nccu.edu.tw,,"HUANG, TAI-HSIN/0000-0001-6518-4566",,,,,62,11,11,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We reveal, through the use of a survey applying both contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments, that many local people and others within the wider population, value peatlands as an example of a cultural landscape. However, there is a reluctance to stop extracting peat for domestic fuel even though the activity is undermining the ecological sustainability of this same landscape. This resistance is shown to arise because the cutting of peat is a well-established land use and a cessation of peat cutting is perceived to require the abandonment of traditional rights. In addition, the activity is widely regarded as more benign than industrial scale cutting for energy. The value attached to the landscape is an opportunity for conservation policy, but for this to succeed there must be an acknowledgement of local interests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To begin, the geographic extent of the market for recreation at a policy site is estimated using data from a similar study site. The population residing within this geographic area is simulated using a spatial microsimulation model and GIS techniques and an individual-level 'visitor arrival function' is then transferred across this simulated population. This allows the latent demand for visits to the policy site by each simulated individual to be predicted and summed, providing an estimate of the total potential demand for recreation at the site. Combining this with an economic value measure of a visit provides an estimate of the potential amenity value of the policy site. The approach is applied to Moyode Wood, a small-scale forest in the West of Ireland. and estimates the potential total economic value of recreation at (sic)0.4 million for the site. The research represents the first time that spatial microsimulation has been used in environmental benefit transfer and shows how it can be used to control for differences in demographic and spatial factors between study and policy sites. It also demonstrates how individual-level single-site travel cost models estimated using on-site survey data can be used to predict demand at alternative policy sites. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The linear programming models presented incorporate the following: biological constraints in the form of species' area needs; economic constraints in the form of opportunity costs of converting smaller administrative districts into nature reserves; and spatial constraints in the form of required connectivity among districts in site selection. The construction of a taxonomic data set for Thailand enables the implementation of the models, the comparison of results and evaluation of the differences in outcomes. The models build upon the existing nature reserve network in Thailand and suggest various public policy options that would augment the reserves for enhancing species protection and for possibly improving national conservation efforts at lowest costs.

It is crucial to ascertain to what extent the common wealth is used for the common benefit. Money-based schemes for valuing the Commons, such as the so-called willingness-to-pay, provide a user-side evaluation perspective based on the idea that value only stems from utilization by humans. As a complement to such a point of view, we present and discuss in this paper a donor-side evaluation method (Emergy Synthesis) based on the idea that a proper measure of value can be achieved by also accounting for the work done by the biosphere in generating services and resources. It should not be disregarded that such resources and services also provide support to other species in the web of life. Emergy, a scientific measure of such environmental support, is suggested as a tool capable to assess quantity and quality of shared resources, thus providing a basis for their environmentally sound management.

Using a new dataset collected from corporate genealogies to estimate entry probabilities, it is found that characteristics associated with zaibatsu increase a firm's likelihood of being an industry pioneer. In particular, first entry probabilities increase with industry diversification and private ownership, which may provide internal financing and risk-sharing, respectively. Nevertheless, the costs of excessive diversification may deter additional pioneering, which may account for the loss of zaibatsu technological leadership by the turn of the century.","US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Suitland, MD USA",,"Tang, JP (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Ctr Econ Studies, Suitland, MD USA.",,"Tang, John/AAN-7966-2020","Tang, John/0000-0003-1669-4249",,,,,35,23,25,0,17,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Most of such foods are based on dairy products but little research work is available on coarse cereals and millets, which constitute the staple foods in developing countries. This paper aims to determine the effect of germination and fementation on nutrient composition of pearl millet based food blends. Design/methodology/approach - Indigenously developed pearl millet based food blends containing raw and germinated pearl millet flour, whey powder and tomato pulp (2:1:1w/w) were autoclaved, cooled and fermented with 5 percent Lactobacillus acidophilus curd which supplied 10(6)cells/ml to the slurry at 37 degrees C for 12 h. The unfermented blends, after autoclaving, served as controls. The developed food blends were subjected to nutritional evaluation by using the standard methods of analysis. The data were statistically analysed. Findings - Pearl millet based, germinated, autoclaved and fermented, food blend maintained adequate cell viability (8.64 cfu g(-1)) as compared to non-germinated food blend. Germination and probiotic fermentation caused significant improvement in the contents of thiamine, niacin, total lysine, protein fractions, sugars, soluble dietary fibre and in vitro availability of Ca, Fe and Zn of food blends. Practical implications - Research is currently aimed at developing probiotic millet based food mixture, which had enhanced nutrient profile. Hence, it can be considered for commercialization after establishing its health/therapeutic implications among the population. Originality/value - Dairy foods have preferentially been used as the carrier medium for probiotics. This paper explores the possibility of using staple foods as the carrier medium. The consumption of such food mixtures containing viable probiotic bacteria should be enhanced among consumers in term of their role in health maintenance and disease prevention.","[Arora, Sonia; Jood, Sudesh; Khetarpaul, N.] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Foods & Nutr, Hisar, Haryana, India",CCS Haryana Agricultural University,"Jood, S (通讯作者)，CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Foods & Nutr, Hisar, Haryana, India.",ramjood@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,36,24,28,4,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Attributes of the bottom-up principle have been identified, the expression of these attributes in the management means of changes initiated by the rural development actors and the analysis of the forces stimulating and impeding these changes made the basis to determine and substantiate the combined elements of the model of rural area change management using the bottom-up principle. The investigation aim is to justify the model of the rural area change management using the bottom-up principle. Strategy of local activity group of Kretinga Municipality titled The Improvement of Life Standards in Kretinga Municipality in 2007 - 2013 has been chosen for empirical investigation. The method of real-life analysis of the forces has been used for the identification of people involvement into the forces stimulating and opposing the preparation of the strategy. These forces have been estimated in accordance with the scores of the impact strength. The model of the rural area change management using the bottom-up principle has been made on the basis of the explicit methodology of strategic management integrating the results of empirical analysis. The identification and validation of the model elements has shown that the model can change if governed by the goal of the change management and other factors of internal and external or real-life environment.

This separation between urban and rural helped retaining traditional residential, working, and sacral environments both in cities and in rural settlements. However, radical social, economic, demographical shifts had induced the growth of cities. The industrial and agricultural revolutions, intensive migration into urban areas had strongly changed not only the ways of agricultural production, but also the functions and lifestyles of rural settlements. In recent decades the agricultural and natural areas at the fringe of the cities are being increasingly built up with residential, industrial, infrastructural, commercial structures. The limits between the urban and rural areas became unclear and hardly distinguishable; this causes vanishing of traditional rural environment from social, economic, and even cultural points of view. This unprecedented urban expansion causes threats to the identity and even survival of relics of rural landscape, such as historic rural settlements, farmsteads, residencies of former manors, characteristic for their historical, cultural, social, ecological etc. values and significance. Changes of functions, communications system and links, shifts in ecological balance, changes of visual characteristics of environment, changes of lifestyles and ignorance of society are the main issues causing problems of preservation and integration in urban development of valuable relics of rural areas. This justifies the relevance of the research. The aim of the research was to analyze the present situation and potential of fragments of historic rural areas affected by urban development and to illustrate the possibilities of sustainable integration of the relics of rural landscape into urban development with the case of Versvas Landscape Reserve in the territory of Kaunas using the concept of ecomuseum.","[Azukaite, Ligita; Vitkuviene, Jurga; Grazuleviciute-Vileniske, Indre] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Civil Engn, Dept Architecture & Land Management, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,a.ligita1@gmail.com; jurga.vitkuviene@ktu.lt; grazuleviciute@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,12,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,31,36,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000004,0

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data from a UK major food importer and retailer to correlate carbon emissions from transport, and transport-related storage, with food miles by creating farm-specific mode-weighted emission factors. Findings - The correlation is found to be poor for a wide range of products and locations and it is clear that the mode of transport is as important as the distance, with sourcing from parts of the Mediterranean resulting in emissions greater than those from the Americas. Practical implications - It is concluded that it is difficult to justify the use of food miles when attempting to influence purchasing behaviour. Because of this result, processes and tools have been developed that relay information on true transport-related carbon emissions to customers and bulk purchasers that allow them to make informed decisions.

Such intense drained areas in Lithuania give a theoretical assumption, that during long term have changed runoff of rivers due to changes of water balance components. The purpose of the work was to evaluate the influence of wet lands drainage area on watershed runoff during different periods of the year. The Jura river watershed in the western part of the Republic of Lithuania was chosen for the research. At the moment drained land area makes 70-84 % of Jura watershed wet lands area. Five year periods averages of river runoff coefficients were calculated and shown for different periods. It was found out runoff coefficient during spring period (March - May) has downward trend, i.e while drained land area increases runoff coefficient during spring month decreases. The hypothesis of reduction river runoff during dry periods due increase drained land cannot be proved as it was found out there is no significant correlation between drained land area and runoff during June - September (r - 0.025). There is strong direct correlation between annual runoff and drained land area in Akmena and Jura (by Taurage) basins, i.e. more as 50 % of annual runoff are influenced by drainage.","[Kelmelyte, Ieva; Taparauskiene, Laima] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Land Management, Fac Water & Land Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,ievutt@gmail.com; laima.taparauskiene@asu.com,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,298,302,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500053,0

Design/methodology/approach - The seminal literature on local food in the UK is reviewed prior to providing a case study on a local food outlet, the True Food Co-op. This is followed by the results from a detailed survey of its customers. Findings - The increase in availability of and interest in local food over the last decade has been matched by new research findings. Although there is a consensus on the reasons why people buy local food, there are significant gaps in other areas of one's understanding, such as the lack of a clear definition of what local food is. This is frustrating further developments in the sector. Research limitations/implications - Business development strategies that rely on niche markets, such as local food, in fast-moving consumer goods categories are enjoying rapid growth. However, there are many difficulties with research in this area that emerge from the multitude of purchases made by numerous people, of various products, and in different places. Practical implications - Innovative community-based food retail outlets, such as the True Food Co-op, provide an example of a business model that links consumers and producers in local food networks. As such they contribute to food security by filling a vital role in a diversified, resilient and environmentally friendly food system. Originality/value - The paper publicises recent research findings in the local food sector that have practical implications for policy.

Such buildings are a big problem in many former socialist countries. The aim of the work - to carry out the analysis of the derelict buildings, to determine indices upon which the location of the derelict buildings depend, to determine problems concerning land plot formation for the exploitation of these buildings. There are approx 9 thousand of non-used buildings in our country at present, of which approx 1.2 thousand are considered as derelict ones. Derelict buildings are located unevenly. The number of derelict buildings in districts is mostly influenced by the value of agricultural purpose land. Relation between the value of the agricultural purpose land and the number of derelict buildings is reverse. There are less abandoned buildings in the places where the land price is higher, i.e. near larger towns and picturesque places and towns suitable for recreation (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda, Druskininkai, Birstonas). Building demolition and usage questions should be carried out evaluating influencing factors and considering master plans of districts as well as development conception predicted in these plans. State land plots are sold and leased without auctions, if they are mortgaged (to physical and juridical persons) by buildings and facilities belonging on ownership rights. Land plot can be formed and sold near buildings registered in the Immovable Property Register. Land plots, situated near derelict buildings, which are not registered in Immovable Property Register, i.e. they can't be functioning as immovable property objects, are not formed. However, attention should be paid that land plots with no buildings (immovable property objects) situated in them can be formed and sold by auction. Selling land plots by auction compulsory conditions, such as the demolition of derelict building or the development of possible activities, can be noted. Derelict buildings deface the visual view, reduce aesthetical value and pollute the environment. After the liquidation or renovation of derelict objects it is important to recreate landscape complexes and objects once damaged by human activity as well as to restore the former biodiversity.","[Sudoniene, Vilma; Atkoceviciene, Virginija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Land Management, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Parsova, Velta] Latvia Univ Agr, Dept Land Management & Geodesy, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Vytautas Magnus University; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Sudoniene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Water & Land Management, Dept Land Management, LT-53361 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilma.sudoniene@nzt.lt; wilmasu@gmail.com; velta.parsova@vzd.gov.lv,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,5,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,469,474,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500081,0

This paper aims to investigate the effect of chilling, pre-heating, UHT, reprocessing and H(2)O(2) individually and in combination on the survival of B. sporothermodurans in broth. Design/methodology/approach - Standard plate counts were conducted for all milk samples and isolates from UHT milk were characterised using PCR. BS vegetative cells and spores in broth were subjected to various stresses encountered, during UHT processing of milk. Survival counts were conducted after all treatments. Findings - B. sporothermodurans was detected in retail UHT milk packs from only one processor. UHT treatment at 140 degrees C for 4s eliminated B. sporothermodurans in broth. The combination of chilling and UHT was more effective in eliminating B. sporothermodurans spores than UHT treatment alone. H(2)O(2) was also effective in eliminating B. sporothermodurans spores after 15 min of exposure. The adopted real time (RT) PCR with SYBR Green method was effective for the confirmation of B. sporothermodurans.

It investigates whether indigenous peoples have agency in international negotiations and specifically the REDD design process and if so, how they have obtained it. Agency refers to the ability of actors to prescribe behaviour and to substantively participate in and/or set their own rules related to the interactions between humans and their natural environment. The aim of this study is to gain understanding of what role non-nation state actors, particularly indigenous peoples, play in shaping the REDD design process under the climate convention and what is shaping their agency. A special emphasis is placed on indigenous peoples as they may be highly vulnerable to the impacts from both climate change and certain policy responses. The article finds that, through REDD, indigenous peoples and forest community alliances are emerging in the climate regime but their agency in designing a mechanism on forest protection in a post-2012 climate regime remains indirect and weak. They are being consulted and invited to provide input, but they are not able to directly participate and ensure that their views and concerns are reflected in the outcome on REDD.","[Schroeder, Heike] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Trop Forests, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Schroeder, Heike] Univ Oxford, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Schroeder, H (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Trop Forests, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",heike.schroeder@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Schroeder, Heike/0000-0003-2342-2030",,,,,89,127,144,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Besides public demand, the private demand offers the opportunity to develop PES. The goal of this paper is to investigate the potential demand by firms for four ecosystem services from tropical forests: biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, scenic beauty, and watershed protection. Those are the four granted in the forest legislation and rewarded for in the PES scheme in Costa Rica. To explain stated willingness to invest WTI, we assess influential factors: expectations with respect to financial and non-financial benefits of investing in ecosystem services; experience with forest ecosystem services; firm attributes, like origin, sector membership, and size; and finally, perceived behavioral control. We sent a questionnaire to over 900 international and Costa Rican firms from different sectors. The low response rate of the survey of overall 6% can be explained by - in a business context - rather new topic of ecosystem services from tropical forests. The analysis showed that a firm's willingness to invest (WTI) depends on the origin of the firm. International firms are interested in buying certificates mainly for carbon sequestration; Costa Rican firms, for all four ecosystem services in the following order: watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and scenic beauty. Indirect and non-financial benefits are surprisingly important and can impede the development of ecosystem service markets. At the same time, the activities of intrinsically motivated green entrepreneurs in a financially oriented firm setting might be a prerequisite within a firm context for bringing such innovative topics as ecosystem services from tropical forests to the table.

In no other part of the world was the cotton industry situated on a coalfield, and the response of other parts of the world cotton industry to Lancashire's agglomeration advantages was dispersal in search of cheap water and/or labour power. Lancashire coal helped to shape the global pattern of cotton production.","[Balderston, Theo] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,,,,,,,,,142,16,19,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

But just how large a role did the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) play directly in this cycle? According to environmental industry participants in Mexico, while not meaningless, the NAFTA law and its implementation were not a major factor in directly driving environmental market growth. First, the environmental market grew only marginally higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) during 1995-2005. Second, it was largely two factors that paced the environmental market growth: an increase in certain domestic environmental programs that largely separate from NAFTA and an influx of foreign manufacturers into Mexico, some of which brought a higher standard of environmental operations with them. Drivers of environmental markets are both economic and regulatory, and in both instances, they are multifaceted, so that no one policy instrument or economic trend is solely responsible for major trends within the environmental industry. However, it is apparent that NAFTA has had some role in accelerating the evolution of environmental markets in Mexico, but arguably a lesser influence than it could have been. Notably, NAFTA had little impact on stimulating growth on the domestic environmental industry in Mexico as trade deficits increased during 1995-2005. The lesson for policymakers may be that trade agreements need some more active entity in assuring not just some uniformity in environmental standards and in the compliance with same, but also in the environmental industry capacity to meet those compliance objectives.","Environm Business Int Inc, San Diego, CA 92116 USA",,"Ferrier, G (通讯作者)，Environm Business Int Inc, 4452 Pk Blvd 306, San Diego, CA 92116 USA.",grant@ebimailbox.com,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Our results show that agricultural TFP growth accelerates in China after 1979 and in India after 1974, although China's agricultural sector clearly outperforms India's. The main explanation of these differentials is that agricultural growth in China benefited from more fundamental institutional and policy reforms in agriculture than India. There is some evidence that the transformation of industry in China was also important for agricultural TFP growth. Manufacture growth absorbed labor and reduced employment in agriculture, creating incentives for capital investment and technical change that kept output per worker in agriculture growing at high rates. Fewer changes in agricultural policies and in the dynamics of manufacturing in India resulted in slower growth in agricultural productivity, despite policy changes that accelerated economic growth in recent years.","[Nin-Pratt, Alejandro; Yu, Bingxin; Fan, Shenggen] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Nin-Pratt, A (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.ninpratt@cgiar.org,,"Fan, Shenggen/0000-0002-2658-4863",,,,,65,37,39,4,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

To this end, we designed a choice experiment representing the national park alternatives by the possible site and the possible improvements in environmental functions. Results revealed that respondents have strong preferences for the establishment of a national park per se. Furthermore, there are significant differences in taste parameters for the different sites, which cannot be explained by respondents' valuing the different functions differently across sites. Instead we explain the results with differences in regional and cultural preferences. We also performed a balanced split-sample test of anchoring effects and found clear evidence of this. We included a zero-bidder screening question prior to the choice set part of the survey instrument to improve WTP estimation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The Protocol stipulates accounting and reporting of GHG emissions and removals, such as energy use, industrial processes, agriculture, waste and net emissions resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities. Emissions reported according to the rules set by the Kyoto Protocol do not include GHG emissions outside a country's boundaries resulting from the production of imported goods or services. As a result, GHG accounts constructed according to the Kyoto Protocol reflect the GHG emissions resulting from the production system of a country, but not all the emissions resulting from the consumption of goods and services within the country. However. as previous studies demonstrate, a country's emission balance changes remarkably if emissions related to goods or services imported and exported are taken into account. Here, we go beyond the aforementioned studies which mainly focus on GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We assess, in a first-order approach, upstream emissions that result from LULUC activities outside a country while the produced goods are consumed within the country. In our study we focus on Austria's livestock system to elucidate the difference between production and consumption-related emissions accounting approaches. We study direct and 'hidden' (embodied) GHG emissions associated with Austria's bilateral trade in livestock and livestock-related products, based on the integration of full carbon accounting (FCA) and life cycle analysis (LCA).

Design/methodology/approach - A three-step procedure was used to develop the index. First, the dimensions of the index were identified through a literature review and interviews with retailers. Next, face-to-face interviews with retailers, food producers and regional development experts were conducted to define the best way to measure the index dimensions. Finally, a Delphi approach with an expert panel was used to determine the relative importance of the dimensions. The index was used to evaluate 278 food retailers from the province of Quebec in Canada. Data collection was conducted through store observation and interviews with managers or owners. Findings - The results reveal a weak level of commitment toward regional foods. Only a small group of retailers, 16 per cent of the sample analysed, adopted practices that demonstrated commitment toward regional foods. A lower level of commitment was observed among corporate stores and discount supermarkets. Research limitations/implications - The index provides an overview of retailers' level of commitment toward regional foods within a region. It is simple to use and the results are easy to communicate. However, further research is needed to validate the index dimensions and their relative importance. Originality/value - This is the first study to provide a means of measuring retailers' commitment toward regional foods based on their behaviour.","[Coderre, Francois; Boivin, Caroline] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Mkt, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Etaabaa, Idriss] UPA, DREPA, Longueuil, PQ, Canada",University of Sherbrooke,"Coderre, F (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Mkt, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",Francois.Coderre@USherbrooke.ca,,,Bombardier Chair of Brand Management,Bombardier Chair of Brand Management,"This study was sponsored by the Bombardier Chair of Brand Management.

Given dramatic changes in food consumption, and heightened public concern about health and obesity, there is a considerable need for research to understand better the factors affecting US FF consumption. This paper aims to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, logistic regression is applied to analyze the socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing the likelihood of consuming FF using United States Department of Agriculture data from the Continuing Survey of food Intakes by Individuals from 1994 to 1996 and the Supplemental Children's Survey of 1998. Findings - In general, the expected likelihood of FF consumption increases until around 20-30 years of age and then decreases; increases as household income grows until about $50,000-60,000 and then decreases; and decreases as household size grows. Further, males from the Midwest and South regions that live outside central cities in Metropolitan Statistical Areas have the highest likelihood of consuming FF. Originality/value - While much literature has addressed key questions about expenditure on food away from home, this study complements previous work by focusing on food items consumed from FF facilities in the 1990s. In addition, the results find highly significant and important (statistically and economically) interactions between the likelihood of FF consumption and age, income, and household size.","[Marsh, Thomas] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Fanning, Jasper] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Stiegert, Kyle] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Food Syst Res Grp, Fitchburg, WI USA",Washington State University; Kansas State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Marsh, T (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",tl_marsh@wsu.edu,,"Stiegert, Kyle/0000-0001-6835-6132",,,,,25,6,9,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to examine a possible framework for assessing a business's food safety culture. Design/methodology/approach - The literature on health and safety culture and organizational culture is examined and relevant components applicable to food safety are identified and discussed. Findings - A total of six possible groupings including: food safety management systems and style; food safety leadership; food safety communication; food safety commitment; food safety environment and risk perception were identified as culture factors that could contribute to food safety performance. These can form the basis for assessing food safety culture and how this may be done practically along with the creation of a positive food safety culture are discussed. Management is traditionally talked about in food safety but a distinction is drawn between this and food safety leadership. Originality/value - For the first time a method for, and the potential benefits from, assessing food safety culture is presented and this will be of value to auditors, environmental health practitioners and industry. Utilizing the suggestions in the paper could help improve compliance with third-party hygiene standards, and reduce the risk of food poisoning.","[Griffith, C.

The purpose of this paper is to compare the views of Russian consumers with those of consumers in European Union member states. Design/methodology/approach - A survey previously conducted in five EU member states was replicated using a Russian consumer sample (n = 460, SEM analysis). Psychological factors underpinning consumer evaluations of food risk management quality (FRMQ) were identified. A qualitative study (consumer focus group, n = 9) allowed for in-depth interpretation of the quantitative results. Findings - Russian consumers hold similar views to consumers in EU member states regarding their perceptions of what constitutes effective FRM practices. However, the perceived honesty of food chain actors was an important determinant of perceived FRMQ only for Russian consumers, who also perceived that they were primarily responsible for their own food-related health protection. EU consumers attributed more responsibility to food chain actors and the authorities. Research limitations/implications - The analysis compared Russian consumers with consumers in five different EU member states. The results cannot be extended to compare Russian consumers with the entire EU. Practical implications - An international risk communication policy is likely to be impractical, and should be developed at a national or regional level. Given that Russian consumers take personal responsibility for their own health protection, information needs to be provided to enable them to do so. Originality/value - To the authors knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of the determinants of perceptions of effective FRM held by Russian consumers with consumers from within the EU regulatory area.","[Frewer, Lynne J.; De Jonge, Janneke; Fischer, Arnout; Van Kleef, Ellen] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Popova, Ksenia] AN Bach Inst Biochem, INBI Inst, Moscow, Russia",Wageningen University & Research; Research Center of Biotechnology RAS,"Frewer, LJ (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",lynn.frewer@wur.nl,"van Kleef, Ellen/B-7789-2009; Fischer, Arnout R.H/B-9589-2009","van Kleef, Ellen/0000-0002-8797-6983; Fischer, Arnout R.H/0000-0003-0474-5336",EU [Food-CT-2004-506446 SAFE FOODS],EU(European Union (EU)),This research was supported by the EU Framework VI Programme Project SAFE FOODS - promoting food safety through a new integrated risk analysis approach for foods (EU Contract Food-CT-2004-506446 SAFE FOODS).,,46,16,18,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, the assessment of social welfare in terms of genuine savings (or changes in total wealth per capita) is arguably too limited. This paper tries to make a case for the incorporation of subjective well-being measures in debates about sustainable development by exploring the macro-level relationship between subjective well-being and natural capital in a cross-country setting. It is tested whether natural capital per capita is correlated with subjective well-being in a sample of fifty-eight developed and developing countries, using natural capital data from the World Bank's Millennium Capital Assessment. Bivariate regressions indicate that it is. When multiple regression models are estimated that include (a) major country-level determinants of subjective well-being (GNI per capita, social capital, income distribution, unemployment, inflation), and (b) regional dummy variables for ex-Soviet Union and Latin American countries, the positive correlation remains. The role of data outliers is carefully explored, and the sensitivity of the results to the use of alternative subjective well-being measures (i.e. life satisfaction, happiness, and a combined life satisfaction and happiness index) is investigated. This does not change the nature of the results. The findings arguably strengthen the case for a 'new welfare economics of sustainability' that takes subjective well-being measures into account.

Based on a review of the literature we propose that research up till now has made use of four distinct system boundaries: the firm, markets, production and consumption systems, and economic systems. Making these boundaries explicit is helpful in interpreting the mixed results that have been obtained. We describe the consequences of the choice for each of these system boundaries: and look at implications for innovation. We also argue that the production and consumption system boundary offers potential for further advances in the field and deserves more attention in future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This has been reflected in the very way it shaped the modern idea of development which, more and more, has been represented in monetary terms to the point of being equated to chrematistic growth altogether. This reductionism has been severely criticized for various reasons, mostly related to the ignorance of the complex, multidimensional, social. cultural and psychological motives and aspirations of human beings, ignoring as well crucial environmental and ecological dimensions within and by means of which the economic process unfolds. One fundamental early contribution to the re-conceptualization of the economic development process in terms of well-being from a systemic perspective came about with the Human-Scale development approach (H-SD) in the 1980s. Central to this paradigm is a systemic re-conceptualization of human needs and an attempt to place this discussion at the centre of the development debate. It suggested a recovery of the oikonomy in its original classical meaning, as a means for achieving better well-being beyond the chrematistics narrow scope. This theory presents a very wide outlook for its theoretical and practical applications and in this paper we will try to build on H-SD's original contribution. We begin this by briefly outlining what can be termed the chrematistic turn within both modern economics' theory and practice at the dawn of modern capitalism. In the second section the main aspects of the H-SD approach are briefly presented and discussed. The last sections are devoted to propose some methodological extensions to the original H-SD version suggesting innovative ways of enlarging its scope through the development and improvement of its evaluation tools. Thereby we hope to enhance its application within its traditional context as well as indicating means for applying it to other fields as development policies, strategies or eventually, appraisal of new technologies.

With many ecosystems worldwide under mounting stress, countries may be increasingly interested in knowing the extent and origin of their ecological imports and dependencies. In this paper the Ecological Footprint is used as a tool to measure the biophysical (as opposed to financial) value of international trade flows. This paper attempts to answer the following question: How large of an Ecological Footprint does a given country exert inside the borders of each of its trading partners? Records in the UN COMTRADE bilateral trade database are multiplied by a matrix of per-product Footprint yield coefficients to translate from values in dollars and tonnes to units of hectares. The results show that the largest interregional flows are from Latin to North America, and from North America to Asia-Pacific. Grouping countries by GDP, high and middle income countries appear in Footprint terms to trade predominantly with other high and middle income countries and much less with low income countries.

This induced the adoption of more capital-intensive production methods in Britain and a faster rate of technological progress, so that competitive advantage had begun to shift in Britain's favour by the late eighteenth century. However, the completion of the process was delayed until after the Napoleonic Wars by increasing raw cotton costs, before supply adjusted to the major increase in demand for inputs.","[Broadberry, Stephen; Gupta, Bishnupriya] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Broadberry, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,,99,56,60,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

It focuses on the norms underlying the criteria and the community constructed on the basis of them. The theoretical approach here rests on a discussion of these norms and on their constitutive role. This role creates a community and gives an institutional basis for the global public domain. Accordingly, different norms create the network on which environmental governance is based. It is assumed that commonly accepted criteria form a common norm. The article analyses eleven criteria and indicator systems and compares the criteria adopted. Eight were created for biofuels and bioenergy and three are used in forest certification. Comparison reveals that the criterion aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is used in Northern systems, whereas commonly accepted environmental criteria are biodiversity and minimization of pollution. The web of norms on which biofuel production and trade is based comprises environmental norms together with the general norm of sovereignty and the norms of the market economy.","Univ Tampere, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Tampere 33014, Finland",Tampere University,"Palmujoki, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Tampere 33014, Finland.",eero.palmujoki@uta.fi,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

During the twentieth century, two types of actors cleared that forest: native Amazonians and outside encroachers. Of the two actors, we know more about what drives outside encroachers to clear forest than about what drives native Amazonians to clear forest. The past research focus has served well because during the twentieth century outside encroachers cleared most of the Amazonian forest. But the past research focus needs to be expanded because native Amazonians are claiming de jute stewardship of the forests they inhabit, and with tighter jurisdiction over those forests will likely come changes in the amount of forest native Amazonians clear. Prior research in rural areas of low-income nations suggests that household income affects household forest clearance. To estimate the effects of household real income on the total forest area (old-growth + fallow) cleared by households we use a panel composed of five annual household surveys (2002-2006, inclusive) from 324 households of a native Amazonian society in Bolivia (Tsimane'). We control for household and village fixed effects and use an instrumental variable for household income. We find positive and significant household real income elasticities of forest clearance of 0.35 and 0.47 and an increase in forest clearance of 5.3%/year. The main finding stood up well to sensitivity analysis. These estimates suggest that in the near future, the forest in the Tsimane' territory will likely face increasing pressure from the Tsimane' themselves, not just from outside encroachers.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the case of Sweden and interviews with the primary grocery purchaser in 300 households who have visited an ICA store (a Swedish supermarket chain) within a time period of the previous 30 days before the interview. Findings - The study shows that there is a correlation between perceived quality and the price customers are willing to pay for private label products. Results also show that there is a strong correlation between perceived value of private label products in specific categories and the stores' overall product variety image. The study further supports the assumption that store loyalty is influenced by the perceived value of the grocery retailer's private label products. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to Sweden and to only one retail chain. Also, it is an attitude- and survey-based approach rather than based on observation or actual spending data. Practical implications - The results will guide retailers if and how they are fulfilling their ambitions regarding their private label merchandises. The study could provide manufacturers and consumer organizations an insight into how consumers respond to this new phenomenon. Originality/value - It is a report beyond the dominating empirical research contexts of the UK and USA. From a conceptual point of view, the paper adopts a more holistic approach investigating the four major retailer motives simultaneously.","[Anselmsson, Johan; Johansson, Ulf] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Anselmsson, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",johan.anselmsson@fek.lu.se,,,,,,,46,22,25,4,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a survey questionnaire using a sample of Thai food-manufacturing firms. The three-part questionnaire was mailed to managers performing food-safety management activities in 480 firms. A total of 217 questionnaires were returned, with a response rate of 45.2 percent. Findings - The results of hypothesis testing indicated that the adoption of a food safety management system can be significantly predicted by: expected gain of social legitimacy; expected gain of economic competitiveness; perceived importance of external stakeholders (government, community, food safety organizations, and media); top management commitment to food safety; firm size and amount of export sales. It can also be predicted by the extent to which firms exchange food safety knowledge with other stakeholders. Practical implications - The results of the study suggest that the Government should formulate food safety policies in favour of educating senior managers in the potential benefits of food safety management systems for their firms. In addition it confirms the importance of Government information dissemination on the successful adoption of such systems and the need to focus Government resources on assisting smaller firms. The findings present evidence of the commercial benefits of system adoption.

Design/methodology/approach - There were six phases, which included designing food baskets, consultation with local residents and a shop survey. Recognising the cultural make-up of the borough food baskets and menus were developed for four key communities, namely: White British, Black Caribbean, Turkish, and Black African. Three areas were identified for the study and shopping hubs identified with a 500-metre radius from a central parade of shops. Findings - The findings paint an intricate web of interactions ranging from availability in shops to accessibility and affordability being key issues for some groups. It was found that in the areas studied there was availability of some key healthy items, namely fresh fruit and vegetables, but other items such as: fresh meat and poultry, fish, lower fat dairy foods, high fibre pasta and brown rice were not available. Access was found to be defined, by local people, as more extensive than just physical distance to/from shops - for many shopping was made more difficult by having to use taxis and inconvenient buses. Small shops were important in delivering healthy food options to communities in areas of deprivation and were judged to offer a better range and more appropriate food than the branches of the major supermarket chains. Research limitations/implications - The importance of monitoring the impact of shops and shop closures on healthy food availability is emphased. From a policy perspective the findings suggest that approaches based on individual agency need to be balanced with upstream public health nutrition approaches in order to influence the options available. Originalty/value - The paper is arguably the first to examine and dissect the issue of food availability and accessibility in the inner London borough in question, especially in the light of its proposed redevelopment for the London Olympics in 2012.","[Caraher, Martin] City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Bowyer, Sarah] Leeds Metropolitan Univ, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England; [Eilbert, Kay] Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust, London, England; [Carr-Hill, Roy] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",City University London; Leeds Beckett University; University of York - UK,"Caraher, M (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1V 0HB, England.",m.caraher@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,18,21,1,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea), especially mealybugs, are major pests of pineapple plants throughout the world, but very little is known of scale insects that occur in Espirito Santo. This study was done to determine what species of scale insects occur on pineapple and other plants in Espirito Santo in order to obtain a better understanding of the potential pests of pineapple (and other crops) in this State. Insects were collected on pineapples and other plants from various locations throughout the State from 2003 to 2006. Coccoidea were identified from about 200 plant samples representing at least 30 species of 20 plant families (mainly of tropical fruits and ornamentals). 11 scale insect species that are potential pests of pineapple were recorded for the first time in the State: Aspidiotus nerii, Diaspis boisduvalii, Diaspis bromeliae, Melanaspis smilacis, Pinnaspis strachani, Pseudaonidia trilobitiformis, Unaspis citri, Coccus viridis, Phenacoccus madeirensis, Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi, and Pseudococcus longispinus. Other scale insects found that are known as potential pests of pineapple were the following: Dysmicoccus brevipes, Dysmicoccus grassii, Ferrisia virgata, Planococcus citri, Planococcus minor, Pseudococcus viburni, and Praelongorthezia praelonga. Although at least 18 scale insect species known as potential pineapple pests are present in Espirito Santo State, only Diaspis boisduvalii, Diaspis bromeliae, Dysmicoccus brevipes, and Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi were collected from pineapple pants and currently only Dysmicoccus brevipes is known as a major pest of pineapple crops in the State. Information obtained in this study provides a basis for development of integrated pest management methods for pineapple crops in Espirito Santo State.","[Culik, M. P.; Ventura, J.

The second phase consisted either by interviewing or inspecting the field conditions performed with pineapple growers or farm managers and with experts familiar with the level of adoption of the technologies related to integrated pineapple production. During this phase a system weighing matrix was filled out creating partial index and impact aggregates. In this evaluation eight of the fifteen farmers engaged in the project were interviewed, all of them within the same level of adoption of the integrated production technology, as well as three experts linked to the project. The third phase dealt with the analysis and interpretation of those indexes. The evaluation of social impacts included four aspects related to the impact characterization: employment, income, health and administration management. The aggregated index of the social impact of the integrated pineapple production technology in the State of Tocantins showed a positive value equal to 3.65 on a scale ranging from -15 to +15.

Higher investments towards irrigation and fertilization could significantly increase the productivity obtained in pineapple fields of Tocantins, where this crop is of great economic importance since it generates thousands of jobs as well as increases the income of small, intermediate and large pineapple growers. The use of adequate production technology has enabled pineapple growers to program harvest for periods of low fruit offer in the Brazilian market, resulting in higher fruit prices and income for the growers. In general, the pineapple fields of Tocantins occupy low fertility soils with low aggregated land value. Most of the pineapple produced in the State is sold on fresh fruit markets all over the country.

It also aims to consider policy implications for food exporting countries. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory approach using in-depth interviews was adopted. Key informants of a sample of 20 companies in five main commercial centres in the People's Republic of China and in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were interviewed. In addition, two interviews were conducted with a key government official and a professor at a leading agricultural university in order to provide details of Chinese Government policy. Findings - According to gatekeepers, Chinese consumers currently have ambiguous views of GM food products. It is concluded that Chinese consumers are likely to accept GM foods provided there are consumer benefits, a price advantage, and credible governmental information concerning safety of GM foods. Research limitations/implications - Chinese Government policy is to take advantage of a window of opportunity provided by markets such as Japan and Europe, which presently prefer to import non-GM food; at the same time China is developing full potential to grow GM Crops just as soon as external market conditions change. Cur-rent barriers to export of GM food products to China are likely to be short-term.

Not only do bribes provide a direct incentive that can suppress testimony, they also signal a greater likelihood of retaliation and hence serve ass implicit threats to witnesses.

In many situations, greater media effectiveness can improve the administration of justice, even when more obvious improvements in judicial effectiveness cannot.","[O'Flaherty, Brendan] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sethi, Rajiv] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"O'Flaherty, B (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",bo2@columbia.edu; rs328@columbia.edu,"Sethi, Rajiv/AAH-3961-2020",,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-941-1,STAT SCI INTERDISC R,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,145,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Mathematics,BMY19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273874600007,0

There have been many papers which have compared the costs of attaining environmental objectives with MBIs and with command and control instruments. However very few have compared different MBIs in examining these costs. This paper seeks to analyse various MBIs for CO2 mitigation from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness, using an AGE (applied general equilibrium) model for the case of Spain. A distinction is drawn between (1) quantity instruments, which represent different extents of a market for emission permits; and (2) price instruments, which represent different types of tax. Each instrument can affect different segments of the emission sources and therefore can have very different effects on the economy as a whole. We show how MBI can help to minimise mitigation costs, but also how taxes and tradable emission permits that are limited or constrained by many exemptions and distortions can raise costs considerably.

Here we investigate, at the national level, the ideal design and expected net benefits of a risk assessment program for evaluating the desirability of nonindigenous species imports. We show how to enhance the statistical rigor of such a system by correcting a common non-random sampling problem encountered in the data. This correction enables model output to be interpreted in an economically relevant way and facilitates a theoretically rigorous characterization of the balance between trade and nonindigenous species establishment risk. Using reptiles and amphibians imported to the U.S. as a case study, we characterize economic outcomes over a range of cases and demonstrate substantial expected returns to such a screening program, relative to the current effectively open-door policy. Our results are informative for the current debate in the U.S. about whether to require federal agencies to apply risk assessment before allowing a species for import. The framework presented decomposes a complex argument about risk management into component economic and statistical parts, allowing for debate and improved understanding over each element to inform the overall program in a transparent fashion.

It shows that ROCE was generally below the cost of capital after the mid-1870s and fell until the turn of the century. Addressing cost inefficiency issues could have restored ROCE to an adequate level in the late 1890s but not in 1910. Declines in ROCE hit share prices and investors made little or no money in real terms after 1897.

The article discusses how growth of settlements polluted waters and created pressure to adopt local institutional responses and networked water supply and sewerage technologies in the mid-19th century. However, the new urban technologies undermined local institutional responses and expanded the scale of water pollution problems they were expected to resolve. Water companies, households and local governments litigated their water pollution conflicts in the courts in the absence of other alternatives. In the end of the 19th century, many states adopted water pollution policies. At first. public health authorities enforced the new policies to protect public water supplies from sewage contamination. However, when the effectiveness of filtration and chlorination of drinking water was demonstrated in the early 20th century, public health authorities ceased to enforce discharge prohibitions and instead pressured water companies to adopt the new technological measures to protect public health.

The article is based on the collection of extensive new data indicating different trends in draught power availability and the efficiency of its use in different countries of Europe. This article shows that the proposition does not hold, and demonstrates that, although towards the end of the nineteenth century England had relatively high numbers of draught animals per agricultural worker, it also had low number of workers and animals per hectare, indicating the high efficiency of muscle power, rather than an abundance of such power. The higher efficiency was related to a specialization on less labour-intensive farming and a preference for horses over oxen.","[Kander, Astrid] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Lund University; University of East Anglia,"Kander, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,,92,23,23,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach - Data from a convenience sample (n = 129) were quantitatively analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, and correlations. Findings - Tourists tended to be neutral on most attributes in selecting foodservice establishments. Key attributes included familiarity with food products for selecting international franchised restaurants, location and desire to experience authentic Thai food from locally owned restaurants, and location for eating establishments at accommodation facilities. Based on sanitation concerns, tourists lacked confidence in selecting any type of establishments, especially street vendors, and awareness of the Clean Food Good Taste (CFGT) Program was low. Tourists' perceived overall sanitation standard in Thailand correlated with their selection of locally owned restaurants and street vendors. Research limitations/implications - Convenience sampling is used due to the transient nature of the population. The English language questionnaire excluded tourists from Asian countries whose cultures are similar to Thai. Generalizability and interpretation should be approached with caution. Nonetheless, this study should bring new interest for future research, addressing tourist consumption behavior pertaining to food safety practices and food tourism in Asia. Practical implications - Suggestions are made for foodservice operators to better attract tourists and for promoting the CFGT Program. Increased awareness of the program could result in a lower number of tourists affected by foodborne illnesses and could help to promote tourism. Originality/value - The paper is useful to both practitioners and academicians interested in tourist consumption behavior, food safety, and food tourism by revealing initial insight into how and why tourists select foodservices in unfamiliar environments.","[Binkley, Margaret] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Burusnukul, Pattarapong] Texas Tech Univ, Nutr Hosp & Retailing Dept, Hospitality Program, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Sukalakamala, Piyavan] Johnson & Wales Univ, Hospital Coll, Charlotte, NC USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Binkley, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",binkley.62@osu.edu,"Binkley, Margaret/H-6933-2012; Zhou, Yu/HTN-8810-2023",,,,,,35,12,13,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

On the contrary, the decrease of ratio between the increase of the indices of the price of the agricultural products and those of the industrial ones bought by the farmers led to the price growth of the inputs which caused a low productivity in comparison with other countries, especially those that are of the E.U. members which represent the model to be followed. The rural area belonging to the NE Region from the administrative point of view gathers the characteristics of not less than 463 parishes and 2445 villages in the counties of Bacau, Botosani, Iasi, Neamt, Suceava and Vaslui, where an approximate of 2,171,838 inhabitants live, that is 56.6% from the population of the region. (Romanian Statistic Yearbook, INS, 2010). The agrarian market reform in Romania hasn't managed to solve the imbalances created between supply and demand. That is why the prices of the agricultural products are inferior to the prices representing the agricultural inputs. The present objectives of the agricultural policies in Romania consist in the increase of the contribution of this branch to the durable economic development in order to ensure the compatibility and competitiveness of the Romanian agricultural products with the ones in the E.U. members. Socially and economically, it is known that agriculture contributes to the welfare of the population especially from the countryside through a supplementary source of income and the proper use of the natural and human resources. The present study aimed at identifying the impact that different factors have on the efficiency of agriculture and implicitly on the economic efficiency and calculated the coefficient of the agricultural concentration and specialization of the north-east region to see the direction of production in this area.","[Ciurea, Ion-Valeriu; Ungureanu, George; Mihalache, Roxana] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Iasi, Fac Agr, Dept Econ, Iasi 700490, Romania","Iasi University of Life Sciences, Romania","Ciurea, IV (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Iasi, Fac Agr, Dept Econ, Iasi 700490, Romania.",ivciurea@uaiasi.ro; ungurgeo@uaiasi.ro; roxxanac@yahoo.com,"UNGUREANU, George/JEP-3348-2023",,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,1,,,,,275,278,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM57,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304706000043,0

Design/methodology/approach - The outsourcing of four levels of logistics activities is investigated: transportation (level 1), packaging (level 2), transportation management (level 3), and distribution network management (level 4). A structured questionnaire was designed and sent to logistics managers in The Netherlands and Taiwan to evaluate the most commonly outsourced activities and identify specific outsourcing firm's characteristics. Findings - About 69 per cent of the companies, in both countries outsource level 1 activities, 16 per cent level 2, and 37 per cent level 3 activities. Only few companies (about 10 per cent) outsource the highest level of activities. In particular, The Netherlands has higher percentages for levels 1 and 3. This might be caused by the fact that most Taiwanese companies emphasise low cost whereas the Dutch companies focus on flexibility in order to deal with higher complexities. When intentions for the future are included, Taiwan is planning to outsource level 2 (40 per cent) and level 4 activities (36 per cent) much more than The Netherlands (respectively 13 and 17 per cent). When zooming in, it was found that outsourcing strategies of companies in the subsectors differ. For instance, the dairy sector outsources more frequently than the meat sector on the first three levels. This might be caused by the fact that meat companies emphasise food quality, whereas dairy companies emphasise flexibility and reliability. Research limitations/implications - This study investigated only food processors. The paper suggests further research should include other types of food organisations. Originality/value - The paper provides valuable insights in outsourcing strategies of food processing companies in Taiwan and The Netherlands for advanced logistics service providers who are looking at the market potential of Taiwan.","[Hsiao, Hsin-I; Omta, S.

The dependence of heat conductivity in samples, formed at 26 - 40 MPa on absolute humidity, is linear, whereas, in samples, formed at less than 26 MPa, is nonlinear. The dependence of absorptive power on formation pressure belongs on the duration of samples keeping over water.

We estimate these distortions for 33 countries of the world using a newly compiled data set. We find that domestic distortions tend to be slightly more important than trade distortions. For the average country, revenues in the agricultural sector would be 26% higher if domestic distortions were eliminated, but 21% higher if trade distortions were eliminated.

Meeting these demands places increasing stress on Egypt's water institutions to support the country's need for food, urban, industrial, and environmental water uses. Many studies have examined measures to increase Egypt's effective water supplies or reduce its water demands. However, no research to date has examined economically efficient and culturally acceptable water institutions for improving the economic performance of Egyptian agricultural water use. The aim of this study is to examine the potential for irrigation water trading as a measure to improve the economic efficiency of Egyptian agricultural water use of the Nile River. Using data on Egyptian land, water, and agriculture, a catchment scale framework is developed to characterize hydrologic and economic impacts of limited water trading by irrigated agriculture while respecting hydrologic, environmental, food security, and institutional constraints. Results suggest that expanded water trading among Egyptian farmers could raise the economic performance of Egypt's irrigation water use. That improved performance could increase national farm income by 6.3 to 7.9% annually with little or no loss in water-related benefits outside agriculture. Worldwide, solutions to safeguard food production are needed fast. Institutionalizing currently informal water trading arrangements could be a prototype for measures to promote food and water security in Egypt and in other countries with similar water management challenges.

Backorder is one example of this system wherein firm produces the product after receiving an order from the customer and they represent a stark contrast to the traditional Make-to-stock (MTS) system where firm anticipates demand and satisfies it from finished inventory. The popularity of postponement is primarily attributed to the operational efficiencies that it can generate for a firm in dealing with highly uncertain and dynamic demand environments. Our focus in this paper is on understanding the implications of the interaction of demand uncertainty and consumer heterogeneity for the optimality of these different systems. We show that the combination of these two forces requires the firm to use both backorder and MTS simultaneously. The optimality of backorder depends on the extent of demand uncertainty-products that exhibit relatively higher demand volatility are better candidates for backorder. Importantly, the combination of the two systems has significant implications for the firm's product line decision (in terms of product qualities) and pricing.","[Che, Hai] Univ So Calif, Dept Mkt, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Narasimhan, Chakravarthi] Washington Univ, Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Padmanabhan, V.] INSEAD, Singapore 138676, Singapore",University of Southern California; Washington University (WUSTL); INSEAD Business School,"Che, H (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Mkt, Marshall Sch Business, 3660 Trousdale Way,HOH 513, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",haiche@usc.edu,"Che, Hai/AAA-6945-2019; Che, Hai/ABE-2597-2020; Padmanabhan, V./B-3659-2010","Che, Hai/0000-0002-4377-5514; Padmanabhan, Vineet/0000-0002-5571-839X",,,,,19,6,9,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We measure the technical efficiency of agriculture in natural forest peripheries and test the results from forest resource extraction. The study findings show that non-timber forest product extraction is a decreasing function of agricultural efficiency, hence producing a positive externality in the conversion of forest resources. This study also determines the level of efficiency improvement necessary to compensate the current income generated by non-timber forest products (NTFPs).

This article provides further evidence for the salience of culture through an in-depth case study of one of the fastest-growing economies in the world during the last 50 years-Botswana. The unique culture that developed among the Tswana before and during the early days of colonialism, which shared many features with those of western nation-states, appears to have contributed significantly to the factors widely seen as determinants of Botswana's post-colonial economic success: state legitimacy, good governance and democracy, commercial traditions, well-established property rights, and inter-ethnic unity. Neighbouring Southern African cultures typically did not exhibit these traits.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hjort, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,61,23,30,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The most attractive feature of this test is that it can not only be used for testing a non-nested model, but also still be applicable even when the general model is misspecified.

The limitations to building such systems are the practical limits on managers' time to develop or learn tools and the state of the science to support decision-making components. We address this question by applying a cost-effectiveness analysis framework and optimization model to support the targeting of restoration funds to control an invasive grass (Bromus tectorum) in agro-ecosystems The optimization aims to maximize benefits derived from a suite of ecosystem services that may be enhanced through site restoration. The model combines a spatially-varying cost function with ecosystem service benefit functions that are risk-adjusted to capture the probability of successful restoration We demonstrate that our approach generates roughly three times the level of ecosystem service benefits (as measured through indicators) compared to the current management strategy of selecting restoration sites that are superlative producers of one ecosystem service The results showed that spatial (GIS) data and ecosystem understanding were sufficient to formally capture the managers' informal decisions and that cost-effectiveness of restoration could be Improved by considering the ability of sites to jointly produce multiple ecosystem services and adjusting expected benefits by the probability of success.

It is argued that whether states' agriculture is in plantation style, based on cheap coerced labor, or organized around family farming matters for the formulation of educational policies. According to the main claim, landlords were not interested in paying higher taxes to educate the masses and curtailed the expansion of schooling in order to keep a cheap workforce and maintain their monopoly over the decision-making process. Describing several episodes in Brazil's history of public instruction, the paper stresses the distributional conflicts over education as well as the rural aristocracy's resistance towards broadly-targeted, citizenship-enhancing educational policies. The descriptive evidence is complemented by statistical analyses employing historical as well as more recent data. It is shown that states characterized by a more egalitarian land distribution, which are not under the dominance of powerful landlords, exhibit better educational coverage and enhanced instruction quality. They also spend more on schooling.","Univ Konstanz, German Inst Global & Area Studies, Dept Polit & Management, D-78457 Constance, Germany",German Institute of Global & Area Studies; University of Konstanz,"Wegenast, T (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, German Inst Global & Area Studies, Dept Polit & Management, Box D86, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",tim.wegenast@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,61,18,21,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

As of March 2009, isolated populations of emerald ash borer (EAB) have been detected in nine additional states and Quebec. EAB is a highly invasive forest pest that has the potential to spread and kill native ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) throughout the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of ash treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land within communities in a 25-state study area centered on Detroit using simulations of EAB spread and infestation over the next decade (2009-2019). An estimated 38 million ash trees occur on this land base. The simulations predict an expanding EAB infestation that will likely encompass most of the 25 states and warrant treatment. removal, and replacement of more than 17 million ash trees with mean discounted cost of $10.7 billion. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside, as well as inside, communities nearly double the estimates of the number of ash trees treated or removed and replaced, and the associated cost. The estimates of discounted cost suggest that a substantial investment might be efficiently spent to slow the expansion of isolated EAB infestations and postpone the ultimate costs of ash treatment, removal, and replacement.

During the last years business computing has changed from these basic local data administrative systems into international computer networks, and as the sophistication of the computer systems increased, so did the investment cost. So, traditionally, companies tend to perceive their IT-systems as costs, often due to IT being looked at as a support function. And user satisfaction in IT usage is critical because this construct is often viewed as a surrogate for IT success. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the body of knowledge about to what extent IT affects the ability to solve accounting tasks. We will measure the impact of IT on user satisfaction, on accounting information use and, finally, on accountants' tasks. The relationship between IT and accounting practices was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively, using a survey and six case studies. The findings suggest that user satisfaction in IT usage and the use of accounting techniques and accounting information increases with new IT investments.

The main objective is to identify the main factors affecting the implementation of traceability schemes, under the current supply chain structure and evaluate the theoretical framework identified in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - A specific executive research was conducted, including interviews with key representatives of the sector. The scope of the research was to collect qualitative data with the aid of an unstructured questionnaire with no close-ended questions. The research sample included 22 agricultural cooperatives and private packinghouses located in northern Greece where the core value adding activities of the fresh produce supply chain are taking place. Northern Greece is of high importance for the examined sector as a high percentage of all value adding activities, from production to distribution, are taking place within this region. Findings - In the fresh produce supply chains ephemeral dynamic collaborations prevail which do not allow particular transparency with regard to the exchange of information between their members. Severe inequities recognized between supply chain members regarding their ability to imply traceability systems effectively, their current technological and operational status and the availability to undertake the cost of investment in such systems. Tight profit margins and inadequate knowledge on potential benefits of traceability systems are reported as some of the main factors that hinder investments on sophisticated traceability schemes. Adequate labeling automation with the implementation of machine-readable labeling technologies and the introduction of web-based technologies as a low cost solution are estimated to improve fresh produce traceability and logistics efficiency. Originality/value - Within a limited number of research papers on fresh produce traceability, there is no reference to the Greek produce sector. Thus, this paper progresses knowledge of the Greek produce industry regarding perspectives and key drivers for traceability implementation, supported by the thorough review of the literature.","[Manos, Basil; Manikas, Ioannis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Manikas, I (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",manosb@agro.auth.gr,"Manos, Basil/AAO-6985-2020; Manikas, Ioannis/B-9754-2018","Manikas, Ioannis/0000-0002-4084-1651",,,,,29,43,47,1,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

First, there is a highly non-linear relationship between the cost of abatement required to be green and the share of green firms.

The linkages between the significant pressures on insect pollinators, their underlying socio-economic driving forces and responses, with the focus on Europe, are addressed in the study. A review of literature revealed the shortage of empirical studies that prove direct links between policy responses and specific pressures on the pollinators. Based on written evidence and expert judgement, land use practices and the use of agrochemicals were regarded as the most significant pressures on different functional groups of pollinators. As demonstrated in the study, agricultural and rural development policy has been the key driving force of these pressures. The application of the DPSIR framework proved to be useful in identifying the pathway of human pressures on pollinators. The study also concludes that there is further need for specific empirical research on the effects and effectiveness of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures (agri-environment measures in particular) to support farming practices that facilitate the protection of the environment and the prevention of pollinator loss.

This article presents two series of systematic data that together indicate the main contours of his indebtedness: (1) end-of-year deficits, and (2) hived-off debts which the Crown left unpaid for long periods (sometimes permanently). The hived-off debts, reconstructed individually, constitute a narrative of fiscal policy-making. Instead of a large and catastrophic bankruptcy, James in effect had numerous small bankruptcies. He benefited from an emerging structure of Scottish domestic credit. He eventually repaid many of his debts after succeeding to the English throne in 1603.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Goodare, J (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,68,5,6,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We show that this shock and its consequences were more important than neoclassical convergence and structural change in explaining the rapid growth of the West German economy in the 1950s. We find little support for the hypothesis of institutional shakeup.

While aggregate PPP holds well in the long run, sectoral deviations are persistent. It raises the need for a currency conversion factor at the same level of aggregation as the output that is compared. Mapping prices from household expenditure surveys into the industrial classification of sectors and adjusting for taxes and international trade, I obtain an expenditure-based sector-specific PPP. Using detailed price data for up to 8 years between 1970 and 1999, I test whether the sectoral PPPs adequately capture differential changes in relative prices between countries. They work well for agriculture and the majority of industrial sectors, but not for most service sectors and for manufacturing sectors that produce differentiated products. Using the most appropriate conversion factor for each industry, productivity convergence is found to be taking place in all but a few industries for a group of 14 OECD countries. The latter results are robust to the base year used for the currency conversion.","[Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",KU Leuven; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Van Biesebroeck, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",johannes.vanbiesebroeck@econ.kuleuven.be,"Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/GLV-0353-2022","Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/0000-0003-4144-5578",,,,,32,15,16,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The objective of the present work is to review the methods of aesthetic assessment of forest landscapes, which will help the implementation of visual-impact assessment in sustainable forestry. From the numerous techniques of landscape evaluation that have been devised in recent years, the expert approach techniques have dominated in environmental management practices and the perception-based approach in research. The non-market economic valuation techniques are essentially trade-off methods and not aesthetic assessments by themselves. Revealed preference methods, such as hedonic-price, use actual market choices of individuals to get their preferences towards non-market attributes, and stated preference methods, such as contingent valuation method, rely on surveys to get directly the individual's willingness to pay for the non-market attributes. Psychophysical preference modelling is a popular quantitative holistic technique of landscape evaluation and if used in combination with indirect aesthetic evaluation methods might create new standards and protocols for techniques of objectively estimating public perception of aesthetic quality and thus to enhance social sustainability in forest space.

The essence of these proposals is to provide financial benefits to developing countries proportionally to the amount of avoided emissions they achieve, i.e. output based. A paper published in Ecological Economics [Combes Motel, P., Pirard, R., Combes, J.L 2008. A methodology to estimate impacts of domestic policies on deforestation: Compensated Successful Efforts for avoided deforestation (REDD). Ecological Economics doi:10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.06.001.] aims to provide an alternative termed Compensated Successful Efforts (CSE). It suggests that financial benefits should be provided on the basis of developing countries' successful 'efforts' to reduce emissions from deforestation, i.e. input based. The CSE approach also differs from previous ones in relation to the definition of what should be Counted as avoided deforestation and how to estimate avoided deforestation. The present paper discusses the CSE approach and points out several shortcomings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two policies mandated in the 1990s changed this perception: National Health Insurance (NHI), which provides insurance coverage to all citizens, and a separation policy (SP) that forbids physicians from dispensing and pharmacists from prescribing drugs. The author finds that by providing an economic incentive to the previously uninsured elderly, NHI raised the probability that they would visit physicians, relative to their continuously insured counterparts. In particular, some previously uninsured elderly who once only visited pharmacists were more likely to also visit physicians after NHI was implemented. Following this, the SP made it more likely that all elderly patients would only visit physicians and buy drugs from on-site pharmacists hired by physicians-a result different than its policy goal.","[Chang, Kang-Hung] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chang, Kang-Hung] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Michigan State University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Chang, KH (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",changkan@msu.edu,,"Chang, Simon/0000-0002-2918-956X",,,,,13,2,2,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Two main features can be highlighted: modeling perspective and simulation results. The SMIO is a pioneering work in the application of this type of metropolitan input-output analysis to the real world by taking into account the spatial and industrial relationships of multiplier effects simultaneously within a metropolitan economic system. The simulation results show that job decentralization results in a serious spatial and industrial restructuring of the metropolitan economy, and that the SMA gains significant economic benefits from job decentralization, no matter where the job expansion takes place within the metropolitan region. Interesting to find is that job decentralization generates positive induced effects for all scenarios through a virtuous circle of production, income formation, and consumption, given suburbanized population, which is one of the economic reasons why jobs follow people.","Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Jun, MJ (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",mjjun1@cau.ac.kr,"Jun, Myung-Jin/AAG-9363-2019","Jun, Myung-Jin/0000-0002-4218-3074",,,,,54,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Intensive use of surface and ground water in irrigation has caused more than a 1 m decline in water levels and has affected the wetlands' ecological characteristics. Previous studies indicate that Sultan Marshes will need more water to restore viable ecological conditions. in this study, we analyze how economic benefits from agriculture and wetlands would be affected if moderate amounts of water were diverted from agriculture back to wetlands in the Deveh Basin. By estimating total and marginal costs and benefits associated with water diversions, we determined the optimum or economically-efficient amount of water diversion. When only direct-use values of the wetland (animal grazing, plant harvesting, and ecotourism) were included in the analysis, the optimum amount of water diversion to the wetlands was found to be 5.2 million m(3) year(-1) (165 L sec(-1)), which compares to about 62 million m(3) year(-1) (1,957 L sec(-1)) used in irrigation. When wastewater treatment benefits (an indirect-use value) were added, the optimum amount rose to 7 million m(3) year(-1). overall, the analysis showed that water diversion from agriculture to the Sultan Marshes is economically preferable.

For this purpose we combined classical contingent valuation with a closed-version of discrete choice method, where the protest responses have been removed. By using econometric analysis we obtained the value of willingness-to-pay and established its determinants. We also made an attempt to control for different biases that arise in such analyses. At last, we used the adjusted average individual value of willingness-to-pay to calculate the aggregate willingness-to-pay.

Nonetheless, the U.S. ranks relatively low on health care indicators. This paradox has been already known for decades. For example, the turning point comparing the U.S. and Canada was in 1972. Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP was higher in Canada than in the USA from 1960 until 1972. Since 1972 expenditure on health care has been higher in the U.S. than in Canada (OECD 2005a, Health data 2005, fourteenth OECD electronic database on health systems, date of release June 2005, last update 04/26/2005). The present study integrates the dispersed literature on spending and health care rankings and adds some statistical analysis to these studies. The evaluation of different factors influencing health care expenditure in the U.S. relative to other countries is restricted to a comparison with Canada. The U.S. and Canada are two countries that are sufficiently similar to make comparisons useful. The comparison of factors influencing health care expenditure in the U.S. and Canada in 2002 reveals that health care expenditure in the U.S. is higher than in Canada mainly due to administration costs, Baumol's cost disease and pharmaceutical prices. It is not primarily inefficiency in health care production but the dominant prevalence for free choice and own responsibility that explains the paradox of high expenditure on health care and low ranking on health care indicators.","Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Spithoven, AHGM (通讯作者)，Utrecht Sch Econ, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.spithoven@econ.uu.nl,"spithoven, antoon/AHD-5838-2022","Spithoven, Antoon/0000-0002-7889-5049",,,,,101,16,19,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

The paper is technically based on a critical analysis of the learning curve approach. Econometric estimation of learning and scale effects inherent to seven energy technologies were performed by the use of several learning curve specifications. These specifications permit to deal with some crucial issues related to the learning curve estimation which are associated with the problem of omitted variable bias, the endogeneity effects and the choice of learning indicators. Results show that dynamic economies from learning effects coupled with static economies from scale effects are responsible for the lock-in phenomena of the energy system. They also show that the magnitude of such effects is correlated with the technology life cycle (maturity). In particular, results point out that, 1) the emerging technologies exhibit low learning rates associated with diseconomies of scale which are argued to be symptomatic of the outset of the deployment of new technologies characterized by diffusion barriers and high level of uncertainty, 2) the evolving technologies present rather high learning rates meaning that they respond quickly to capacity expansion and R&D activities development, 3) conventional mature technologies display low learning rates but increasing returns to scale implying that they are characterized by a limited additional diffusion prospects.

Multi-criteria and social research techniques were combined, relying on social actors' involvement throughout the research work. The paper documents that participatory processes allowed to unveil framings, perspectives, values and interests, as well as understanding of the social and institutional context in which the waters are governed. The deployment of this methodological approach has in this case provided an extended diagnosis which was the starting point to explore non a priori foreseen management alternatives by the researchers. The methodological approach proved useful for problem structuring in a collective, flexible and iterative way, unveiling existing water management conflicts and their motivations, and improving the quality and effectiveness of the information exchange and the reflection process, among social actors, even if the whole process developed in a research setting rather than in a policy for real one. Participatory multi-criteria evaluation could in this case, contribute to identify policy options that could be better defended before all the social actors, including the general public, thus attempting to achieve shared ground. The paper suggests some methodological considerations for applying participatory multi-criteria evaluation based on the outcomes of the case study application. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A pluri-disciplinary standpoint,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Firms; Ecology; Nature; Responsibility; Stakeholders,CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; STAKEHOLDER; ENVIRONMENT,"The paper analyses the motives and consequences of including environmental protection in good managerial practices driven by a concern of responsible corporate behaviour. Corporate Social Responsibility is increasingly discussed in economics and management studies today. This idea is fairly recent and stems from a philosophical school of thought attributed to Hans Jonas, which says that nature must be preserved for anthropocentric as well as biocentric reasons. In this respect, the consequences that these two visions imply for men and companies will be developed. Corporate leaders often make use of this concept, which finds its origins in philosophy, in order to analyse the normative behaviour of their companies. In this respect we shall favour a jonasian interpretation. Hans Jonas will help us question the fundamental meaning of responsibility. We will attempt to investigate this meaning using CSR. More specifically, this article tries to answer the question: what exactly is corporate responsibility? Is it a mere concept currently in fashion, or is it a new structural approach which could indeed take responsibility into account in so far as long-term environmental preservation is concerned? In order to answer this question, we shall first propose a reading of stakeholders. This approach poses several problems when dealing with corporate responsibility regarding the preservation of nature. Secondly, we shall present a more detailed analysis of such corporate social responsibility and the problems it poses. The debate regarding action with the interest of its outcome and action in the interest of the action itself shall be the focal point of our discussion. This article will adopt a narrative and critical methodology. So as to achieve this goal, we propose to critically analyse theoretical paradigms and test them through case studies.

However, the empirical analysis of the determinants to environmental technological change has not received too much attention in the environmental/ecological economics literature and many open questions remain in this context. Based on a careful review of the literature, this paper argues that further analysis should address several issues at different levels: i.e., regarding the conceptual framework, the thematic scope of the studies, some methodological issues and other aspects related to the environmental policy variable. First, an integrated conceptual framework which takes into account the interplay between relevant variables influencing environmental technological change (i.e., factors internal and external to the firm and characteristics of the environmental technologies) and all the stages of this process, with a greater emphasis on the invention stage, should be developed. other aspects should then be tackled, including a focus on several themes (i.e., a greater attention to cross-sectoral technologies, the barriers to different types of environmental technologies, the international dimension of environmental technological change and environmental technological change in small and medium size enterprises), methodological issues (combination of case studies and econometric modelling) and several issues related to the environmental policy variable.

A low temperature regime, although insufficient, has been the main method of overcoming this challenge so far. Thus, methods preserving the quality and extending the shell life of minimally processed or fresh-cut produce are needed. This paper seeks to propose that honey could be used to preserve the fresh-like quality of minimally processed pomegranate arils and extend their shelf life. Design/methodology/approach - Manually extracted pomegranate arils were treated with water as control, 10 or 20 per cent diluted honey solution each for five minutes, then held at 4 degrees C for ten days. Changes in organoleptic and visual quality, softening, soluble solids content, pH, absorbance at 446 and 510nm, and total aerobic count were recorded during the ten-day storage period. Findings - The study found that honey solution dip treatments extended the fresh-like quality of minimally processed arils by delaying quality loss, microbial development, and pigment changes. Practical implications - The paper shows that honey dip treatment may be used, depending oil commodity, to preserve quality and extend the shelf life of minimally processed or fresh-cut produce in the food-processing industry. Originality/value - The study pays particular attention to minimally processed pomegranate arils, by adapting a potentially safe organic method, the use of honey dips.","[Ergun, Muharrem] KSU, Dept Hort, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Ergun, Nazan] Kahramanmaras Agr Res Inst, Kahramanmaras, Turkey",Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University,"Ergun, M (通讯作者)，KSU, Dept Hort, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",mergun71@yahoo.com,"Ergun, Muharrem/C-3089-2016","Ergun, Muharrem/0000-0002-0213-1245",,,,,23,24,25,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The conclusion of the FASRB was strongly supported by the international comunity, acting intensively in the Balkan region after the wars in the nineties. This Agreement is an example of positive development in managing of natural (i.e. water) resources in a post-war period. The different phases and aspects of drafting, negotiation, signature, ratification and implementation of the Framework Agreement on the River Sava Basin are presented here. The paper contains brief data on the geographical, historical and political features of the Sava River Basin, on the former Yugoslavia disintegration, on the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe's role in the proces of drafting the Agreement as well as on the Sava Initiative description. The paper also contains details on the goals, general principles, areas of cooperation, mechanism of cooperation, monitoring implementation dispute settlement, protocols, the Statute of the International Sava River Basin Commission and the dispute settlement provisions. A separate part of the paper comprises some details on the current status of cooperation in certain fields covered by the Agreement, including the status of (inland) navigation, with brief references on the FASRB implemenation in the Republic of Croatia. The efforts on the unification of the basic navigation rules, establishment, maintenance and improvement of the uniform waterway marking system as well as on the rehabilitation and development of the Sava River Waterway and development of the River Information Services are presented. The activities concerning water management issues such as the development of the Sava River Basin Management Plan, the establishment of a system of measures, activities, warnings and alarms in case of extraordinary impacts of the water regime caused by pollution or floods, ice occurrence, droughts and water shortages, the establishment of an integrated information system, as well as provisions regulating dispute settlement are highlighted.

The treatments Complete, - N, - P, - K, - Ca, - Mg, - S and - B were applied as nutrient solutions in plastic pots with 14 kg of purified beach sand and one pineapple plant as the experimental unit. The trial was set up in a randomized complete blocks design with six replications. Evaluations were done on fresh and dry weight, length and width of 'D' leaves, 'D' leaf area and number of leaves at forcing date and percentage of flowering in response to forcing. In addition, foliar concentrations of macronutrients and boron were determined. The deficiencies of N and K reduced fresh and dry weight, length, width and area of 'D' leaves at nine and 12 months after planting; that of Ca reduced fresh weight and 'D' leaf area at 12 months and the deficiencies of P, Mg, S and B did not significantly affect the leaf variables studied. At seven months after planting only N deficiency reduced leaf number and 'D' leaf area. The deficiencies of K, P, Ca and S accelerated flowering, while those of N and Mg delayed it. The appropriate and deficient concentrations in leaf dry matter at time of floral induction were, respectively: N = 14.8 and 6.6; P = 1.37 and 0.70; K = 23.0 and 11.6; Ca = 4.40 and 1.30; Mg = 2.30 and 0.90, S = 1.54 and 0.56 ( all expressed as g kg(-1)), and B = 20.0 and 5.6 mg kg(-1).","[Ramos, M.

To date, however, literature on the topic has been mainly theoretical and empirical studies of actual policy discussions have received less attention. This article contributes to the debate with a narrative policy analysis of interviews with members of Finland's Committee on sustainable consumption and production. Narrative policy analysis is suitable for complex policy cases. By tracing and comparing the different stories, non-stories and counterstories in the debate, the analysis clarifies the issue and paves the way for solutions. We found that it is common even among business and ministry representatives to criticize the current growth-bound economic system. From the perspective of narrative policy analysis, however, this critique only increases uncertainty and complexity in the policy field which, paradoxically, leads to a strengthening of the dominant growth stories. We suggest that constructing a complete degrowth story is essential for supporting democratic deliberation on sustainability. Robust institutional support for degrowth work together with research and experimentation are important milestones on the way. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to critically examine the methods and the results. We argue that the case studies literature, even when its results are specific and difficult to generalise, is a necessary source of empirical evidence about policy impacts and the factors responsible for these impacts, pointing to issues that are neglected in the theoretical and econometric literature such as the specifics of the innovation context and policy interaction effects. The paper states five synthesised findings and makes a plea for multi-method analysis. One other important synthesised finding is that the influence of market-based instruments on innovation (such as emission trading and taxes) is far weaker than assumed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the conditions under which cooperation can emerge has important implications for the design of resource management and wildlife conservation interventions. Incentive-based conservation approaches are being widely implemented, yet very few studies test the role of incentives in promoting cooperation in relevant developing country contexts. Using a common pool resource game, in four villages in Cambodia, we investigated how the level of within-group cooperation varies under different institutional arrangements, including opportunities for social approval, external enforcement of rules and individual and collective incentive payments. Our results demonstrate the significance of self-organisation, the ability to devise, monitor and enforce a set of rules, among resource users. Treatments which promoted self-organisation had the greatest effect in reducing individual extraction, achieved the greatest efficiencies and had the strongest interaction with group decision-making in reducing extraction. The effects of these treatments carried over to reduce extraction in subsequent treatments, irrespective of their institutional arrangements. These results suggest that policies designed to incentivise certain behaviour in local stakeholder groups may be more successful if they create opportunities for local decision-making.

This largely ignores both any potential offset to lower hours from higher hourly productivity and the fact that the 48-hour week was also introduced in almost all other industrialized nations (generally involving substantially greater reductions in hours). We examine the international context and the short-term impact on British productivity, focusing on three major export industries-coal, cotton, and iron and steel.

Within the EU, decentralised heat generation is of particular relevance for future climate policy, as its emissions are not covered by the EU ETS. We conducted a choice experiment concerning energy retrofits for existing houses in Germany. In the experiment, the approximately 400 sampled house owners could either choose a modern heating system or an improved thermal insulation for their home. We used standard and mixed logit specifications to analyse the choice data. We found environmental benefits to have a significant impact on choices of heating systems. However, they played no role in terms of insulation choices. Based on the estimated mixed logit model, we further obtained willingness-to-pay (WTP) measures for CO2 savings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is a general consensus that fisheries subsidies cause great harm to the resource by exacerbating the problems resulting from the common resource issues of fisheries leading to overexploitation of the resource through a new set of perverse incentives. Many now advocate that subsidies should gradually be terminated, and that capacity enhancing and fuel subsidies should be terminated immediately. On account of the global fisheries crises, highly subsidised fisheries and the anticipated reforms of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy this study aimed to estimate the impact of eliminating fisheries subsidies on various macro and micro economic variables pertaining to the regional economy of the Azores using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model based on a social accounting matrix. The simulation results suggest that reduction, and in particular, elimination of fisheries subsidies would have a substantial effect on the region, however, the negative social and economic effects would be largely confined to the fishing sector. Conversely, the augmentation of fishery subsidies would benefit the fishing sector with an overall adverse effect on the rest of the economy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article addresses that gap. Factors responsible for that sector's relative insignificance until the 1950s included a general tendency to slaughter rather than to treat sick animals, the absence of advanced medicines until the innovation of sulpha drugs and antibiotics, and difficult relations with the wider pharmaceutical industry. Thereafter output of veterinary medicines increased dramatically, arising from an exponential growth in the demand for intensively farmed poultry meat. Since the 1980s a decline in the use of drugs in agriculture has caused the industry to concentrate on the health needs of domestic animals rather than those of livestock.","[Corley, T. A.

Through two case studies in the Canterbury Region, we investigate the emergence of structured and deliberative participatory processes for decision-making in New Zealand. We particularly focus on the use of evaluative criteria and weightings in providing structure for stakeholder deliberations and clarity and transparency in decision-making processes. Some of the benefits of using criteria weightings to reflect individuals' priorities include their ability to bring out the various perspectives and preferences to start the deliberations and increase the understanding of other people's points of views and their knowledge to all of the stakeholders. We consider particular aspects of the New Zealand context, including the development of criteria specific to Maori interests. These case studies lead us to conclude that stakeholder participation in decision-making is beneficial and increasingly necessary to resolve the problems and tensions around the governance of Canterbury's water resources. They also demonstrate that there are numerous practical and systemic barriers that must be overcome if the potential is to be fully realised. We provide recommendations on how such participatory processes can be successfully implemented to produce meaningful and effective outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, a new long-term research program, the Earth System Governance Project, proposes several key issues to be examined: architecture, agency, adaptiveness, accountability, and allocation and access. The contributions to this special issue have focused on the analytical problem of agency. For example, they have examined newly emerging or understudied agents of global environmental governance, or offered a fresh assessment of agency in the context of existing governance mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism. This concluding article outlines several insights provided by the contributions to this special issue regarding four key questions underlying the study of agency in global environmental governance. First, they call attention to the ingredients or processes that characterize agency in the first place and thus distinguish actors from agents. Secondly, the authors highlight the differences among agents and how they interact with each other. Thirdly, they point toward variation in the ways that agents may acquire authority. Finally, the contributions to this special issue suggest that there may be several approaches to evaluating agency, with different consequences. Thus, taken together, the contributions to this special issue provide a starting point for broadening our understanding of agency in earth system governance.","[Dellas, Eleni; Pattberg, Philipp] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Betsill, Michele] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Colorado State University,"Dellas, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",eleni.dellas@ivm.vu.nl; philipp.pattberg@ivm.vu.nl; m.betsill@colostate.edu,"Betsill, Michele/GQY-4502-2022; Betsill, Michele/ABD-5548-2020; Pattberg, Philipp/J-4141-2012","Betsill, Michele/0000-0001-7090-904X; Pattberg, Philipp/0000-0003-1136-7791","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0810837] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,46,58,64,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Fishery managers, however, have limited control over most sources of marine and estuarine pollution and at best can only adapt to environmental conditions. We develop a bioeconomic model of optimal harvest of an annual species that is subject to an environmental disturbance. We parameterize the model to analyze the effect of hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) on the optimal harvest path of brown shrimp, a commercially important species that is fished in hypoxic waters in the Gulf of Mexico and in estuaries in the southeastern United States. We find that hypoxia alters the qualitative pattern of optimal harvest and shifts the season opening earlier in the year: more severe hypoxia leads to even earlier season openings. Failure to adapt to hypoxia leads to greater losses when the effects of hypoxia are more severe. However, rent gains from adapting fishery management to hypoxia are relatively small compared to rent losses from the hypoxia effect itself. This suggests that it is critical for other regulatory agencies to control estuarine pollution, and fishery managers need to generate value from the fishery resources through other means such as rationalization.

In this study biosphere-atmosphere interactions were investigated on a light loam soil (Calc(ar)i-Endohypogleyic Luvisol) in different managed grassland ecosystems of the Training farm of the Aleksandras Stulginskis University in 2009 within the frame of a European COST Project. The main objective of this investigation was to determine the impact of fertilizers, their rates and combinations on GHG emissions and productivity of abandoned, semi-natural grassland. Obtained results were compared with emissions from sown grassland. GHG emission measurements were run in June-September, when meteorological conditions were optimal for intensive plant and soil biota physiological processes, in absence of frosts stress. Results of this investigation will be compared to results of analogical investigations of natural, poor nutritional value swards not commonly used on the farms. Accounting for GHG emissions of grassland ecosystems may be important to evaluate and interpret fluxes measurements at regional and ecosystem levels.","[Balezentiene, Ligita] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Distr, Lithuania; [Klimas, Evaldas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Plant Crop & Anim Husbandry, LT-53347 Akademija, Kaunas Distr, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Balezentiene, L (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Distr, Lithuania.",ligita.balezentiene@asu.lt; evaldas.klimas@asu.lt,,,Agency for International Science and Technology Development Programmes in Lithuania,Agency for International Science and Technology Development Programmes in Lithuania,Research was carried in cooperation with ES COST ES0804 activity.

Producer-driven marketing (PDM) is defined as marketing by farm families of their own produce by developing and managing their own supply chains beyond the farm-gate. Family farms are defined as family operated farms. The framework used compared revenue, costs and uncertainty in various distribution channels. Design/methodology/approach - Six individual case studies were conducted using semi-structured interviews. The interview protocol included enterprise characteristics that contribute to the ongoing viability of the businesses. Findings - PDM was a feasible entry point for new brands and a profitable alternative to supplying generic product to the mainstream when costs were controlled. It is proposed that PDM was feasible in the context of Australian family farms where the distribution channel chosen reduces variability in the farm-gate price, captures the marketing margin and minimises negotiation costs, particularly the labour costs to find a buyer. Research limitations/implications - The feasibility assessment excluded the cost of acquiring new skills which may be significant. The entrepreneurs interviewed already possessed significant marketing and business skills and experience to produce and market a brand through alternative distribution channels. Practical Implications - Producers can potentially increase farm profitability where household labour and skills are available to market produce beyond the farm-gate. These implications are likely to be relevant in most developed countries, not just Australia. Originality/value - The phenomenon of producer-driven marketing is relatively novel in Australian agribusiness with no previous analysis of the profitability and long-term viability of such an approach in the Australian context.","[Broderick, Sherryl; Kristiansen, Paul] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Vic] Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of New England; University of New England,"Broderick, S (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",sbroder3@une.edu.au,"Kristiansen, Paul/X-6638-2019","Kristiansen, Paul/0000-0003-2116-0663; Wright, Vic/0000-0002-8284-3567",,,,,36,14,19,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These compounds are primarily found in fruits, and mangoes are an important source. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this work, the antioxidant activities of mangoes cultivated in three different ways were evaluated by their ability to capture free radicals using the DPPH radical. Findings - The results showed that the biodynamic mangoes had highest antioxidant activity in mature-green and ripe fruits, while for those of organic origin the antioxidant activity was highest in unripe fruits. The organic mangoes also showed highest values of phenolic compounds at all maturation stages. The mangoes from conventional crops had lower values for all parameters evaluated in this study than the organically and biodynamically cultivated fruits. Originality/value - This work brings an important contribution in the field of agriculture at a time when organic and biodynamic systems of cultivation are an alternative to the conventional system and that pollutes the environment and produces food that contains quantities of chemical contaminants that can damage the health of the consumer. The comparison in phenolic compounds content, flavonoids and antioxidant activity in biodynamic, organic and conventional systems is original and of great importance, showing that the ecological cropping systems are less harmful to the environment and promote improvements to the chemical composition of foods.","[Maciel, Leonardo Fonseca] Univ Fed Bahia, Fac Farm, Lab Pesquisa & Anal Alimentos & Contaminantes LAP, Salvador, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia,"Maciel, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Bahia, Fac Farm, Lab Pesquisa & Anal Alimentos & Contaminantes LAP, Campus Univ Ondina, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",lfmaciel@ufba.br,"Maciel, Leonardo/E-9297-2013; Miranda, Maria/D-4471-2014","Maciel, Leonardo/0000-0002-6990-5102;",CAPES,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The authors would like to thank CAPES for the financial support.,,49,28,30,2,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We review findings of PES impacts on forest cover, a proxy for forest-based ecosystem services. National studies conclude that PES has not lowered deforestation rates. Yet in northern Costa Rica, there is evidence of additionality for PH-related avoided deforestation. Moreover, sub-national studies of bi-directional forest cover change, along with farm-level interview data and an understanding of ground-based operations, demonstrate that avoided deforestation is an incomplete measure of PES impact. Sub-national case studies suggest PES is associated with agricultural abandonment and net gains in forest cover via forest regeneration and plantation establishment. Explanations include that forest regeneration has always been an accepted PES modality for some regions. Also, early PES cohorts have an implicit spatial correlation with pre-PES incentives focusing exclusively on reforestation. Without understanding de facto PES implementation, it is impossible to appropriately evaluate PES impacts or discern whether PES outcomes positive or negative are due to PES design or its implementation. This distinction is critical in refining our understanding of both the utility and limitations of PES and has some practical implications for PES-style REDD initiatives.

A contracting threshold hypothesis,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,GPI; Economic growth; Threshold hypothesis; Asia-Pacific region,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; TELL US; WELFARE; INDEX; ISEW; SCALE,"This paper argues that GDP growth in both developed and developing countries has associated costs that can outweigh the benefits and thus reduce sustainable well-being. This conclusion is based upon the findings of empirical applications of the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) to a range of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The studies conducted on seven Asia-Pacific countries indicate that, in the case of five of the seven nations, more recent GDP growth has reduced the sustainable well-being experienced by the average citizen residing within them. Moreover, the threshold point at which the costs of GDP growth outweigh the benefits appears to be contracting (i.e., occurring at a much lower per capita level of GDP). This paper therefore introduces a new contracting threshold hypothesis: as the economies of the Asia-Pacific region and the world collectively expand in a globalised economic environment, there is a contraction over time in the threshold level of per capita GDP. As a consequence, the threshold point confronting growth late-comers (i.e., developing countries) occurs at a much lower level of sustainable welfare than what wealthy nations currently enjoy. The consequences of this for developing countries are clearly significant and require a new approach to economic development.

This study investigated an approach for estimating the physical dimensions of the environmental externalities from a maize cropping system in oasis farming of the arid north-west of China, and the monetary valuation of these environmental externalities based on integrated process-based biophysical and economic models. The simulation results show that current farming practices cause 7854 Yuan/ha of groundwater recharge cost, 7696 Yuan/ha of water treatment cost, and 91 Yuan/ha of N2O mitigation cost. These costs lead to a social benefit-cost ratio of only 0.55, although the farmers' benefit-cost ratio was 1.85. A combination of adoption of recommended best management practices by farmers, and an increase in the water price to 1.1 Yuan/m(3) could maintain both the social and farmers' benefit-cost ratios above 1, but the costs of recharging groundwater were large in all cases.

The objectives of this paper are (i) to examine the Israeli pattern of medical care cost during the 12 months prior to death by gender, age, and chronic conditions, and (ii) to examine the implications of the results for the Israeli risk adjustment scheme. For the first objective, we used 12 month follow-up data on a cohort of decedents. For the second objective, we supplemented the data with a cross-section of enrollees (survivors and decedents in 2004). With regard to the first objective, we found that the broad Israeli patterns of cost match previous studies from other countries. With respect to the second objective, we argue that since the cost during the last 12 months of life is very high and is concentrated among relatively few persons, in order to prevent any adverse incentives caused by the combination of age-based risk adjustment and segmentation of end-of-life health care, death should be introduced into the existing retrospective risk-sharing arrangement.","[Shmueli, Amir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Hlth Management, Jerusalem, Israel; [Shmueli, Amir; Messika, David; Oberman, Bernice] Gertner Inst, Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Zmora, Irit] Clalit Hlth Serv, Tel Aviv, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Clalit Health Services,"Shmueli, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Hlth Management, POB 12272, Jerusalem, Israel.",amirsh@ekmd.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,14,13,14,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

However understanding why transaction costs occur and why they are small or large is also important for efficient policy selection and evaluation. Following an analysis of the organisational economics literature and reports of the extent of transaction costs for a number of environmental policies, three key influences to transaction costs in environmental policies are identified. These are the following: 1) the characteristics of the transaction for the environmental good: 2) the nature of the transactors: and 3) the current institutional environment and arrangements. These affect transaction costs to the government and all other parties influenced by a policy. Transaction costs occur due to actions of information collection and policy design, policy enactment and establishment, implementation and contracting, administration and monitoring, and enforcement. An interrogation of transaction cost influences reveals that: 1) the influence varies between parties and is affected by the actions and interactions of and between all parties to a policy: 2) how transaction costs are experienced varies across time; and 3) who experiences transaction costs depends on the policy itself. Future policy selection and refinement will benefit from empirical analysis of the causes of transaction costs. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It fills an important gap in the literature by modeling the endogenous location of open space. The article compares open space decisions made under a majority rules voting scheme with welfare-improving criterion and finds households tied to a location in space compete for public goods. Significant differences emerge between the two decision criteria, indicating that requiring referenda for open space decisions is likely to lead to inefficient outcomes. Specifically, many open space votes are likely to fail that would lead to welfare improvements, and any open space decisions that do pass will require amenities larger than needed to achieve the social optimum. The more dispersed and large the population, the larger the gap between the socially efficient level and the level needed for a public referendum to pass. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for PES to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential PES schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic-quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, PES systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers.

Where agricultural production was once paramount, it now competes with other ecosystem services such as carbon storage, rural amenity, and wildlife habitat. If rural areas are to be managed to produce this broad range of goods and services, then more diverse and complex management regimes are needed. This paper explores the literature on property rights before using a 'property rights bundle' approach in the UK uplands to (1) examine the distribution of property rights between stakeholders in a multi-resource system and (2) evaluate the effect of state intervention on the redistribution of property rights and the resulting management regimes. Private land owners were found to be the dominant type of property rights holder and private property the dominant management regime in the uplands of the UK. Government intervention has also created private-state regimes for some public goods such as biodiversity but common property management is still in its infancy with regards to ecosystem services and few stakeholders have claimant rights over resources. As a result, many stakeholders are unable to influence management to produce the goods that they want. A property rights perspective highlights that single management regimes alone are unlikely to manage land sustainably for both private and public goods. Instead, a complex mix of private, private-state and common property regimes are found to be emerging in this multi-resource system. These mixed management regimes have the potential to produce sustainable outcomes but only if the appropriate management regime is matched to each resource, if links are developed between each regime to deal with conflict and if mixed management is adaptable enough to cope with new and changing demands.

The latter represent more than 98% of the total industrial production in each Chinese province for the period 1991-2001. Through the use of the log-mean Divisia Index Decomposition method, the variations in province-level industrial SO2 emissions with regard to the 1990 baseline level are decomposed into the contribution from three components: scale, composition, and technical effects. The following analysis seeks to explain how trade openness affects aggregate industrial SO2 emission through its impact on the structural determinants for these three components of region-specific environmental variations.

The paper analyzes and assesses from technical, economic and environmental viewpoints different initiatives in the energy sector aimed at increasing energy efficiency in end-uses and reducing overall carbon emissions. The results are based on energy planning for five Italian urban areas sized at about fifty thousand inhabitants. The analysis has been developed with the aim of reaching generally applicable criteria suitable for evaluating the local energy policy contribution to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Several initiatives for the private and public sectors have been considered, such as: (i) the introduction of combined heat and power generation based on useful thermal demand, suitable for the industry and service sectors (swimming pools, large distribution organizations); (ii) generation of electricity from renewables (solar energy, biomass); (iii) thermal insulation of private and public buildings, such as schools; (iv) introduction of micro-combined heat and power generation in the residential sector. For each solution the primary energy reduction and the consequent reduction in GHG emissions have been evaluated and a feasibility analysis has been developed in order to assess the profitability of the investment. Great attention has been paid to the public sector, which has an important role in providing leadership and driving changes in other sectors; furthermore, a rational use of energy combined with the exploitation of country-based incentives is able to reduce the public administrative expenditure. The results show that local energy policy can give an important contribution to gas emission reduction targets, and underline the fundamental role of public sector initiatives.","[Arteconi, A.; Bartolini, C.

Design/methodology/approach - A Cobb-Douglas production function is estimated to discern the relative contribution of physical versus R&D knowledge capital in fostering productivity growth. The paper uses a balanced panel dataset and is based on pooled cross-sectional time series data for ten food and beverage manufacturing industries over the period 1994-2005. The methodological framework adopted in this paper is a cross-sectionally correlated and time-wise autoregressive model. Data employed in this paper are from Statistics Canada's annual survey of manufacturing industries and Canadian Socio-economic Information Management computerized database. Findings - The results show that food manufacturing productivity for ten food and beverage sectors is more responsive to physical capital than R&D knowledge capital. Some of the other determinants of labor productivity in food manufacturing included the contribution from university-educated workers. Originality/value - The paper is useful to both policy makers and academics in the research fields of R&D and productivity. It provides some interesting insights into the contribution of physical and knowledge capital to food manufacturing industry productivity.","[Carew, Richard] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agri Food Res Ctr, Summerland, BC, Canada; [Florkowski, Wojciech J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Griffin, GA USA",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Carew, R (通讯作者)，Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agri Food Res Ctr, Summerland, BC, Canada.",richard.carew@agr.gc.ca,"Florkowski, Wojciech/ABA-4946-2021",,,,,,38,2,4,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The model estimates the impact of managerial and environmental factors on efficiency simultaneously. A decomposition of the overall technical efficiency into two components, target efficiency and environmental efficiency, is derived. Estimation of target efficiency scores requires the solution of a single large non-linear optimization problem and provides both a joint estimation of target efficiency scores from all DMUs and an estimation of a common scalar expressing the environmental impact on efficiency for each environmental factor. We argue that if the indices on environmental conditions are constructed as the percentage of output with certain attributes present, then it is reasonable to let all reference DMUs characterized by a composed fraction lower than the fraction of output possessing the attribute of the evaluated DMU enter as potential dominators. It is shown that this requirement transforms the cone-ratio constraints on intensity variables in the BM-model (Banker and Morey 1986) into endogenous handicap functions on outputs. Furthermore, a priori information or general agreements on allowable handicap values can be incorporated into the model along the same lines as specifications of assurance regions in standard DEA.","[Olesen, O.

The first part deals solely with hospitals in state ownership, but the study moves later onto the problems of ownership relations as well. The question posed is why the SBC phenomenon is so general in the hospital sector (including specialist outpatient clinics and diagnostic or nursing establishments that operate as separate units). The study contains several references to Hungarian experience, but the subject is of a more general nature. The SBC phenomenon is not confined to the Hungarian hospital sector, nor to the socialist system, nor as a vestige of socialism during post-socialist transformation. Soft budget constraints inevitably develop in the hospital sector, even in capitalist market economies.","[Kornai, Janos] Coll Budapest, Inst Adv Study, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Kornai, Janos] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kornai, Janos] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Harvard University; Central European University,"Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Coll Budapest, Inst Adv Study, Szentharomsag U 2, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary.",kornai@colbud.hu,"János, Kornai/N-3078-2014",,,,,,34,14,15,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

It published its final report in November 2000 after 2.5 years of extensive studies, public hearings, and discussions. The report included recommendations that were expected by some to become internationally acceptable standards for the planning, assessment, design, construction, operation, and monitoring of large dam projects. However, to date, none of these recommendations have been either officially accepted by major international financial institutions, including the World Bank, or by a large number of national governments, including China and India, which are the world's top and third largest dam-building countries. Several factors have prevented their broad acceptance: (1) the World Bank lost its stake in the development of policy as the original scope of the review expanded from solely Bank-funded projects to cover all large dam projects in the world; (2), the World Bank was neither included in the secretariat nor did it provide Commissioners, thereby providing the Bank with an excuse not to accept the recommendations; (3) the Commission had the heavy tasks of carrying out both scientific study and developing policies, under serious time constraints, resulting in premature recommendations that were difficult to apply in the real world; (4) the character of the final recommendations was not clearly explained in the report, giving stakeholders unrealistic expectations.","[Fujikura, Ryo] Hosei Univ, Fac Humanity & Environm, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028160, Japan; [Nakayama, Mikiyasu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Chiba 2778563, Japan",Hosei University; University of Tokyo,"Fujikura, R (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Fac Humanity & Environm, Chiyoda Ku, 2-17-1 Fujimi, Tokyo 1028160, Japan.",fujikura@hosei.ac.jp; nakayama@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Fujikura, Ryo/M-9718-2013","Fujikura, Ryo/0000-0002-0742-0767",,,,,48,15,18,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A theoretical investigation and empirical evidence from Italy using NAMEA,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,NAMEA; Air emissions; Labour productivity; Sector value added; Capital stock; Environmental efficiency; Technological innovation,INNOVATION; COMPLEMENTARITIES; COMPETITIVENESS; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGY; IMPACT; BIAS,"In this paper we test an adapted EKC hypothesis to verify the relationship between environmental efficiency' (namely emissions per unit of value added) and labour productivity (value added per employee). We exploit NAMEA data on Italy for 29 sector branches and 6 categories of air emissions for the period 1991-2001. We employ data on capital stock and trade openness to test the robustness of our results. On the basis of the theoretical and empirical analyses focusing on innovation, firm performances and environmental externalities, we would expect a positive correlation between environmental efficiency and labour productivity - a negative correlation between the emissions intensity of value added and labour productivity - which departs from the conventional mainstream view. The hypothesis tested is a critical one within the longstanding debate on the potential trade-off or complementarity between environmental preservation and economic performance, which is strictly associated with the role of technological innovation. We find that for most air emission categories there is a positive relationship between labour productivity and environmental efficiency. Labour productivity dynamics, then, seem to be complementary to a decreasing emissions intensity in the production process. Taking a disaggregate sector perspective, we show that the macro-aggregate evidence is driven by sector dynamics in a non-homogenous way across pollutants. Services tend always to show a 'complementary' relationship, while industry seems to be associated with inverted U-shape dynamics for greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides. This is in line with our expectations. In any case, EKC shapes appear to drive such productivity links towards complementarity. The extent to which this evidence derives from endogenous market forces, industrial and structural change, and policy effects is discussed by taking an evolutionary perspective to innovation and by referring to impure public goods arguments.

We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to (sic)153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between (sic)190 and (sic)310 billion based upon average price elasticities of - 1.5 to - 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about (sic)50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged (sic)151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged (sic)761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories - namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.

It is defined as software that embodies SNF-compliant specification models. SNF-compliant specification models restrict the conceptual database schemas to only the ontological assumptions of a business domain. These ontological assumptions are informed by the SNF theory - a semantic theory whose essence is a simple surrogate structure. From this simple structure the schema of any business system is constructed. To date, projects that have deployed SNF-compliant systems in business have used conventional software engineering approaches for implementation. In this paper we compare and contrast two unconventional approaches to the implementation of SNF-compliant software: SNF Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and SNF Native Technology (NT). Both promise to expedite the development of SNF-compliant business software.

Design/methodology/approach - The decision structures of various age groups of wine consumers were explored by means of laddering inter-views, a technique drawn from means-end chain theory, to reveal consumers' attribute-consequence-value chains. Findings - The results reveal that wine consumers perceive an emotional benefit from drinking wine and that this varies with the age of the consumer. The degree of abstraction in the cognitive process involved in the perception of this benefit increases inversely with the age of the consumer. Older people report less complex decision-making processes. In general terms, consumers drink wine for the sensory pleasure it gives, but younger drinkers are also motivated to drink it for reasons relating to cultural identity and social status, while older generations focus primarily on the potential of wine as a social catalyst.

The paper considers arguments from the literature that differences in consumer attitudes and behaviour between the two markets may be the determinant of the success, or otherwise, of the large US and European supermarkets. Design/methodology/approach - A review of literature about Western and Japanese retailing is followed by an account of exploratory empirical research into Japanese consumer grocery purchasing and consumption behaviour. Findings - The results support an argument that the large store one-stop shopping supermarket format popular in the UK/EU is not and will not be the preferred format in Japan. Convenience, matters, but it is not the same concept as in the UK, for example. Research limitations/implications - The sample survey is purposively biased towards younger female shoppers from the working population who will have a significant impact on future consumer behaviour patterns. Results are more inferential than statistically validated hypotheses. Practical implications - Supermarket chains should open a larger number of smaller stores, concentrating on frequently delivered and high quality products, above all in the fresh foods categories. Moreover, the growth of the small convenience store format in markets such as the UK and California suggests that western consumers' desires for convenience are becoming more like those of Japanese consumers. Originality/value - The paper shows that there has been little effort, to date, to demonstrate through primary research whether unique characteristics and buying behaviour do exist in the Japanese marketplace.","[Haddock-Fraser, Janet] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Poole, Nigel] Univ London, London, England; [Doishita, Mitsuhiro] Forestry & Fisheries Japan, Minist Agr, Agr Prod Bur, Tokyo, Japan",University of Kent; University of London; Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan,"Haddock-Fraser, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England.",j.haddock@kent.ac.uk,,"Poole, Nigel/0000-0002-2157-7883",,,,,43,15,17,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The ASH30 study is a longitudinal dietary survey which provided quantitative evidence of dietary change and investigated factors influencing dietary change from adolescence to-adulthood. Design/methodology/approach - Two three-day food diaries were collected both in 1980 (aged 11-12 years) and 2000 (aged 31-32 years) from the same 198 respondents in North East England. In 2,000 questionnaires were used to collect perceptions of, and attributions for, dietary change and open-ended responses were analysed using content analysis. Findings - The use of mixed methods brings added breadth and depth to the research which cannot be achieved by a single discipline or method. Determining what has influenced change in dietary behaviour from adolescence to adulthood is a complex and multifaceted task. Eating habits are influenced by multiple factors throughout the life course. Change in food intake between adolescence and adulthood related to life-course events and trajectories. The qualitative findings highlighted relevant contextual information such as themes of moral panics, the concept of convenience and fresh foods. Practical implications - Adopting mixed method approaches to exploring dietary change should offer a rich perspective from which to base realistic interventions. Originality/value - Longitudinal dietary surveys present an opportunity to understand the complex process of dietary change throughout the life course in terms both of how diets have changed but also of why they have changed.","[Lake, A.

In this program, a total of 4,700 seedlings were generated over three generations using various parental combinations of Ananas comosus var. comosus, A. comosus var. bracteatus, A. comosus var. ananassoides 'FRF223', A. comosus var. erectifolious 'Selvagem 6' and Ananas macrodontes 'I.26-803'. Several selections have been developed for the garden and or cut-flower market. Characteristics represented include a pink or red syncarp, dark red-brown foliage and a dwarf, clumping growth habit. While a surprising display of ornamental diversity exists within Ananas, the genus is limited in comparison to the other bromeliad genera. Opportunity might exist however to introgress characteristics such as additional foliage colours, plant morphology and syncarp colours from other genera into Ananas.","Maroochy Res Stn, Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, Nambour, Qld, Australia",,"Sanewski, GM (通讯作者)，Maroochy Res Stn, Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, POB 5083 SCMC, Nambour, Qld, Australia.",garth.sanewski@dpi.qld.gov.au,,,,,,,9,10,12,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-310-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,822.0,,,,,,71,78,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.822.7,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BAU01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305508900007,0

Employing data from the Household. Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this paper examines the influence of scenic amenity on the life satisfaction of residents of South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. Measuring scenic amenity on a 10-point scale, it is found that, on average, a respondent is willing-to-pay approximately AUD $14,000 in household income per annum to obtain a one-unit improvement in scenic amenity. However, on closer inspection, we find that the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the level of scenic amenity is not linear. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to value scenic amenity using the life satisfaction approach and is the first paper to use this approach to value any type of environmental good or service in SEQ. As such, this paper represents a genuine contribution to a small, yet growing, body of literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Emission levels of economic activities to water are determined based on existing environmental accounts. These emission levels are built into a dynamic economic model for the Dutch economy and subsequently coupled to a national water quality model. The modular approach has the advantage that the impacts on the economy and water quality are evaluated simultaneously, but each within their own domain based on the appropriate scale and level of detail. The dynamic nature of the economic model allows us to also evaluate a derogated water policy as foreseen in the European Water Framework Directive. The indirect costs of different water quality improvement policy scenarios are at least as high as the direct costs related to investments in pollution abatement technology. The stricter the policy scenario, the more important the role of economic adjustment and restructuring mechanisms at the macro-economic level. Significant water quality improvements can be achieved through stringent domestic emission reductions. However, reaching water quality standards is highly dependent on water quality improvement policy in surrounding river basin countries and climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

With rates of sea-level rise approximately double the global average, North Carolina has one of the most vulnerable coastlines in the United States. A range of modest sea-level rise scenarios based on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report projections (2007) are considered for four counties of North Carolina-New Hanover, Dare, Carteret, and Bertie-which represent a cross-section of the state's coastline in geographical distribution and economic development. High-resolution topographic LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data are used to provide accurate inundation maps for the properties that will be at risk under six different sea-level rise scenarios. A simulation approach based on spatial hedonic models is used to provide consistent estimates of the property value losses. Considering just four coastal counties in North Carolina, the value of residential property loss without discounting in 2030 (2080) is estimated to be about $179 ($526) million for the mid-range sea-level rise scenarios. Low-lying and heavily developed areas in the northern coastline are comparatively more vulnerable to the effect of sea-level rise than the other areas.","[Bin, Okmyung] E Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Poulter, Ben] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Poulter, Ben] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Dept Global Change & Nat Syst, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Dumas, Christopher F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ & Finance, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Whitehead, John C.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Duke University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Bin, O (通讯作者)，E Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",bino@ecu.edu; ben.poulter@pik-potsdam.de; dumasc@uncw.edu; whiteheadJC@appstate.edu,"Whitehead, John/AAF-5051-2020; Poulter, Ben/ABB-5886-2021","Poulter, Ben/0000-0002-9493-8600",,,,,31,39,51,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Contrary to this approach, this paper analyzes soybean biodiesel in Brazil using a parallel biophysical and economic assessment at different scales. A Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach is applied as a scenario analysis tool. A soybean biodiesel energy balance for the specific conditions of Brazil is included and the energy ratio turns out to be 1.09. This means that the energy delivered is higher than the energy invested, however the net energy is very low. The economic impacts are analyzed through input-output analysis. The results show that soybean biodiesel increases energy consumption per hour of work without a corresponding increase in economic labor productivity. Consequently the already low energy efficiency of Brazilian production could get worse. Although Brazil has large expanses of land, the substitution of 20% fossil diesel (i.e. just 3.3% of the country's primary energy consumption) with fully renewable biodiesel might destroy protected areas and forests and increase the GHGs emitted.

An emergy method for evaluating the costs and benefits of the project and a composite index named the emergy cost-benefit ratio (EmCBR) were developed. The emergy evaluation shows that the major costs associated with the proposed project come from earthwork (77.4% of the total cost) and concrete work (15.4%), and that water saving (43.0% of the total benefit) and agricultural yield increase (56.9%) are the most important contributions. The calculated EmCBR is 0.97 (the lowest value for a feasible project is 1.0) which indicates that this project would not be feasible in emergy terms. The regional agricultural system could not benefit from the proposed project, according to several emergy indices: emergy yield ratio (EYR), emergy investment ratio (EIR), environmental load ratio (ELR) and environmental sustainability index (ESI). The results show that conventional cost-benefit analysis could fail to provide an adequate decision-making framework because it is unable to value resources and environmental impacts properly. More additional emergy evaluations should be completed on other alternatives to the proposed project to provide adequate guidelines for selecting the best alternative that contributes most to agricultural development with limited environmental impact.

Although still focussed on domestic development goals, BASIC countries have made important steps toward a greater engagement in the global climate agenda. For India, the shift was marked by a voluntary, but conditional, target of reducing emission intensity, away from the past normative position based on equal per capita, emissions entitlements. The new track aims at finding cost-effective mitigation strategies that align national development goals and climate actions. This paper examines the mitigation potential of a domestic sustainable development policy using a suite of integrated assessment models. The long-term goal is to keep temperature increase below 2A degrees C. This article shows that it is possible to match domestic development goals and climate mitigation. Win-win options exist and side benefits-in terms of energy security and local pollution-are important. However, development policies are not sufficient to achieve the desired emissions reductions. We find that it is necessary to introduce a constraint on the carbon budget. The price of carbon that emerges is however much lower than in a conventional mitigation scenario. Finally, this paper proposes to shift the negotiations away from the current climate-centric focus toward development, in order to reduce conflicts and deliver greater global and national benefits.","[Shukla, P.

Angler behavior is described using econometrically estimated site choice models, with site choice among anglers driven by site attributes and angler characteristics. The biophysical model represents the marine reef environment as a system with different trophic levels identifying algal and coral growth as well as two types of fish (piscivores and herbivores). Ecosystem dynamics are driven by interactions within the trophic levels and interaction between fish populations and fishing activities. The model is used to simulate recreational fishing activities and their interactions with the environment. Recreational fishing sites from the Ningaloo Marine Park, an iconic coral reef system in Western Australia, are used as a case study. A set of management strategies, including business-as-usual and different site closure durations, are assessed for two different levels of fishing pressures. The results show that not only the effectiveness but also the distribution of management impacts across space and over time can be very different from what one would expect without the benefit of integrated modeling.

The ecosystem service valuation is carried out by comparing the biophysical and economic values of three focal services (i.e. carbon sequestration, reduction in sedimentation, and waterfowl production) across three focal land uses in the region [i.e. native prairie grasslands, lands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve Programs (CRP/WRP), and cropland]. This study finds that CRP/WRP lands cannot mitigate (hectare for hectare) the loss of native prairie from a social welfare standpoint. Land use scenarios where native prairie loss was minimized, and CRP/WRP lands were increased, provided the most societal benefit. The scenario modeling projected native prairie conversion to cropland over the next 20 years would result in a social welfare loss valued at over $4 billion when considering the study's three ecosystem services, and a net loss of about $3.4 billion when reductions in commodity production are accounted for.

Most auctions focus on ecosystem services on individual properties to maximise the total amount provided. However, for many services it is not just the total quantity but their location in the landscape relative to other sites that matters. For example, biodiversity conservation may be much more effective if conserved sites are connected. Adapting auctions to address ecosystem services at the landscape scale requires an auction mechanism which can promote coordination while maintaining competition. Multi-round auctions, in which bidding is spread over a number of rounds with information provided between rounds on the location of other bids in the landscape, offer an approach to cost effectively deliver landscape-scale ecosystem services. Experimental economic testing shows these auctions deliver the most cost effective environmental outcomes when the number of rounds is unknown in advance, which minimises rent-seeking behaviour. It also shows that a form of bid-improvement rule facilitates coordination and reduces rent seeking. Where the biophysical science is well developed, such auctions should be relatively straightforward to implement and participate in, and have the potential to provide significantly better outcomes than standard 'one-shot' tenders.

The system, called car2go, allows users to take and leave vehicles at any point within the city limits. Thus opposed to traditional car-sharing, there are no fixed stations and in particular one-way trips of any length are possible without a booking requirement. Since this is the first free-floating system in operation, there is as yet no associated empirical research. Based on primary data from a survey, a model was developed to forecast the environmental impact of car2go. The prognosis considers the period of five years after the launch of car2go in 2009 and indicates a CO2-reduction per average car2go-user. In addition, more than a quarter of the survey respondents stated that they may forgo a car purchase if car2go was offered permanently. By reaching a greater share of citizens than traditional systems, the results indicate that free-floating car-sharing systems could contribute to reducing private vehicle ownership in cities.

Newly digitized apprenticeship indenture records for 1600-1749 offer little evidence that personal ties strongly shaped apprentice recruitment. The typical London apprentices had no identifiable tie to their master through kin or place of origin. Migrant apprentices' fathers were generally outside the craft sector. The apprenticeship market was strikingly open: well-to-do families accessed a wide range of apprenticeships, and would-be apprentices could match ability and aptitude to opportunity.

Additionally, it is presumed that these certifications contribute to poverty reduction of smallholders. Yet, gross margins, profits and poverty levels of certified smallholder coffee producers have not yet been quantitatively analyzed applying random sampling techniques. Our quantitative household survey of 327 randomly selected members of conventional, organic and organic-fairtrade certified cooperatives in Nicaragua is complemented by over a hundred qualitative in-depth interviews. The results show that although farm-gate prices of certified coffees are higher than of conventional coffees, the profitability of certified coffee production and its subsequent effect on poverty levels is not clear-cut. Per capita net coffee incomes are insufficient to cover basic needs of all coffee producing households. Certified producers are more often found below the absolute poverty line than conventional producers. Over a period of ten years, our analysis shows that organic and organic-fairtrade farmers have become poorer relative to conventional producers. We conclude that coffee yield levels, profitability and efficiency need to be increased, because prices for certified coffee cannot compensate for low productivity, land or labor constraints.

The individual effects on adoption between the groups are identified by the use of multinomial logit analysis. The results provide evidence that there are significant differences in the characteristics between the adopter groups. The findings also reveal that the factors that affect adoption play a different role for early, medium and late adopters, particularly with regard to farming intensity, age, information gathering as well as attitudes of the farmer. More specifically, early adopters were the youngest to adopt organic farming and their decisions were found to be less profit related compared to other groups. Late adoption is constrained by risk considerations, while environmental attitudes and social learning were identified to be important determinants for all adopter groups. Overall, the findings strongly suggest, that for policy measures to be effective, the current state of diffusion has to be taken into account. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to simple TCM applications, TCM-CB facilitates the ex ante valuation of marginal welfare effects resulting from environmental quality or quantity changes, similar to the contingent valuation method (CV). Even though TCM-CB is highly policy relevant, i.e. to inform changes in management regimes at recreational sites, the validity of estimates has hardly received any attention and little is known about the performance of TCM-CB compared to CV. In this paper, TCM-CB and CV are explored with respect to several validity tests in a case study on the recreational effects of water level changes in a reservoir. Overall, the findings reveal that TCM-CB and CV perform equally well in terms of theoretical validity, but that the marginal recreational value varies significantly between the two methods. We also observe that both methods face similar internal difficulties with respect to the stability of values when the order of a set of valuation questions is changed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The consensus emerging from previous studies appears to be that investors in and occupiers of eco-labeled buildings obtain a bundle of benefits related to lower operating costs, reputation benefits and productivity higher. In this study, a hedonic model is used to test whether the presence of an eco-label has a significantly positive effect on rental rates, sale prices and occupancy rates of commercial office buildings in the US. The results suggest that office buildings with Energy Star or LEED eco-labels obtain rental premia of approximately 3-5%. Dual certification produces an additive effect with rental premia estimated at 9%. Respective sale price premia for Energy Star and LEED labeled office buildings are 18% and 25%. The sale price premium for dual certification is estimated at 28-29%. An occupancy premium could not be confirmed for LEED labeled office buildings and only a small positive occupancy premium was found for Energy Star. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Prior studies examine the physician production process in a theoretical setting and do not provide empirical insight. We expand upon the theoretical work in the literature by specifying a four-product generalized Leontief cost function for physician services that recovers measures of marginal cost, scale, scope, and elasticity. Our study is based on physician survey data from the 1998 American Medical Association Physician Socioeconomic Monitoring Survey and motivates a scientific framework for advancing the existing reimbursement fee schedule. Our analysis indicates that physician office visits are generally priced above marginal cost, implying there may be evidence of market power in physician private practices. Furthermore, our analysis lends to the policy debate over whether the use of a Resource-Based Relative Value Scale system is the most appropriate mechanism for facilitating Medicare reimbursements.","[Gunning, Timothy S.] Ernst & Young LLP, Transfer Pricing & Econ, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University,"Gunning, TS (通讯作者)，Ernst & Young LLP, Transfer Pricing & Econ, 5 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036 USA.",timothy.gunning@ey.com,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,,,,,38,14,14,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Until recently, empirical evidence generally suggests that there is a negative relationship between temperature and income, and, therefore, global warming has an adverse impact on economic activity. However, Nordhaus (2006) argues that the temperature-income relationship depends on how income is measured. We show in this paper that the results of Nordhaus (2006) may be due to an omitted-variable problem. Based on a well-motivated temperature-income model, we find that the relationship between temperature and income is not dependent on income measurement. Our regression results show that the adverse impact of an increase of 1 C in temperature can be as much as a 3% decrease in total income for the G-7 nations. Therefore, our results suggest an aggressive climate mitigation policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

S. states since 1991. This paper examines the effect of the quality of medical care, behavioral risk factors (obesity, smoking, and AIDS incidence), and other variables (education, income, and health insurance coverage) on life expectancy and medical expenditure using longitudinal state-level data. We examine the effects of three different measures of the quality of medical care. The first is the average quality of diagnostic imaging procedures, defined as the fraction of procedures that are advanced procedures. The second is the average quality of practicing physicians, defined as the fraction of physicians that were trained at top-ranked medical schools. The third is the mean vintage (FDA approval year) of outpatient and inpatient prescription drugs. Life expectancy increased more rapidly in states where (1) the fraction of Medicare diagnostic imaging procedures that were advanced procedures increased more rapidly; (2) the vintage of self-and provider-administered drugs increased more rapidly; and (3) the quality of medical schools previously attended by physicians increased more rapidly. States with larger increases in the quality of diagnostic procedures, drugs, and physicians did not have larger increases in per capita medical expenditure. We perform several tests of the robustness of the life expectancy model. Controlling for per capita health expenditure (the quantity of healthcare), and eliminating the influence of infant mortality, has virtually no effect on the healthcare quality coefficients. Controlling for the adoption of an important nonmedical innovation also has little influence on the estimated effects of medical innovation adoption on life expectancy.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 3022 Broadway,504 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,,,,,32,27,27,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1389-6563,1573-6962,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

It shows that although every agent prefers to live in a mixed-race neighborhood, complete segregation is observed almost all of the time. A concept of tipping is rigorously defined, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of segregation. Complete segregation emerges and persists in the checkerboard model precisely because tipping is less likely to occur to such residential patterns. Agent-based simulations are used to illustrate how an integrated residential area is tipped into complete segregation and why this process is irreversible. This model incorporates insights from Schelling's two classical models of segregation (the checkerboard model and the neighborhood tipping model) and puts them on a rigorous footing. It helps us better understand the persistence of residential segregation in urban America.","Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Zhang, JF (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",juzhang@clarku.edu,,,,,,,88,80,97,3,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Water samples were taken by 4 repetitions during the flood, before its inflow into and outflow from meadows, on the 1st-3rd-6th-12th days of the flood. In the lower Nemunas, the concentration of biogenic compounds in incoming and outgoing flood waters depended on the flood duration, the soil of study area, and the elevation of land surface. In flood water, the highest amounts of total nitrogen (3.3-19.6 mg/L), nitrates (3.3-1.6 mg/L), ammonium (0.87-0.33 mg/L), phosphates (0.13-0.42 mg/L) and the least amounts of nitrites (0.026-0.020 mg/L) were determined. The highest concentration of researched ions was observed on the first day of flood, and it gradually declined on the third, sixth, and twelfth day. Nitrate concentration was greater in water flowing in meadows during the whole flood in the Nemunas higher floodplain than in lower and in the Minija floodplain, and on the twelfth day of flood, it was less in the lower area of Nemunas floodplain than in the Minija. Total nitrogen concentration was greater in the Nemunas up to the sixth day of flood, and on the twelfth day of flood, it was greater in the Minija water. In the course of flood, the ratio of inorganic and organic nitrogen has changed. During the continuance of the flood, the amount of organic nitrogen has particularly increased when flowing out of meadows in the lower Nemunas valley. On the first day of the flood, the water flowing into meadows in the Nemunas had more phosphates (0.25 mg/L) than in the Minija (0.17 mg/L), and from the third day of the flood on, the concentration (0.14 mg/L) became equalized in all study area. After comparison of differences in quality of water flowing into and out of meadows, it was ascertained that the outflowing water has mostly purified from ammonium (good sorption by ground colloid) in the Nemunas floodplain on the twelfth day of flood (the highest difference), and in the Minija floodplain on the first day. Water flowing through meadows has the least effect on phosphate concentration, with exception of the first day of flood in the Nemunas. Correlation analysis between the same compounds in inflowing and outflowing flood waters demonstrates that stronger correlations were observed between nitrate (correlation coefficient r = 0.84) and ammonium (r= 0.64) concentrations, and weaker - between total nitrogen (r= 0.47) and nitrites (r= 0.41).",,,,katutis@vezaiciai.lzi.lt; Antanas.Dumbrauskas@asu.lt; Aurelija.Rudzianskaite@asu.lt,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2011,5.0,2,,,,,292,297,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BAM56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000304698500052,0

This paper aims to identify and prioritise CPs in the home kitchen environment during food preparation in order to inform food safety campaigns. Design/methodology/approach - This study involved: filming participants (n = 60) while they prepared a meal according to a specified recipe (30 beef/salad burgers and 30 chicken salads); swabbing key potential contamination sites in the participant's kitchen for microbiological testing; sampling the meat and salad components of the cooked meal for microbiological testing; visual inspection and temperature check of the meat after cooking and administering a survey of knowledge, attitudes and demographic factors. Findings - This study has identified the critical points (CPs) during domestic food preparation as: CP1: correct cooking practices; CP2: prevention of cross-contamination; and CP3: correct food storage practices.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 1,011 randomly selected subjects over 15 years of age were interviewed by telephone. Moreover, 638 label users were recruited for assessing nutrition label habits. Findings - Of the subjects, 36 per cent claimed that they had never, 25 per cent rarely, 19 per cent always and 15 per cent sometimes read nutrition labels. Females, participants with the highest levels of education, still undergoing education, physically active and on special diets claimed that they were more likely to read nutrition labels. Among label users, younger participants mentioned curiosity as the most important reason for reading nutrition labels, while older participants more often pointed out wish for healthy eating habits. Interpretational aids were often mentioned among younger participants for easier understanding of nutritional information, while older participants requested bigger letter size. Research limitations/implications - The present study provides a starting point for establishing nutrition education targeted at specific groups of consumers. Research is limited to the subject's self-reported nutrition label reading. Future research is needed to explore the differences between label users and 'non-users. Originality/value - As the study showed, a notable difference exists between younger and older subjects regarding nutrition habits that could help experts toward effective communication. Nevertheless, the study could fill the research gaps in nutrition reading habits of specific groups of consumers in European countries, other than northern Europe.","[Ranilovic, Jasmina] Podravka D D Food Ind, Qual Control Dept, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Baric, Irena Colic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Food Chem & Nutr Lab, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Ranilovic, J (通讯作者)，Podravka D D Food Ind, Qual Control Dept, Koprivnica, Croatia.",jasmina.ranilovic@podravka.hr,"Ranilovic, Jasmina/JMA-8741-2023","Ranilovic, Jasmina/0000-0001-7600-1083","Podravka Company, in Croatia","Podravka Company, in Croatia","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Podravka Company, in Croatia.",,21,23,27,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Further, it seeks to derive practical implications for food marketing. Design/methodology/approach - The results stem from two qualitative studies. In the first study the development of organic food consumption in families was investigated from a parents' perspective. In the second, juveniles' influence on organic food consumption in families was examined. In both studies data were collected by means of problem-centred interviews. Data were analysed with Grounded Theory procedures according to Strauss and Corbin (1990) in the first study and with content analysis according to Mayring (2007) in the second. Findings - Children's transition into adolescence often represents a causal condition for a reduction of organic food consumption in families due to juveniles' preferences for conventional food in product categories such as sweets, salty snacks or breakfast cereals. Concessions of parents to their children's preferences are based on strategies like being liberal, avoiding conflicts or letting children have their own experiences. Parents' strategies depend on their evaluation of conventional food. Practical implications - Marketing for organic food should increasingly involve the demands of juveniles since they are considered to be an attractive target group. Originality/value - No insights exist for the investigated phenomenon.","[Riefer, Angelika; Hamm, Ulrich] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Hamm, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany.",hamm@uni-kassel.de,"Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020; Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013","Hamm, Ulrich/0000-0001-7444-3451",,,,,33,15,15,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Extraction of rice bran protein concentrate (RBPC) from defatted rice bran was standardized using alkali extraction method. Defatted rice bran and RBPC were analyzed for their proximate composition. RBPC was analyzed for its bulk density, foaming capacity (FC), emulsion activity (EA), and water and oil absorption capacity. RBPC was incorporated in biscuits at 5, 10 and 15 per cent levels. The biscuits were analyzed for their physicochemical, fracture strength (texture analyzer) and sensory attributes (nine-point hedonic scale) to assess their acceptability. Findings - The maximum yield of 13.2 per cent for RBPC was obtained at alkaline pH of 11, temperature of 60 degrees C and extraction time of 60 minutes. The bulk density, foaming capacity, emulsifying ability, water and oil absorption capacity of RBPC were 0.4 g/ml, 11 per cent, 40 per cent, 2.9 ml/g and 2.3 ml/g respectively. The protein content of biscuits increased significantly from 7.3 per cent in control biscuits to 15.4 per cent in the 15 per cent RBPC supplemented biscuits with their fracture strength also significantly higher than the control biscuits (p < 0.05). Replacement of refined wheat flour up to 10 per cent RBPC produced protein-enriched biscuits with desirable overall acceptability. Originality/value - Rice bran protein concentrate can be beneficially utilized to formulate protein enriched biscuits with enhanced nutritional value especially for malnourished or undernourished people.","[Yadav, Ritika B.; Yadav, Baljeet S.; Chaudhary, Deepu] Chaudhary Devi Lal Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sirsa, India",Chaudhary Devi Lal University,"Yadav, RB (通讯作者)，Chaudhary Devi Lal Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Sirsa, India.",rita.by@rediffmail.com,"Yadav, Ritika B/IAR-9693-2023","Yadav, Ritika B/0000-0002-9704-6309; Yadav, Baljeet/0000-0003-1503-3473",,,,,36,39,46,3,61,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These in turn are expected to affect river runoff and water variability, depending on basin latitude. In this paper, we assess the impact of water supply variability on 'treaty cooperation' (defined here as the likelihood of treaty formation and number of treaties formed) between international bilateral river basin riparian states. The water variability measure that we use captures both annual runoff variability and precipitation variability. We employ additional control variables adopted from economic and international relations theories on international cooperation. The main results suggest that water supply variability in international bilateral basins creates an impetus for cooperation. Our results support an inverted U-shaped relationship between water supply variability and treaty cooperation.

An analysis of adaptation by livestock species choice in South America,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Climate variability; Adaptation; Livestock species choice; South America,CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; COSTS,"This paper examines how South American farmers' choices of livestock species vary across the range of climate and in turn infer from them as to what would happen under climate changes. We examine the choice of five primary species using a multinomial logit model with and without climate variability measures based on 1300 livestock farm surveys in seven countries. The results indicate that climate variables are highly significant determinants of primary species choice after controlling for soils, geography, household characteristics, and country fixed effects. We find the probability of adopting any livestock increases with warming, but decreases when it becomes too wet. The impacts of climate change would vary by species and climate scenarios. For example, under a hot and dry CCC scenario by 2060, beef cattle decrease by 3.2%, dairy cattle by 2.3%, pigs by 0.5%, and chickens by 0.9%, which is offset by a large increase in sheep by 7%. These adaptive changes vary again by country. Large changes are observed in the Andean countries. Under the hot dry scenario, daily cattle increase in Uruguay and Argentina, but decrease elsewhere. The increase in sheep occurs mostly in the Andes mountain countries such as Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Under a milder and wetter scenario, beef cattle choice declines in Colombia. Ecuador, and Venezuela, but increases in Argentina and Chile. Sheep increase in Colombia and Venezuela, but decrease in the high mountains of Chile where chickens are chosen more frequently.

To test the chain of alleged causation from unequal power and wealth to poor schooling, one must follow the public money, or lack of it, in as many contexts as the data will allow. Public funding for mass schooling is the hitherto untested middle link in the chain. The key to Latin America's poor schooling was the failure to supply tax money, not gender discrimination or any shortfall in market demand for skills. The most glaring anomalies were the Venezuelan and Argentine failures to supply the levels of tax support for mass schooling that their high income could have afforded.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Lindert, PH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",phlindert@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,52,19,20,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Indeed, some have argued that high inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest Americas, and that this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions that help explain the disappointing growth performance we observe there even today. This paper argues to the contrary. Compared with the rest of the world, Latin American inequality was not high either in pre-conquest 1491 or in the post-conquest decades following 1492. Indeed, it was not even high in the mid-19(th) century just before Latin America's belle epoque. It only became high thereafter.

The addition of forest income after joint forest management (JFM) reduces measured income inequality by about 12%, all else equal, in the JFM involved households. But no such perceptible decrease has been found for non-JFM households during this period. Categorically, forest income plays the dominant role in reducing measured income inequality for those households who are relatively asset poor and that also live below poverty line. The study also shows that the non-involvement in JFM programme by the non-JFM households might bring about a major environmental shirking, because illegal timber income constitutes the major part in total income for non-JFM households even after JFM scenario.

In China, the scarcity of arable land (0.09 ha per capita), increasing population, and migration of the workforce to cities pose a significant challenge for food security. Agricultural energy productivity has therefore become a key concern. In this study, we used input-output analysis to measure energy productivity at a national agro-ecosystem scale for China using the total embodied energy requirement (TEER) to reveal hidden energy flows. We introduced a structural decomposition technique that reveals how changes in TEER for the agricultural sector were driven by changes in energy-use technology and the inter-relationships among two agricultural sectors (farming and animal husbandry). The results will help both policymakers and farmers to improve the efficiency and environmental compatibility of agricultural production. Declining TEER for both sectors means that China's overall agro-ecosystem has increased its energy productivity since 1978 due to improved relationships between the agricultural sectors and increased use of biological energy. However, the net positive energy income decreased in the farming sector and an increasing proportion of fossil energy use, accompanied by increased energy income in the animal sector, provide incentives to increase yield and decrease labor by using more fossil energy, thus raising more animals in the animal husbandry sector. Overuse of fossil energy since 1990 has resulted in decreasing fossil energy efficiency, requiring immediate measures to improve the use of fossil-fuel-intensive materials such as fertilizers.

The narrow approach together with a combination of a historical and economical approach enables us to cut deeper into the controversial environmental Kuznets curve-hypothesis. We found the main reasons for a downturn in sulphur emissions to be: technological development and anxiety about possible environmental damage and economic costs related to that. It can be discussed whether our results refute the environmental Kuznets curve or just show possible ways in which the environmental Kuznets curve is achieved. Nevertheless our case study casts some serious doubt on the most straightforward assumption coming out from the EKC, that economic growth would automatically solve environmental problems. We claim that the causal connection might also go in an opposite direction: proper environmental standards and conservation comprise a necessary condition for economic growth in the long run.

The results support the Gaia hypothesis against challenges based on the tragedy of the commons: model creatures are often able to work together to maintain the common good (a suitable climate) without being undermined by free riders. A long-term dynamics appears in which communities that cannot sustain Gaian cooperation give way to communities that can. This result provides an argument why a Gaia scenario should generally be observed, rather than a tragedy of the commons scenario. Second, a close look at how communities fail reveals failures that do not fit the tragedy of the commons framework and are better described in terms of conflict between differently positioned parties, with power over different aspects of the system. In the context of Norgaard's work, all these observations can be read as narratives of coevolution relevant to social communities as well as ecological ones, contrasting with pessimistic scenarios about common governance and supporting respect for traditional arrangements and restraint in intervention.

As a result, the field has a long way to go to establish causality, and to be able to account for spatial economic dynamics.","London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Storper, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.storper@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,111,21,25,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The procedure estimated the potential costs of LD from a standard index of land sensitivity to degradation (ESAI) by calculating, over 784 local districts covering the entire Italian territory, a 'depletion factor' in relation to the agricultural value added. The procedure was based on changes in the ESAI (1990-2000) and ancillary variables (i.e., per capita value added, share of agriculture in the total production, and agricultural profitability). On average, the estimated costs of LD in Italy amounted to nearly 0.5% of the agricultural value added (which corresponded to 12(sic)/ha of cultivated surface). These figures are comparable to those presented in the literature for regions with similar environmental conditions. This paper contains descriptions of the assumptions under which the proposed scheme works and comments on their empirical plausibility. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The benefits of ABC system and its impacts on companies' performance have motivated numerous empirical studies on ABC system and it is considered as one of the most-researched management accounting areas in developed countries. Previous research on ABC have examined pertinent issues related to ABC implementation such as the levels of ABC adoption in various countries, the reasons for implementing ABC, the problems related to ABC and the critical success factors influencing ABC. This paper reviews the research on ABC carried out within the last decade, from 1995-2008, and from the review research gaps are identified. Specifically, this paper examines the selection of factors influencing ABC successful implementation, variables used by previous research. The review revealed that past research concentrated mainly on behavioral, organizational, and technical variables as the main determinants of ABC success.

Attention has recently been drawn to the significant threat facing the future of the provision of employee assistance services in the form of 'commoditization'. EAPs providers in the Asia-Pacific region have experienced similar pressures to those experienced globally, with the standardization of product features and an increasing focus on price reduction. In addition, while EAPs have been enthusiastically adopted by organisations, this has generally occurred in the absence of clearly identified corporate needs, resulting in the widespread lack of strategic integration of the EAP into organisational RR functioning. This paper examines current research from Australia on the perceptions of Australian human resource (HR.) representatives on the use of EAPs as a strategic tool. It will be argued that the issues of commoditization, and the continuing lack of awareness among organisational decision makers of the nature of EA service provision, represent impediments to the strategic and effective use of EAPs.","[Kirk-Brown, Andrea] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Berwick, Vic 3805, Australia",Monash University,,andrea.kirk-brown@buseco.monash.edu.au,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,6,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-026-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,6,10,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BSB91,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284085200002,0

This life cycle study is focused on the effects on greenhouse gases emissions of a car scrappage scheme in a time range of 24 years, from 1996 to 2020, reducing the average vehicle life from 12 to 10 years; the reference value of retirement age is calculated from the Italian vehicle fleet and used cars market statistics. Two case studies are analyzed for two reference gasoline cars and one diesel car, representative of the European and USA fleet in 2005, considering emissions and consumption data respectively from the MIT and JRC reports published in 2008. In the baseline case it is considered the expected technological evolution of conventional gasoline vehicle both on propulsion and non-propulsion systems. The advanced case takes into account a higher technology improvement up to 2020, with hybrid propulsion systems. Both case studies show that the GHG emissions on the whole vehicle life cycle are neutral with respect to car replacement acceleration, provided that the promoting incentives are restricted to the more energy efficient new vehicles, and new technologies development expected for 2020 will be achieved.","[Lelli, M.; Pede, G.; Valentini, M.

Recently, the underlying legislation was extended to also include various small facilities with sometimes small businesses as owners, and the Government authorized the SSM to issue regulations as warranted and appropriate. The implementation of the new legislation includes the challenges of simultaneously honouring the polluter pays principle and the principle of equity between the generations whilst at the same time complying with the requirements on proportionality as well as harmony with other legislation. Surveys have therefore been conducted regarding similar solutions in other areas as well as statements in other legislations, and the results are briefly summarized in the present paper.

We get the following finds from the study. First, annually the performance of the provincial government's public utilities management shows a trend of gradual improvement, but geographically there exists significant regional disparities in the performance of the provincial government's public utilities management. Second, by decomposing the difference by using population or provincial gross product as the weights, we find that the provincial management performances have the same spatial pattern as the economy development, and the regional disparities are mainly composed by the inter-regional differences and show a characteristic of stationary.

Furthermore, we propose an alternative measure of the extent and effectiveness of the global protected areas network based on potential net primary production (NPP0). The average NPP0 in urban areas and parks is calculated and compared to the average NPP0 of the geopolitical regions and biomes containing these areas. Additionally. human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) in parks is used as an indicator of the effectiveness of these protected areas. We find that in almost all regions of the world, humans have chosen to settle in the most productive areas. At the global scale, urban areas have considerably higher NPP0 (592 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) than the global average (494 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while parks have roughly average NPP0 (490 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). Parks with an IUCN category of I-VI account for 9.5% of the planet's terrestrial NPP0, compared to 9.6% of its terrestrial area. Although protected area and protected NPP0 are nearly equal, this equivalence is diminished by HANPP within parks. Globally, the average HANPP in all protected areas is 14% of their NPP0, and HANPP within parks increases as the park management category becomes less restrictive. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between HANPP in parks and the extent of urbanization in the surrounding region and biome. Area-based targets for conservation provide no information on either the quality of the areas we choose to protect, or the effectiveness of that protection. We conclude that NPP0 and HANPP may provide an additional, useful tool for assessing the extent and effectiveness of the global protected areas network. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Ray, I",,,,"Ray, Indrajit",,,Identifying the woes of the cotton textile industry in Bengal: tales of the nineteenth century,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRICES; EXPORTS,"This article seeks to answer three basic questions about the nineteenth-century cotton textile industry in Bengal that still remain unresolved in the literature; namely, when did the industry begin to decay, what was the extent of its decay during the early nineteenth century, and what were the factors that led to this? In the absence of data on production, this article seeks to settle the debate on the basis of the industry's market performance and its consumption of raw materials. It contests the prevailing hypothesis that the industry's perpetual decline started in the late eighteenth or the early nineteenth century. Instead, it is argued that the decline started around the mid-1820s. The pace of its decline was, however, slow though steady at the beginning, but reached crisis point by 1860, when around 563,000 workers lost their jobs. Regarding the extent of its decay, this article concludes that the industry was diminished by about 28 per cent by the mid-1800s. However, it survived in the high-end and low-end domestic markets. Evidence is also gathered in favour of the hypothesis that, although British discriminatory policies undoubtedly depressed the industry's export outlet, its decay is better explained by technological innovations in Great Britain.",,,,,,,,,,,63,10,10,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Specifically, we use nonparametric regression techniques and their natural complement, conditional density estimation. Results indicate that savings banks that expand geographically outside their natural markets achieve greater productivity gains. However, there are some firms for which this result is more moderate.

Currently, the development of such payment schemes is perceived mainly through theoretical lenses offered by economists and hydrologists. Notwithstanding the usefulness and appropriateness of these theoretical lenses, they have difficulties to accommodate certain aspects of the development of payment schemes for water-related environmental services. Specifically, the discussion of negotiation aspects remains relatively isolated and superficial, even though it is generally acknowledged that the development of payment schemes is often significantly influenced by political negotiations. This paper addresses this limitation. It shows how the main elements of negotiation analysis can provide a theoretical underpinning for important drivers behind the development of specific payment schemes, which are beyond the scope of hydrological or economic rationality. Four cases of water-related payment schemes in the Netherlands are studied, employing one of the key insights offered by negotiation analysis: the importance of the underlying interests and values of the parties involved. The findings of these four cases show the potential of negotiation analysis as a useful complement for understanding and supporting the development of payment schemes for environmental services.

Firstly, we describe and discuss the three levels of moral progress; pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional as presented in Kohlberg's theory. Secondly, we draw a distinction between classical economics, neoclassical economics, and ecological economics, and discuss to what extent the differences in ethics within the three theories can be explained by referring to the ethical development characterizing Kohlberg's moral stages. Thirdly, we discuss some of the hallmarks characterizing economics based upon what Kohlberg termed, universal principles at the highest stage in the development of moral reasoning. To exemplify the evolution of moral reasoning in different economic theories, we describe the changes that take place in the image of man over the last 2-300 years. The human being in economics has been discussed in this journal with reference to three different relations, to himself, community, and nature. We have used the metaphors economic man, social man, and ecological man to characterize the ethical content of the three first stages. At the first stage, economic man interpreted as an egocentric individual seeking personal gain, characterizes classical economics. At the second stage, social man seeks the best for a group of people within the perspective of neoclassical economics. At the third stage, ecological man is aware of the interrelatedness between economy and nature. Within ecological economics the agent is termed ecological man to indicate the interconnectedness between economy and the ecosystems. While being aware of the weakness in predictive power inherent in these kinds of stage theories, we find it stimulating to conclude with a description of economics based upon the ideas characterizing the highest level (stage 7) in Kohlberg's theory. We put forward a hypothesis concerning a fourth stage in the development of economics termed neoecological economics. We describe the economic actor as cosmic man. Cosmic man has an extended self and incorporates all the other images of man. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Preferences are transmitted intergenerationally and through social interactions, where we assume that agents are more likely to adopt environmental preferences the larger the amount of pollution. In the basic setting we find that both converge non-monotonically towards an interior steady state. When including technical change we notice that there will be no change in the steady state level of the environment unless technical change is sufficiently strong, which stands in stark contrast to the literature.

In France, tax collectors successfully overcame the collective action costs of imposing constraint on the king. In the Ottoman Empire, tax collectors faced prohibitive transaction costs to organizing in a similar manner.","[Balla, Eliana] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Baltimore Off, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Johnson, Noel D.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond; George Mason University,"Balla, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Baltimore Off, 502 S Sharp St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",eliana.balla@rich.frb.org; njohnsoL@gmu.edu,,,,,,,77,39,46,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

This paper aims to better understand the motivations and likely responses to policy for lifestyle landholders in Australia, in order to assess which policy mechanisms, if any, are likely to be most efficiently used to influence their land management. Through face-to-face interviews, we find that lifestyle landholders have important differences from commercial farmers, including much smaller properties, a stronger interest in environmental outcomes, a lack of land-management skills and a lack of time for land-management activities. From the perspective of environmental policy programs, engaging with lifestyle landholders is likely to involve higher transaction costs, and there are likely to be higher learning and transition costs per unit area. A framework for selection of policy tools is modified to take account of these findings. It is concluded that the prospects for worthwhile public investments in land-use changes by lifestyle landholders are lower than for commercial landholders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The controversial issues include the substitutability between production inputs, the role of time and the economic consequences of irreversibility in the production process. A case in point is the use of Cobb-Douglas type production functions, which completely ignore the physical process underlying the production of a good. We examine these issues in the context of the production of a basic commodity (such as copper or aluminium). We model the extraction and the refinement of a valuable substance which is mixed with waste material, in a way which is fully consistent with the physical constraints of the process. The resulting analytical description of production unambiguously reveals that perfect substitutability between production inputs fails if a corrected thermodynamic approach is used. We analyze the equilibrium pricing of a commodity extracted in an irreversible way. We force consumers to purchase goods using energy as the means of payment and force the firm to account in terms of energy. The resulting market provides the firm with a form of reversibility of its use of energy. Under an energy numeraire. energy resources will naturally be used in a more parsimonious way.

As a result we have invisible or social, environmental and health costs which end up being socialised with the farmer, in general, having no incentives to recognise and internalise them. This study is intended to review and develop this problem in the light of the Brazilian reality. To this end, we make use of an empirical exercise to illustrate estimation of the social cost associated with acute poisoning by pesticide using the PREVS/IBGE data (Harvest Forecast Research) in the state of Parana, Brazil. The results suggest that, for maize, the costs of acute poisoning could represent 64% of the benefits of using herbicides and insecticides. and, in the best of hypotheses, when some risk factors are eliminated, they may reach 8% of the benefits of the use of these products. Similarly, when we examine future scenarios for five and ten years, we find less encouraging results, as in ten years the costs of acute poisoning could reach around 85% of the benefit of using insecticides and herbicides for maize. However. there is the encouraging news that, if preventive measures were taken during this time, the gains would be considerable, about 6.5 times greater. We conclude that an assessment of the real benefits involved with pesticides in Brazil is required, principally in regard to the smallholder, where farmers need more training in the use - or even the elimination - of these hazardous substances. There are sustainable technological options available which are economically efficient, especially if we consider the social, environmental and health costs. In this context it is worth highlighting the role of regulatory measures as a mechanism which can reorient generation of negative external costs through the reduction of current incentives in the socialisation of private costs.

Transport connections to one facility are congested. A model is presented for this asymmetric duopoly game that can be solved for a Nash equilibrium in prices and wages. A comparative statics analysis is used to illustrate the properties of the equilibrium. A numerical model is then applied to the two Brussels airports. Three stylized policies are implemented to address the congestion problem: expansion of transport capacity, congestion pricing, and a direct subsidy to the uncongested facility. Our results indicate that the degree of intrinsic differentiation between the two firms is crucial in determining the difference in profit and market share. Price and wage differences also depend on trip frequency and consumer preferences for diversity. Congestion pricing is the most effective policy tool but all three options are shown to have attractive attributes.","[Dunkerley, Fay; Proost, Stef] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [de Palma, Andre] Ecole Normale Super, F-94230 Cachan, France; [de Palma, Andre] Ecole Polytech, F-94230 Cachan, France",KU Leuven; Universite Paris Saclay,"Dunkerley, F (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",fay.dunkerley@econ.kuleuven.be; andre.depalma@ens-cachan.fr; stef.proost@econ.kuleuven.be,,"Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",,,,,21,4,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

In this paper we argue that the standard shift-share analysis is inadequate to measure the contribution of sectors to accelerations in productivity. We present a modified shift-share method, which takes account of surplus labour in agriculture and accounts for the contribution to growth from expanding sectors. We apply this novel methodology to the GGDC 10-sector database, which is a new data set with annual time series of value added and persons employed for the ten main sectors of the economy.

Depending on the degree of information asymmetry, different forms of payment induce appropriate behavior. These theoretical results are then pitted against the RBRVS of the United States to find that a number of its aspects are not optimal. We then turn to Switzerland's Tarmed and find that it fails to conform with the prescriptions of economic contract theory as well.

In addition to a basic CVM question, a related scenario was developed that asked half of the survey respondents to state their fair share cost to lessen a potential food shortage in the next decade, also through the expanded use of cellulosic ethanol. Three alternative biomass feedstocks were assessed: farming residues, forestry residues and paper mill wastes, and municipal solid wastes. Overall a slightly larger proportion of respondents were WTP extra for cellulosic ethanol in the basic CVM scenario than in the FS scenario, though no significant differences were found in the WTP for the different feedstocks. Bid curve lognormal regression results for the two models were similar, supporting the idea that asking a FS rather than a conventional WTP question may be justifiable in some circumstances, such as in cases of a national emergency.

However methane (CH4), with a global warming potential (GWP) 25 times that of CO2, should not be neglected as an environmental indicator for informed environmental management. While this is a significant component, the CH4 associated with imported embodied energy should also be included in national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. This study proposes an initial method for incorporating methane into ecological footprint analyses and hopes to inform future debate on its inclusion. In order to account for differences in methane intensities from exporting countries, methane intensities for OECD countries were calculated using emission and energy consumption estimates taken directly from National Inventory Reports (NIR), published in conjunction with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For other countries the methane intensities were estimated using energy balances published by the International Energy Association (IEA) and IPCC default emission factors. In order to estimate embodied organic methane, material imports and exports were translated into units (such as live animals) capable of conversion into methane emissions. A significant increase in Ireland's footprint results from the inclusion of the GWP of methane is included within the footprint calculation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The National Footprint Accounts (NFA) by Global Footprint Network (GFN) calculate trade-embodied Footprints by multiplying yield and embodied energy factors with mass volumes of traded goods in a Product Land Use Matrix (PLUM). This article compares energy Footprints embodied in trade from and to the United Kingdom in 2002 as calculated by the NFA-PLUM with the results from a recently developed multi-region input-output model (MRIO) for the UK. Although totals for imports and exports are comparable, breaking down the results by economic sectors reveals large differences and hardly any correlation between the two methods. The omission of trade in services (especially transport services) and upstream impacts of energy goods (fossil fuels) and the use of inappropriate embodied energy factors in the NFA-PLUM method are identified as the main reasons for these differences. In the light of the results it seems that a comprehensive Footprint account of trade can better be achieved with an input-output based approach. I conclude that MRIO models once fully developed - will be particularly suitable in the future to estimate the Ecological Footprints of imports and exports of nations with the possibility to track their origin via inter-industry linkages, international supply chains and multi-national trade flows.

Non-cartel producers were highly responsive to price changes, and their threat to the cartel was made credible by market integration facilitated by canals. The spread of railways had little impact on the cartel's market power.

The simultaneous exercise of one of the two rights by all the owners of a common causes a problem of overexploitation in the first case (competition in use) and underuse in the second (competition in exclusion). The relevance of both inefficiencies stems from the way they illustrate the general conflict between individual and collective interests. This paper proposes a formal synthesis of the problems of inefficiency associated with the exploitation of resources in common property regimes. The synthesis takes into account the following features: i) the importance of the consumer surplus for the analysis of the issue; ii) the attitude of economic agents in the face of a reciprocal externality linked to the exploitation of the common; and iii) the social and the private costs of exploitation.

Our principal conclusions are that (a) restriction to these data-based technologies adds continuity in input quantities to the properties satisfied by the Fare-Lovell and the Zieschang indexes (thus eliminating a salient advantage of the Debreu-Farrell index), but (b) none of the indexes satisfies all Fare-Lovell axioms (nor all continuity axioms) on either DEA or FDH technologies, and hence (c) trade-offs among the indexes remain.

Generally newer studies yielded higher WTP. Variables such as the change in the size of the species population, payment frequency, survey mode, response rate, type of respondent, type of species, and a new variable for whether a species is a 'charismatic megafauna' or not, whether the species has use and nonuse value versus nonuse value only and year of the study, were found to significantly influence WTP.

The number and extent of coverage of existing international water agreements and joint management institutions merits cautious optimism about future water management in the region. Yet, taken alone, a numerical account of water treaties reveals little about the context in which the agreements were negotiated, the nature of the rules and regulations adopted, or the influence of the agreements in addressing problems or enhancing joint governance. Drawing on a database containing all the international freshwater agreements entered into between South Africa and its neighbours since 1910, this article examines trends in the articulation of these treaties and discusses the implications of the rules and regulations they embody. Specific consideration is given to issues of information sharing, water allocation and organizations.

Practically, this process consists in decorating the Specialisation/Generalisation links (i.e. the is-a links) of the hierarchy of concepts with 2 gradients. The goal of the first gradient, called Conceptual Prototypicality Gradient, is to capture the user-sensitive degree of truth of the categorisation process, that is the one which is perceived by the end-user. As this gradient is defined according to the three aspects of the semiotic triangle (i.e. intentional, extensional and expressional dimension), we call it Semiotic-based Prototypicality Gradient. The objective of the second gradient, called Lexical Prototypicality Gradient, is to capture the user-sensitive degree of truth of the lexicalisation process, i.e. the definition of a set of terms used to denote a concept. These gradients aim at representing the multiple points of view that can be associated to the same ontology. They enrich the initial formal semantics of an ontology by adding a pragmatics defined according to a context of use which depends on parameters like culture, educational background or emotional context.","[Aime, X.] Soc TENNAXIA, F-75009 Paris, France; [Furst, F.] Univ Amiens UPJV, MIS Lab Modelisat Informat & Syst, F-80039 Amiens 01, France; [Kuntz, P.; Trichet, F.] Univ Nantes, LINA, UMR CNRS 6241, Team Knowledge & Decis, F-44322 Nantes 03, France",Nantes Universite,"Aime, X (通讯作者)，Soc TENNAXIA, F-75009 Paris, France.",xaime@tennaxia.com; frederic.furst@u-picardie.fr,"Aimé, Xavier/A-2393-2013","Xavier, Aime/0000-0003-1200-6875",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806057-2-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,239,+,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BKK53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268388300031,0

Pineapple plays an important economic and social role in many micro regions, generating a significant number of jobs and expressive income for more than 18,000 producers and many other people involved in this business, mainly directed to the inland market. On the other side, fresh fruit exports have also increased recently, mostly due to investments of Del Monte Company in Northeast Brazil. The cultivar 'Perola', native to Brazil, is grown in about 80% of the area, followed by 'Smooth Cayenne', 'Jupi', 'MD-2' and several local varieties mostly used in the Amazon Region. Strong research efforts have contributed to the significant progress of the Brazilian pineapple industry. The breeding program of Embrapa Cassava & Tropical Fruits has generated and evaluated many hybrids, two of them have recently been recommended for planting: 'Imperial' and 'Vitoria', both showing good horticultural characteristics and resistance to fusariosis, the most serious pineapple disease in Brazil. Consumers' demand for safe and high quality food has pushed for changes in the production systems. Led by the Brazilian Ministry for Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, a program on integrated fruit production, including pineapple, has been carried out since 2000. Procedures directed to integrated pest management based upon strict monitoring of the main phytossanitary problems (fusariosis, fruit borer, mealybug associated wilt etc.), as well as to improve weed management and the nutritional status of the plants, have enabled reductions of the amounts of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides applied during the crop cycle, thus contributing to environmental protection, lower production costs and better fruit quality. Intensive training activities (courses, technical meetings, field days etc.) have proved to be effective by stimulating adoption of this production system by growers.","[de Matos, A.

Through the use of ethylene forcing, flowering can be induced in pineapple throughout the year. Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, is solely responsible for the initiation of reproductive development in pineapple. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of cold treatment of pineapple on ethylene production and flower induction. Cold treatment stimulated greater amounts of ethylene production in shoot apex than in 'D'-leaf basal tissues. Shoot apices of pineapple treated with ice crystals also produced twice as much ethylene as did those of control plants. However, pineapple plants treated 1-2 times with ice crystals or ice water were not induced to flower under field conditions. In another field experiment two applications of 1.0% calcium carbide (CaC2) applied at 48h intervals was sufficient to complete force reproductive development of 'Tainon 17' pineapple plants. Supplementation of CaC2 with activated charcoal had no significant effect on the percentage of inflorescence emergence. However, GC analysis revealed that the release of acetylene from CaC2 was prolonged by up to 24h by the addition of activated charcoal. Based on these preliminary results, additional experiments are being conducted to identify the most cost-effective combinations of CaC2 and activated charcoal for the efficient forcing of pineapples.","[Lin, C.

Due to cultural differences in cross-border consolidations, the benefits of domestic and cross-border consolidations are likely to differ. This paper examines the effectiveness of merger processes, with a detailed analysis of both domestic and cross-border consolidations in Europe from 1998 to 2004. Effectiveness is measured via several criteria: improvement in costs, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE). To analyze potential cost efficiency improvement, we use a stochastic cost frontier approach. The same methodology is used for ROA and ROE to estimate efficiency in profitability. Finally, considering cross-border mergers as a form of entry, we carry out an analysis of the entry effect in response to the performance and profitability of the incumbent market participants. Results show that mergers in the European banking industry have been effective. Although domestic M&As are more common than cross-border M&As, banks involved in cross-border M&As are more efficient. Moreover, cross-border merged banks seem to outperform incumbent banks.","[Fethi, Meryem Duygun; Shaban, Mohamed] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester, Leics, England; [Lozano-Vivas, Ana] Univ Malaga, Dpto Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",University of Leicester; Universidad de Malaga; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Fethi, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester, Leics, England.",avivas@uma.es; kkar@binghamton.edu; m.fethi@leicester.ac.uk; m.shaban@leicester.ac.uk,"LOZANO-VIVAS, ANA/L-5058-2014","LOZANO-VIVAS, ANA/0000-0001-7965-7061; Shaban, Mohamed/0000-0002-6939-113X; Duygun, Meryem/0000-0002-1112-0898",,,,,39,17,18,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In reality, a variety of economic, demographic, farm and farmer characteristics influence all the management decisions made by farmers, including those relating to AESs. In Ireland, the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) requires that farmers choose at least 2 biodiversity undertakings (BUs) from a menu as part of their AES contract. Using a multinomial logit model, the likelihood of farmers choosing different BUs was estimated using data from the 2007 National Farm Survey as a function of georeferenced habitat data. A comparison was then made between the probable selection of BUs with what would be considered the optimal selection from an ecological perspective. The results indicate that farmers' most likely choices of BUs only sometimes equates with the optimal ecological choices. This highlights deficiencies in the design of REPS, knowledge of which is very timely, given the imminent replacement of REPS by a new AES. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Different management actions reduce the impact of invasions differently: preventing invasion eliminates impacts entirely, surveillance can facilitate early detection and eradication, and removing individuals can reduce future impact. Few studies have examined the trade-off between all three facets of invasion management. Using a simple model of island invasion, we find how resources should be allocated to each action to minimise the total cost of management and impact. We use a case study of black rat (Rattus rattus) invasion on Barrow Island, Western Australia. The optimal amount to invest in each management action depends on the effectiveness of each action, and the magnitude of impact caused by different stages of invasion. If the pest is currently absent, it is more cost-effective to prevent impacts through prevention or surveillance. If the pest is already widespread, it can sometimes be cost-effective to give up rather than attempting eradication. This model of invasion can provide useful decision support by identifying the trade-offs inherent in each candidate management strategy, the thresholds that alter optimal strategies, and the parameters for which we need more information.

It focuses on one of the key periods in the history of energy. After a period of declining coal prices and soaring consumption which fuelled the Second Industrial Revolution, the nineteenth century British economy was externalising the social costs of energy production and consumption on a massive scale. Rising from 25% in the 1820s, an estimated 60%-70% of the average social costs of coal were externalised in the 1880s, imposing damages close to 20% of GDP. The eventual decline in air pollution concentration (around 1900) occurred fifty years later than was broadly socially optimal.

Measuring the importance of competition determinants of seaports, conventionally analyzed using a SWOT-analysis based on (transport) infrastructure as a prime requirement for port activity growth, is an important issue to port management. However, it seems that the institutional environment of a seaport is also critical in obtaining a competitive advantage. In Haezendonck et al. (2000 and 2001) those port specific advantages and disadvantages were identified using factor analysis and L1-regression on the perceptions of 75 respondents, all senior executives and experts, through a survey. As regards the results of this study, critiques were formulated on the use of perceptions, often biased due to the political lobbying potential of the results. Since respondents often see independent studies as an opportunity to obtain more or early government subsidies, attract new investment projects or at least highlight the attention on their specific problems and demands, they were prone to underestimating the positive impact of the key success factors of the studied seaport compared to its main rivals, in this case major seaports in the so-called Hamburg-Le Havre competitive range. The purpose of this article is to test the assumption that respondents significantly underestimate the positive impact of port specific advantages and to see which of the respondent subgroups within the 75 respondents sample are more responsible than others for this underestimation. In addition, we argue and demonstrate that the use of a stochastic frontier method is appropriate for this matter. Each of 25 considered competition determinants of the original study is decomposed into a noise and efficiency term, based on the Bayesian stochastic frontier model (BSFM). In this article, we find evidence that BSFM could be used to test the lobby-effect or underestimation of the real effect of determinants, that terminal operators as a subgroup of respondents, are more likely to underestimate the key success factors than the subgroup of port experts and that those determinants that are directly related to government action show more underestimation than competitiveness determinants that result from private investments.","[Haezendonck, Elvira; Jans, Tim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Econ Social & Polit Sci, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Haezendonck, Elvira; Jans, Tim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Solvay Business Sch, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [van den Broeck, Julien] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Antwerp,"Haezendonck, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Econ Social & Polit Sci, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",elvira.haezendonck@vub.ac.be; tim.jans@vub.ac.be,,"Haezendonck, Elvira/0000-0001-6733-6228",,,,,22,5,5,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We first consider the case in which the quality of the environment affects utility, but not productivity. This allows us to look at the trade-off between environmental quality and output. We then consider the case in which the quality of the environment increases productivity but does not affect utility. Our main results show that in both cases a unilateral implementation of a more stringent environmental policy by the domestic country raises foreign welfare under a benchmark parameterization. Our modeling strategy allows an analysis of how nominal rigidities interact with the implementation of environmental reforms, by allowing the domestic country to shift, through exchange rate depreciation, parts of the costs of more stringent environmental policies to the foreign one.

Optimal Medicare reimbursement policy depends upon the extent to which each of these explanations is correct. To investigate, we compare the consequences of the 1997 adoption of prospective payment for skilled nursing facilities (SNF PPS) in geographic areas with high versus low levels of hospital/SNF integration. We find that SNF PPS decreased spending more in high integration areas, with no measurable consequences for patient health outcomes. Our findings suggest that integrated providers should face higher-powered reimbursement incentives, i.e., less cost-sharing. More generally, we conclude that purchasers of health services (and other services subject to agency problems) should consider the organizational form of their suppliers when choosing a reimbursement mechanism.","[Kessler, Daniel P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Law, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kessler, Daniel P.] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Afendulis, Christopher C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dapartment Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA USA; [Kessler, Daniel P.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kessler, DP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Sch Law, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",fkessler@stanford.edu,,,,,,,30,5,8,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

However, DEA theory requires substitutability. In this paper, we illustrate the consequences of nonsubstitutability on DEA efficiency estimates, and we develop new efficiency indicators that are similar to those of conventional DEA models except that they require nonsubstitutability. Then, using simulated and real-world datasets that encompass fixed proportion technologies, we compare DEA efficiency estimates with those of the new indicators. The examples demonstrate that DEA efficiency estimates are biased when inputs and outputs are nonsubstitutable. The degree of bias varies considerably among Decision Making Units, resulting in substantial differences in efficiency rankings between DEA and the new measures. And, over 90% of the units that DEA identifies as efficient are, in truth, not efficient. We conclude that when inputs and outputs are not substituted for either technological or other reasons, conventional DEA models should be replaced with models that account for nonsubstitutability.","[Barnum, Darold T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Managerial Studies, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Barnum, Darold T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Informat & Decis Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Barnum, Darold T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Pharm Adm, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Gleason, John M.] Creighton Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Coll Business Adm, Omaha, NE 68178 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Creighton University,"Barnum, DT (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Managerial Studies, MC 243,601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",dbarnum@uic.edu; jgleason@creighton.edu,,,,,,,53,12,14,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

OLS estimates reveal that mixed-race slaves, slaves in the tobacco-producing Piedmont, and female slaves of female slave owners were manumitted at younger ages. Weibull proportional hazards estimates imply that the same groups were more likely to be manumitted. The results also reveal a markedly diminishing likelihood of manumission after Nat Turner's 1831 insurrection in south-central Virginia. The results are consistent with a principal-agent model in which slave owners contracted with slaves over consumption and future manumission to elicit effort and control shirking or other unproductive activities.","[Bodenhorn, Howard] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Bodenhorn, Howard] NBER, Clemson, SC USA",Clemson University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bodenhorn, H (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",bodenhorn@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,10,12,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JUN,2011,5.0,2,,,,,145,164,,10.1007/s11698-010-0056-x,0.0,,,20,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,756BX,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289987800003,0

The universal Medicare eligibility among kidney transplant patients provides a unique opportunity to explore labor supply responses to public insurance provision among a large number of men and women of prime working age and of all income levels. Although these patients are likely to be less healthy than the general population, upon receiving a kidney transplant, the main health problem of an individual with kidney failure, the lack of functioning kidneys, is removed. The income effects associated with the large transfer payment may discourage labor supply, while the potential health benefits of the coverage extension may promote labor supply. Results indicate that Medicare's increased medication coverage led to decreases in labor force participation among part time workers. These results suggest that potential labor supply reducing income effects should be taken into account when discussing the possibility of expanded public health insurance coverage, particularly for other groups of individuals with high expected medical expenditures, such as the elderly, or those with chronic conditions, such as diabetes. These results are useful considering the forthcoming expansion of government aid to purchase health insurance.","Florida Int Univ, Robert Stempel Coll Publ Hlth & SocialWork, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Page, TF (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Robert Stempel Coll Publ Hlth & SocialWork, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, HLS 2 554,11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",tpage@fiu.edu,,,,,,,18,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1389-6563,,,INT J HEALTH CARE FI,Int.

Economic growth is important for raising human living standards. But whether economic growth benefits the environment is unclear. Research into this relationship has focused on a U-shaped association known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). As economies grow, environmental quality initially declines but ultimately recovers and improves. However, environmental quality has been narrowly defined in the research, largely neglecting the availability and range of ecosystem services. Because these services derive from biodiversity, we use avian biodiversity as a proxy for environmental quality. Our results replace the U-shaped relationship with a lazy-S relationship. As economies grow, environmental quality initially declines, then improves over intermediate growth, but ultimately declines at higher growth. The EKC hypothesis has been used to forward economic growth as a means for improving environment quality. Our results call into question policies that rely solely on economic growth for reversing environmental decline. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show semi-uniform consistency of the estimator and provide an application to the stochastic frontier model.","[Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Horrace, William C.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University of Miami; Syracuse University,"Parmeter, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",whorrace@maxwell.syr.edu; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,"Horrace, William/I-6279-2015","Horrace, William/0000-0003-1325-5320",,,,,51,20,25,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Performance increases with golfing skill, but may first increase and then decrease with age as experience interacts with changes in physical condition. Similarly, mental fortitude or the ability of a golfer to perform under pressure may first increase and then decrease with age as experience interacts with changes in the ability to concentrate. Net performance on the tour is the result of both physical golfing skill and the ability to perform under pressure. We control for changes in physical skill and focus on the mental side of the game. The role of experience suggests an inverted U shaped relationship between age and mental performance that could vary significantly across golfers. We use Order-m FDH to calculate a measure of performance under pressure, and we confirm an inverted U-shaped curve with age. Along the way, we examine the ability to perform under pressure at the level of the individual golfer.","[Fried, Harold O.] Union Coll, Dept Econ, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Tauer, Loren W.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Union College; Cornell University,"Fried, HO (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Dept Econ, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",friedh@union.edu; lwtl@cornell.edu,"Tauer, Loren/AAD-6301-2020",,,,,,11,14,15,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Small ball refers to a manager's active intervention or strategy implementation in baseball games. In general, the frequency of managers' orders for play actions such as a sacrifice bunt is higher in Asian baseball than in North American baseball. This paper attempts to statistically test the hypothesis that small ball is effective in winning games by using data from Korean baseball. The panel data analysis of a stochastic production frontier model presents somewhat mixed empirical results, but the overall evidence suggests that small ball actually has detrimental effects on the number of runs scored.","Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",yhnlee@sogang.ac.kr,"Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446",,,,,27,11,11,7,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

It is important to identify those factors in order to design an appropriate policy that can enhance the compliance of restaurant operator towards the Halal standard. However, literature has shown that limited research has been conducted. Seven factors were examined through self administrated questionnaire distributed to 350 restaurant owners in Kuala Lumpur but only three are found to be significant namely lack of knowledge, supplier issues and governance issues. The finding shows that attitude and perceived behavioral control have significant relationship with behavior of non-compliance but subjective norm has no significant relationship with the behavior of non-compliance. This result will help relevant authorities to understand the critical factors that influence the non-compliance of Halal standard among restaurant operators to help them improve the formulation of appropriate policies in enhancing restaurant operators' compliance towards Halal practices.","[Ab Rahman, Ilyia Nur; Hashim, Dzulkifly Mat] Univ Putra Malaysia, Halal Prod Res Inst, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Saleh, Rosli] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ Management, 43400 Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,,ilyianur.rahman@gmail.com,,,"University Putra Malaysia Research Grant, under the Research University Grant Scheme [06-01-09-0686RU]","University Putra Malaysia Research Grant, under the Research University Grant Scheme","This study is financially supported by the University Putra Malaysia Research Grant, under the Research University Grant Scheme [06-01-09-0686RU].",,14,9,10,0,1,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-1015-6,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,24.0,,,,,,88,+,,,,,,3,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BEW94,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318458900018,0

We state the problem as a network utility maximization problem with QoS constraints and show that a distributed solution can be carried out. In order to fairly share the resulting revenue we study concepts from coalitional game theory and propose a solution based on the Shapley value and statistics on the revenues.

Design/methodology approach - Data were collected on 129 products of the Dutch food and beverages (F&B) industry announced in professional journals in 1998. Questionnaires were used in 2000 to evaluate product innovativeness, product innovation process factors and short-term market performance; whereas in 2005 long-term market performance was measured. Findings - The results show that there are considerable differences in the innovation processes of new versus improved products and in the role of process-related aspects in the short- and long-term market success of these products. Interestingly, taking the current emphasis on market orientation in the F&B industry into account, technology-related aspects are especially crucial for long-term market success. Originality/value - The study distinguishes between product development processes of new versus improved products and relates innovation process factors to the success not of the company as a whole but of the specific product that is under development. This is a new approach. Moreover, the success of products is measured not only soon after market launch, but also after several years. It fills an important research gap by investigating success factors of products that have become cash cows of F&B companies.","[Enzing, Christien M.] Technopolis Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Batterink, Maarten H.; Omta, S.

For recreational value evaluation we used method of questionnaires. More than 100 questionnaires were filled by visitors. The juniper formation was positively valued by visitors highlighting the quality of landscape, attractive walking conditions and convenient arrival. According to responses, more walking paths, better forest furnishing, waste management and management of the stand are needed in the site. For evaluation of ecological status, 20 sample areas, each of 400 m(2) were investigated. In each area all juniper (Juniperus communis L.) individuals as well as other arboreal species were characterized by their shape (a tree or shrub), diameter, height, age and health status. In 2008 the average parameters of junipers in formation were D = 10.1 cm, H = 6.5 m, A = 55 years. The average density of juniper formation was 1232 individuals/ha and most of junipers constitute the indigenous bush form of juniper (68%), the remaining 32% were growing in a tree form. The juniper formation consists of healthy individuals (10.8%), various levels of damaged (68.7%) and dead (20.5%). The main causes of damaged junipers: too high density of individuals within the group and the interaction between individuals, various felling damage, various juniper diseases. 22 species of shrubs and trees were identified in juniper formation: 15 native and 7 alien species. The density of these shrubs and trees exeeded 33 thousand of individuals/ha. The largest prevalence was of introduced species (76.7%). The status of juniper formation got worse within 10 years, the status index changed from 2.9 to 3.2.

In this article, we explore the politics around pursuits of adaptiveness in water management, emphasizing the major transboundary river basins draining the south and eastern Himalayas. We look at two main functions: storing, diverting and sharing water for periods of scarcity; protecting people and places from destructive floods. We find that the pursuit of adaptiveness will take place partly outside the range of human experience in a context of large differences in exposure and vulnerabilities, disparate interests and unequal power. Anticipatory policies and actions to adapt and improve adaptive capacity to the transboundary impacts of changes in water-use, land-use and climate on water resources and services are still in their infancy; but several problem-framing discourses are emerging that have longer-term implications for water governance. It is not yet clear how these competing policy-frames will evolve in Asia. Much will depend on how systems of water governance develop. Public scrutiny of how governments in Asia plan to adapt to climate change in the water sector-on how risks of not enough and too much water are dealt with-will need to continue to help sort out those projects and strategies which are driven primarily by political benefits from those which actually contribute to building adaptive capacities and maintaining social-ecological resilience.","[Lebel, Louis; Bastakoti, Ram C.] Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Xu, Jianchu] Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bastakoti, Ram C.] Asian Inst Technol, Bangkok 10501, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Lamba, Amrita] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Law & Governance, New Delhi 110067, India","Chiang Mai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Asian Institute of Technology; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Lebel, L (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",louis@sea-user.org,"Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Bastakoti, Ram C/0000-0003-2456-5420; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",,,,,114,23,23,2,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

While the prevalent accounting framework for carbon emissions is production based (Production-Based Principle, PBP), we here quantify the CO2 emissions on the basis of the Consumption-Based Principle (CBP) for Austria. At a methodological level, a Multi-Regional Input-Output model with full linkages is used to account for Austria's CO2 responsibility on a global scale. Estimates are carried out for the years 1997 and 2004. Results show that during 1997 CO2 responsibility based on CBP were 36% larger than those based on PBP. This relation has increased through time. The CBP indicator of 2004 was 44% larger than the PBP. In terms of carbon emission location, for each Euro spent on Austrian final demand in 2004, it is estimated that two-thirds of the CO2 emissions occur outside Austrian borders. Regarding the origin of the emissions embodied in imports, it is estimated that about one-fourth originated in non-Annex I countries in 1997. This proportion increased to one-third by 2004. Due to this divergence between CBP and PBP indicators, there is a need to rethink current accounting bases in order to properly assign CO2 responsibilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In principle, these problems can be mitigated by supplementing government financing with contributions from leading environmental service users. We use original survey data and official statistics to analyze user financing in Costa Rica's renowned national PES program, focusing on the amounts and sources of user financing, the drivers of contributions, and contributors' perceptions of the PES program. We find that user financing has supported less than 3% of the acres enrolled in the program and that hydroelectric plants are the largest private sector contributors. Large hydroelectric plants tend to contribute while small ones do not.

This multidimensional approach requires that special attention is paid to dimensional issues. However, many studies in economics, as well as in ecological economics, apply dimensional numbers to exponential or logarithmic functions. We show first that it is an analytical error to put a dimensional number x into exponential functions (e) and logarithmic functions (log ox). We introduce several examples of this analytical error both in ecological economics and conventional economics. These observations are presented with the hope that they will orient future quantitative analyses toward more constructive ends. Since the empirical and theoretical studies in economics often adopt the logarithmic specification of the production and cost function, we derive a procedure or an algorithm, concerned with the given data set, by which we can examine whether or not a particular logarithmic specification is superior to the usual regression specification in terms of the least square norm.

Understanding what factors have contributed to this pollution reduction in the U.S. as a whole, as well as in various regions within the country, has important policy implications. A recently developed regional environmental-econometric input-output model for the Midwestern states of the U.S. has been used to examine the causes of pollution reduction in this regional economy over a thirty-year period. Simulations conducted with this model suggest that, for the rate of growth experienced over the period, technological improvement has dominated economic structural change in the reduction of pollutant emissions. On average, technological improvement has accounted for approximately 80% of emissions reduction, while economic structural change explains the remaining 20% of the decrease. Our analysis suggests that, while much remains to be done in reducing emissions in both developed and developing countries, policies that are informed by an understanding of the role of structural change and which promote the adoption of more recently developed technologies may contribute substantially to sustainable development.

Results suggest that urban sprawl, income segregation, and jurisdictional disparities are driven by the same economic conditions and thus tend to co-exist.

This fundamental question acts as rationale for conducting an in-depth assessment as to whether the development of markets for ecosystems is both appropriate and sufficient when dealing with the restoration of natural capital of two degraded study areas within the Maloti-Drakensberg mountain range in southern Africa, which is a fire-prone grasslands ecosystem. The mountain range is South Africa's most strategic source of fresh water. While occupying less than 5% of South Africa's surface area, it produces 25% of the country's runoff through rivers, major dams, and national and international inter-basin transfers. Addressing the question, the study develops an integrated hydrology-ecology-economic model based on the functional relationships between these three aspects in managing and restoring the natural capital of the two study areas. It was found that the benefits of introducing improved management practices exceeds cost in low to medium degraded quinaries, but not in heavily degraded quinaries. The economic return on the water (baseflow) produced by such a system of improved land use management, however, far exceeds that of conventional (construction-based) water development programmes and offers meaningful economic and market development opportunities.

By analysing a newly constructed series of spinning wages in the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic, the wages of male and female textile workers for the same work could be investigated. At first sight, the evidence on equal piece rates for spinning men and women seems to rule out wage discrimination. Nevertheless, more deeply rooted gender discrimination resulting from the segmented seventeenth-century labour market restricted women's access to many professions. Exactly this segmentation determined differences in wage earning capacities between men and women.","Leiden Univ, Int Inst Social Hist Anisterdam, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Meerkerk, EV (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Int Inst Social Hist Anisterdam, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",,,"van Nederveen Meerkerk, Elise/0000-0003-1527-5798",,,,,56,20,22,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

One key issue arising from this is the challenge to develop scientific decision support methods that are capable of dealing with uncertainty in a systematic and differentiated way, integrating scientific as well as practical knowledge. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for perceiving and describing uncertainty in environmental decision-making. The conceptual framework consists of a general definition of uncertainty along with five complementary perspectives on the phenomenon, each highlighting one specific aspect of it. By using the conceptual framework, decision-makers are able to reflect on their knowledge base with regard to its completeness and reliability and to gain a broad picture of uncertainty from various standpoints. The theoretical ideas presented here are complemented by two empirical studies looking at how uncertainty is dealt with in the implementation process of the EU Water Framework Directive. The rather abstract differentiations are illustrated by a number of examples in the form of interview statements and excerpts from the directive and official EU documents. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Alonso, AD",,,,"Alonso, Abel Duarte",,,Farmers' relationship with hospitality businesses: a preliminary study,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Farms; Food industry; Hospitality services; Buyer-seller relationships; United States of America,AGRICULTURE,"Purpose - Numerous advantages exist for farmers as food producers and for restaurateurs as food sellers to be engaged in business relationships. While in many situations such relationships would seem a very natural process that would also benefit consumers, to date very little research has been conducted in examining the extent to which farmers are engaged in such relationships. The present paper aims to explore these areas from the farmers' perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured telephone interviews and two on-site face-to-face interviews were conducted among 30 farm owners/operators in the state of Alabama, USA. Findings - A very weak relationship was noticed between farms and hotels/restaurants in this study. While geographic distance or isolation could be assumed to be an impediment for both farms and hospitality businesses to interact, only two businesses mentioned such constraint as a reason for not engaging in business relationships. In contrast, not being contacted by hospitality businesses or not starting the contact, as well as concerns of not receiving the right price, or convenience by selling their produce by other means (on-site, farmers' markets) were some of the reasons farmers mentioned. Research limitations/implications - The low number of respondents and the selection of only those businesses that were advertised are acknowledged limitations in this study. Practical implications - Engaging in business relationships with restaurants may help farmers maximize the price they receive for their hard work, have a steady source for their product, or educate a new breed of consumers who value the importance of consuming fresher foods. To achieve these benefits, stronger interactions between both industries are needed, especially in cases where both restaurants and farms are geographically close to one another. Originality/value - The study investigates an area that has been neglected in contemporary research.","Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia",Edith Cowan University,"Alonso, AD (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Mkt Tourism & Leisure, Joondalup, Australia.",a.alonso@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Articles from five newspapers were collected and coded using the content analysis technique and analyzed for topic, tone, and theme. Findings - For a six-year time period, 618 articles on organic food and organic agriculture are analyzed and the prominent topics are found to be genetic engineering, pesticides, and organic farming. Articles with a neutral tone with respect to organic agriculture and food accounted for 41.4 percent of the articles, while positively toned articles garnered 36.9 percent. The themes human health, food safety, and environmental concerns were discussed with positive reference to organic food and agriculture in 81, 50, and 90 percent, respectively, of comments pulled from the articles. Practical implications - Analysis of these articles over time, between media outlets and by topic allows for understanding of media reporting on the subject and provides insight into the way the public is influenced by news coverage of organic food and agriculture. Originality/value - Research that analyzes media coverage for how it portrays the topic of organic food and organic agriculture with respect to health, food safety, and environmental concern, and concludes that articles about organic production in the selected time period are seldom negative.","[Cahill, Stacey; Morley, Katija] Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Powell, Douglas A.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University of Guelph; Kansas State University,"Cahill, S (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,,45,16,22,4,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A prospective four-week study investigating the predictive ability of HAPA variables and past behaviour was used. At time 1, 109 participants completed self-report questionnaires regarding their action self-efficacy, risk awareness, outcome expectancies and intentions to hygienically prepare food and past behaviour. At time 2, participants returned a follow-up questionnaire, which measured behaviour, planning, maintenance and recovery self efficacy. Structural equation modelling was used to compare three versions of the HAPA model. Findings - The first model showed that intention was a significant predictor of behaviour explaining 40 per cent of the variance and was the best fit. The second model, which included the volitional components of the HAPA model, did significantly increase the proportion of behaviour explained. The third model, which included past behaviour, increased the variance explained but was not a superior fit to the previous two models. Practical implications - The results of this study confirm that aspects of the HAPA may be useful in determining hygienic food handling behaviour. However, volitional variables do not appear to be important in this behaviour. The implications of this for future research and interventions are elucidated. Originality/value - The current study is one of the first to use the HAPA model to predict hygienic food handling behaviour.","[Mullan, Barbara A.; Wong, Cara L.; O'Moore, Kathleen] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mullan, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",Barbara@psych.usyd.edu.au,"Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019","Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899",,,,,43,18,24,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Environmental uncertainty is defined as the lack of information about the external environment and is obtained by integrating the perceived dynamism and complexity of the environmental variables. The measurements that are used are the result of applying the Rasch methodology to the information obtained by means of a questionnaire completed by the deciders of firms in the Canary Islands (Spain). Those measures permit the complexity and dynamism perceived by the groups of firms in the supply chain together with the levels of perceived dynamism and complexity of the environmental variables to be jointly positioned on a map. Findings - According to the perceptions of the members of the agrifood supply chain (agriculture, agrifood industry and distribution), the main sources of environmental uncertainty are demand and competitors. The agricultural sector perceives somewhat more uncertainty than agrifood industry sector, while the distribution sector perceives a stable environment. Research limitations/implications - The paper presents a useful tool for the business population and public institutions to identify which variables are perceived as the most dynamic and complex and how those variables are perceived by each member of the agrifood supply chain. Originality/value - The paper operationalises the proposal of Duncan by means of a new application of the Rasch methodology. The results reflect the thinking of the members of all sectors of a supply chain. It is one of the first to study the environmental uncertainty perceived in the agrifood supply chain from a strategic perspective as a fundamental antecedent of the promotion of vertical collaboration in the agrifood supply chain.","[Yanes-Estevez, Vanessa; Ramon Oreja-Rodriguez, Juan; Maria Garcia-Perez, Ana] Univ La Laguna, IUDE, San Cristobal Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Yanes-Estévez, V (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, IUDE, San Cristobal Laguna, Spain.",vayanes@ull.es,"; Yanes-Estevez, Vanessa/F-6965-2016","Garcia-Perez, Ana Maria/0000-0003-4252-8340; Yanes-Estevez, Vanessa/0000-0002-4834-7199",FYDE-CajaCanarias; Department of Economy and Treasury of the Canary Islands Government,FYDE-CajaCanarias; Department of Economy and Treasury of the Canary Islands Government,This paper has benefited from the Promotion of Business Research in the Canary Islands Universities Program of FYDE-CajaCanarias and the Department of Economy and Treasury of the Canary Islands Government for the 2007 subvention research program.,,73,30,32,2,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The model identified several key factors that modulate the evolution of inequality within societies.","[Zhang Fangfeng] Beijing Wuzi Univ, Sch Informat, Beijing 101149, Peoples R China; [Zhang Xuehu] Peking Univ, Beijing 453003, Peoples R China; [Tejaswini, More K.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA",Beijing Wuzi University; Peking University; Yale University,"Zhang, FF (通讯作者)，Beijing Wuzi Univ, Sch Informat, Beijing 101149, Peoples R China.",zzf_flora@163.com,,,Beijing Municipal Commission of Education [WYJD200902]; Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Institutions of Higher Learning Under the Jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality [PHR200906210],Beijing Municipal Commission of Education(Beijing Municipal Commission of Education); Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Institutions of Higher Learning Under the Jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality,"The idea of this paper originally began in CSSS 2005, so we are. grateful for the support we received from the CSSS organizers and fellow students.

Smith; J. S. Mill; Game theory; Co-evolution,,"The assumed selfishness of market actors could be considered in the context of two perspectives: macroeconomic and microeconomic. The first concerns the market mechanism as the most effective from the social well-being or the wealth of a nation points of view. The latter is based on the premises of the nature of human beings. I have distinguished between two possible ways of understanding selfish forms of behaviour in the market: as rational economic behaviour i.e. the most effective from the gains and losses point of view (i.e. public interests in the works of A. Smith) or as selfish from the psychological point of view (this is mostly presented by J. S. Mill's theory). The first approach seems to be concerned with the creation of the most effective market mechanism from the State's point of view. In the context of historical processes over 400 years, cultural evolution has been promoting selfish behaviour; for example, it was widely presented in T. Hobbes' works and then for over 200 years, the theory of A. Smith has been supporting and moulding the institutional context of market and social behaviour. Thus, positive economics describes the market created by the ideas of a neo-classical paradigm, which is based on the normative premises of A. Smith and J. S. Mill. Moreover, the virtual market behaviour described by effects (f. e. Veblen's effect) and failures seems to be a manifestation of a discrepancy between market reality and the classical assumptions. The social evolution of human beings has been advantageous to the human species. Moreover, from the social point of view, pro-social behaviour is natural as well as desirable and it has been preferred by the cultural evolution. Competitiveness assumes that somebody has to lose, because someone gains. Cooperation looks for gains for all the players. The choice is political, and not imposed by selfishness.

In common with previous studies, we find evidence for intraindustry spillovers, but none for general cross-industry spillovers. This picture changes when we take vertical industry relations into account. There are important productivity spillovers from plants in upstream industries. Interestingly, a similar effect cannot be found from plants in downstream industries. The number of plants in these sectors has no effect on plant-level TFP, just as the number of plants in other industries that are neither important upstream suppliers nor downstream customers also has no effect.","[Lopez, Ricardo A.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Suedekum, Jens] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Duisburg Essen,"López, RA (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall 105,100 S Woodlawn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rialopez@indiana.edu; jens.suedekum@uni-due.de,,,,,,,30,21,22,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Based on a large new data set on trade flows within and across the borders of Germany, I explore the geography of trade costs across Central Europe, 1885-1933. The key finding is that the German Empire before 1914 was a poorly integrated economy. This internal fragmentation resulted from cultural heterogeneity, from administrative borders, and from natural geography that divided Germany into eastern and western parts. After World War I and again with the Great Depression, internal integration improved, while external integration worsened in part because of border changes along the lines of ethnolinguistic heterogeneity. By the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, Germany was reasonably well integrated.","[Wolf, Nikolaus] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Wolf, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Lib Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",nikolaus.wolf@warwick.ac.uk,,"Wolf, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7461-2910",,,,,52,43,50,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

The value of real output is compared using purchasing power parity exchange rates. Output per hectare was nine times greater in the Yangtze Delta than in England. More surprisingly, output per day worked was about 90 per cent of the English performance. This put Yangtze farmers slightly behind English and Dutch farmers c.1820, but ahead of most other farmers in Europe-an impressive achievement. There was little change in Yangtze agricultural productivity between 1620 and 1820. In 1820, the real income of a Yangtze peasant family was also about the same as that of an English agricultural labourer. All was not rosy in the Yangtze, however, for incomes there were on a downward trajectory. Agriculture income per family declined between 1620 and 1820, even though income per day worked changed little since population growth led to smaller farms and fewer days worked per year. The real earnings of women in textile production also declined, since the relative price of cotton cloth dropped-possibly also because a larger population led to greater production. The implication is that the Yangtze family, unlike the English family, had a considerably higher real income c.1620, and that period was the Delta's golden age.","Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford,"Allen, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922531] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,53,18,27,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Other authors have examined trends in nominal spice prices, but this article uses relative spice prices, that is, accounting for inflation. We find that the Voyages of Discovery had a major impact on European spice markets, and provide a simple model of monopoly and oligopoly to decompose the sources of the Cape route's impact on European markets.
