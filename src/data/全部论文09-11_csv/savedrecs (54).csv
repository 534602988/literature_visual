We address how these changes have influenced anthropometric indicators of growth and nutritional status in Yalcoba, a Mayan farming community involved in the circular migration of labor in the tourist economy. Data are presented on stature and weight for children measured in 1938 in the Yucatan Peninsula and from 1987 to 1998 in the Mayan community of Yalcoba. In addition, stature, weight and BMI are presented for adults in Yalcoba based on clinic records. Childhood stature varied little between 1938 and 1987. Between 1987 and 1998 average male child statures increased by 2.6 cm and female child statures increased by 2.7 cm. Yet, 65% of children were short for their ages. Between 1987 and 1998, average child weight increased by 1.8 kg. Child BMIs were similar to US reference values and 13% were considered to be above average for weight. Forty percent of adult males and 64% of females were overweight or obese. The anthropometric data from Yalcoba suggest a pattern of stunted children growing into overweight adults. This pattern is found elsewhere in the Yucatan and in much of the developing world where populations have experienced a nutrition transition toward western diets and reduced physical activity levels.

Prices refer to the overall consumer price index as well as to the index without housing prices. To increase the efficiency of the testing framework, the analysis is based on panel unit root tests. First and second generation tests are applied. They indicate a lack of regional price convergence, as the null hypothesis of a unit root is usually not rejected. The second generation tests reveal that the source of the unit root is likely common for all regions. The results are very similar for the overall regional price level and the measure without housing prices, and for the Western and Eastern part of the German economy. The elimination of housing prices is not sufficient to obtain a price index where tradables dominate. One rationale of our findings is the persistent west-east divide in consumer prices. A second argument is related to the persistence of the price gradient between urban and rural regions.","[Dreger, Christian] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Kosfeld, Reinhold] Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, D-34127 Kassel, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Universitat Kassel,"Dreger, C (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cdreger@diw.de; rkosfeld@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de,"Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,29,12,12,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

THE IMPACT OF NONCLASSICAL MEASUREMENT ERROR,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EXTENT,"Measures of inequality and mobility based on self-reported earnings reflect attributes of both the joint distribution of earnings across time and the joint distribution of measurement error and earnings. While classical measurement error would increase measures of inequality and mobility, there is substantial evidence that measurement error in earnings is not classical. In this paper, we present the analytical links between nonclassical measurement error and some summary measures of inequality and mobility. The empirical importance of nonclassical measurement error is explored using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) matched to tax records. We find that the effects of nonclassical measurement error are large. However, these nonclassical effects are largely offsetting when estimating mobility, as measured by the intertemporal correlation in earnings. As a result, SIPP estimates of the correlation are similar to estimates based on tax records, though SIPP estimates of inequality are smaller than estimates based on tax records.","[Gottschalk, Peter] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Huynh, Minh] NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",Boston College; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA,"Gottschalk, P (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",,,,,,,,19,53,58,0,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This paper demonstrates that the cost structure of public-input production is relevant to their proposition on efficient capital-tax financing. That proposition holds if the per-unit cost of public inputs is exogenously fixed; however, it does not hold if public-input production exhibits scale economies. Also, this paper compares our analysis with the Zodrow-Mieszkowski model. That comparison illustrates the importance of the way public inputs are rationed to private firms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Sasser, AC",,,,"Sasser, Alicia C.",,,Voting with their feet: Relative economic conditions and state migration patterns,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Migration patterns; Relative economic conditions,INTERNAL MIGRATION; RETURN MIGRATION; AMENITIES; FLOWS,"Over the past decade, state and local policymakers and business leaders across the U.S. have expressed concern regarding the ability to attract and retain skilled workers, given the economic climate of their states compared with other parts of the nation. Examining the factors underlying state-level migration trends is important to determine what role, if any, public policy might play in addressing their potential impact on local labor supply. Using data from the Internal Revenue Service for each of the 48 states in the continental United States from 1977 through 2006, this paper examines the role of three economic factors namely labor market conditions, per capita incomes, and housing affordability in determining domestic state-to-state migration flows. Estimates from a logistic model of out-migration show that while all three measures of relative economic conditions are significant determinants of migration, the magnitude of their impact varies and has changed considerably over time. For example, the importance of per capita income as a determining factor has fallen considerably since the late 1970s, while that of housing affordability has risen. Interestingly, the role of labor market conditions while significant throughout the entire 30-year period was most prominent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Estimates from the model are used to forecast migration for 2009 for selected states. The results from this exercise are surprisingly accurate when compared to actual state migration patterns for that year.

Variables capturing the extent of asymmetries in the procedures to settle trade litigations perform significantly in estimation both across OECD countries and across French regions.

Schwartz's tournament equilibrium set (TEQ) ranks among the most intriguing, but also among the most enigmatic, tournament solutions proposed so far. Due to its unwieldy recursive definition, little is known about TEQ. In particular, its monotonicity remains an open problem to date. Yet, if TEQ were to satisfy monotonicity, it would be a very attractive solution concept refining both the Banks set and Dutta's minimal covering set. We show that the problem of deciding whether a given alternative is contained in TEQ is NP-hard, and thus does not admit a polynomial-time algorithm unless P equals NP. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic that significantly outperforms the naive algorithm for computing TEQ.","[Brandt, Felix; Fischer, Felix; Harrenstein, Paul] Univ Munich, Inst Informat, D-8000 Munich, Germany; [Mair, Maximilian] Univ Munich, Inst Math, D-8000 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich,"Brandt, F (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Inst Informat, D-8000 Munich, Germany.",brandtf@tcs.ifi.lmu.de; fischerf@tcs.ifi.lmu.de; harrenst@tcs.ifi.lmu.de; mairm@cip.ifi.lmu.de,"Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023",,,,,,24,16,18,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2010,34.0,4,,,,,597,609,,10.1007/s00355-009-0419-z,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,571KK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275750500004,0

A master and subproblem are proposed both of which are in the form of a complementarity problem or an equivalent variational inequality. These problems are solved iteratively until a certain convergence gap is sufficiently close to zero. The details of the method are presented as well as an extension of the theory from Fuller and Chung (2005, 2007). In addition, extensive numerical results are provided based on an electric power market model of Hobbs (IEEE Trans Power Syst 16(2):194-202, 2001) but for which stochastic elements have been added.

Our agenda conditions are tight.

We focus on tests for serial dependence and ARCH effects with possibly non-Gaussian errors. The tests are based on properly standardized multivariate residuals to ensure invariance to error covariances. The procedures proposed provide: (i) exact variants of standard multivariate portmanteau tests for serial correlation as well as ARCH effects, and (ii) exact versions of the diagnostics presented by Shanken (1990) which are based on combining univariate specification tests. Specifically, we combine tests across equations using a Monte Carlo (MC) test method so that Bonferroni-type bounds can be avoided. The procedures considered are evaluated in a simulation experiment: the latter shows that standard asymptotic procedures suffer from serious size problems, while the MC tests suggested display excellent size and power properties, even when the sample size is small relative to the number of equations, with normal or Student-t errors. The tests proposed are applied to the Fama French three-factor model. Our findings suggest that the i.i.d. error assumption provides an acceptable working framework once we allow for non-Gaussian errors within 5-year sub-periods, whereas temporal instabilities clearly plague the full-sample dataset.

Primary data on live births and infant deaths recorded in the official statistics and data of Armenia Demographic and Health Survey 2005 are studied. We find that the socio-economically disadvantaged portion of the Armenian population is at a significantly increased risk of infant mortality; that geographically the mortality risk is unequally distributed, and is highest in the poorest region, Shirak; and that the recorded decline in infant mortality is due entirely to a decline in post-neonatal mortality, with neonatal deaths currently accounting for more than 75% of infant mortality as a whole. We conclude that efforts to reduce infant mortality in Armenia, and probably in the rest of this region of commonwealth of Independent States, must involve policies and strategies that target infants' survival in at-risk populations, living in at-risk geographical regions, as well as addressing the issue of neonatal mortality among all Armenians.

The results corroborate previous Studies: average height increased during the second half of the 20th century for both women and men, better educated individuals are tallest, divorced men are shorter than married men and urban populations enjoy a height advantage over rural ones. We also compare the level and the trend in height to other postindustrial populations to identify key Causes of physical growth and conclude that the quality of the health care systems and equal access to it seem to have a greater impact than other redistributive aspects of the welfare state. The relatively low level of inequality ill health led to average height in Switzerland that are similar to those obtained in the Scandinavian social-democratic welfare states.

The approach modifies the outcomes of a multivariate lottery with a multivariate transformation and observes the change in the decision maker's certain equivalent. If the certain equivalent follows this multivariate transformation, we refer to this situation as multiattribute transformation invariance, and we derive the functional form of the utility function. We then show that any additive or multiplicative utility function that is formed of continuous and strictly monotonic utility functions of the individual attributes must satisfy transformation invariance with a multivariate transformation. This result provides a new interpretation for multiattribute utility functions with mutual utility independence as well as a necessary and sufficient condition that must be satisfied when assuming these widely used functional forms.

The agent's belief about future prices depends on his confidence in the forecasts made by other agents, measured by the distribution type of agents and by a confidence parameter. The resulting stochastic dynamical system is firstly analyzed in a deterministic setting, deriving conditions for uniqueness and stability of steady states and proving that, for high values of the confidence parameter, no complicated dynamics can be exhibited, hence the new component has a stabilizing effect on the qualitative dynamics. Differently, for small values of the confidence parameter, we prove the existence of a stability region in the parameters plane where the only possible dynamics is convergence to a steady state, while complexity is exhibited outside such region. Starting from the results obtained in the deterministic case, the model is then explored by reintroducing randomness. More specifically, we analyze the stability region in three directions: first of all, a robust estimate of the stability region's measure is provided; second, a long run equilibrium relation between the parameters of the system is obtained; third, the persistence properties of the series describing the bifurcation curves is performed. We finally underline some economic implications.","[Brianzoni, Serena; Cerqueti, Roy; Michetti, Elisabetta] Univ Macerata, Dipartimento Ist Econ & Finanziarie, I-62100 Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"Michetti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dipartimento Ist Econ & Finanziarie, Via Crescimbeni 20, I-62100 Macerata, Italy.",michetti@unimc.it,,"CERQUETI, ROY/0000-0002-1871-7371",,,,,14,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In any case, all these existing contracts provide an initial feasible solution for the two-sided market situation, perhaps non optimal in the sense the agents do not obtain jointly the maximum profit that they could get by cooperation. Therefore, the agents could be interested in improving their results through cooperation but taking into account the existing bilateral contracts. Thus, taking as starting point what each agent has got with the existing contracts, they have to distribute among themselves the extra amount that they could get by cooperation.

It focuses on two of the most established and lauded political-security networks: the ASEAN-Institutes of Strategic and International Studies (ASEAN-ISIS) and the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP), critically exploring their effectiveness and influence today. Drawing on extensive interviews, participant observation and an analysis of documentary sources, it concludes that there is little evidence to suggest these networks have affected the significant institutional change described in much of the literature. Rather, there is persuasive evidence that their influence on track one has waned in recent years. After canvassing a range of alternative explanations for this state of affairs, it argues that recent scholarship on track two has paid insufficient attention to the scope conditions that are a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for unofficial networks to successfully achieve policy diffusion. Non-official diplomacy can affect institutional change, but it is less common than most accounts suggest.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Polit Sci & Int Relat Programme, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Capie, D (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Polit Sci & Int Relat Programme, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,"Capie, David/0000-0001-5574-1103",,,,,68,28,32,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This paper develops and applies three complementary modelling approaches in order to uncover its fundamental and behavioural drivers over time and across intra-day trading periods. First, intra-day prices are related to systematic components, including economic fundamentals, strategic and market design effects. Then, residual volatility is attributed to: i) regular, non-linear agent reactions to market fundamentals (covariates of heteroscedasticity), ii) the adaptation of price formation due to substantial agent learning (time-varying effects), and iii) the transient extreme pricing in periods of scarcity (regime-switching dynamics). We find that, i) GARCH effects diminish, when each of the above sources of volatility is accounted for, and ii) allowing for the time-varying responses of prices to fundamentals can yield more precise volatility estimates than an explicit GARCH specification.","[Bunn, Derek W.] London Business Sch, London, England",University of London; London Business School,"Bunn, DW (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",nkarakatsani@rae.gr; dbunn@london.edu,"Bunn, Derek W/P-5247-2016","Bunn, Derek/0000-0003-1770-4488",,,,,71,40,41,3,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Despite improved energy efficiency, the baseline scenario would lead to a doubling in energy consumption by 2050 increasing further thereafter. CO2 emissions would continue rising, driven by the coal consumed in the power production which roughly follows the GDP growth; the scarcity of oil resources would trigger the development of alternative vehicles. Conversely, a 400 ppm CO2 eq stabilization case would lead to drastic changes in supply (renewables - biomass), transformation (carbon capture and storage) and demand (low energy technologies). It transpires that the contribution to the reduction effort of low stabilization compared to a baseline scenario would be similar for final consumption (36% efficiency and 10% fuel mix) and for the power sector (25% renewables, 25% CCS, 4% nuclear). In addition this low emission scenario would alleviate the tensions on fossil energy markets.","[Criqui, Patrick] Univ Grenoble France CNRS LEPII, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),,,,,,,,,24,40,41,0,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2010,31.0,,,,1,,49,82,,,,,,34,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,681SC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284336100003,0

Particular attention is paid to migrants' savings and transfers to family members in the home country. Our findings indicate that migrants who intend to stay in Germany only temporarily have a higher propensity to save and save larger amounts in their home country than permanent migrants. A similar picture emerges when considering migrants' payments to family members abroad. The results of a decomposition analysis indicate that temporary and permanent migrants seem to have different preferences towards sending transfers abroad, while economic characteristics and the composition of households in home and host countries are less relevant.","[Bauer, Thomas K.; Sinning, Mathias G.] RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Bauer, Thomas K.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Bauer, Thomas K.; Sinning, Mathias G.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Sinning, Mathias G.] Australian Natl Univ, RSSS, Social Policy Evaluat Anal & Res Ctr SPEAR, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Ruhr University Bochum; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Australian National University,"Bauer, TK (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",bauer@rwi-essen.de; mathias.sinning@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,4,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Many think the impossibility of being 'out of touch' leads to increased time pressure. In addition to claims that the mobile phone has led to harried leisure, others have argued that perpetual contact extends work into the home or intensifies work in other ways. In this article, these issues are explored using survey data employing some novel methodologies combining a questionnaire with logs of phone traffic recovered from respondents' handsets and a purposed designed timed diary of technology use. Overall, results show that mobile phone use is not associated with more harried leisure. Fears of work intruding into home life appear to be exaggerated. However, there is some evidence that frequent use of mobiles during working hours is associated with work intensification, at least among men.","[Bittman, Michael; Brown, Judith E.] Univ New England, Sch Behav Cognit & Social Sci, Discipline Sociol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Wajcman, Judy] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of New England; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bittman, M (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Behav Cognit & Social Sci, Discipline Sociol, Bldg E11, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",michael.bittman@une.edu.au; jude.brown@une.edu.au; J.Wajcman@lse.ac.uk,,"Bittman, Michael/0000-0001-9137-5542",,,,,45,103,117,6,55,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We estimate an open economy model of these two channels consisting of seven equations using the general method of moments with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation correction (GMM-HAC) with pooled data for four different samples of countries receiving remittances in 2003. The countries with per capita income below $ 1200 benefit most from remittances in the long run because they have the largest impact of remittances on savings. Their changes in remittances account for about 2 % of the steady-state level of GDP per capita when compared to the counterfactual of having no changes of remittances. Their ratio of the steady-state growth rates with and without changes of remittances is 1.39. Transitional gains are higher than the steady-state gains only for the human capital variables of this sample. As savings react much more strongly than investment an important benefit of remittances is that less debt is incurred and less debt service is paid than without remittances. All effects are much weaker for the richer countries.,"[Ziesemer, Thomas H.

The study's findings also demonstrate how state/provincial embeddedness has remained especially influential. To help bridge the gap between theory and concrete public policy making, the article's conclusion offers a set of factors to be considered by scholars and practitioners in their efforts to understand and compare growth trends in urban areas.

The paper makes two main contributions. 1) We construct an occupation-specific index of workplace centralization that accounts for the difference between average employment density from the perspective of employees in each occupation and average employment density from the perspective of all employees. 2) We provide empirical evidence that relative wages of central to non-central occupations increase with city size, or equivalently, the elasticity of wages with respect to city size increases with occupational centrality. We conjecture that this empirical regularity arises because, as city size increases, workers in more central occupations face an increasingly less desirable locus of housing prices and commuting times relative to workers who have jobs in residential areas. The results are robust to the inclusion of individual-specific human capital variables and city-specific fixed effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

'Hybrid' roles combining technical and traditionally female skills were seen as the way forward.

The literature about the Golden Age has emphasized supply-side explanations based on structural change, the reconstruction effort and the catch-up hypothesis, but also demand-side explanations focused on the effects of demand stability for promoting high rates of investment. In this article we have focused our attention on the evolution of the user cost of capital for explaining the high rates of investment. Our hypothesis is that the increase in investment rates was propelled by the decline in the user cost of capital, the consequence largely of the drop in the relative price of machinery. The embodiment of new technology and the reductions in trade barriers explain this decrease in the relative price of machinery.","[Cubel, Antonio; Teresa Sanchis, M.] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Cubel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Campus Tarongers,Avda Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Antonio.cubel@uv.es; m.teresa.sanchis@uv.es,"Cubel, Antonio/Q-9397-2018","Cubel, Antonio/0000-0002-0722-4934",,,,,81,3,3,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

For reasons of inadequate leverage and eroding legitimacy, the International Monetary Fund has not been effective in dealing with undervalued exchange rates. This paper proposes new rules in the World Trade Organization to discipline cases of significant undervaluation that are clearly attributable to government action. The rationale for WTO involvement is that there are large trade consequences of undervalued exchange rates, which act as both import tariffs and export subsidies, and that the WTO's enforcement mechanism is credible and effective. The World Trade Organization would not be involved in exchange rate management, and would not displace the International Monetary Fund. Rather, the authors suggest ways to harness the comparative advantage of the two institutions, with the International Monetary Fund providing the essential technical expertise in the World Trade Organization's enforcement process. There is a bargain to be struck between countries with sovereign wealth funds, which want secure and liberal access for their capital, and capital-importing countries, which have concerns about the objectives and operations of sovereign wealth funds. The World Trade Organization is the natural place to strike this bargain. Its General Agreement on Trade in Services already covers investments by sovereign wealth funds, and other agreements offer a precedent for designing disciplines for these funds. Placing exchange rates and sovereign wealth funds on the trade negotiating agenda may help revive the Doha Round by rekindling the interest of a wide variety of groups.","[Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Subramanian, Arvind] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",The World Bank; Johns Hopkins University,"Mattoo, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,23,10,10,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2009,32.0,8,,,,,1135,1164,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01199.x,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,472BT,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268104800001,0

J,"Weisdorf, J",,,,"Weisdorf, Jacob",,,Why did the first farmers toil? Human metabolism and the origins of agriculture,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Time-budget studies done among contemporary primitive people suggest that the first farmers worked harder to attain subsistence than their foraging predecessors. This makes the adoption of agriculture in the Stone Age one of the major curiosities in human cultural history. Theories offered by economists and economic historians largely fail to capture work-intensification among early farmers. Attributing a key role to human metabolism, this study provides a simple framework for analysing the adoption of agriculture. It demonstrates how the additional output that farming offered could have lured people into agriculture, but that subsequent population increase would eventually have swallowed up its benefits, forcing early farmers into an irreversible trap, where they had to do more work to attain subsistence compared to their foraging ancestors. The framework draws attention to the fact that, if agriculture arose out of need, as some scholars have suggested, then this was because prehistoric foragers turned down agriculture in the first place. Estimates of population growth before and after farming, however, in the light of the present framework seem to suggest that hunters were pulled rather than pushed into agriculture.","Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Weisdorf, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jacob.weisdorf@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,30,9,10,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Because obesity is more prevalent among the poor some have raised concerns that food assistance programs may encourage excess weight. This paper investigates whether the U.S. Food Stamp Program contributes to adult participants' weight as measured by body mass index (BMI). Results suggest that the typical female food stamp participant's BMI is indeed more than 1 unit higher than someone with the same socioeconomic characteristics who is not in the program. For the average American woman, who is 5 ft 4 in. (1.63 m) tall, this means an increase in weight of 5.8 pounds (2.6 kg).

The expected strain on public budgets and especially social security has received prominent attention, but aging poses many other economic challenges that threaten growth and living standards if they remain unaddressed. This paper investigates the potential benefits of pension and labor market reform for growth and living standards, taking into account behavioral reactions to specific reforms. Which behavioral reactions will strengthen, which will weaken reform policies? While Germany has a large unfunded pension system and vulnerable labor markets, Germans show remarkable resistance against pension and labor market reform. Can Germany maintain its standard of living even if behavioral reactions offset some of the Current reform efforts? The paper uses a novel modeling approach to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous components of labor supply in order to shed light on these questions.","[Boersch-Supan, Axel; Ludwig, Alexander] Univ Mannheim, MEA, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Börsch-Supan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, MEA, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",axel@boersch-supan.de; alexander@ludwig.de,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

However, researchers generally develop forecasts of the total tourism demand without considering the existence of its disaggregated components, which might have independent behaviour. As an alternative, the disaggregated approach models each component First and then sums these individual forecasts in order to obtain aggregate forecasts of the total tourism demand. This paper compares the aggregated and disaggregated approaches by ex post forecasting international tourist arrivals in Spain. The total tourism demand is disaggregated into 12 different origins. The HEGY test is used to check for regular and seasonal unit roots in each time series and SARIMA models are used to develop single forecasts. This empirical study finds slightly more accurate results using the disaggregated approach in multi-step, out-of-sample forecasting.","IFSP, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, BR-01109010 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Instituto Federal de Sao Paulo (IFSP),"Santos, GED (通讯作者)，IFSP, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, R Pedro Vicente 625, BR-01109010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",glaubereduardo@gmail.com,"de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo/G-9727-2013","de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo/0000-0001-8731-101X",,,,,18,5,5,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The main vocation of these areas was livestock production. Pastoral lands, which are subject to increasing pressure leading to their degradation, not only provide forage to feed livestock but also play a critical role in alleviating many of the most challenging environmental and ecological problems. Today, the situation is complex since phenomena of degradation, drought and grain price escalation. As a result, some breeders stop their activity in search of more lucrative chances. Others diversify their income sources by trying to carry small service activities in the neighbouring villages. But, when livestock production remains the main activity, they try to strive, after all, to maintain their flocks. Livestock rearing, frequently being the only possible activity in less favoured areas, is often fundamental to maintain social activities and contribute to the national self-sufficient in meat. This paper provides a summary of indicators demonstrating the economic importance and potential of the livestock sector in Tunisia in order to raise the awareness of decision makers on all opportunities this sector can offer if we can orientate the breeders' behaviour with respect to economic and climatic conditions. The paper focuses on the determinants of the production supply and on the livestock dynamic process by carrying out a relational analysis to determine the factors and the decisional variables which affect the productivity parameters and the behaviour of breeders in their decisions related to meat production and optima livestock size. We showed that the identification of such determinants allows decision makers to select the intervention tools according to target objectives.","Inst Reg Arides Medenine Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia",Institut des Regions Arides,"Jaouad, M (通讯作者)，Inst Reg Arides Medenine Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,1,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2009,8.0,2,,,,,31,36,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,470GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267962500005,0

In 1992, industrial-development-related projects constituted 98% of the portfolio in monetary terms, and environment-related projects 2% while, in 2004, the former constituted 43% and the latter 57%. However, the larger share of the environment-related projects in 2004 was only marginally, if at all, linked to UNIDO's industrial development agenda. A compelling explanation for this radical change in the organization's technical cooperation portfolio is provided by a model of strategic choice that draws on resource dependency and institutional approaches and that allows for staff strategic actions. Two factors, UNIDO's financial and confidence crisis in the 1990s and an organizational culture wedded to industrial development, shaped UNIDO's strategic responses, which, for the most part, did not integrate environmental concerns into industrial development projects and programs as instructed by its principal governing body.","Sustainable Prod Inst, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",,"Luken, RA (通讯作者)，Sustainable Prod Inst, Argentinierstr 4-12A, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",skipluken@yahoo.com,,,,,,,41,4,4,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Against this backdrop, this article asks how much 'constitution' is left in the new document. To answer this question, I assert that little is gained by classifying the Treaty in toto as a 'European constitution' or as the epitome of its failure. Instead, I develop an analytical framework that disaggregates the concept of constitution into its formal, material and symbolic functions, and systematically assess how far Lisbon would strengthen (or weaken) Europe's constitutional quality. The article suggests that, rather than transferring new competences to Brussels or making a constitutional saut qualitatif, Lisbon moderately bolsters the Treaties' formal functions; yet, in contrast to the Constitutional Treaty it adds little in material terms and is a decisive setback symbolically. Calls for ratification by referendum justified by the reform's extent are therefore ill-founded.","UCL, Dept Polit Sci, London WC1H 9QU, England",University of London; University College London,"Reh, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Polit Sci, 29-30 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England.",c.reh@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,15,21,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We argue that the nature of discovery and colonization of islands provides random variation in the length and type of colonial experience. We instrument for length of colonization using variation in prevailing wind patterns. We argue that wind speed and direction had a significant effect on historical colonial rule but do not have a direct effect on GDP today. The data also suggest that years as a colony after 1700 are more beneficial than earlier years. We also find a discernable pecking order among the colonial powers, with years under U. S., British, French, and Dutch rule having more beneficial effects than Spanish or Portuguese rule. Our finding of a strong connection between modern income and years of colonization is conditional on being colonized at all since each of the islands in our data set spent some time under colonial rule.","[Feyrer, James; Sacerdote, Bruce] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Sacerdote, Bruce] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Feyrer, J (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,,"Feyrer, James/0000-0002-2787-4264",,,,,55,82,94,2,34,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

A longer period under an IMF program increased government use of torture and extra judicial killing and also worsened the overall human rights conditions in developing countries. The use of a two-stage model ruled out the possibility that human rights practices would have worsened even if IMF programs had not been in effect. Previous studies of the impacts of IMF programs also found that they had worsened government respect for human rights. However, those studies did not control for the effects of selection.

Using the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member economies as a case study, we construct indices of importer and exporter transparency for the region from a wide range of sources. Our results from a gravity model suggest that improving trade-related transparency in APEC could hold significant benefits by raising intra-APEC trade by approximately US$148 billion or 7.5 per cent of baseline trade in the region.

This enables us to investigate the relationship between the conscripts' and the parents' socioeconomic status as well as their effects on the height of the conscripts. Overall, the conscripts' occupations match that of their parents rather well, and deviations can mainly be attributed to their young age. However, we also find significant height differences between the occupational groups of the conscripts even after controlling for the parents' occupations. This could be caused by a reverse effect of height on occupational advancements, but as conscripts doing manual work are generally shorter than those with non-manual occupations irrespective of their rank, we assume that the working conditions of the adolescents and young men actually influenced their growth.

Many also claim that this power will have negative effects on the EU. We examine such claims analytically, influenced strongly by spatial models of EU policy-making. We find that Turkey's preferences lie sufficiently outside the EU mainstream that it will have little influence in day-to-day policy-making under the assent, co-decision, consultation and co-operation procedures (or the common procedure in the Constitutional Treaty). Its influence may be more evident in areas such as the CFSP or JHA, where unanimity remains the normal procedure. Still, Turkey's veto power here is no different from that of other, much smaller countries. Furthermore, veto power can only block changes and cannot be used to pull the EU in undesirable new directions. Even this veto power can be avoided if the EU-27 establish whatever policies they desire prior to Turkish membership, forcing Turkey to accept a fait accompli. Despite these limitations to its power, Turkey may have some influence in purely intergovernmental settings such as negotiations over new treaties that might occur some decades hence.","[Pahre, Robert] Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Pahre, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, 361 Lincoln Hall,702 S Wright St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pahre@uiuc.edu,"Ucaray-Mangitli, Burcu/AAB-2940-2019","Ucaray-Mangitli, Burcu/0000-0003-1115-4462",,,,,80,5,5,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using this very limited database, decade-interval changes in real property prices are estimated-with varying degrees of precision. Our conclusions are two fold. First, adjusting for inflation, commercial office property values were 30% lower in 1999 than they were in 1899. Second, within any decade values often rise and fall by 20-50% in real terms. With these results, the long-term historic return to New York commercial property must mostly comprise yield with capital gains limited to general inflation.

The economic impacts of medical migration have been little researched, causing a polarisation in the debate between its critics and its proponents. The paucity of quantitative studies may be explained by the lack of comprehensive and consistent data. Investments in statistical resources on medical migration are therefore a major priority. The available evidence suggests that particularly English-speaking countries in Sub-Saharan African countries and the Caribbean with relatively few health workers and a high disease burden suffer most from the medical brain drain. However, the exodus of health workers is not the main cause of the health status crisis, but rather a symptom of deeper underlying problems, which often extend beyond the health sector towards the broader economic and political environment. In such situations, medical brain drain does pose challenges for human resource management and health service delivery. The only effective and long-term sustainable policy is one that addresses the underlying push and pull factors. Reforms have to be country-led, but may be supported via temporary migration schemes, remittances, enhancement of diaspora networks, and financial aid for which a strong moral case exists.","Royal Trop Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Rutten, M (通讯作者)，Royal Trop Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,97,19,24,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2009,32.0,2,,,,,291,325,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01147.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,408WX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467400005,0

In this article I apply the concept to NAFTA and look at two of its member states, finding that despite the low level of institutionalization, NAFTA has set in motion new forms of political organization and behaviour, and new demands for political action. This is especially marked in Mexico, and in certain sectors. It is also clearly visible in the changing patterns of cross-border bureaucratic communication. The main conclusions are that: (1) even in a lightly institutionalized regional trade agreement, the institutional, legal and civil society capacity of less-developed members is strengthened; (2) despite the absence of a formal process of policy or institutional development and the lack of legislative instruments, NAFTA has begun a hidden process of domestic adjustment in technical and specialized areas; and (3) like the EU, pressures to expand and strengthen NAFTA have emerged as a result of the initial agreement as well as extraneous factors. These conclusions may offer lessons to the study and practice of regional organizations elsewhere.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Studies, Edinburgh EH8 9LL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Aspinwall, M (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Studies, Edinburgh EH8 9LL, Midlothian, Scotland.",mark.aspinwall@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,22,26,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Second, we use a cointegrating vector of office employment and office stock to provide a better control of the demand for new construction than traditional indicators based on real estate prices and vacancy rates.

The analysis compares the net economic benefits of three immunization strategies with and without user fees: school-based vaccination for school children only (age 5-14), school-based vaccination for all children (age 1-14), and a mass vaccination campaign for all people older than one year. All options assume the use of a low-cost new-generation oral cholera vaccine. The analysis incorporates the latest knowledge of vaccine effectiveness, including new evidence on the positive externality associated with the resulting herd protection (both protection of unvaccinated individuals and enhanced protection among vaccinated individuals arising from vaccination of a portion of the population). It also uses field data for incidence, benefits (private willingness to pay, public cost of illness), and costs (production, shipping, delivery, private travel costs). Taking herd protection into account has important economic implications. For a wide variety of parameters values, vaccination programs in Beira pass a cost-benefit test. Small school-based programs with and without user fees are very likely to provide net benefits. A mass vaccination campaign without user fees would result in the greatest reduction in the disease burden, but the social costs would likely outweigh the benefits, and such a program would require substantial public sector investment. As user fees increase, mass vaccination becomes much more attractive, and the reduction in disease burden remains above 70 percent at relatively low user fees.","[Jeuland, Marc] Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Clemens, John] Int Vaccine Inst Seoul, Seoul, South Korea; [Whittington, Dale] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; International Vaccine Institute; University of Manchester,"Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",jeuland@email.unc.edu; marcelin@zebra.uem.mz; jclemens@ivi.int; dwhittin@email.unc.edu,,"Whittington, Dale/0000-0002-6075-8812",,,,,32,22,23,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Analyzing the determinants of transit ridership across US urbanized areas,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public transit; Ridership,TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; DEMAND; MODEL,"Public subsidy of transit services has increased dramatically in recent years, with little effect on overall ridership. Quite obviously, a clear understanding of the factors influencing transit ridership is central to decisions on investments in and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet the literature about the causes of transit use is quite spotty: most previous aggregate analyses of transit ridership have examined just one or a few systems, have not included many of the external, control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit service supply and consumption. This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas - in both absolute and relative terms - can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and nontransit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26% of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Main method used for the analysis is the wavelet variance decomposition. Wavelet variance (or energy) decomposes a variance of stochastic process on scale basis and hence is important tool for analysing financial time series. The wavelet variance is a suitable alternative to the power spectrum analysis based on the Fourier transform. Such scale decomposition help us to track the different energies on the tested stock markets and their evolution in time. The wavelet analysis of the tested stock markets shows different energies on scales during current financial crisis. Results indicate that each of the tested stock markets reacted differently to the current financial crisis. More important, Central European stock markets seem to have strongly different behaviour during the crisis.

The first strategy has to afford a lot of constrains from internal factors, the second strategy has to receive significant pressures from external matters, and the third strategy is the best strategy in the long-term.","[Wang Jiping; Zhao Man] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,SICHUAN UNIV PRESS,CHENGDU,"29 WANGJIANGLU, JIUYANQIAO, CHENGDU, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5614-4376-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,513,519,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268879300075,0

We investigate the mechanisms behind this relationship using data on German pre-teen students. We show that taller children are more likely to enroll in Gymnasium, the most academic secondary school track, and that primary school teachers provide more favorable school track decisions to taller students. We find that a 1 cm increase in height is associated with a 1.6 percentage points increase in the probability of attending Gymnasium. This holds even when controlling for academic achievement and parental background. In addition, we present evidence that height and social skills are positively associated already at age 2-3. We propose the association between height and noncognitive skills as a possible explanation of the height-school premium, even if discrimination cannot be ruled out entirely. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a Global VAR modeling approach, this article shows first that countries with a large trade exposure with the U.S. economy have a relatively larger sensitivity to U.S. developments. However, even for countries that do not trade so much with the U.S., they are largely influenced by its dominance through other partners' trade. Moreover, while no clear trend seems to emerge, it seems that the role of the U.S. in the global economy has changed over time. Overall, for most countries-the latest recession excluded-a change in U.S. GDP had weaker impacts-though more persistent-for most recent periods. The latest recession, however, led to some renewed increase in the sensitivity of the economies to U.S. developments.","[Dees, Stephane; Saint-Guilhem, Arthur] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Saint-Guilhem, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaisertrasse 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",stephane.dees@ecb.europa.eu; arthur.saint-guilhem@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,18,27,32,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It examines the relationship between the supply of fast-food restaurants and weight gain of pregnant women and their newborns. I study prenatal weight gain because excessive weight gain has been linked to postpartum overweight/obesity and I study both tails of the birthweight distribution because the origin of obesity may be traced to the prenatal period and both tail outcomes have been associated with obesity later in life. I merge the 1998 and 2004 Natality Detail Files with the Area Resource File, and County Business Patterns, which provide data on the number of fast-food restaurants in the metropolitan area where the mother resides. The empirical model includes an extensive list of MSA characteristics and MSA fixed effects to control for factors that may be correlated with both health outcomes and restaurants' location decision. Results reveal that the fast-food and weight gain relationship is robust to the inclusion of these controls but these controls greatly mitigate the fast food-infant health relationship. Greater access to fast-food restaurants is positively related to mothers' probability of excessive weight gain but it does not share a statistically significant relationship with birthweight. These relationships hold in all the socioeconomic and demographic subgroups studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our main findings can be summarised along the following lines: knowledge stock has a significant positive impact on a firm's productivity, with an overall elasticity of about 0.104; this general result is largely consistent with previous literature in terms of the sign, the significance and the estimated magnitude of the relevant coefficient. More interestingly, the coefficient increases monotonically when we move from the low-tech to the medium-high and high-tech sectors, ranging from a minimum of 0.03/0.05 to a maximum of 0.14/0.17.

However, an anomalous case of factory regime was found in Hengfa, a handbag manufacturing factory. This article studies workers' voluntary and hard-working attitude toward work, the institutional arrangement that organizes such workers' interests, as well as the broader context that generates workers' consent toward these institutional arrangements. First, the residential-working compound of Hengfa and the dormitory curfew have shaped the labour process into a game pursuing leisure time outside of the factory. Second, China's household registration system (hukou) has determined inner-migrant workers' residential status, making them rely on entrance guards and curfew as a protection for personal safety, and therefore has constructed the workers' consent toward the curfew. Based on this analysis, a particular type of state-capital interrelation and its effect on the labour process can be found.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Peng, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",tfpeng@berkeley.edu,,"Peng, Thomas/0000-0002-8701-4637",,,,,19,23,28,0,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The Use of Benford's Law on Regression Tables,JAHRBUCHER FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE UND STATISTIK,,,English,Article,,,,,,,1ST DIGIT,"The occurrence of scientific fraud damages the credibility of science. An instrument to discover deceit was proposed with Benford's law, a distribution which describes the probability of significant digits in many empirical observations. If Benford-distributed digits are expected and empirical observations deviate from this law, the difference yields evidence for fraud. This article analyses the practicability and capability of the digit distribution to investigate scientific counterfeit. In our context, capability means that little data is required to discover forgery. Furthermore, we present a Benford-based method which is more effective in detecting deceit and can also be extended to several other fields of digit analysis. We also restrict this article to the research area of non-standardized regressions. The results reproduce and extend the finding that non-standardized regression coefficients follow Benford's law. Moreover, the data show that investigating regressions from different subjects demands more observations and hence is less effective than investigating regressions from single persons. Consequently, the digit distribution can discover indications for fraud, but only if the percentage of forgery in the data is large. With a decreasing proportion of fabricated values, the number of required cases to detect a significant difference between real and fraudulent regressions rises. Under the condition that only few scientists forge results, the investigation method becomes ineffective and inapplicable.","[Bauer, Johannes] Univ Munich, Inst Soziol, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Gross, Jochen] Roland Berger Strategy Consultants Holding GmbH, D-80807 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Bauer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Inst Soziol, Konradstr 6, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",johannes.bauer@soziologie.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,19,5,5,0,12,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The idea is to consider the credit risk problem as a reliability model indexed by the age and in this way, many semi-Markov results could be adapted to describe credit risk problem. The default state is seen as a non working state. As the semi-Markov process is a generalization of Markov process, the presented model can be seen as a more general migration model. In fact, in semi-Markov environment the distribution function (d.f.) of the waiting time before a transition can be of any type and without the strong constraints of the Markov model. Furthermore, some results on the asymptotic behavior of the presented model are given. This permits the construction of the d.f. of the default random variable for each working state.

The paper explores the political-economy, feasibility and desirability implications of the two main alternatives, a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade (CAT) system. Having the same concerns, CAT systems in the EU and the US have accounted for different outcomes in each case. Likely leakages under foreseeable carbon prices are estimated to be small and not of an order of magnitude justifying the special allowances sought across a wide spectrum of industries. The experience of the EU and US reviewed here suggests that mitigation is likely to continue to be carried out under a CAT, provided permits are distributed for free to the lobbies whose support is necessary to get adoption of mitigation policies. This quota mechanism, long-used to allocate scarcity in the international trading system both nationally and internationally, would end up with the most powerful receiving the quotas rents, giving them the leverage and resources to maintain allocation schemes favourable to them.","[Mathys, Nicole A.] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Mathys, Nicole A.] FERDI, Paris, France; [de Melo, Jaime] Swiss Fed Off Energy, Bern, Switzerland; [de Melo, Jaime] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Neuchatel,"Mathys, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",,,"Mathys, Nicole/0000-0002-4981-0333",,,,,37,14,15,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2011,34.0,11,,,SI,,1938,1954,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01417.x,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,864SE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298259500006,0

We find that asset prices react strongest to other domestic asset price shocks, but that there are also substantial international spillovers, both within and across asset classes. The results underline the dominance of US markets as the main driver of global financial markets: US financial markets explain, on average, around 30% of movements in euro area financial markets, whereas euro area markets account only for about 6% of US asset price changes. Moreover, the methodology allows us to identify indirect spillovers through other asset prices, which are found to increase substantially the international transmission of shocks within asset classes.

Recently it was confirmed for the US movie theater industry. This paper investigates, whether such a price-concentration relationship can be found on local cinema markets in Germany as well, focusing on up-to-date mainstream movies. First, we develop a model of monopolistic pricing and estimate its parameters using data of monopoly markets from a new set of German micro data. Then we apply the estimated model to simulate monopoly prices on local markets with two or more operators and compare them to the prices actually observed in these markets. We find no significant difference in admission prices, which puts our study in contrast to the results found on local US markets. Searching for an explanation, we test whether movie theater operators even though being located in the same geographic area, are local monopolists, but find no hint of that, either.","[Boehme, Enrico; Mueller, Christopher] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Böhme, E (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",boehme@econ.uni-frankfurt.de; christmu@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Accurate forecasts of ridership are necessary for the planning and operation of transit services. In this paper, monthly ridership of the Metropolitan Tulsa Transit Authority is analyzed to identify the relevant factors that influence transit use. Alternative forecasting models are also developed and evaluated based on these factors-using regression analysis (with autoregressive error correction), neural networks. and ARIMA models-to predict transit ridership. It is found that a simple combination of these forecasting methodologies yields greater forecast accuracy than the individual models separately. Finally, a scenario analysis is conducted to assess the impact of transit policies on long-term ridership. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that within countries the results are sensitive to the statistical assumption made on initial conditions, the inclusion of serial correlation and the assumption of strict exogeneity of children.

Recently many retail gasoline markets in the mid-western United States and other countries have been shown to exhibit price cycles in which competition generates rapid cyclical retail price movements. We show that cost changes in cycling markets are passed on two to three times faster than in markets without cycles. We argue that the constant price movement inherent within the Edgeworth cycle eliminates price frictions and allows firms to pass on cost fluctuations more easily.,"[Lewis, Matthew] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Noel, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Lewis, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Lewis, Matthew S/D-2537-2010","Lewis, Matthew/0000-0002-2211-6595",,,,,15,53,60,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We analyze non-linearities in both the effect of distance from the highway and the effect of time relative to the completion of the road segment. While previous studies of the effects of nearby amenities on property and land values have focused on either cross-sectional spatial or temporal patterns, the joint analysis of the two dimensions has not been thoroughly investigated. We use home sale data from a period of 11 years centered around the completion of a new highway extension in metropolitan Los Angeles. We combine a standard hedonic model with a spline regression technique to allow for non-linear variations of the effect along the temporal and spatial dimensions. Our empirical results show that the maximum home price appreciation caused by the new highway extension occurs at moderate distances from the highway after it is completed. Lower price increases for this period are observed for homes sold closer to the highway or much further away. This price pattern gradually fades away in the years following the construction completion. A similar, although weaker, price pattern is also observed in the first years of the construction period. There is no statistically significant distance dependency in the 2 years in our sample prior to the beginning of the construction. This indicates that the housing market is not fully efficient as the information about the impending construction of the highway is not immediately incorporated into sales prices.","[Chernobai, Ekaterina; Carney, Michael] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Finance Real Estate & Law, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Reibel, Michael] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Geog & Anthropol, Pomona, CA 91768 USA",California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona,"Chernobai, E (通讯作者)，Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Finance Real Estate & Law, 3801 W Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",echernobai@csupomona.edu,,,,,,,43,34,38,0,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We investigate overcrowding and find major regional differences. Scottish households in the survey were more overcrowded despite being less poor. Investigating the causes of this overcrowding, we find little support for supply-side theories or for the idea that the Scottish households in our survey experienced particularly great variations in income, causing them to commit to overly modest accommodation. We present evidence that is consistent with idea that particularly tough Scottish tenancy and local tax laws caused excess overcrowding. We also provide evidence that Scottish workers had a relatively high preference for food, rather than housing, expenditure, which can be at least partly attributed to their inheritance of more communal patterns of urban living.","[Gazeley, Ian] Univ Sussex, Dept Hist, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Newell, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Newell, Andrew] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Scott, Peter] Univ Reading, Sch Management, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Reading,"Gazeley, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Hist, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",I.S.gazeley@sussex.ac.uk; a.t.newell@sussex.ac.uk; p.m.scott@henley.reading.ac.uk,,"Scott, Peter/0000-0003-1230-9040; Gazeley, Ian/0000-0002-4277-1001",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,32,3,3,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

EVIDENCE ON COGNITIVE BIASES,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RETURNS; PROBABILITIES; EARNINGS,"A pervasive concern with the use of subjective data in choice models is that they are biased and endogenous. This paper examines the extent to which cognitive biases plague subjective data, and specifically addresses the questions of: (1) whether cognitive dissonance affects the reporting of beliefs; and (2) whether individuals exert sufficient mental effort when probed about their subjective beliefs. For this purpose, I collect a unique panel dataset of Northwestern University undergraduates which contains their subjective expectations about major-specific outcomes for their chosen major as well as for other alternatives in their choice set. I do not find evidence of cognitive biases systematically affecting the reporting of beliefs. By analyzing patterns of belief updating, I can rule out cognitive dissonance being of serious concern in the current setting. There does not seem to be any systematic (non-classical) measurement error in the reporting of beliefs: I do not find systematic patterns in mental recall of previous responses, or in the extent of rounding in the reported beliefs for the various majors. Comparison of subjective beliefs with objective measures suggests that students have well-formed expectations. Overall, the results paint a favorable picture for the use of subjective expectations data in choice models.

A simple two-stage empirical procedure is developed and implemented for a selected medium-sized metropolitan statistical area. Using hedonic pricing parameters estimated in the first stage, LIHTC ceiling rents are compared to predicted market rents. The findings indicate rent savings constitute a relatively small fraction of the programs costs, suggesting developers and investors may capture some of the program's benefits.

To quantify tendencies towards integration, an AR(1) model of regional price differentials is augmented with a trend term that is capable of displaying asymptotic decay (indicating price convergence). The results obtained suggest that only about one-fifth of Russia's regions appear as not integrated and showing no tendency towards integration over the sample period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such instruments, which come into existence through innovation or financial deregulation, allow more borrowing than otherwise would occur in previously affordability-constrained markets. Within the context of a model with an endogenous rent-buy decision, we demonstrate that the supply of aggressive lending instruments temporarily increases the asset prices in the underlying market because agents find it more attractive to own or because their borrowing constraint is relaxed, or both. This result implies that the availability of aggressive mortgage lending instruments magnifies the real estate cycle and the effects of fundamental demand shocks. We empirically confirm the predictions of the model using recent subprime origination experience. In particular, we find that regions that receive a high concentration of aggressive lending instruments experience larger price increases and subsequent declines than areas with low concentration of such instruments.

Previous studies have shown that weight status varies along socioeconomic lines but remains largely unaffected by economic shocks over time. This study is the first that explicitly analyses the impact of food prices on adult BMI and obesity in the Russian Federation. Using panel data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey from 1994 to 2005, that included 10,551 urban respondents over 18 years, a reduced form weight demand function is estimated. Controlling for individual heterogeneity by a fixed-effects model, price-weight elasticities are derived. The main result is that food prices are not the essential determinants of BMI and obesity in Russia. Elasticities of BMI with respect to single food prices are low and show absolute values smaller than 0.01. However, some products like chicken meat, milk, onions and butter show significant price effects on body mass. A 20% increase in the price of chicken meat would cause a reduction in body weight of 112 g on average. In contrast to the United States, it is mainly high-income households that show significant weight reactions to food prices in Russia. Separate regressions by gender showed significant effects of milk and butter prices on male BMI and of onion prices on female BMI. The risk of being obese is even less affected by price.

The first objective of this paper is to assess the extent to which applied tariffs can be legally raised without violating bound tariff obligations and compare it with what is economically feasible. The second objective is the examination of whether individual countries have taken advantage of these legal tariff hikes as protectionist responses during economic crises, after the creation of the WTO.

To this effect it uses the CWS integrated assessment model. After a reminder of the two game theoretical stability notions involved-core-stability and internal-external stability-and of the CWS model, the former property is shown to hold for the grand coalition if resource transfers of a specific form between countries are introduced. The latter property appears to hold neither for the grand coalition nor for most large coalitions whereas it is verified for most small coalitions in a weak sense that involves transfers. Finally, coalitions, stable in either sense, that perform best in terms of carbon concentration and global welfare are always heterogeneous ones. Therefore, if coalitional stability is taken as an objective, promoting small or homogeneous coalitions is not to be recommended.","[Brechet, Thierry; Gerard, Francois; Tulkens, Henry] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Brechet, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management, Chair Lhoist Berghmans Environm Econ & Management, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Bréchet, T (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",thierry.brechet@uclouvain.be,,"Gerard, Francois/0000-0003-1397-7155",Belgian Science Policy [SD/CP/05A],Belgian Science Policy(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),The authors wish to thank Johan Eyckmans for the collaboration under the CLIMNEG project.

A key feature of the C-STGARCH model is that its transition function depends on all the parameters of the model as well as on the data. The structural properties of the model are investigated, in addition to the finite-sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of its parameters.

Smith's distinctive approach that sees nature and space as produced by capitalist relations of production helps resolve some of the longstanding debates within the study of agriculture.

At the root of Ortes' work is the problem of poverty caused by the unbalanced distribution of goods produced in a nation, thus resulting in the suffering of a small or large portion of its population. For this reason, and with inspiration from W. Petty, Ortes proposed Political Geometry to obtain, thanks to set theoretical principles, reliable estimates of the most significant macroeconomic figures. For this purpose, Ortes carried out an exhaustive ten-year study into the Venetian State of the late 1700's to measure the amount of goods required to ensure the decent subsistence of each of its citizens. By meticulously analysing the productive structure as well as the techniques then in use and with the help of experts in human physiology and other disciplines, Ortes attempted to collect the data needed to construct a system of indicators to establish a socio-economic balance in the Veneto.","[Erba, Alighiero] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Erba, A (通讯作者)，Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",alighiero.erba@teletu.it,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

However, the water carrying capacity would change with the change of people's living standards, consumption habits, the rate of population growth and so on. (C) The water resources carrying capacity in northern Xinjiang is higher than the southern. Within southern Xinjiang, it is higher in estern chan western. Generally, it shows a decreasing trend from northern to southwestern.

The secretariat of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is no different. This study reveals a fundamental 'misfit' between external demands and internal dynamics in the OECD Secretariat. On one hand, the OECD analysts are employed on the basis of merit. Compared to the employees in the central administrations in many OECD member states, the OECD personnel are very competitive in terms of experience and academic skills. Thus, the OECD Secretariat can be seen as a veritable powerhouse of idea generation, data collection and analysis. On the other hand, the OECD member states seem to be reluctant to let the OECD do what it does best: produce bright, challenging and provocative ideas. In many regards, the OECD personnel are, in practice, being reduced to undertaking basic secretariat functions such as organizing meetings, writing summaries and arbitrating between conflicting national interests. Despite having a vast role repertoire of roles at their disposal, this article reveals the paradox when OECD officials play out only two roles: the epistemic role, in which creative thinking and innovation are rewarded, and the bureaucratic role, in which rule following and regularity are rewarded. This paradox is characterized as a role dilemma that is compatible with the idea of the OECD as an international compound bureaucracy. The article concludes by suggesting three scenarios of how the observed dissonance between the internal and external dimensions of the OECD identity can be accommodated.","[Marcussen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Trondal, Jarle] Univ Agder, Dept Polit Sci & Management, Kristiansand, Norway",University of Copenhagen; University of Agder,"Marcussen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,"Marcussen, Martin/0000-0002-4614-286X",,,,,76,22,22,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Cultivated banana is affected by a number of diseases and pests. Genetic improvement of the crop has resulted in the development of a number of hybrids. However, these hybrids have been derived from limited Musa germplasm. Modern plant breeding is considered to reduce crop diversity although new molecular data appear to refute this idea. Variation in Musa is hypothesised to have arisen mainly from mutations, though a number of other mechanisms could be involved, such as somaclonal variation, transposable element activity, new genome combinations, polyploidy, genome duplications, mitotic recombination and recombination of novel alleles. In this paper, we demonstrate that banana breeding schemes that cross wild diploids with genetically uniform landraces increases the genetic diversity of East African highland banana. Banana breeding programmes have a greater opportunity of supplying small-scale farmers with a range of genotypes that would help to maintain the current diversity observed in farmers' fields.","[Nyine, M.] Int Inst Trop Agr, Kampala, Uganda",,"Nyine, M (通讯作者)，Int Inst Trop Agr, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda.",,"Pillay, Michael/JPX-3230-2023; Pillay, Michael/L-9954-2013","Pillay, Michael/0000-0003-1508-801X;",,,,,41,7,7,1,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,225,229,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.897.24,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200024,0

The argument is made that contemporary institutional and 'Varieties of Capitalism' as well as 'Varieties of Unionism' perspectives on labour market reform have overstated the power of states, institutions and organised interests in deflecting global economic pressures. Drawing on a range of recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) statistics and qualitative studies, it is claimed that current developments in finance and corporate governance mark a fundamental break with post-war developments. Capital has reasserted its power over organised labour and labour markets not only in the US and UK, but throughout Western Europe as well. In assessing how far this reversal has gone, the article focuses on three key political economic changes: i) the rise in finance and adoption of corporate 'shareholder' systems; ii) the expansion of mergers and acquisitions and their negative effects on unionisation and manufacturing jobs; and iii) the effects of financial pressures and corporate reform on collective bargaining and wages. This is the first study to report on comparative changes and qualitative reforms to both finance and labour in 13 OECD countries between 1980 and 2005.","Laurentian Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",Laurentian University,"Peters, J (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",jpeters@laurentian.ca,,,,,,,69,49,51,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It argues that codes of conduct not only reflect an uneven division of labour - in which firms are stratified in size, productivity and labour conditions - but actively shape it. Using examples drawn from light-manufacturing industries in China, it illustrates how labour codes of conduct feed into these processes of uneven development. In their reaction to the implementation of codes of conduct across global supply chains, some Chinese suppliers at the higher tiers of industrial structure have sought to substitute capital for labour as a way to increase productivity beyond abusive labour conditions. Simultaneously, many smaller firms at lower tiers that are reliant on cut-throat forms of discounting have evolved elaborate schema of falsifying code of conduct processes and reports. Finally, mid-tier firms tend to display a strategically partial degree of compliance. Code provisions that empower workers to self-organise are commonly undermined because such trends threaten the very political basis upon which the restructuring the global division of labour over the past four decades has been predicated.","Queens Univ, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Taylor, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",marcus.taylor@queensu.ca,,"Taylor, Marcus/0000-0003-0944-601X",,,,,72,54,55,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Through the statistics of the Chinese tech-hours, this article considers that the Chinese students in polytechnic institute have too less tech-hours for practice to train technical skills. And meantime, the student numbers and laboratory numbers have not reached a common ratio. To solve the above problems, one of the effective methods is to use the resources of society, including offices, enterprises and factories etc. According to the analysis of the studying record, this article puts forward a proposal that the report card should be reformed. Especially, the practical report list should include more details instead of today only one number.

It is among the most influential recent innovations in mainstream economics - Paul Krugman was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics for his contributions to the NEG, and it provided the theoretical inspiration for the World Bank's 2009 World Development Report. Drawing on the work of David Harvey and Henri Lefebvre, this article interprets the NEG as a colonising project in both its theoretical claims and its practical applications. Theoretically, the NEG colonises the disciplinary terrain of economic geography while replacing its substantive content with the abstractions of neoclassical economics. Inpractical terms, the NEG has been instrumental in the World Bank's 'new spatial approach to development', which aims to fully colonise peripheral regions of the global economy through constructing the spatial infrastructures necessary for globalised production and exchange. The social contradictions implicit in this project are revealed in the case of the Plan Puebla Panama', a regional development programme for southern Mexico and Central America, based on the NEG, and identified by the World Bank as a prototype for its spatial approach to development. The article thus provides a critique of the NEG as a theoretical approach and as a policy tool, demonstrating the increasing significance of the production of space within the neoliberal project, and cautioning against the transformation of socio-spatial reality in the image of technocratic abstractions.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Wilson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",japhy.wilson@manchester.ac.uk,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,,,,,97,25,28,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

These tests, however, could be biased if the real exchange rate contained MA roots. Indeed, two independent arguments claim that the real exchange rate, being a sum of a stationary and a non-stationary component, is possibly an ARIMA (1, 1, 1) process. Monte Carlo simulations show how systematic changes in the parameters of the components, of the test equation and of the correlation matrix affect the size of first and second-generation panel unit root tests. Two components of the real exchange rate-the real exchange rate of a single good and a weighted sum of relative prices-are constructed from the data for a panel of countries. Computation of the relevant parameters reveals that panel unit root tests of the real exchange rate are severely oversized, usually much more so than simple augmented Dickey-Fuller tests. Thus, the evidence for purchasing power parity from first and second-generation panel unit root tests may be merely due to extreme size biases.","[Fischer, Christoph] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Porath, Daniel] Univ Appl Sci Mainz, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Fischer, C (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",christoph.fischer@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,33,1,1,1,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Precise figures are, however, crucial if we are to arrive at a correct depiction of the political economy of the Third Reich. Based on previously neglected sources, it will be shown that, beginning in 1936/7, Germany experienced a spectacular investment boom, primarily targeted at broadening the industrial foundation for war.

In contrast, the empirical literature has only examined linear cointegration. This article argues that ignoring nonlinear cointegration may lead to misleading conclusions that no cointegration exists between house prices and the fundamentals. To illustrate this point, I test for cointegration for ten U.S. cities and find that only one city shows evidence of linear cointegration. Further analysis using the two-step testing procedure yields evidence of nonlinear cointegration for six other cities. Still, there are three cities left out without evidence of nonlinear cointegration. Further studies are needed to test for other forms of nonlinear cointegration before a conclusion of no cointegration can be reached for the remaining three cities.","Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,43,33,36,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2010,38.0,4,,,,,599,632,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00273.x,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,682VN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284431200001,0

Mortgage termination due to mobility, default and refinancing provides a lens for evaluating property market adjustments. The borrower's decision to move as an adjustment mechanism in the property market is associated with utility-maximizing decisions to either prepay or default on the mortgage. The optimal choice between these two termination events may depend on unobserved propensities related to change in income, job location, or family size, and substantial inertial forces including search costs, neighborhood change and attachment to an area. We propose a method for modeling variables determining the impact of mobility on mortgage terminations with imperfect household and loan level data. Since omitted variables contribute to moving decisions and therefore to mortgage prepayment and default decisions, utility functions for sale and default are correlated through these unobservable variables; thus, the IIA assumption of the widely used Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) is violated. Under such circumstances, econometric theory suggests that the Nested Logit Model (NMNL) is a better choice, which obviates the limitation of MNL by allowing correlation in unobserved factors across alternatives. Using loan level micro data, we find empirical evidence showing significant correlation between sale and default due to omitted borrower mobility characteristics. Our simulations find that NMNL out performs MNL in out-of-sample prediction. Improved predictions of moves and defaults are applicable to micro and macro analysis of the housing market system.","[An, Xudong] San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Clapp, John M.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business Adm, Ctr Real Estate, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Connecticut; University of Southern California,"An, XD (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",xan@mail.sdsu.edu; john.clapp@business.uconn.edu; ydeng@usc.edu,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171; Clapp, John/0000-0002-0342-367X",,,,,52,9,12,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The extent of the dynamics of firms' participation within the funding scheme gives information about the openness of the scheme towards non-participating firms. Using firm-level data on German manufacturing and knowledge-intensive service firms, it turns out that participation in the funding scheme shows a rather high level of continuity. This is also confirmed by applying a multivariate approach. Firms which received funding in the past are more likely to be selected for public funding again. Moreover, a firm's size and knowledge capabilities increase the probability of entering the scheme.","ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Aschhoff, B (通讯作者)，ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",aschhoff@zew.de,,,,,,,40,28,28,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Although substituting local food for imported produce will not necessarily reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the food miles movement is widely supported by consumers and import-competing producers, especially in some parts of Western Europe. We investigate the economic implications of food miles preference changes in the UK, France and Germany on other nations using an economy-wide model. Among the regions we consider, New Zealand is the most distant from Western Europe and Madagascar and Malawi export the most agro-food products relative to GDP, so food miles movements have the largest impacts on these regions. When there is a linear relationship between distance and preference changes, food miles campaigns decrease welfare in New Zealand, Madagascar and Malawi by 0.30, 0.12 and 0.28 per cent, respectively. When there is a preference shift away from imported food unrelated to distance, proportional welfare losses in the three countries are, respectively, 0.11, 0.08 and 0.24 per cent. With the exception of New Zealand, these findings indicate that some of the world's poorest nations will suffer the most from European food miles lobbying. We conclude that food miles campaigns will increase global inequality without necessarily improving environmental outcomes.","[Winchester, Niven] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Winchester, Niven] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Otago,,,,"Winchester, Niven/0000-0003-2703-4596",,,,,30,9,10,3,40,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2010,33.0,10,,,,,1201,1217,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01270.x,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,658UY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282516100001,0

A special emphasis is put on the role of the interregional differences in Belgium. Our results partly confirm previous findings for Belgium suggesting that municipalities interact over the local surcharge on the (labor) income tax rate but not on the local surcharge on the property tax. Using spatial econometrics tools and an original methodology for specifying weight matrices, we find that municipalities are sensitive to the local income tax rates set by only their closest neighbors. We cannot reject the hypothesis that interregional differences matter for municipalities belonging to the Brussels region: for the local income tax rate, the intensity of interactions is shown to be higher between municipalities belonging to the Brussels region than between municipalities belonging to different regions.

The paper considers a refinement of the commonly used contiguity matrix which exploits information on commuting flows between locations. Within the set of contiguous jurisdictions, the matrix assigns higher weights to localities for which commuting patterns suggest that households would view them as substitute locations to reside in. The concept is then applied to cities and townships in New England. Using the expenditure competition effect on local police spending as an example, we show that commuting-adjusted weighting schemes give estimates which differ substantially from those obtained using a standard contiguity matrix.

Furthermore, there are evidence suggesting that both unemployment and urbanization rates are positively related to crime. Based on a GMM approach we find the existence of an inertial effect on criminality. Besides that, the GMM results show that public security spending is effective in reducing criminality rates. Contrary to the common wisdom, we could not find evidence that poverty increases violent crimes.

The analysis is based on the Spence-Mirrlees wedge which corresponds, at each observed gross income level, to a ratio between the marginal tax rate of the individual for whom the bundle is designed and that of his nearest more productive neighbour if he chooses to mimic. Using this wedge, a necessary and sufficient condition for bunching to be optimal is obtained in terms of the primitives of the model, separating optima are characterized geometrically, and comparative statics properties derived, notably with respect to skill levels and individual social weights. It is then shown that the analysis extends to adverse-selection problems where participation constraints replace the tax revenue constraint.","Uppsala Univ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Simula, L (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, Dept Econ, POB 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",laurent.simula@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,23,16,16,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUL,2010,35.0,2,,,,,199,220,,10.1007/s00355-009-0437-x,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,608ZR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278625000002,0

Alcalde and Barbera (Econ Theory 4:417-435, 1994) and Sonmez (Econ Des 1:365-380, 1994) show that efficient and individually rational matching rules are manipulable. We pursue the possibility of strategy-proof matching rules by relaxing efficiency to the weaker condition of respect for unanimity. First, we prove that a strategy-proof rule exists that is individually rational and respects unanimity. However, this rule is unreasonable in the sense that mutually best pairs of agents are matched on only rare occasions. In order to explore the possibility of better matching rules, we introduce a natural condition of respect for 2-unanimity. Respect for 2-unanimity states that a mutually best pair of agents should be matched, and an agent wishing to being unmatched should be unmatched. Our second result is negative. Secondly, we prove that no strategy-proof rule exists that respects 2-unanimity.

Countries that sign binding international agreements in the realm of monetary relations signal their commitment to an open economic system, which should reassure international market actors that the government is committed to sound economic policies. If the theory is correct, we should observe evidence that noncompliance is in fact costly. I test this argument by examining the effect of noncompliance with Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of Agreement on sovereign risk ratings. The results show that noncompliance with the agreement mitigates any benefits that accrue to Article VIII signatories. The empirical evidence suggests that, in addition to improving economic and political conditions at home, governments in the developing world would improve their access to financial markets by signing and complying with international monetary agreements.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Nelson, SC (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 240 Scott Hall,601 Univ Pl, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",stephen-nelson@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,69,7,7,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The empirical evidence found from this paper confirms that short-horizon contrarian profits can be partially explained by the lead-lag effects, while in the intermediate-term price momentum profits and long-term contrarian profits can be partially attributed to the firms' overreaction to past price changes. Our results support the contrarian/overreaction hypothesis, and they are inconsistent with the Fama-French risk-based hypothesis or the underreaction hypothesis. The study also confirms the earning underreaction hypothesis and finds the high volume stocks tend to earn high momentum profits in the intermediate-term. The study finds that the earning momentum effect for hotel stocks is more short-lived and smaller in magnitude than the market average. Price momentum portfolios (or contrarian portfolios) of big hotel firms underperform small hotel firms and the hotel price momentum portfolio (or contrarian portfolios) significantly underperform the overall market over the intermediate-term (or the long-term). These findings imply that the U.S. hotel industry, particularly the big hotel firms, have experienced relatively conservative growth in the sample period. It suggests that a conservative hotel growth strategy accompanied by an internal-oriented financing policy is proper in a period of prosperity.","[Zhang, Minye] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Finance Real Estate & Law Dept, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119613, Singapore",California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona; National University of Singapore,"Zhang, MY (通讯作者)，Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Finance Real Estate & Law Dept, 3801 W Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USA.",minyezhang@csupomona.edu; ydeng@nus.edu.sg,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171",,,,,50,6,6,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This may seem odd given the economic strength of the country. We use household survey data for five Swiss cantons to explore some possible reasons for this. We estimate a tenure choice equation that allows us to analyze the impacts of a number of key variables on the ownership rate. We pay particular attention to the relative cost of owning and renting, which is a function of house prices, rents, and the user cost of owning. The latter is a function of income tax policy and expected house price inflation, among other things. We also measure mortgage underwriting criteria and consider rent control and other policies affecting rental housing. By simulating a number of hypothetical changes to taxation and other policies, underwriting criteria, and price levels, we assess the importance of these variables in explaining the ownership rate. We conclude that high house prices-relative to household incomes and wealth-and the tax on imputed rent are the most important causes of Switzerland's low ownership rate.","[Bourassa, Steven C.] Univ Louisville, Sch Urban & Publ Affairs, Louisville, KY 40208 USA; [Bourassa, Steven C.; Hoesli, Martin] BEM Management Sch, CEREBEM, F-33405 Talence, France; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Geneva, HEC, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Geneva, SFI, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Hoesli, Martin] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Louisville; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Aberdeen,"Bourassa, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Sch Urban & Publ Affairs, 426 W Bloom St, Louisville, KY 40208 USA.",steven.bourassa@louisville.edu; martin.hoesli@hec.unige.ch,"Bourassa, Steven C/GZK-5077-2022","Bourassa, Steven C/0000-0002-6863-7417",,,,,34,41,42,2,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Education production function models are estimated using state-level PISA-E data, where possible pooling three subjects and three waves to obtain up to 138 test-score observations. The same results found previously across countries hold within Germany: Higher mean student performance is associated with central exams, private school operation, and socio-economic background, but not with spending, while higher equality of opportunity is associated with reduced tracking. In models that pool German states with OECD countries and combine up to 54 state and country observations, these institutional determinants do not differ significantly between the sample of German states and the sample of OECD countries, indicating that the existing cross-country evidence is not substantially biased by unobserved country-specific factors.","[Woessmann, Ludger] Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Woessmann, Ludger] Ifo Inst Econ Res, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Woessmann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",woessmann@ifo.de,,,,,,,47,37,39,1,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We study the issue by analyzing how the market reaction to a stock repurchase announcement varies as a function of the individual REIT's governance structure. In particular, we examine how executive and employee stock option holdings influence the market reaction to a firm's announcement of a stock repurchase. Using a sample of REIT repurchase announcements, we find that the market reacts more favorably to announcements by firms where executives have larger option holdings and the chief executive officer is not entrenched. Our results with respect to the roles of stock option holdings of executives and nonexecutives differ from those reported for a cross-section of non-REIT firms. While we find evidence supporting the importance of executive stock options in aligning the incentives of management and reinforcing the positive signaling associated with a repurchase announcement, we find little evidence that the market views REIT repurchases as being used primarily to fund option exercise. We attribute these findings to greater dependence by REIT investors on internal governance mechanisms (such as stock option programs) as a result of regulatory restrictions that limit external monitoring such as hostile takeovers.","[Ghosh, Chinmoy; Harding, John P.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Giambona, Erasmo] Univ Amsterdam, Finance Grp, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sezer, Oezcan] Univ Toledo, Dept Finance, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Sirmans, C.

This paper presents reasons for why these predictions can vary in the direction as well as the magnitude of their effects. The two driving factors are the elasticity of electricity supply from renewable energy sources relative to nonrenewable ones and the effective stringency of the target. The availability of other baseload generation helps to determine that stringency, and demand elasticity influences only the magnitude of the price effects, not the direction of those effects.

Trend and volatility are estimated jointly with the maximum likelihood estimation. There is long persistence in the variance of oil price shocks, and a GARCH unit root (GUR) test can potentially yield a significant power gain relative to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. After allowing for nonlinearity, the evidence supports a deterministic trend in the price of oil. The deterministic trend implies that influence of a price shock is transitory and policy efforts to restore a predictable price after a shock would be unwarranted in the long run.","[Li, Jing] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Thompson, Henry] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",South Dakota State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，S Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",jing.li@sdstate.edu; thomph1@auburn.edu,,,,,,,11,6,8,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,3,,,,,159,165,,,,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,619HW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279421600008,0

Before product designing and selling to farmers, it is necessary to understand farmers' real desire so that the product can be tailored to fit their needs. This paper focuses on the demand analysis for WIAI on household level. With this goal, 660 households located in 22 administrative villages in Changfeng and Huaiyuan county, Anhui province, China were surveyed. Survey questions covered risks faced by households, their coping mechanisms and willingness to pay for WIAI. Survey data were assessed and findings are shown as below: drought and flood were major weather risks for crops; the key coping strategies to crop loss were seeking employment elsewhere, or borrowing money from relatives or friends; most of investigated farmers showed interest in WIAI; those who were more familiar with insurance, or whose losses were higher due to deficient or excessive rainfall, or who had more trust in the accuracy of local weather forecasts, expressed more interest in WIAI with the quite low correlation coefficient, while statistically significant. It hints that there are potential demands for WIAI among farmers. However, methodologies deserve further development so as to provide more reliable assessment of the relationships between the willingness to pay and the above-mentioned three factors.

Drawing on empirical research of compliance (Clean Development Mechanism) and voluntary carbon offset markets, we highlight the diversity of technologies, techniques and devices involved in carbon offsetting, ranging from refrigerant plants to systems of calculation and audit. We suggest that polarised debates for and against offsetting do not adequately reflect the considerable variations between types of offset project and governance practices in the compliance and voluntary offset markets. Using conceptual insights from governmentality theory and science and technology studies we assess the tensions in making standard, fungible carbon credits. In conclusion, we suggest attention to the technologies and materiality of carbon offsetting allows a fresh perspective on somewhat entrenched debates about the advantages and disadvantages of offsetting.","[Lovell, Heather] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Ctr Study Environm Change & Sustainabil CECS, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Liverman, Diana] Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Liverman, Diana] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Edinburgh; University of Arizona; University of Oxford,"Lovell, H (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Ctr Study Environm Change & Sustainabil CECS, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",heather.lovell@ed.ac.uk; liverman@email.arizona.edu,"Lovell, Heather/L-6955-2018; Lovell, Heather/G-7019-2011","Lovell, Heather/0000-0003-1164-0356",,,,,46,95,108,6,119,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

However, the antichresis insulates owners from tenant liquidity risk while rent contracts do not, making antichresis leases more attractive for tenant populations with greater liquidity risk.

A study on domestic political determinants,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,FTA; Japan; trade policy-making; lobbying; market opening,PRIME-MINISTER; TRADE; POLICY,"The last decade has witnessed Japan's transformation from one of the last hard core multilateralists to an active negotiator of free trade agreements (FTAs). This striking policy shift raises the question as to whether FTAs can finally deliver substantial liberalization of the Japanese market, a goal long sought by Japan's trading partners and domestic champions of structural reform. I argue that Japan's ability to negotiate such high-yield FTAs (with large trading partners, and encompassing substantial market access concessions and multiple WTO plus commitments) will hinge upon the intensity of lobbying by the internationalized business sector to overcome the resistance of uncompetitive sectors; and the centralization of domestic policy-making in order to break the protectionist inertia of traditional subgovernments. In developing this argument, I modify existing demand/supply models of FTA policy to factor in the preferences of societal actors in the game of selective and discriminatory liberalization and to take into account the influence of domestic political institutions through the logic of principal-agent relations.","American Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Solís, M (通讯作者)，American Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,,,,,,60,20,22,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The costs of China's agri-food exporting enterprises in complying with foreign food safety regulations was investigated through two firm level surveys during the year of 2008 and 2009. The results showed that the total compliance costs increased over time. Building renovation, technological innovation, and testing equipments were major components of total compliance costs. The results of surveys also showed that compliance costs of domestic private enterprises were more than that of foreign-funded enterprises. The compliance costs of small-scale enterprises were more than that of big- and medium-scale enterprises. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.

Consequently, this paper describes the methodological basis of the calculation of so-called adjusted quarterly composite index. It represents a particular link between the monthly composite index of the economic activity and the sections not covered by it, but in quarterly periodicity. This connection makes possible the use of the adjusted composite index for flash estimates of the real growth of quarterly GDP 30 days after the end of the referent quarter.

Consumers were generally concerned about food safety issues; however, the awareness level with regard to traceable food was low. Consumer distrust of public policy and the public media blocked the effectiveness of a food traceability system. Consumers' willingness to buy traceable food is driven primarily by their evaluation of the safety of traceable food and acknowledgement of the importance of implementing food traceability. It is likely that with increased consumer awareness of the relationship between a food traceability system and food safety, their willingness to consume traceable food will increase significantly.

In the modelling exercise, the seasonality of the data is treated using the deterministic seasonal dummies, seasonal unit root test techniques and the unobservable component method. The empirical results suggest that no single forecasting technique is superior to the others in all situations. As far as overall forecast accuracy is concerned, the Johansen maximum likelihood error correction model outperforms the other models. The time-series models also show superior performance in dealing with seasonality. However, the time-varying parameter model performs relatively poorly in forecasting seasonal tourism demand. This empirical evidence suggests that the methods of seasonality treatment affect the forecasting performance of the models and that the pre-test for seasonal unit roots is necessary and can improve forecast accuracy.","[Shen, Shujie] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Li, Gang] Univ Surrey, Sch Management, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Song, Haiyan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Leeds; University of Surrey; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Shen, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.shen@its.leeds.ac.uk; g.li@surrey.ac.uk; hmsong@polyu.edu.hk,"Song, Haiyan/ABE-6463-2020; Song, Haiyan/AAD-3283-2022; Li, Gang/AAR-3204-2020","Song, Haiyan/0000-0001-6158-1222; Li, Gang/0000-0002-9858-5232",,,,,41,31,33,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A tobit regression model is then used to identify the underlying drivers of airline efficiency, as measured by the data envelopment analysis efficiency score. The impact of unionization on airline efficiency is found to be statistically insignificant, controlling for the influences of other hypothesized determinants of airline efficiency: the average age of an airline's fleet, the average size of its aircraft, its average stage length, the extent to which the airline relies of hubbing within its route structure, the percent of its passenger enplanements that are international, and whether the airline is a legacy carrier. The statistically significant drivers of airline efficiency, at a ten percent level of significance, are average aircraft size, average stage length and the extent to which the airline relies on hubbing and connecting flights within its route structure. The stage length variable is not significant at a five percent level of significance, however. An increase in average aircraft size or in average stage length enhances an airline's efficiency whereas an increase in hubbing reduces it. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond the Subsidy to home ownership under the personal income tax. the U.S. tax code provides additional Subsidies to specific groups of homeowners. For example, the Mortgage Revenue Bond program (MRB) permits lower levels of government to issue tax-exempt debt. using the proceeds to supply mortgages at below-market interest rates to deserving households. States are also permitted to issue and distribute Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCCs) which entitle recipient homeowners to claim a tax credit for some portion of the mortgage interest paid rather than the tax deduction claimed by other homeowners. This paper documents the wide variations in reliance upon MCCs and MRBs across U.S. states and the emergence of Mortgage Credit Certificates as the largest housing program administered by California, the largest U.S. state. The paper also provides ail economic analysis of the MCC program using micro data on more than 12 thousand program recipients in California. We estimate the extent and distribution of MCC subsidies across income and demographic groups, measuring the dollar amount of federal Subsidies and their effects upon the user cost of residential capital and the demand price of housing. We estimate Poisson models of the geographic incidence of MCC subsidies across neighborhoods of varying socio-demographic composition and deprivation. Finally, we note differences in the administrative and programmatic costs of MCCs and MRBs, suggesting that there are clear reasons to favor Mortgage Credit Certificates as a means of subsidizing deserving households.

Two two-country models are constructed for this purpose. One country is large and rich and produces traded capital goods; the other is a small poor economy that produces traded tourism services. The models differ only in the luxury good nature of tourism. In both models, the tourism economy grows sustainably because its terms of trade improve continuously. This result is related to sectoral productivity gaps. Throughout the transition, the growth differential between the countries is significantly higher when tourism is a luxury good. In this case, there is a faster increase in the tourism imports of the rich economy. As a result, the terms of trade of the poor economy improve greatly and its investment is boosted.","[Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D.] Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Spain; [Hernandez-Martin, Raul] Univ La Laguna, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna,"Alvarez-Albelo, CD (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Guajara, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Spain.",calbelo@ull.es; rahernan@ull.es,"Hernández-Martín, Raúl/AAB-6280-2022; HERNANDEZ-MARTIN, RAUL/H-2474-2019; Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D./F-4141-2016","Hernández-Martín, Raúl/0000-0001-5360-1908; HERNANDEZ-MARTIN, RAUL/0000-0001-5360-1908; Alvarez-Albelo, Carmen D./0000-0003-4220-3175",,,,,34,3,3,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Firms are typically linked to the nation in which they began and are considered to have fixed national identities. While firms have reallocated various activities around the world in response to value creation opportunities, they have largely retained their national identities and their headquarter activities have remained bundled in their home countries. This characterisation is increasingly tenuous. Firms are redefining their homes by unbundling their headquarters functions and reallocating them opportunistically across nations. A firm's legal home, its financial home and its homes for managerial talent no longer need to be co-located and, consequently, the idea of firms as national actors rooted in their home countries is rapidly becoming outdated.

J,"Golub, SS",,,,"Golub, Stephen S.",,,Openness to Foreign Direct Investment in Services: An International Comparative Analysis,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper quantifies and analyses the extent of restrictions on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in the service sector in developed and developing countries. Services account for an increasing share of global FDI. Recognition of the economic benefits of FDI clashes with nationalistic economic, political and national security concerns about foreign takeover of 'strategic' sectors, such as telecommunications, finance and transport. Consequently, almost all countries impose restrictions on FDI in services. Several different types of restrictions are considered: limitations on foreign ownership, screening or notification procedures, management restrictions and operational restrictions. These restrictions on FDI are computed at the industry level and then aggregated into a single measure for the service sector as a whole for 23 developed and 50 developing countries. Notwithstanding the worldwide trend towards liberalisation of restrictions, there remain substantial disparities between regions and individual countries in the severity of restrictions on inward FDI in services. The lowest restriction scores are in Europe and Latin America, whereas East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East have the highest levels of restrictions. The evolution over time of FDI restrictions is also presented for developed countries over the period 1981-2005, showing liberalisation in all countries, especially since the early 1990s, although to varying extents across countries. The severity of restrictions also differs considerably by sector, with electricity, telecommunications, transport and finance most restricted. The paper also finds a strong negative correlation of restrictiveness with inward stocks of FDI in services, suggesting that restrictions impede FDI.","Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",Swarthmore College,"Golub, SS (通讯作者)，Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",,,,,,,,32,46,54,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2009,32.0,8,,,,,1245,1268,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01201.x,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,472BT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268104800006,0

But to what extent does this policy result in spatial and social inequities by neglecting contaminated sites in distressed neighborhoods containing minority and low-income populations? This case study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, identified that tracts with above-average percentages of African Americans and Hispanics, although containing above-average numbers of brownfields per square mile and higher percentages of brownfields compared to percentage of the city's area, had below-average city-assisted redevelopments as a percentage of all brownfields. A policy implication is that despite difficulties promoting brownfield redevelopment in distressed neighborhoods, in addition to economic efficiencies, more emphasis is needed on the social benefits of public assistance for brownfield redevelopment, including potential spillover benefits, such as crime reduction and health improvements for surrounding neighborhoods.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"McCarthy, L (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Bolton Hall,Room 449,POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",lmccarth@uwm.edu,,"McCarthy, Linda/0000-0002-7381-0245",,,,,44,20,30,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Sweden's price-level targeting of the 1930s revisited,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The article re-examines Sweden's price-level targeting during the 1930s which is regarded as a precursor of today's inflation targeting. According to conventional wisdom, the Riksbank was the first central bank to adopt price-level targeting, although in practice giving priority to exchange-rate stabilisation. Based on Bayesian econometric techniques and the evaluation of new archival sources, we come to the conclusion that defending a fixed exchange rate is hard to reconcile with the claim of adopting price-level targeting. This finding has implications for the prevailing view of the 1930s as a decade of great policy innovations.","[Straumann, Tobias; Woitek, Ulrich] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Straumann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Winterthurerstr 30 Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",straumann@iew.unizh.ch,,,,,,,33,9,10,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

This development is often attributed to the remaining disincentives of the reformed social assistance to take up a low-paid full time job. Therefore, several proposals have been worked out to reduce these disincentives. In this paper we analyse an in-work benefit programme considered by the German government, which follows the proposal of Bofinger et al. (2006). We employ a microsimulation model for estimating labour supply as well as distributional and fiscal effects of this reform proposal. We provide morning after effects, i.e. fiscal effects without considering behavioural adjustments, and long run effects, which take into account the labour supply response following the introduction of the reform. We predict the labour supply responses by estimating a discrete choice model for different household types and find a moderate increase in labour supply (103,000 full-time equivalents) as well as overall low negative participation effects. The distributional analysis reveals an overall increase in poverty rates caused by lower earnings disregards as well as substantial deadweight losses, since a large part of the in-work benefit accrues to households who do not belong to the working poor in the status quo.","[Wiemers, Juergen; Bruckmeier, Kerstin] Inst Arbeitsmarkt & Berufsforsch, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Wiemers, J (通讯作者)，Inst Arbeitsmarkt & Berufsforsch, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",juergen.Wiemers@iab.de; Kerstin.Bruckmeier@iab.de,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,6,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

When the predictors have no natural ordering, an exhaustive evaluation of all possible combinations of the predictors can be computationally costly. This paper considers 'boosting' as a methodology of selecting the predictors in factor-augmented autoregressions. As some of the predictors are being estimated, we propose a stopping rule for boosting to prevent the model from being overfitted with estimated predictors. We also consider two ways of handling lags of variables: a compenentwise approach and a block-wise approach. The best forecasting method will necessarily depend on the data-generating process. Simulations show that for each data type there is one form of boosting that performs quite well. When applied to four key economic variables, some form of boosting is found to outperform the standard factor-augmented forecasts and is far superior to an autoregressive forecast.

This article examines the effects of framing in terms of 'risk' and 'opportunity' on public support. Moreover, we examine first whether the effect of framing CFSP as a 'risk for the nation-state' has more impact than 'risk for the EU' framing, and second whether fear of globalization moderates the effect of news framing at the individual level. Drawing on a survey-embedded experiment (n = 2,081) we found that participants in the 'risk' frame condition showed significantly lower levels of support compared to participants in the 'opportunity' condition. Those in the 'risk for the nation-state' condition were significantly less supportive of CFSP than those in the 'risk for the EU' condition. The framing effect was moderated by fear of globalization so that individuals more afraid of globalization exposed to the 'risk' frame condition were significantly more susceptible to 'risk' framing than individuals with low fear of globalization. The results provide insights into the effects of valenced news frames and support for specific EU policies.","[De Vreese, Claes H.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"De Vreese, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Kloveniersburgwal 48, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.h.devreese@uva.nl,"de Vreese, Claes/N-1375-2013",,,,,,79,37,43,2,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The revenue maximizing decision for the landlord involves a tradeoff between the rental rate and time on the market. Because the turnover of renters is higher than owners, and because the landlord must bear some carrying costs on a vacant house, pricing the rent too high may decrease revenue due to a higher vacancy period and pricing it too low may reduce the revenue when occupied. While there is substantial research on the relationship between listed prices and time on the market for freehold interests, this is the first study to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between asking rent, contract rent and time on the market for single family residential rental (leasehold) property interests. We present two models; a rental price model and a duration model for time-on-the market. Using data from the Dallas-Fort Worth area we find that landlords who set a lower asking rent relative to predicted rent can expect a shorter marketing period for their properties. The results also indicate that overpricing the asking rent and then lowering it at a later date leads to a longer marketing time (after the reset) and often a lower rent. These finding are reasonably robust for low-, mid-, and higher-valued rental properties.","[Allen, Marcus T.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; [Rutherford, Ronald C.; Thomson, Thomas A.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Finance, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Allen, MT (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, 2912 Coll Ave LA484, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.",mallen@fau.edu,,,,,,,21,24,29,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

A new methodological framework based on a multinomial logit (MNL) model and an enhanced odds ratio plot is presented. The use of an MNL model overcomes limitations of many prior studies that employ a sequence of binary logit models to examine multiple weight categories. The use of an enhanced odds ratio plot provides important information into the relative importance of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics. Several new findings for the Atlanta area result from this study. Socio-demographic variables, including age and educational attainment, exhibit a non-linear relationship with the odds of their overweight or obese. Gender, age, ethnicity, and educational attainment are strongly associated with the odds of being overweight or obese, while income and number of students between 5 and 16 years old in the household have smaller effects. Built environment characteristics such as increased net residential densities and enhanced street connectivity are associated with reductions in the odds of being overweight or obese.

In Canada, the ILUTE (Integrated Land Use Transportation Environment) project is an IUM framework Currently under development. While model development is undertaken by academics, the implementation of ILUTE is meant to occur within planning organizations thus rendering the success of model application dependent on available resources for modelling and planners' attitudes towards the role of models. In an attempt to render the ILUTE modelling framework more policy-sensitive, a survey was conducted with planners and policy-makers pertaining to the three levels of government (municipal, provincial, and federal) in Canada. The survey collects information with respect to the Current evaluation process of transport policy and its associated pitfalls as well as the desired state of policy appraisal and the need for more formal evaluation tools. Results show the presence of numerous challenges working against the proper development, adoption, and refining of models. The most notable of which include a general disbelief in the usefulness of models for decision-making, lack of resources for large-scale modelling exercises, and poor institutional integration among government departments. While local and national planning goals reflect the recent challenges of promoting environmental preservation, reducing social inequities, and improving the quality of life, modelling tools that can assess the impacts of proposed policies on these goals have lagged behind.

Since then, the mean-variance model has played a crucial role in single-period portfolio optimization theory and practice. In this paper we study the optimal portfolio selection problem in a multi-period framework, by considering fixed and proportional transaction costs and evaluating how much they affect a re-investment strategy. Specifically, we modify the single-period portfolio optimization model, based on the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as measure of risk, to introduce portfolio rebalancing. The aim is to provide investors and financial institutions with an effective tool to better exploit new information made available by the market. We then suggest a procedure to use the proposed optimization model in a multi-period framework.

Examination of the path followed by these two economies as they adjust to the consequences of automotive liberalisation clarifies not only comparative economic performance in key areas of industry and trade, it also highlights the influence of differing levels of multi-state economic integration, as these processes create, or fail to create, new opportunities for manufacturing economies operating in their individual regional geographic settings.","Yeditepe Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University,"Darby, J (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,,40,4,5,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2009,32.0,3,,,,,460,478,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01139.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,419TM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264242600004,0

The methodology chosen to measure the individual levels of efficiency was non-parametric due to the advantage of not defining a functional form for the production technology. Results show that wine-producing farms could increase the efficiency of input use. The scale and congestion inefficiencies are responsible for most of the observed technical inefficiency.

Constructing synthetic benchmark portfolios controlling for firm size and for book-to-market value ratio, we find that 60-month buy-and-hold abnormal returns for REIT acquirers are significantly negative at approximately -10%, supporting the position that REIT merger acquirers underperform non-merging REITs in the long run. We find no evidence to challenge previous studies reporting positive announcement period returns for acquirers when the target is privately held, but we do find evidence that these positive returns do not persist.

In the first step we examine the stationarity of the individual real exchange rates using the ADF (Augmented Dickey - Fuller) and PP (Phillips - Perron) unit root tests. All the real exchange rates were identified as to be non-stationary, so the PPP can not hold. Further analysis was done using the Engle-Granger cointegration approach and Johansen cointegration approach. Both approaches provide support for the validity of the PPP only for Hungary - the values of estimated parameters, however, are not consistent with the PPP theory. Finally we present the Larson et al. panel cointegration technique which enables to overcome the problems with the low power of the unit root and cointegration tests in case of short sample sizes. The absence of cointegration in majority of analysed countries makes it impossible to apply this modem technique.","[Chocholata, Michaela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Operat Res & Econometr, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,,chocholatam@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,153,158,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900027,0

The main conclusion of the analysis is that, in many ways, the situation of illegal labour and transit migration in the Czech Republic is similar to that in countries with a longer experience as target countries for immigration.","[Drbohlav, Dusan; Janska, Eva] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Drbohlav, D (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Albertov 6, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",drbohlav@natur.cuni.cz; ejanska@centrum.cz,"Janska, Eva/O-5882-2017","Janska, Eva/0000-0003-3451-2832",,,,,37,9,10,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,1,,,,,141,156,PII 908449158,10.1080/09668130802533025,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,403NS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263089900006,0

We account for the difference of each announcement from its market expectation and we jointly model the volatility of the returns accounting for intra-day movements and day-of-the-week effects. Our findings show that real-time interactions on the new EU markets are strongly determined by matured stock markets as well as the macroeconomic news originating thereby. In general, differences in results across markets are driven by differences in key market participants, mostly by the presence of foreign investors. Our findings yield insights into the process of the development of new European capital markets and stock market integration in the EU.","Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,,jan.hanousek@cerge-ei.cz,"Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017; Hanousek, Jan/H-2879-2014; Hanousek, Jan/HOC-4951-2023","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169; Hanousek, Jan/0009-0006-3997-5931",,,,,54,0,0,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-1963-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,103,108,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BNO76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275146900019,0

This ideological affinity led to close practical cooperation in schemes such as the Anglo-French commercial Treaty of 1860 but they remained fundamentally divided on the value of colonies. Here Cobden's liberal belief in the self-organisation of society through individual freedom clashed with the Saint-Simonian readiness to promote the civilizational benefits of colonial domination.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Hist, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Howe, A (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Hist, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.c.howe@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Therefore, enlarging the investments of government and strengthening different types of infrastructure according to the demands of different regions matters.

The spatial analysis developed by Park (2006) gives a new tool to test the distributional dominance of one process over the other even under nonstationarity. Extending the notion of well-developed stochastic dominance to the nonstationary time series whose distributions are time-varying, the existence of spatial dominances in Korean stock market returns is investigated. We find the evidence that the cumulative return distributions of Korean stock market index before the crisis spatially dominate the distributions after the crisis in the short term investments, and the dominance gets weaker as the investment period gets longer.","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, CS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",skimcs@skku.edu,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The paper revisits the issue by employing the threshold regressions with instrumental variables approach. Using the initial level of economic development as a threshold variable, we find strong evidence in support of a nonlinear income threshold in the relationship. In particular, the data show that an increase in inequality would hinder growth in low-income countries but accelerate growth in high-income ones. The results therefore suggest that redistributive policy that alleviates inequality can foster economic growth in low-income countries, while policymakers confront a tradeoff between inequality and growth in high-income countries.","[Lin, Shu-Chin; Huang, Ho-Chuan] Tamkang Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kim, Dong-Hyeon] Providence Univ, Taichung, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Providence University - Taiwan,"Lin, SC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",econscl@mail.tku.edu.tw; river@mail.tku.edu.tw; dhkim@pu.edu.tw; robert@ocit.edu.tw,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019","Huang, Ho-Chuan/0000-0002-9763-0572",,,,,55,24,24,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Cohen's story of the transatlantic divide in IPE follows a simple plot, creating expectations concerning the outcome and culmination of this process. The conclusion is not predictable - there is no story unless our attention is being held in suspense by contingencies - but it must be acceptable. In Cohen's story, the expectation created is that IPE will follow American positivism and theories but involves 'British' moral judgements and sentiments of justice. However, there are better ways of telling better stories about the history and future of Global Political Economy. First, the methodological dividing line is essentially false, i.e. based on an anachronistic understanding of science. Causal explanation involves hermeneutical understanding; and does not imply predictions in the sense of positivism. Second, I argue that the rise of IPE should be read in terms of debates on political economy that have continued since the eighteenth century and have never been limited to Britain and the United States. The rise of new Political Economy in politics, sociology, business studies and other fields is a challenge to the hegemony of orthodox neoclassical economics. Analogically to the time of the Great Depression when collective learning did occur and largely in Keynesian terms, the on-going and future learning is contingent also on the consequences of the orthodox dominance in policy-making.","[Patomaki, Heikki] RMIT Univ, Globalism Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Patomaki, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Patomaki, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Patomäki, H (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Globalism Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,26,7,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This proved difficult to achieve in many areas, although monetary policy was an exception. Here co-ordination was rapid, not only in the euro area but also between the European Central Bank and other EU national central banks. Even so, within the euro area, the lender of last resort function was carried out by national central banks.

This hypothesis has been referred to as 'financialization'. This article argues that the interdisciplinary literature can be enriched if the macroeconomic dimension of financialization is more explicitly taken into account. In particular, important macroeconomic constraints regarding the determination of profits, in the face of a decreasing importance of physical investment and an increased importance of financial operations, are often not explicitly considered. The author compares his macroeconomic approach with contributions from different strands in the existing literature, including empirical analyses of new patterns of profit generation, the 'varieties of capitalism' approach, the British 'social accounting' literature, and the French 'regulationist' literature. The author's theoretical framework is illustrated by means of an empirical comparison of the effects of financialization in the USA and in Germany.","Hans Boeckler Fdn, Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"van Treeck, T (通讯作者)，Hans Boeckler Fdn, Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Dusseldorf, Germany.",,,,,,,,98,112,124,4,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This article considers a U.S. dataset that contains such information on husbands, wives, and grown children. Although certain variables (like education, race, and smoking status) are helpful in explaining an individual's BMI, the BMI of one's spouse (or parents) remains the most significant predictor of BMI. To help distinguish between correlation and causality in the married-adult BMI regressions, we consider two alternative approaches for dealing with possible endogeneity (due to omitted variables): (1) including spousal variables to proxy for omitted variables and (2) modeling spousal BMI in a hierarchical framework to explicitly allow for a couple effect. The results suggest endogeneity of educational attainment, but not smoking status, and support prior research that finds different associations of BMI with income for husbands and wives. For grown children, parental BMI and smoking status are identified as significant predictors.","[Abrevaya, Jason] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tang, Hongfei] Seton Hall Univ, Stillman Sch Business, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Seton Hall University,"Abrevaya, J (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",abrevaya@eco.utexas.edu; hongfei.tang@shu.edu,,,,,,,29,16,20,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We find that candidates with Irish names are over twice as likely to be called to interview as are candidates with an African, Asian or German name. This discrimination rate is high by international standards, and does not vary between minority groups.

We find evidence of subtle flow limiting and speed reducing phenomena more than a mile downstream of a lane drop bottleneck. These phenomena impact the fundamental relationship, FD. Close to the lane drop the free flow regime appears to come from a parabolic FD, but further downstream the relationship straightens to a triangular FD and throughput increases. We develop a theory to explain the underlying mechanisms. These insights should help resolve the decades long debate about the shape of the FD. The phenomena also provide a mechanism that may contribute to the empirically observed capacity drop often seen at bottlenecks. Although we study a lane drop, this work should be transferable to other bottlenecks where the capacity restriction persists for an extended distance, e.g., a corridor with a fixed number of lanes and an on-ramp bottleneck.

Facts or Misleading Test Results,JAHRBUCHER FUR NATIONALOKONOMIE UND STATISTIK,,,English,Article,,,,,,,1ST DIGIT,"Detecting election fraud with a simple statistical method and minimal information makes the application of Benford's Law quite promising for a wide range of researchers. Whilst its specific form, the Second-Digit Benford's Law (2BL)-test, is increasingly applied to fraud suspected elections, concerns about the validity of its test results have been raised. One important caveat of this kind of research is that the 2BL-test has been applied mostly to fraud suspected elections. Therefore, this article will apply the test to the 2009 German Federal Parliamentary Election against which no serious allegation of fraud has been raised. Surprisingly, the test results indicate that there should be electoral fraud in a number of constituencies. These counterintuitive results might be due to the naive application of the 2BL-test which is based on the conventional chi(2) distribution. If we use an alternative distribution based on simulated election data, the 2BL-test indicates no significant deviation. Using the simulated election data, we also identified under which circumstances the naive application of the 2BL-test is inappropriate. Accordingly, constituencies with homogeneous precincts and a specific range of vote counts tend to have a higher value for the 2BL statistic.","[Shikano, Susumu; Mack, Verena] Univ Konstanz, Chair Polit Methodol, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Shikano, S (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Chair Polit Methodol, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",susumu.shikano@uni-konstanz.de; verena.mack@uni-konstanz.de,"Shikano, Susumu/Q-3501-2016","Shikano, Susumu/0000-0003-4087-2789",,,,,29,5,6,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Specifically, we consider the government's problem of determining optimal labor and peak-period transport taxes under two different labor market structures, viz., a competitive labor market and a wage bargaining setting. The models include commuting and non-commuting transports, and they allow for telecommuting. We implement the models numerically using Belgian data. Results include the following. First, if union preferences reflect the transport concerns of their members, we find that optimal congestion taxes under competitive labor market conditions exceed those under bargaining by 10-17%. Second, the combination of substantially higher transport taxes and lower labor taxes compared to the reference situation jointly implies that the optimal tax structure strongly stimulates telecommuting for both labor market structures considered. Third, it is found that improving the efficiency of telecommuting results in a considerable reduction of optimal congestion tolls. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a case study of the Antwerp manufacturing guilds, it argues that apprenticeship should be understood from the perspective of 'distributional conflicts'. Fixed terms of service and masterpieces guarded the guilds' labour market monopsony, enabling masters to distribute the available skilled and unskilled labour among members (among other ways, through the restriction of the number of apprentices per master). Although from the perspective of product quality, this may have enabled masters to prevent adverse selection, the introduction of standardized apprenticeship requirements was the result of social and rent-seeking concerns.","Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"De Munck, B (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr Urban Hist, Antwerp, Belgium.",bert.demunck@ua.ac.be,,"De Munck, Bert/0000-0002-1927-9254",,,,,84,26,28,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The data-storage characteristics of smart cards present novel opportunities to enhance transit services. On the one hand, there are fare policies, where smart card holders are given specific rebates on the use of the service based on usage patterns or levels. On the other, there are non-fare policies, for instance if holders receive advantages, such as rebates and offers, from commercial partners. The purpose of this paper is to present a geodemographic framework to identify potential commercial partnerships that could exploit the characteristics of smart cards. The framework is demonstrated using data from Montreal, Canada. Household survey data, specifically trip ends, and business data points are jointly used to determine the exposure of various types of establishments to users of the Montreal Metro network. Spatial analysis of business establishments in the neighborhood of metro stations helps to identify potential commercial partners.

They result from the combination of Bayesian Networks (BNs), Object-Oriented languages, and relational models. They are specifically designed for their efficient construction, maintenance and exploitation for very large scale problems, where BNs are known to perform poorly. Actually, in large-scale problems, it is often the case that BNs result from the combination of patterns (small BN fragments) repeated many times. PRMs exploit this feature by defining these patterns only once (the so-called PRM's classes) and using them through multiple instances, as prescribed by the Object-Oriented paradigm. This design induces low construction and maintenance costs. In addition, by exploiting the classes' structures, PRM's state-of-the-art inference algorithm Structured Variable Elimination (SVE) significantly outperforms BN's classical inference algorithms (e.g., Variable Elimination, VE; Local Conditioning, LC). SVE is actually an extension of VE that simply exploits classes to avoid redundant computations. In this article, we show that SVE can be enhanced using LC. Although LC is often thought as being outperformed by VE-like algorithms in BNs, we do think that it should play an important role for PRMs because its features are very well suited for best exploiting PRM classes. In this article, relying on FaA and Jaffray's works, we show how LC can be used in conjunction with VE and deduce an extension of SVE that outperforms it for large-scale problems. Numerical experiments highlight the practical efficiency of our algorithm.","[Gonzales, Christophe; Wuillemin, Pierre-Henri] LIP6 UPMC, Dept DESIR, F-75005 Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Gonzales, C (通讯作者)，LIP6 UPMC, Dept DESIR, Boite 169,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",christophe.gonzales@lip6.fr,,"Wuillemin, Pierre-Henri/0000-0003-3691-4886",,,,,37,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2011,71.0,1,,,SI,,33,62,,10.1007/s11238-010-9219-2,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,777VJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291652900004,0

In this framework, we study an axiomatic decision model and prove a representation theorem. Resulting decision criteria aggregate partial evaluations consisting of (i) the conditional expected utility associated with the analyzed part of the decision, and (ii) the best and worst consequences of its non-analyzed part. The representation theorem is consistent with a wide variety of decision criteria, which allows for expressing various degrees of knowledge on (A, (A) over bar) and various types of attitude toward ambiguity and uncertainty. This diversity is taken into account by specific models already existing in the literature.

J,"Anderton, R; Tewolde, T",,,,"Anderton, Robert; Tewolde, Tadios",,,The Global Financial Crisis: Understanding the Global Trade Downturn and Recovery,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VERTICAL SPECIALIZATION; GROWTH,"This paper aims to shed light on why the downturn in global trade during the intensification of the financial crisis in 2008Q4-2009Q1 was so severe and synchronised across the world and also examines the subsequent recovery in global trade during 2009Q2-2010Q1. The paper finds that a structural imports function which captures the different and time-varying import-intensities of the components of total final expenditure - consumption, investment, government expenditure, exports, etc. - can explain the sharp decline in global imports of goods and services. By contrast, a specification based on aggregate total expenditure cannot fully capture the global trade downturn. In particular, panel estimates for a large number of OECD countries based on the individual components of expenditure suggest that the high import-intensity of exports at the country-level can explain a significant proportion of the decline in world imports during the crisis, while declines in the highly import-intensive expenditure category of investment also contributed to the remaining fall in global trade. At the same time, the high and rising import-intensity of exports also reflects and captures the rapid growth in 'vertical specialisation', suggesting that widespread global production chains may have amplified the downturn in world trade and partly explains its high degree of synchronisation across the globe. In addition, the estimates find that stockbuilding, business confidence and credit conditions also played a role in the global trade downturn. Meanwhile, the global trade recovery (2009Q2-2010Q1) can only be partially explained by differential elasticities for the components of demand (although the results confirm that the upturn in OECD imports was also driven by strong export growth and the reactivation of global production chains, as well as the recovery in stockbuilding and the fiscal stimulus). This may be in part because of the many policy measures that were implemented to boost global trade at that time and which cannot be captured by the specification. The paper is also a pseudo-real-time robustness test of the specification in that the first analysis of the global trade downturn is based on the data available at the time (i.e. October 2009 vintage), while an updated analysis of the global downturn as well as the trade upturn is based on a more recent dataset (i.e. October 2010 vintage). The results for the global downturn remain robust regardless of which vintage of the dataset is used.","[Anderton, Robert; Tewolde, Tadios] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Anderton, R (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,25,7,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2011,34.0,5,,,,,741,763,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01351.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,769RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291034800005,0

These policies aim at improving the financial incentives for work, while maintaining high levels of social protection. Examples include the Earned Income Tax Credit in the USA and the Working Families' Tax Credit in the UK. While these policies are proven to be quite effective with respect to poverty alleviation, many worry that they may discourage labor supply on the intensive margin. We consider an alternative measure implemented in Belgium: the Workbonus, which subsidizes social security contributions for low-skilled workers. This program differs from other measures in that the eligibility and the level of the subsidy are based on full-time equivalent earnings. The instrument therefore distinguishes between low skill and low effort and avoids the above-mentioned disincentive effect. We assess the effects of the Workbonus on labor supply using a particular discrete-choice labor supply model, in which individuals are assumed to choose among jobs belonging to individual-specific latent choice sets. In particular, we compare the Workbonus with a tax credit system temporarily implemented in Belgium in 2001-2004. Results show that both measures have a positive impact on labor supply. However, the Workbonus is more efficient in terms of cost per additional full-time equivalent position created and avoids the part-time trap implicit in the tax credit system.","[Jia, Zhiyang] Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway; [Dagsvik, John K.; Jia, Zhiyang] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway; [Orsini, Kristian] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium; [Van Camp, Guy] Belgian Fed Publ Serv Social Secur, DG Strategy & Res, Brussels, Belgium",Statistics Norway,"Jia, ZY (通讯作者)，Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway.",john.dagsvik@ssb.no; zhiyang.jia@ssb.no; kristian.orsini@ec.europa.eu; guy.vancamp@minsoc.fed.be,"Jia, Zhiyang/GON-7137-2022; jia, zhiyang/IQS-3932-2023","jia, zhiyang/0000-0002-2709-5498",,,,,28,6,6,0,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The author explores the interplay between these expectations and the coach's tenure by examining dismissals of college football head coaches from 1983 to 2006. Using a discrete-time hazard model, the author demonstrates that schools use prior performance in two ways: to evaluate the ability of the coach and to establish performance standards for retention. As recent performance is more relevant for estimating ability, the author shows that stronger recent performances decrease the chance of dismissal but stronger historic performances increase the chance of dismissal. Results describe a continual learning process on the part of schools. The author also considers the effects of race, insider-ness, rivalries, and rules violations on retention.","[Holmes, Paul] SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Fredonia,"Holmes, P (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Fredonia, W327 Thompson Hall, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA.",paul.holmes@fredonia.edu,,"Holmes, Paul/0000-0003-0114-7509",,,,,19,36,52,2,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The author finds a strict, robust, positive impact of all economic factors, such as per capita income and openness to trade, on tourism expenditure per capita, as well as on tourism expenditure per GDP. There seems to be a mutual openness to tourism as countries able to attract high inbound tourism receipts per capita also have high outbound tourism expenditures per capita. A further important finding is that people in democratic countries spend a higher share of income on travelling abroad. The results offer an encouraging suggestion that it makes sense for developing countries to invest in the tourism sector, as an increasing willingness to pay for outbound tourism goes hand in hand with an increasing per capita income.","Univ Jena, Dept Econ, Chair Econ Policy, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Vietze, C (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Dept Econ, Chair Econ Policy, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",christoph.vietze@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,65,13,13,2,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We contribute to the literature by employing a mixed logit model, i.e. a multinomial logit model with random intercepts and random coefficients, to incorporate any unobserved firm heterogeneity and by paying special attention to the quantitative significance of the determinants. We find that while the impact of productivity on the export and FDI decision is positive and statistically significant, it is economically negligible. The effect of firm size, credit constraints and information spillovers from experienced firms is also small in magnitude. A quantitatively dominant determinant of the export and FDI decision is instead the prior status of firms in terms of internationalisation. In addition, the use of the mixed logit model enables us to find a substantial role of unobserved firm characteristics in internationalisation of the firm. These findings suggest that entry costs to foreign markets, which substantially vary in size across firms, play an important role in the export and FDI decision. In addition, given that the negligible effect of productivity and the dominant effect of prior status appear to be more prominent in Japan than in some other countries, this study helps highlight the uniqueness of Japanese firms.","[Todo, Yasuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Todo, Yasuyuki] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Todo, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Todo, Yasuyuki/N-2336-2019","Todo, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-3201-4488",,,,,36,26,30,0,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2011,34.0,3,,,,,355,381,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01331.x,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,737CM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288546100002,0

The diploid or polyploid cultivated banana varieties are sterile intra- or interspecific hybrids of these two species and have been fixed through hundreds/thousands of years of human selection. The genetic improvement of banana is slow because knowledge on the putative fertile ancestors is scant. The present study was based on the assumption that the ancestors of the present-day wild types participated in the ancient hybrid formation. These ancient genomes are still analysable in the present-day cultivars because of their limited possibility for recombination in the mostly sterile hybrids. Therefore, in the present work, uniparentally inherited cytoplasmic (maternally inherited chloroplast and paternally inherited mitochondria) as well as biparentally inherited nuclear genome-based marker systems (rDNA) were applied for the identification of putative ancestor genepools of banana. This study was based on a mini core collection of 52 genotypes, including ten M. acuminata and eight M. balbisiana wild types along with ten AAA, ten AAB, eight ABB triploid, three AA, two AB diploid and a single tetraploid cultivar. Genepools featured by present-day wild types could be established with all the three marker systems for M. acuminata, while M. balbisiana yielded no variability for the rDNA locus. Using the cytoplasmic and nuclear marker systems separately, genepools representing the ancient genomes featured by present-day wild types have been established. Using the genepool classification for tracing the maternal lineage by chloroplast and the paternal lineage by mitochondrial genepools in combination with nuclear rDNA genepools allowed the identification of putative family trees suggesting simple ways for the evolution of the present-day hybrid cultivars. In addition, our results indicate that certain wild genotypes are lacking in collections, strengthening the need for more but clearly focused collecting missions.","[Boonruangrod, R.; Desai, D.; Berenyi, M.; Fluch, S.; Burg, K.] Austrian Inst Technol, Dept Hlth & Environm, Seibersdorf, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Boonruangrod, R (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Technol, Dept Hlth & Environm, Seibersdorf, Austria.",,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,133,137,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200013,0

Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), which are unique DNA sequences derived from a cDNA library and therefore representing genes transcribed in specific tissues or at some stage of development, are one type of DNA sequences highly available today for many important crop species. Molecular markers are used for bridging DNA sequence information with particular phenotypes and are useful tools for genotyping germplasm collections and also for tagging genes involved in desirable agronomic traits. In this sense, there is always a strong demand for suitable marker techniques to better utilise existing sequence information. A transcriptome database from banana (Musa spp.), DATAMusa, containing 42,724 ESTs from 11 different cDNA libraries and encompassing approximately 24 Mb of DNA sequence, was used in this study for the design of primers to PCR-amplify two types of EST-derived molecular markers, Variable Nucleotide Tandem Repeat (VNTR) and Target Region Amplification Polymorphism (TRAP). These primers were then validated against a panel of 14 diploid Musa genotypes and produced 32 (VNTR) and 119 (TRAP) alleles. Used separately or together, both types of markers were able to discriminate Musa genotypes from different genome background (A or B genomes). The TRAP alleles identified were derived from only one EST, while the VNTR alleles were derived from 12 unigenes. Based on the results of this study, EST-derived markers can be an important source of polymorphism to be used in genetic diversity and gene discovery studies in banana.","[Garcia, S. A.

The service delivery depends on the service quality specifications. If they do not match each other the GAP 3 appears.

They describe cultivars by names related to one or more traits at various development stages of the plant life cycle, like agronomic performance, uses of plant parts or aesthetics. This allows farmers to categorise diversity using relevant morphological criteria to create a pattern of naming and grouping cultivars. Factors farmers use to describe and name cultivars are interrelated and provide a set of agro-morphological criteria which define a landrace. Not much is known about the structure of farmers' nomenclature of these landraces and its relevance to the botanical descriptors and classification. This paper describes a study which was undertaken in two culturally different banana-growing communities in Uganda, Luwero in mid altitudes and Mbale in high altitudes. The purpose of the study was: (1) to identify the traits farmers use in describing and naming cultivars of East African highland banana; (2) to compare farmers' and botanical descriptors to assess the relationship between the two; and (3) to determine the biological usefulness of the farmers' system. Three methods were used: an informal participatory method to provide preliminary information on descriptors; a quantitative ranking of the results of the participatory method; and multivariate statistics to discover the relationship between the two types of descriptors by comparing the categorisations resulting from the descriptor analysis. Results indicated that the most important farmer descriptors fall into five categories: size and shape, texture, appearance, agronomic and commercial aspects. There was more than 60% correlation between farmers' grouping of cultivars (based on fewer descriptors) and botanical classification (based on many descriptors). In conclusion, farmers' grouping resulting from their descriptors had a biological meaning while the botanical classification reflected the practices of local people.","[Karamura, D.; Karamura, E.] Biovers Int, Kampala, Uganda",Alliance; Bioversity International,"Karamura, D (通讯作者)，Biovers Int, POB 24384, Kampala, Uganda.",,"Kiggundu, Andrew/GNP-6289-2022","Kiggundu, Andrew/0000-0002-7020-9219",,,,,8,1,2,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66051-38-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,897.0,,,,,,107,112,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.897.10,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR16,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323851200010,0

We find no evidence of superior performance associated with REITs specializing in a single property type.

By criticising the mainstream a-historical approaches, which reduce those tensions to the reluctance of interest-maximising politicians to delegate power, this article locates current reforms within the historical context of the trajectory of neoliberalism. In the case of Turkey, rather than undertaking comprehensive regulatory reform, the governments of the 1980s implemented ad-hoc strategies within the existing system, which corroded and de-legitimised the old institutional structures and facilitated market reforms. Yet, the same strategies created an institutional structure producing its own vested political and economic interests which gave its specific colour to the form and pace of current regulatory reform. The article derives insights from the Turkish case in order to re-think the crucial relation between politics and regulation, and between choices available to and constraints faced by policy makers and to re-conceptualise the role of unintended consequences by refuting any ideal typical understanding of neoliberalism.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sönmez, Ü (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,"Sonmez, Umit/ABA-3930-2020","Sonmez, Umit/0000-0002-0509-1656",,,,,99,15,17,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A structural vector autoregression identified with short-run restrictions was employed for each country with Fed funds rate as the US monetary policy instrument, non-oil output growth and inflation. The main results suggest that for inflation, the GCC countries show synchronised responses to monetary policy shocks from the US which are similar to inflation in the US, and for non-oil output growth, there is no clear indication that US monetary policy can be as effective for the GCC countries as it is domestically. Consequently, importing US monetary policy via a dollar peg may guarantee only stable inflation for the GCC countries - not necessarily stable non-oil output growth. If the non-oil output response is made conscientiously - and there are concerns over the dollar's ability to perform its role as a store of value - a basket peg with both the US dollar and the euro may be a sound alternative as confirmed by the variance decomposition analysis of our augmented SVAR with a proxy for the European short-term interest rate.","[Louis, Rosmy Jean] Vancouver Isl Univ, Nanaimo, BC, Canada; [Balli, Faruk] Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Vancouver Island University; Massey University,"Louis, RJ (通讯作者)，Vancouver Isl Univ, Nanaimo, BC, Canada.",,"Balli, Faruk/H-8162-2019; Osman, Mohamed/AAK-2619-2020","Balli, Faruk/0000-0003-2372-4709;",,,,,38,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2010,33.0,12,,,,,1898,1922,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01267.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,700SN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285764700010,0

Within the stated choice experiment, car drivers that frequently face traffic congestion, traded-off several trip-related (including toll costs) and house/location-related factors in their decision where to locate. If we look at the influence of different variables, toll and fuel costs seem to be important. Respondents are more sensitive to travel costs (i.e. toll and fuel costs) than to equally high (monthly) housing costs. Travel time appears to play a less important role, as indicated by a low value of time (VOT). In addition, location-related factors, such as the type of location and the number of bedrooms, turn out to be important factors as well. It can be concluded that respondents generally speaking prefer to pay higher housing costs and accept longer travel times to avoid (high) travel costs. Finally, if we look at the difference in preferences in relation to toll and fuel cost, we can conclude that toll costs are valued more negatively than fuel costs, although the differences are small.

The article focuses on the medieval precursors of the financial revolution, which the States of Holland brought about when they introduced province-wide public debt in the sixteenth century. The relevant techniques were already known, but predominantly used for political rather than financial purposes. Therefore techniques such as collective responsibility for debt were scarcely implemented. The article hypothesizes that sovereigns made use of the corporate personality of public bodies to increase ties with the main towns of Holland, and thus they used collective responsibility for debt to create stability. This only became a major financial instrument at the turn of the sixteenth century, when a financial crisis forced both sovereign and main towns to reorganize the medieval system of debt servicing. This centralization was crucial for the large public debt the county of Holland created under the Dutch Republic and may even be regarded as a step in the direction of national debt.","Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Zuijderduijn, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",C.J.Zuijderduijn@uu.nl,"Zuijderduijn, Jaco/HPD-8142-2023","Zuijderduijn, Jaco/0000-0002-1296-008X",,,,,67,12,12,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

By default, they assume that activity-travel decisions are uniform from 1 day to the next and individuals are independent from one another. Such assumptions do not reflect reality. This research investigates day-to-day variability in activity time-use patterns of household members while incorporating variations in their interactions. Results from a descriptive analysis and a series of daily structural equation models provide evidence of day-to-day variability in activity time-use patterns. Specifically, time-use patterns on weekdays are substantially different from those on weekends. Furthermore, compared to independent activities, there is a higher proportion of intra-personal variability and a lower proportion of inter-personal variability for joint activities. These findings suggest that transportation planners should not combine independent and joint activities as has been the case in the recent past, nor should they use single-day or pooled models when estimating activity time-use patterns.

Indeed, IO performance varies substantially over time and across tasks, and yet the international relations literature has devoted little attention to why this occurs. This article provides a framework for studying IO performance. After addressing some of the distinct challenges of conceptualizing and analyzing performance in the context of IOs, we discuss the tradeoffs of using different performance metrics-from process indicators to outcome indicators-and present a typology of factors that influence performance. Finally, we discuss research strategies for those interested in studying performance rigorously. The policy relevance of studying IO performance is clear: only if we understand why some IOs perform better than others can we begin to improve their performance in a systematic way. As many organizations come under pressure to reform, while at the same time taking on new and more complicated tasks, scholars should be actively engaged in debates surrounding IO performance and its role in effective governance at the international level.","[Gutner, Tamar] American Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Thompson, Alexander] Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",American University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Gutner, T (通讯作者)，American Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",tgutner@american.edu,,,,,,,86,150,160,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The theoretical and empirical basis for a new framework identifying hitherto under-specified 'work process skills' is outlined. This framework allows recognition of the integrated use of awareness-shaping, relationship-shaping and coordination skills, at different levels of experience-based complexity, derived from reflexive learning and collective problem-solving in the workplace. Political struggles over the use of combinations and levels of these 'skills of experience' may result either in jobs designed to reduce autonomy, or in improved skill recognition and development, enhancing equity and career paths.","[Hampson, Ian] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Org & Management, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Junor, Anne] Univ New S Wales, Ind Relat Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hampson, I (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Org & Management, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",I.Hampson@unsw.edu.au; a.junor@unsw.edu.au,"Junor, Anne/Q-7516-2019","Hampson, Ian/0000-0002-0792-8712; Junor, Anne/0000-0002-5351-8087",,,,,47,42,45,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

An enlargement of the jury with positive correlation can be detrimental up to a certain size, beyond which it becomes beneficial. The second theorem finds a family of distributions for which correlation has no effect on a jury's competence.

Applying Gutner and Thompson's framework for international organization performance (IOP) research to UN peacekeeping, it argues further that the relationship between process performance and outcomes in peacekeeping is irreducibly ambiguous, and that ambiguity has significant implications for efforts to measure and improve peacekeeping performance. To demonstrate this, the article reviews methods employed by the UN to measure its peacekeeping performance, arguing that the primary method employed-results-based budgeting (RBB)-is inherently unable to cope with the challenges of performance ambiguity. Its adoption and continued use despite its evident shortcomings are due to RBB's legitimacy in the wider organizational field of international public management in which the UN Secretariat, and UN peacekeeping, perform. Finally, the article considers recent efforts to improve process performance in UN peacekeeping, and discuss the ways in which so-called 'integration' reforms central to such efforts are a means of reducing and managing the ambiguity inherent in peacekeeping.","Concordia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Lipson, M (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",michael.lipson@concordia.ca,"Lipson, Michael/JTT-3115-2023","Lipson, Michael/0000-0003-2263-7670",,,,,111,50,57,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Why the Herder Problem is not a Prisoner's Dilemma,THEORY AND DECISION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Game theory; Prisoner's Dilemma; Herder Problem; Stag hunt; Assurance game; Tragedy of the commons; Institutions; Trust,COMMONS DILEMMA; GAME,"In the game theory literature, Garrett Hardin's famous allegory of the tragedy of the commons has been modeled as a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, labeled the Herder Problem (or, sometimes, the Commons Dilemma). This brief paper argues that important differences in the institutional structures of the standard Prisoner's Dilemma and Herder Problem render the two games different in kind. Specifically, institutional impediments to communication and cooperation that ensure a dominant strategy of defection in the classic Prisoner's Dilemma are absent in the Herder Problem. Their absence does not ensure that players will achieve a welfare-enhancing, cooperative solution to the Herders Problem, but does create far more opportunity for players to alter the expected payoffs through cooperative arrangements. In a properly modeled Herder Problem-along the lines of an assurance game-defection would not always be the dominant strategy. Consequently, the Herder Problem is not in the nature of a Prisoner's Dilemma.","[Cole, Daniel H.] Indiana Univ, Sch Law Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Grossman, Peter Z.] Butler Univ, Coll Business Adm, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Butler University,"Cole, DH (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Law Indianapolis, 530 W New York St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",dancole@iupui.edu; pgrossma@butler.edu,"Cole, Daniel/AAZ-6091-2020","Cole, Daniel/0000-0002-6356-5178",,,,,36,11,14,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2010,69.0,2,,,,,219,231,,10.1007/s11238-008-9121-3,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,628BY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280090600004,0

As a case in point, we consider Spanish exports of Mediterranean horticultural products (MHP). Two bi-equational export supply and demand models (an equilibrium and a disequilibrium model) are proposed, in which volumes and prices are determined simultaneously, to throw light on the main causes of Spain's expanding exports of MHP. The results clearly reflect the primacy of rightward shifts in the supply and demand curves in explaining the growth of MHP trade by volume. Thus, both rising incomes in the more developed countries and technological change in agriculture specializing in these products were key to the growth of this trade. Meanwhile, Spanish exporters also benefited from the increasing integration of international markets, especially through declining transport costs and, to a lesser extent, trade liberalization.","[Pinilla, Vicente] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Ayuda, Maria-Isabel] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Pinilla, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Gran Via 4, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",vpinilla@unizar.es; mayuda@unizar.es,"Pinilla, Vicente/H-4331-2015","Pinilla, Vicente/0000-0003-2256-8898",,,,,64,29,29,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

British experience suggests, however, that institutions also played a crucial part. In particular, the monopolistic nature of Great Britain's official coinage arrangements undermined incentives for establishing a sound system of small change even after theoretical and technological constraints were no longer present. The institutional perspective offered here helps to explain a number of historical facts that are otherwise puzzling, including the fact that a relatively successful private-sector small-change system anticipated Great Britain's official solution to the small-change problem by two decades.","Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Selgin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",Selgin@uga.edu,,,,,,,46,1,2,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Several adaptations of the original model by Bailey et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 58:933-942, 1963) are proposed in literature. They all have in common using a dummy variable approach for measuring price indices. In order to reduce the impact of transaction price noise on the estimates of price indices, Goetzmann (J Real Estate Finance Econ 5:5-53, 1992) used a random walk with drift process for the log price levels instead of the dummy variable approach. The model that is proposed in this article can be interpreted as a generalization of the Goetzmann methodology. We replace the random walk with drift model by a structural time series model, in particular by a local linear trend model in which both the level and the drift parameter can vary over time. An additional variable-the reciprocal of the time between sales-is included in the repeat sales model to deal with the effect of the time between sales on the estimated returns. This approach is robust can be applied in thin markets where relatively few selling prices are available. Contrary to the dummy variable approach, the structural time series model enables prediction of the price level based on preceding and subsequent information, implying that even for particular time periods where no observations are available an estimate of the price level can be provided. Conditional on the variance parameters, an estimate of the price level can be obtained by applying regression in the general linear model with a prior for the price level, generated by the local linear trend model. The variance parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood. The model is applied to several subsets of selling prices in the Netherlands. Results are compared to standard repeat sales models, including the Goetzmann model.","[Francke, Marc K.] Univ Amsterdam, Finance Grp, Fac Econ & Business, Sch Business, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Francke, Marc K.] Ortec Finance Res Ctr, NL-1043 DV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Francke, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Finance Grp, Fac Econ & Business, Sch Business, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.k.francke@uva.nl,,,,,,,48,40,43,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We discuss potential consequences and modifications, resulting from these findings. Subsequently, we use a sophisticated pooled mean group panel model to provide more detailed insights into matching processes in the concerning partial labor markets. This approach allows for a more general perspective and furthermore, parameters can be estimated asymptotically efficient via maximum likelihood.

This paper estimates the cost inefficiency of railway sectors across countries using stochastic frontier models and examines whether the rise of state ownership affected inefficiency. The results show that the trends in inefficiency differed substantially across countries from the 1880s to 1912. They also show that inefficiency increased with greater nationalizations and decreased with greater state railway construction. A counterfactual analysis suggests that the rise of state ownership contributed to lower inefficiency in most countries, but the effects within countries varied depended on whether state ownership increased through nationalizations or new construction.

In this paper, we consider the problem of determining all hierarchies, conserving the ordinal equivalence between the Shapley-Shubik and the Penrose-Banzhaf-Coleman power indices, achievable in simple games. It is proved that only four hierarchies are non-achievable in simple games. Moreover, it is also proved that all achievable hierarchies are already obtainable in the class of weakly linear games. Our results prove that given an arbitrary complete pre-ordering defined on a finite set with more than five elements, it is possible to construct a simple game such that the pre-ordering induced by the Shapley-Shubik and the Penrose-Banzhaf-Coleman power indices coincides with the given pre-ordering.","[Freixas, Josep] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Manresa 08242, Spain; [Freixas, Josep; Pons, Montserrat] Tech Univ Catalonia, Dept Appl Math 3, Barcelona, Spain; [Freixas, Josep; Pons, Montserrat] Tech Univ Catalonia, Sch Engn Manresa, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Freixas, J (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Av Bases Manresa 61-73, Manresa 08242, Spain.",josep.freixas@upc.edu; montserrat.pons@upc.edu,"Pons, Montserrat/C-2586-2015; Freixas, Josep/P-3977-2014","Pons, Montserrat/0000-0003-1592-0347; Freixas, Josep/0000-0002-9033-9432",,,,,14,13,13,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2010,68.0,4,,,,,393,404,,10.1007/s11238-008-9108-0,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,558CS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274718700002,0

Collecting data on all the possibly relevant information used in the lending process, they find when controlling for a subset of this information that race has a statistically significant effect on the decision to reject a mortgage application. Other researchers, using the same dataset, have shown that analysis of alternative subsets of the variables significantly reduces the effects of race. While theory should guide variable selection, there is often no unique theory to explain social science. In such cases, uncertainty in model specification causes one to be uncertain as to the true effects of the variables of interest. This paper accounts for the effects of model uncertainty by using Bayesian model averaging and finds a reduced effect of race and weakened evidence concerning the statistical significance of the effect.","Univ N Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Goenner, CF (通讯作者)，Univ N Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA.",cullen.goenner@und.nodak.edu,,,,,,,35,4,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It documents that the positive profitability differential of exporters compared to non-exporters is statistically significant, though rather small, when observed firm characteristics and unobserved firm-specific effects are controlled for. In contrast to nearly all empirical studies on the relationship between productivity and exports we do not find any evidence for self-selection of more profitable firms into export markets. Due to the sampling frame of the data used we cannot test the hypothesis that firms which start exporting perform better in the years after the start than their counterparts which do not start. Instead, we use a newly developed continuous treatment approach and show that exporting improves the profitability almost over the whole range of the export-sales ratio. Only firms that generate 90 per cent and more of their total sales abroad do not benefit from exporting in terms of an increased rate of profit. This means that the usually observed higher productivity of exporters is not completely absorbed by the extra costs of exporting or by higher wages paid by internationally active firms.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,,,"Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020; Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536",,,,,30,47,49,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2010,33.0,3,,,,,399,423,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01261.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,573CA,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275884800005,0

In 2005 the jetfoil, which had been the dominant mode for many years, was replaced by a slower but cheaper fast ferry service. This induced important changes in the market shares of all competing modes (airplane, slow ferry and another fast ferry with a shorter in-sea time, but needing a bus connection in land). We estimated several discrete choice models, with data collected two years before, with the aim to test their forecasting performance in relation with observed behaviour. Interestingly, we found that an easy to interpret multinomial logit model allowing for systematic taste variations performed best in forecasting. We also discuss some model assumptions related to forecasting that allow replicating the effects of introducing a new mode more accurately. We finally show how the model can be used to examine the social benefits of a related infrastructure improvement project in the island of Gran Canaria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

If this hypothesis is true, there should have been strong migration creation but little migration diversion in the last 20 years. The results broadly support migration creation for the CEECs prior to their EU membership. At the same time, the evidence of diversion away from other world regions is mixed. The combined impact of a common language and established communities, compared to distance and a common border, may contribute to the preservation of migration channels from outside Europe. Within Europe, to be an EU outsider can have a negative impact on migration channels. Moreover, whilst liberal immigration policies increase immigration contemporaneously, restrictive immigration policies only show an impact with a two-year lag.","[Marques, Helena] Univ Balearic Isl, Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Marques, H (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Edifici Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos,Cra Valldemo, Palma de Mallorca 07122, Illes Balears, Spain.",vhfm374@uib.es,,"Marques, Helena/0000-0002-9257-7848",,,,,48,14,15,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The method combines the tools of symbolic time series analysis (Daw et al. in Rev Sci Instrum 74:916-930, 2003) with the nearest neighbor single linkage clustering algorithm (Mantegna and Stanley in An introduction to econophysics: Correlations and complexity in finance, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2000). Data symbolization allows to obtain a metric distance between two different time series that is used to construct a minimal spanning tree allowing to compute an ultrametric distance. From the analysis of time series data of companies included in Dow Jones Industrial Average, we derive a hierarchical organization of these companies. In particular, we detect different clusters of companies which correspond with their common production activities or their strong interrelationship. The obtained classification of companies can be used to study deep relationships among different branch of economic activities and to construct financial portfolios.","[Risso, Wiston Adrian] Univ Siena, Dept Econ, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Brida, Juan Gabriel] Free Univ Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, Bolzano, Italy",University of Siena; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Risso, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",JuanGabriel.Brida@unibz.it; risso@unisi.it,"Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790",Free University of Bolzano,Free University of Bolzano,"Our research was supported by the Free University of Bolzano (project Dynamical Regimes in Economics: modelling and statistical tools).

Previous authors have devoted considerable attention to the impacts of these policies on a country-by-country basis. However, there are also strong interactions among these programs, as they compete in world markets for feedstocks and ultimately for a limited supply of global land. In this paper we offer the first global assessment of biofuel programs-focusing particularly on the EU and US. We begin with an historical analysis of the period 2001-2006, which also permits us to validate the model. We then conduct an ex ante analysis of mandates in the year 2015. We find that if these mandates are indeed fulfilled the impact on global land use could be substantial, with potentially significant implications for greenhouse gas emissions.","[Tyner, Wallace E.; Birur, Dileep K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,,hertel@purdue.edu,,,US Environmental Protection Agency; US Department of Energy; Argonne National Labs,US Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Argonne National Labs(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge research support from the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US Department of Energy, and Argonne National Labs.

The three books discussed in this article are a welcome departure from such an artificial division between (inter)national security issues on the one hand, and economic issues on the other. Furthermore, like much political economy scholarship, they each aim to incorporate an analytical focus on domestic politics that many international security scholars still eschew. Such a broader (re-)integration of the domestic political economy dimension of security into international relations scholarship provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical understanding of how and why national security, like all areas of public policy, is riddled with the pursuit of political agendas.","Peace Res Inst Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Leibniz Institut Hessische Stiftung Friedens und Konfliktforschung (HSFK),"Homolar, A (通讯作者)，Peace Res Inst Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,"Homolar, Alexandra/0000-0001-9537-8046",,,,,38,13,16,3,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The article analyses how the urban cultural landscape has been reshaped to support the political ambitions of three successive regimesRomania as a kingdom and liberal constitutional monarchy (1881-1938); state-socialist Romania (1947-1989); and the post-socialist Romanian state from 1989. The article highlights complex continuity from the state-socialist period under post-socialism, rather than destruction of the landscape of state-socialism, combined with the return of pre-socialist landscape elements. The article argues for the need for studies of the fate of state-socialist urban landscapes under post-socialism which consider the complexities introduced by the persistence of landscape elements from the pre-socialist and state-socialist periods and their combination with pre-socialist and post-socialist landscapes to produce hybrid memory-scapes and spaces of the nation.","[Light, Duncan] Liverpool Hope Univ, Dept Geog, Liverpool L16 9JD, Merseyside, England; [Young, Craig] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England",University of Liverpool; Liverpool Hope University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Light, D (通讯作者)，Liverpool Hope Univ, Dept Geog, Hope Pk, Liverpool L16 9JD, Merseyside, England.",lightd@hope.ac.uk; cyoungmmu@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,20,22,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,9,,,,,1453,1478,PII 928817388,10.1080/09668136.2010.515792,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,673RX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283681800002,0

We present an empirical analysis of the political and economic factors that drive state governments to adopt an RPS, and the factors that lead to the inclusion of in-state requirements given the adoption of an RPS. Although advocates claim an RPS will stimulate job growth, we find that states with high unemployment rates are slower to adopt an RPS. Local environmental conditions and preferences have no significant effect on the timing of adoption. Overall, RPS adoption seems to be driven more by political ideology and private interests than by local environmental and employment benefits, raising questions as to when environmental federalism serves the public interest.","[Yin, Haitao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lyon, Thomas P.] Univ Michigan, Erb Inst Global Sustainable Enterprise, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lyon, Thomas P.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Yin, HT (通讯作者)，Bldg 10,Room 207,535 Fahua Zhen Rd, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",tplyon@umich.edu; htyin@sjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,42,202,254,1,36,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2010,31.0,3,,,,,133,157,,,,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,619HW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279421600007,0

J,"Paterson, M",,,,"Paterson, Matthew",,,Legitimation and Accumulation in Climate Change Governance,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; private governance; legitimacy; accumulation; carbon markets,GLOBALIZATION; RISE,"Recent debates have drawn attention to the legitimacy challenges faced by new forms of global governance. Privatised governance in particular has come under considerable scrutiny. This paper attempts to contribute to this debate through an analysis of the widespread critiques of climate governance that focus on its 'marketized' or 'privatized' character. Such critiques fundamentally attempt to delegitimise dominant governance mechanisms which can be collectively known as the 'global carbon market'. The paper argues that to understand the political dynamics of legitimacy surrounding these forms of governance we need to take into account the recurrent tension within capitalism between accumulation and legitimation. This focus enables us to understand the legitimacy problems surrounding climate governance. First, it draws attention to the character of the discourses which are critical of marketized climate governance, which attack it precisely because of the forms of accumulation it enables. Second, many of these governance projects have themselves been developed in part precisely in order to overcome legitimacy crises inherent in capital accumulation, and specifically in the current context in relation to the dominance of finance within contemporary capitalism. Finally, it suggests that one of the strategies of firms involved in such governance is to attempt to overcome this legitimacy-accumulation tension in the way that automobility did in the Fordist era. Climate governance practices should be understood as a pursuit of this sort of coherence which might give rise to an 'ecological regime of accumulation' that aims to forestall more radical critiques that argue that capitalism and sustainability are inimical.","Univ Ottawa, Sch Part Studies, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Paterson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Part Studies, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",Matthew.Paterson@uottawa.ca,,"Paterson, Matthew/0000-0002-0007-2229",,,,,79,73,76,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Theories on this topic predict opposing partner effects: economic theory expects a negative relationship due to financial incentives, whereas a positive relationship can be expected from a social capital point of view. In order to test these opposing mechanisms properly, (a) labour market outcomes are decomposed into labour market participation and job level, and (b) a historical perspective is introduced. Large scale labour force surveys conducted by Statistics Netherlands from 1977 onwards show that a partner's career resources have a negative influence on working hours and a positive influence on job level. Over birth cohorts, the negative effect on working hours has become stronger for males and weaker for females, whereas the positive effect on job level has decreased for both men and women.","[Verbakel, Ellen; de Graaf, Paul M.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Verbakel, E (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",E.Verbakel@uvt.nl; Pdegraaf@uvt.nl,"de Graaf, Paul M/D-7035-2013; Verbakel, Ellen/H-5118-2012","Verbakel, Ellen/0000-0003-1022-9020",,,,,33,39,41,0,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

CAFE policy has been in effect for the past three decades, and new legislation has raised standards significantly. We present a structural analysis of automaker responses to generic CAFE policies. We depart from prior CAFE analyses by focusing on vehicle design responses in long-run oligopolistic equilibrium, and we view vehicles as differentiated products, taking demand as a general function of price and product attributes. We find that under general cost, demand, and performance functions, single-product profit maximizing firm responses to CAFE standards follow a distinct pattern: firms ignore CAFE when the standard is low, treat CAFE as a vehicle design constraint for moderate standards, and violate CAFE when the standard is high. Further, the point and extent of first violation depends upon the penalty for violation, and the corresponding vehicle design is independent of further standard increases. Thus, increasing CAFE standards will eventually have no further impact on vehicle design if the penalty for violation is also not increased. We implement a case study by incorporating vehicle physics simulation, vehicle manufacturing and technology cost models, and a mixed logit demand model to examine equilibrium powertrain design and price decisions for a fixed vehicle body. Results indicate that equilibrium vehicle design is not bound by current CAFE standards, and vehicle design decisions are directly determined by market competition and consumer preferences. We find that with increased fuel economy standards, a higher violation penalty than the current stagnant penalty is needed to cause firms to increase their design fuel economy at equilibrium. However, the maximum attainable improvement can be modest even if the penalty is doubled. We also find that firms' design responses are more sensitive to variation in fuel prices than to CAFE standards, within the examined ranges. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The research differs from similar studies on excess commuting in two ways. First, a disaggregate modal choice analysis of excess commuting is undertaken for two time periods - 1991 and 2001. Second, sensitivity analysis is undertaken to explore the impact of changes in the density of the transport network for users of public and private transport. The results suggest that excess commuting is considerably greater for users of private transport implying the greater inefficiency of commuting associated with that mode. By way of contrast, capacity utilisation measures suggest the opposite indicating the difficulty of using these measures for policy-making. The results suggest also that the greater inter-mixing of jobs-housing functions has facilitated reductions in actual commuting costs as well as increasing the range of available trip possibilities over the study period. In terms of the sensitivity analysis, the results suggest that public transport users could achieve dramatic savings on their commute if the density of that network was increased considerably.

In the model, environmental quality has a positive effect not only on utility but also on production. Moreover, cleaner technologies can be used in the economy if a part of the output is used in environmentally oriented R&D. In this framework, if the initial level of capital is low, then the shadow price of a cleaner technology is low in relation to the cost of developing it, given by the marginal utility of consumption, and it is not worth investing in R&D. Thus, there will be a first stage of growth based only on the accumulation of capital with environmental quality decreasing until there is enough pollution to make investing in R&D profitable. After this turning point, if the new technologies are efficient enough, the economy can evolve along a balanced growth path with increasing environmental quality. The result is that the optimal investment pattern supports an environmental Kuznets curve.","[Rubio, Santiago J.; Garcia, Jose L.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Rubio, Santiago J.] Univ Valencia, ERICES, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Hueso, Jose L.] Polythecn Univ Valencia, Inst Multidisciplinary Math, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Rubio, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Edificio Dept Oriental,Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",santiago.rubio@uv.es,"Hueso, José L/K-9139-2014; Rubio, Santiago J./F-6329-2016; Garcia-Martinez, Jose Ramon/L-5755-2014","Rubio, Santiago J./0000-0002-2727-9756; Garcia-Martinez, Jose Ramon/0000-0002-1228-0228","Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [SEJ2004-05704, SEJ2007-67400, MTM2007-64477]; FEDER [SEJ2004-05704]",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"Department of Economic Analysis, University of Valencia, Spain.

If traffic is free flowing, drivers should slow to more fuel-efficient speeds as the price of gasoline rises. However, we find little evidence that drivers respond to increased fuel costs by slowing down. When congestion constrains traffic flow, freeway speeds should rise with gasoline price, and we find a $1.00 increase in price raises average freeway speeds by approximately 7% during rush-hour periods. Finally, we introduce a novel method to calculate the short-run vehicle miles traveled demand elasticity during rush hour.","[Burger, Nicholas E.] RAND Corp, Washington, DC USA; [Kaffine, Daniel T.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA",RAND Corporation; Colorado School of Mines,"Burger, NE (通讯作者)，RAND Corp, Washington, DC USA.",,"Kaffine, Daniel/V-9996-2019",,,,,,18,29,37,0,14,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"238 MAIN STREET, STE 500, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1046 USA",0034-6535,,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Under the IHMM, transitions of the hidden risk states of the sector depend on the observed number of bonds in the sector that default in the current time period. This incorporates the feedback effect of the number of defaults on the transitions of the hidden risk states. This feature seems to be more realistic and does not enjoy by the traditional HMMs. We then develop a dynamic version of the binomial expansion technique (BET) modulated by the IHMM for modeling the occurrence of defaults of bonds issued by firms in the same sector. Under the BET modulated by the IHMM, the number of bonds defaulting in each time period follows a Markov-modulated binomial distribution with the probability of defaulting of each bond depending on the states of the IHMM, which represent the hidden risk states of the sector. Efficient method will be presented for estimating the model parameters in the BET modulated by the IHMM. We shall compare the hidden risk state process extracted from the IHMM-modulated BET with that extracted from the BET modulated by HMM in order to illustrate the significance of the feedback effect using real data. We shall also present the estimation results for the BET modulated by the IHMM and compare them with those for the BET modulated by the HMM.","[Siu, Tak Kuen] Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Ching, Wai-Ki; Li, Li-min; Li, Tang] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math, Adv Modeling & Appl Comp Lab, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Wai-Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Macquarie University; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Siu, TK (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",wching@hkusua.hku.hk; ktksiu2005@gmail.com; liminli@hkusua.hku.hk; litang@hkusua.hku.hk; hrntlwk@hkucc.hku.hk,"Ching, Wai Ki/D-3062-2009; Li, Wai Keung/AAL-7193-2020; Siu, Tak Kuen/AAJ-6372-2020; Li, Wai/I-7954-2015; /D-3103-2009","/0000-0001-9149-9289; Siu, Tak Kuen/0000-0003-2823-5138",,,,,15,6,7,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Disaggregate choice models regarding the ownership, type and usage of cars and motorcycles are required to achieve this. Consequently. this study proposes integrated car and motorcycle models based on a large-scale questionnaire survey of Taiwanese owners of cars and motorcycles, respectively. Incorporating gas mileage and emission coefficients for different types of cars and motorcycles into the proposed models can enable the estimation and comparison of reductions in energy consumption and emissions under various management strategies. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed integrated models, scenarios involving 10% and 30% increases in gas prices are analyzed and compared. The results indicate that gas price elasticities of cars and motorcycles are low, ranging from 0.47 to 0.50 for cars and 0.11 for motorcycles. Additionally, a high ratio of discouraged car users shifting to use of motorcycles neutralizes the effects of increased gas price in reducing energy consumption and emissions. Pollution of CO and HC even slightly increased because motorcycles are much more polluting in terms of CO and HC. At last, the reductions of energy consumption and emissions under 10% and 30% increase (or decrease) in other manipulating variables are also estimated and compared. The countermeasures for reducing ownership and usage of cars and motorcycles are then recommended accordingly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Throughout this study Spanish data are taken from the European Household Panel established between 1994 and 2001. The inference is based on those households surveyed in 1994 and onwards, including those who moved into their 1994-current residence after 1979. The follow-up of the household is conducted until the house is vacated or the sample observed in (year 2001) is finalized. We distinguish amongst owners, renters, and rent-free occupants or squatters (others), since these groups of households are known to exhibit a different pattern regarding residence time. Our approach for estimation is purely non parametric. This is an interesting feature, since we show that the renewal processes which represent the households' mobility have a non-constant rate over the period 1980-1994 for owners and rent-free occupants. This fact invalidates the method of inference based on the equilibrium equation proposed by Anily et al.

By contrast, in its everyday use envy involves interpersonal comparisons of well-being. We present, discuss results from free-form bargaining experiments on fair division problems in which inter-and intrapersonal criteria can be distinguished. We find that interpersonal comparisons play the dominant role.

The mean (standard error) rate of change in age at menarche by year of birth was -0.55 (0.02) years/decade. The rate of change was not constant, but varied between historical periods as follows: -1.44, -0.14, -0.60, and -0.36 years/decade for the periods 1941-1947, 1948-1958, 1959-1978, and 1979-1989, respectively. The changes in age at menarche correlated positively with the changes in the nation-wide rates of homicide within such periods; i.e. decelerations in the menarcheal trend coincided with increases in the rates of homicide and vice versa. The correlation was higher with the rates of homicide when women were 5 years of age (r = 0.99, p = 0.01) compared to the rates of homicide at the year of birth (0.55, p = 0.45). There were negative correlations between the changes in age at menarche and the changes in GDP, but they were weaker than those with the rates of homicide. These results could suggest a potential impact on maturation of psychosocial stress in childhood due to exposure to a generalized atmosphere of violence and fear. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

What is less well understood is how comparative identity processes shape EU identification. Drawing on social identity principles, we argue that EU identification is in part affected by tensions between relevant subgroup identities. To illustrate this point, two studies were conducted in UK regions (Wales and Cornwall). Findings confirm our prediction that a comparative context affects EU identity and indicate (a) that levels of EU identity were higher in contexts where regional identity was salient, and (b) that regional identity affected the bases and meaning of EU identification and EU endorsement. Discussion highlights the importance of taking context and intergroup relations into account when examining EU attitudes.","[Mols, Frank] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Haslam, S.

The analytically relevant correlation is the short-term one, defined as that between changes in saving and investment. Of special interest is the speed at which variables return to the long run equilibrium relationship, which is interpreted as being negatively related to the degree of capital mobility. The long run correlation, in turn, captures the coefficient implied by the solvency constraint. We find that heterogeneity and cross-section dependence completely change the estimation of the long run coefficient. Besides we obtain a more precise short run coefficient estimate compared to the existent estimates in the literature.

The shift of the single payment scheme from the historical to the regional model, as recommended in the Health Check final agreement, might further affect this sector and threat the existence of the olive-growing farms mainly in less productive areas. This work aims to analyse the potential effects of the latest CAP reform on olive growers' behaviour and economic performance in southern Italy. The object area is the Apulia region, which is one of the most important olive-growing regions in Italy. To analyze the economic impact of the reforni, we adopt a simulation scheme of the farm economic balance based on the definition and characterization of Representative Olive-growing Farms (ROFs). The analysis demonstrates that the regionalization of the entitlements would imply an income reduction for all farms, which is stronger in the << complete approximation >> scenario, and for those farms located in marginal areas.","[Roselli, Luigi; De Gennaro, Bernardo; Cimino, Orlando] Univ Bari, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Policy Evaluat & Rural Planning, I-70121 Bari, Italy; [Medicamento, Umberto] Univ Foggia, Fac Agr, Dept Prod Sci Engn Mech Econ Agr & Livestock Syst, Foggia, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Foggia,"Roselli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Policy Evaluat & Rural Planning, I-70121 Bari, Italy.",,"Roselli, Luigi/A-7933-2012; De Gennaro, Bernardo/J-3627-2013; Cimino, Orlando/AAP-3594-2021","Roselli, Luigi/0000-0002-1164-8772; De Gennaro, Bernardo/0000-0002-5273-8846; Cimino, Orlando/0000-0001-9841-7223",,,,,16,9,10,0,5,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2009,8.0,2,,,,,4,13,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,470GF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267962500002,0

EVIDENCE ACROSS COUNTRIES,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MIGRATION; PREFERENCES; POLICY; REDISTRIBUTION; ECONOMY; GROWTH,"This paper analyzes welfare-state determinants of individual attitudes toward immigrants-within and across countries- and their interaction with labor market drivers of preferences. We consider two mechanisms through which a redistributive welfare system might adjust as a result of immigration. Under the first model, immigration has a larger impact on high-income individuals, while under the second one low-income individuals are those most affected. Individual attitudes are consistent with the first welfare-state model and with labor market determinants. In countries where immigration is unskilled, income is negatively correlated with pro-immigration preferences, while skill is positively correlated with them. These relationships are reversed in economies characterized by skilled migration. We must end welfare state subsidies for illegal immigrants ... This alienates taxpayers and breeds suspicion of immigrants, even though the majority of them work very hard.

This finding has been interpreted as proof for the role of migrants in reducing trade-related transaction costs such as contract enforcement costs or information costs. This paper contributes to improving our understanding of trade-related transaction costs by analysing empirically whether temporary migrants, like permanent migrants, have an impact on bilateral trade flows. Temporary migrants can be expected to be less integrated in the host country than permanent migrants. At the same time, their knowledge of the home country can, on average, be expected to be more up-to-date. Our findings therefore give insights as to the relative importance of knowledge on the host and the home country for trade-related transaction costs. Using a gravity approach in our empirical analysis, we find that temporary migration has a positive and significant effect on trade and that temporary migration tends to have a stronger and more significant effect on both imports and exports than permanent migration. Interestingly, the role of temporary migrants in reducing trade costs does not appear to be associated with their skills.","[Jansen, Marion; Piermartini, Roberta] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Jansen, M (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,32,29,36,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2009,32.0,5,,,,,735,753,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01167.x,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,440QD,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265713900003,0

The diffusion of diesel cars is tied to issues of environmental impact, energy supply and demand, and changes in tax revenue. Policymakers can influence demand for diesel vehicles to protect social welfare and to observe international environmental protection laws. On the supply side, carmakers need to know consumer preferences regarding new vehicles to arrive at developmental strategies. This study used microsimulated demand forecasting to address these issues and predict consumer demand for diesel passenger cars. The model accommodates governmental policies and car attributes such as price and engine efficiency. We find that consumers will likely prefer diesel passenger cars to gasoline ones due to the low operation costs of the former in spite of high purchase price when diesel is relatively cheaper than gasoline. Finally we find that diesel passenger cars will capture a 42% market penetration ratio under the pricing system suggested by the Ministry of Environment of Korea. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Theoretical analyses within the so-called new economic geography have suggested that this phenomenon can be related to trade policies. However. no theoretical consensus has been reached concerning the direction of this effect. just a few empirical studies have attempted to explore this link. In this paper we exploit the cross-sectoral pattern of tariff protection to explicitly assess to what extent trade policy explains observed geographical concentration of industries in Argentina. This country is an interesting case because economic activities have been traditionally concentrated around the Great Buenos Aires area, while at the same time tariffs have been high on average and have displayed a large cross-sectoral variation over the last decades. The econometric evidence suggests that trade policy has had indeed a significant impact on manufacturing location. In particular, lower sectoral tariffs have been associated with de-concentration of industries out of the area surrounding Buenos Aires. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using industry and immigration data by metropolitan area, the authors examine the impact of immigration on industry employment change during the 1990 decade. Results show that cities that attracted immigrants experienced slower declines in computer employment than they would have in the absence of immigration.","[Howland, Marie] Univ Maryland, Urban Studies & Planning Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Howland, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Urban Studies & Planning Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Nguyen, Doan/AAX-1500-2020","Nguyen, Doan/0000-0003-3299-839X",,,,,35,4,4,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The Liberals countered by not only defending free trade, but proposing land reform. Recent analyses fail to account for the cleavages exposed between 1903 and 1910. The dominant cleavage divided the country along the lines of agricultural sectors, but was cross-cut by a factor-based cleavage in urban areas. This pattern is explained by the Liberals' policies on land use and taxes, which altered voters' evaluations of the impact of trade.","McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Brawley, MR (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The paper then contrasts the epistemology of OEP, based on partial equilibrium analysis, with that of the 'British' school of IPE, which favors a more holistic approach. This difference is not captured well in the TRIP survey, nor is it particularly well understood by many proponents of either side. Recognizing the progressive nature of the OEP research program, the essay concludes with a call to bridge but not necessarily to abolish the transatlantic divide.","Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Lake, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,,,,,42,36,40,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The internal financing means the fund comes from depreciation and retained earnings. No matter the amount of fixed assets, depreciation policy, or the profit and its distribution are all closely related to the government's tax policy, especially corporate income tax policy. To support and protect the development of SMEs, a routine is constructing favorable tax law or policy by different governments. Though the Chinese government published favorable tax law or policy especially to the SMEs, these tax preferential policies mostly encourages technical transformation not stimulates more internal financing. For example, The State Administration of Taxation's Technology Innovation about Corporate Income Preference (Public Finance & Taxation [2006], number 88) permitted SMEs technical development expenses deducted before paying taxes. We must pay attention to the following law, Chinese government formally carried out new The Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprise Income Tax on January 1(st), 2008. Although it made domestic and foreign enterprise corporate income tax balance, in the meantime, it rescinded meager profit enterprises' 18% and 27% income tax preferential rate. The meager profit enterprises only carry out 20% income preferential rate. In practice, some of the SMEs tax burden much heavier than before. Just because this fact, SMEs abnormal leave phenomena happened frequently. There were more than 200 Korea SMEs abnormal leave phenomena happened in Chengyang district, Qingdao, China from the latter half of the year 2007 to the first half of the year 2008.([1]) Developed Countries, such as America, England, France and Japan an gives SMEs positive income tax preferential policy, especially stimulates its internal financing. On the contrary, some Chinese tax clauses restrict internal financing. Therefore, much adjustments of the tax policy can be carried out. The paper puts forth the proposal and countermeasure of tax policy based on elaborate analysis to stimulate internal financing of Chinese SMES.","[Lin Yongchun] Tianjin Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Business Management, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Technology & Education,,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,SICHUAN UNIV PRESS,CHENGDU,"29 WANGJIANGLU, JIUYANQIAO, CHENGDU, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5614-4376-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,274,279,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268879300037,0

Auctions for spectrum allocation are devoted to selling frequency spectrum to telecommunication companies. Several auction formats were discussed for realizing the spectrum auction objectives such as efficient outcome, preventing monopolization, and maximizing revenue. Bandwidth auction problems are characterized by sellers with slots of bandwidth and by buyers with values for bundles of slots. The allocation problem here is to assign combinations of bandwidth slots to buyers and match them with sellers so as to maximize the total surplus in the system. These problems lead to combinatorial auctions with multiple criteria.

Furthermore, the paper introduces Wald tests for conditional spatial sigma-convergence based on a spatial maximum likelihood approach. Empirical estimates for 212 European regions covering the period 1980-2002 reveal a slow speed of convergence of about 0.4-0.6% per year under both models. However, pronounced heterogeneity in the convergence speed is evident. The Wald tests indicate significant conditional spatial sigma-convergence of about 1.6% per year under the spatial Solow model. Verdoorn's specification points to a smaller average variance reduction during the considered period. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It included a small but strong group of economists, among them the notable Luigi Amoroso and Giulio La Volpe. The more ambitious project carried out by the Paretians was the dynamization of the theory of general equilibrium. In accordance with the main international research programs, also in Italy, the 1930s were the years of economic dynamics. Luigi Amoroso, following his scientific formation and emphasizing the analogies using physical sciences, in particular rational mechanics, proposed a view of economic dynamics based on the habits; La Volpe turned his attention to choices grounded in plans and predictions, that is, in the future. The Paretian approach to dynamics was one of the most original products of the Italian tradition during this period, at least in the field of pure theorizing, but, for the reasons that we will attempt to explore, it did not have a significant impact in the working out of economic dynamics in the post-war period.","Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Pomini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",mario.pomini@unipd.it,,,,,,,66,1,1,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

If instead payoffs in some states are always lower than in all others then ignoring the bad states is no longer inconsistent with these axioms.

What is seldom acknowledged, however, is the role that this language of crisis and collapse - what might be called a 'crisis discourse' - has had on framing trade negotiations and in maintaining forward momentum in the liberalization process. This discourse has played a role in facilitating the kind of institutional development that the GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO) has undergone - helping to push through bargains among GATT contracting parties and WTO members that have been (and remain) deeply asymmetrical - and driving the trade agenda forward at moments when the institution appears deadlocked; and it has continued to play a role in the current round of negotiations. The aims of the paper are twofold. First, the paper explores the content of the crisis discourse. Second, it examines the way in which the discourse has been deployed as a means of reframing trade negotiations in such a way that the likelihood of their continuation and ultimate conclusion increases. The paper does this by focusing on the collapse and resumption of the negotiations in the wake of the WTO's 2005 Hong Kong ministerial meeting, though the crisis discourse and its intensification at moments of intransigence has been a key feature of trade negotiations since the Allies first sat down to develop a trade architecture in the wartime and early post-war years.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Int Polit, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Wilkinson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Int Polit, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Wilkinson, Rorden/0000-0002-0883-8081",,,,,85,35,36,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We validate these findings for Germany using the BIAdata Base Project and the German Socio-Economic Panel. While we find no significant correlation between BMI and wages in any of our models, simple linear regression models featuring both contemporary and time-lagged fatness measures indicate that FFM and, to a lesser extent, BF are associated with hourly wages: more specifically, the relationship between FFM/BF and hourly wages is about two to three times higher for females than for males. In contrast, fixed-effects models indicate that there is no correlation between hourly wages and both FFM and BF with one exception: a significant correlation (and one in line with expectations) is found to be the rule among job changers.

There is, however, confusion about what 'normative power' actually means, which is why the debate over whether the EU actually is or is not a normative power has not always been as fruitful as it could be. This article proposes two necessary starting points for more constructive discussion: a distinction between 'normative' and 'normal', and a distinction between 'power as a powerful actor' and 'power as ability to cause effects'. Furthermore, the article distinguishes between 'normative identity', 'normative interests', 'normative behaviour', 'normative means of power' and 'normative outcomes' as separate features of a normative power. There are also at least four different mechanisms through which normative power is exercised: by persuasion, by invoking norms, by shaping the discourse and by leading through example. The article concludes that normative power is best seen as an ideal type - one which the EU approximates more closely than other great powers.","Univ Tampere, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Tampere 33014, Finland",Tampere University,"Forsberg, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Tampere 33014, Finland.",,,,,,,,64,82,84,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In a B2C (business-to-consumer) context, the authors examine the interrelationships among hotel website factors, e-satisfaction, e-trust, e-loyalty and switching costs. They extend prior research by incorporating these constructs into a more comprehensive conceptual framework. This study answers three research questions. First, will the three components of website factors (communication, transaction and customization) have a significant effect on e-loyalty through e-satisfaction and e-trust? Second, do e-satisfaction and e-trust mediate e-loyalty? Third, do switching costs have a moderating effect between e-satisfaction, e-trust and e-loyalty? The authors examine data compiled from customers who have booked hotel accommodation online. The results support their hypotheses and confirm both the mediation role of e-satisfaction and e-trust and the moderation role of switching costs. Conceptually, this study provides an empirical validation of website factors, e-satisfaction, e-trust and loyalty linkage. At the managerial level, the research provides insights into the critical drivers of loyalty in the emerging online marketplace.","[Han, Jin Soo; Lee, Gyehee] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Kim, Woo Gon] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Dedman Sch Hospitality, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Rachjaibun, Nitta] Blue Spice Restaurant Grp, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Kyung Hee University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Han, JS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, 1 Hoegi Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",wkim@cob.fsu.edu; nitta@blue-spice.com; jshan@khu.ac.kr; ghlee@khu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Woo Gon/0000-0002-5898-7528",,,,,98,9,12,1,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The models for participation and working hours are simultaneously estimated for different levels of education. It is found that socio-cultural factors have slightly more impact on the employment decisions of lower educated mothers compared to their higher educated counterparts, although the differences are only minor. Despite the level of education, socio-cultural factors appear to be more important in mothers' employment decisions than financial-economic factors. In addition, both factors are better predictors for mothers' decisions to participate than for their number of working hours; demographic variables are found to be the most important predictor for mothers' working hours.","[Cloin, Marielle; Keuzenkamp, Saskia] Netherlands Inst Social Res, SCP, NL-2500 BD The Hague, Netherlands; [Keuzenkamp, Saskia] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Plantenga, Janneke] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ USE, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Utrecht University,"Cloïn, M (通讯作者)，Netherlands Inst Social Res, SCP, Parnassusplein 5,POB 16164, NL-2500 BD The Hague, Netherlands.",m.cloin@scp.nl,"Cloin, Mariëlle/CAI-2609-2022; Cloin, Mariëlle/CAF-7493-2022","Cloin, Mariëlle/0000-0003-3386-4094; Cloin, Mariëlle/0000-0003-3386-4094",,,,,35,14,15,1,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In the model, if research is not disclosed via lobbying it enters the public domain and, subsequently, is randomly observed by the policy maker (PM). Consequently, the interest group strategically chooses both whether to fund research and whether to lobby it versus let it be randomly observed. The main result is that for a range of parameter values, in equilibrium the interest group sometimes funds, but never lobbies, research. This behavior effectively jams the public signal of the PM, making the policy choice worse on average. This occurs despite all research being unbiased. The results provide qualified theoretical support for the value of research funding transparency and implications for the interpretation of interest group funded research.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Stone, DF (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",dan.stone@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2011,37.0,3,,,,,397,424,,10.1007/s00355-010-0496-z,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,811OJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294220700002,0

We model the long-run volatility change as a recurrent structure change, while short-run changes in the mean growth rate as regime switches. Both structure and regime are unobserved. The structure is assumed to be Markovian. Conditioning on the structure, the regime is also Markovian, whose transition matrix is structure-dependent. This formulation imposes interpretable restrictions on the Hamilton Markov switching model. Empirical studies show that this restricted model well identifies both short-run regime switches and long-run structure changes in the US macroeconomic data.

The panel data for the period of 1980-2003 include all the countries having the data on an EDIS. The major finding is that if the interaction between a country's overall economic development and its use of an EDIS is not controlled for, the country's use of the EDIS increases the probability of a banking crisis. This increase is greater the more inefficiently designed the EDIS is. However, once the interaction between the overall economic development and the use of the EDIS is controlled for, it is found that the EDIS itself is not a significant factor of a banking crisis. In that case, the less developed the country is that is using an EDIS, the higher the probability of a banking crisis.","[Khan, Anichul Hoque] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Dewan, Hasnat] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 5N3, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Khan, AH (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr,WMC 3602, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",anichul.khan@gmail.com; hdewan@tru.ca,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

From a tourism management point of view, a measure such as the TTCI is expected to be instrumental in explaining and predicting the tourism performance of receiving countries. This study explores several ways to transform the TTCI into a formative structural model. Partial least squares path modelling, PLS regression, mixture modelling and non-linear covariance-based structural equation modelling are applied to examine the TTCI's predictive power. The analysis probes possible measures for improvement. The destination countries may be subject to unobserved heterogeneity with regard to how the various constituents of competitiveness act on tourism performance.

Of particular interest are any shifts in the importance of cost pass-through and pricing-to-market for import pricing in Germany that may have ocurred since the 1990s. We analyse pricing in single equations for 11 product categories because the factors influencing the pricing behaviour, eg competitive pressure, may well have developed differently on the individual product markets. The Saikkonen (1991) approach is applied to test the import price levels for changes in the impact of their determinants. After aggregating the findings for the individual product categories, we find that, on the whole, pricing-to-market has increased, whereas cost pass-through via foreign costs and exchange rates is lower, but not via commodity prices.","Deutsche Bundesbank, Dept Econ, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Stahn, K (通讯作者)，Deutsche Bundesbank, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,5,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

He makes a distinction between the decision to go to a physician and the number of times the physician is visited in the observed time period. Winkelmann finds that there is no correlation between both decisions. This result appears to be far from straightforward since the primary driving force in both decisions will be the health of the patient. From this perspective a significant correlation is expected. In this paper, I first replicate part of Winkelmann's research. I then set out to analyse whether the zero correlation is actually true or comes from the way the relation between both decisions is modelled. My empirical analysis confirms the latter, but nevertheless also corroborates Winkelmann's main conclusions on the relevance of the explanatory variables used in his investigation.

Plurality Voting is compared with Approval Voting and Dual Voting, both of which allow to vote for multiple candidates, but differ in whether voters are required to cast all their votes. We find that in most elections held under Plurality Voting and Approval Voting, at most two candidates are viable. By contrast, three candidates are viable in a sizable number of elections held under Dual Voting due to strategic voting. Our evidence suggests that Approval Voting may encourage a two-party system, whereas Dual Voting may encourage multipartism.

Using a unique 15-year panel of Florida cities that includes both detailed revenue and house price data, we investigate the pathways whereby a change in house price may affect city revenue per capita and test for symmetric effects during housing booms and busts. For the median-sized city, we find that while increases in house price raise revenues, decreases in price have no effect on revenues. In addition, the former impact is small in magnitude. While the strongest pathway is through assessed values, our results illustrate that a change in house price can also affect other sources of revenue besides ad valorem taxes. The overall conclusion is that movements in Florida housing markets are only weakly related to a city's property taxes and total revenues per capita, which fails to support the argument portrayed in the popular press that house price changes strongly impact local budgets.

A hypothesis that contrasts two types of activity (facility based and local culture based) is examined. First, from a conceptual perspective, the authors note that agritourism based on local cultural resources can internalize positive externalities, which are uniquely nurtured local cultural resources, into income unlike facility based activity that has no connection with local cultural resources. Second, the results of estimations from a price determinant ordered logit model demonstrate that owning a swimming pool is the most common and influential factor in enhancing the price level, while regional diversity is observed in local cultural resource based activities such as restaurants, World Heritage Sites and DOC wines. These findings indicate that hardware based evolution is more effective in the short term than evolution based on software. Nevertheless, this hardware based evolution of agritourism is founded implicitly on an assumption of continuously growing demand and sufficient financial capability for the fixed investment. When growth in demand becomes stagnant, facility installation can be a heavy burden on operators. Consequently, for the sustainable development of agritourism, it will be necessary to harness the locality so as to create a balance between facility based services and local culture based services.","[Ohe, Yasuo] Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Chiba 2718510, Japan; [Ciani, Adriano] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ & Food Sci, I-06100 Perugia, Italy",Chiba University; University of Perugia,"Ohe, Y (通讯作者)，Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 648 Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",yohe@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Ohe, Yasuo/K-1096-2019",,,,,,40,31,32,2,68,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The explanatory variables for regional growth include measures of New Economy inputs (innovation, human capital, and entrepreneurial environment) and industry structure (composition, size, age, and diversity). The findings indicate that metro growth rates in per capita income are associated primarily with New Economy inputs whereas employment growth rates are related primarily to industry structure characteristics. In addition, interaction terms between the policy and structure variables indicate that policy inferences from indices of competitiveness should vary by city type. For example, increases in knowledge workers and entrepreneurial environment are more positively associated with income growth rates in the smaller, more specialized metropolitan areas.

Specifically, immigrant homeowners experienced a 41.7% increase in median home values between 2001 and 2006, while the median value of housing owned by the native-born increased by 59.4% over the same period. We use a semi-parametric decomposition approach to assess the relative importance of the various determinants of home values in producing this gap. We find that the differential returns to housing wealth are not related to changes in the nature of the houses or the neighborhoods in which immigrants and native-born homeowners live. Rather, the gap stems from the fact that over time there were differential changes across groups in the hedonic prices (i.e., returns) associated with the underlying determinants of home values.

Nonetheless, Chinese commercial banks, decoupled from the rest of the world, achieved remarkable results because of their risk-averse nature and banking reform during the past 10 years. To improve corporate governance and efficiency, the latest reform was focused on ownership transformation via foreign participation and stock listing. Employing data of 14 listed Chinese banks during the period 1999-2008, this paper tests whether IPO was an effective way to enhance banks' efficiency using two frontier approaches, data envelopment analysis and SFA. The results confirm our hypothesis and suggest that restructuring banks into shareholding companies improves both technical efficiency and scale economies. This conclusion is further confirmed by the technical inefficiency effects model which found that efficiency rating of listed banks was about 5 per cent higher than their prior IPO level. Facing tougher economic condition and increased competition, banks not only need to broaden income sources, cut expenditures, but more importantly, to strengthen their risk management to become more resistant to a volatile business environment.","[Luo, Dan; Yao, Shujie; Chen, Jian] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Yao, Shujie; Wang, Jianling] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Xian, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Luo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,,,,,,42,20,23,2,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2011,34.0,5,,,,,805,825,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01354.x,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,769RB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291034800009,0

We compare the effects of predictable and unpredictable house price changes, which we use to capture the collateral and wealth effects of house prices respectively. We further analyze the relationship between the effects and household borrowing constraints, as well as the temporal pattern of the effects. Our analysis provides the following findings. First, house price changes have significant effects on GMP growth, and the effect of predictable changes (the collateral effect) is about three times stronger than the effect of unpredictable changes (the wealth effect). Second, the persistent component of predictable changes has a stronger collateral effect than the novel component. Third, when households are more financially constrained, the collateral effect is stronger, the wealth effect is weaker, and the total effect remains unchanged. Finally, the effects last for eight quarters, and peak on the fourth quarter after house price changes take place.","[Peng, Liang] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Miller, Norman] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Sklarz, Michael] Collateral Analyt, Honolulu, HI 96816 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of San Diego,"Peng, L (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, 419 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",liang.peng@colorado.edu,,,,,,,26,77,82,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The duration of prices is found to be 3.9 months on average. There is no clear heterogeneity across main groupings in the frequency of price changes, but more dependence on imported goods reduces price stickiness. Price decreases are less frequent than price increases, indicating downward rigidity in prices. There is evidence in favour of both time and state-dependent price setting behaviours. Further, there is a low degree of synchronization of price changes across firms, whereas price increases tend to be more synchronized than price decreases. Ordered probit models show that price adjustments depend on the type of the shock: the pass-through of a change in the cost is faster than changing demand. Besides, estimated probabilities of price adjustments with 5-years rolling windows reveal that inflation targeting has succeeded in bringing down the probability of price increases, whereas downward price rigidity has not weakened yet.","[Sahinoz, Saygin] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Saracoglu, Bedriye] Gazi Univ, Econometr Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Gazi University,"Sahinöz, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",saygin.sahinoz@tcmb.gov.tr; bedriye@gazi.edu.tr,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This allowed women to increase their human capital both formally and informally in the years before child bearing so that more informed mothers brought up better educated offspring. The demographic pattern influenced the stock of human capital and directly contributed to Western Europe's development advantage.

We extend this literature by focusing on how 'within-MNE' heterogeneity affects the extent to which one can identify the TFP threshold in the exporter-MNE TFP relationship. Within-MNE heterogeneity is established by determining both the number and location of the foreign affiliates established by each MNE. In this way, we separate single-affiliate MNEs from those with multiple affiliates, as well as analyse the role played by vertical FDI, a topic typically ignored in previous stochastic dominance tests of the Helpman et al. (2004, American Economic Review, 94, 300-16) hypothesis. Our empirical tests employ Japanese firm-level FDI and TFP data for the period 1975-2000. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to determine stochastic dominance, we find significant TFP heterogeneity within the MNE group based on investment history and affiliate geographic location. While our results confirm the standard HMY three-tiered classification to exist for Japanese firms, exporter-MNE 'between-group' TFP heterogeneity is sensitive to the 'within-MNE' investment history heterogeneity. We note that single- and two-affiliate MNEs are statistically more similar to exporting firms than to MNEs with greater foreign affiliate totals. This shows the exporter-MNE TFP threshold to be not as explicit as Helpman et al. (2004, American Economic Review, 94, 300-16) suggest. In fact, our results allow us to identify the MNE-side width of Girma et al.'s (2005, Economic Letters, 83, 317-24) 'uncertainty region' surrounding this threshold. Finally, we also find a strong TFP-market orientation relationship exists where the most productive firms follow complex integration strategies, lesser TFP firms do horizontal FDI, and the least productive MNEs do vertical FDI.","[Kukulski, Jeffrey] US Bur Census, Kalamazoo, MI USA; [Ryan, Michael] Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Western Michigan University,"Kukulski, J (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Kalamazoo, MI USA.",,,"Ryan, Michael/0000-0001-9381-3112",,,,,28,9,10,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2011,34.0,4,,,,,546,567,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01343.x,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,745KA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289163100003,0

Two different approximations can be found in the literature: first, a univariate approach that has focused on the stochastic properties of the stock of debt and, second, a multivariate one that has focused on the long-run properties of the flows of expenditures and revenues, i.e., in the stochastic properties of the deficit. In this paper we unify these approaches considering the stock-flow system that fiscal variables configure. Our approach involves working in an I(2) stochastic processes framework. Given the possibility of the existence of regime shifts in the sustainability of US deficit that the literature has pointed out, we develop a new statistic that can be applied to test several types of I(2) cointegration and multicointegration relationships allowing for regime shifts. To test for these kinds of changing long-run relationships we propose the use of a residual-based Dickey-Fuller class of statistic that accounts for one structural break. We show that consistent estimates of the break fraction can be obtained through the minimization of the sum of squared residuals when there is I(2) cointegration. The finite sample performance of the proposed statistic is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. The econometric methodology is applied to assess whether the US fiscal deficit and debt are sustainable. Copyright.

An early preoccupation was with the way a large section of the workforce had been removed from employment altogether. Over time, researchers paid more attention to groups which remained marginal to the workforce even when unemployment fell: who, or what, was keeping them at the margins? Similarly, early attention to policy adjustments that might make it easier for people to live with unemployment was replaced by research of much broader policy relevance as researchers felt able to move beyond the defensive position they had adopted in response to the neo-liberal public policy agenda. Much of the research published after 2000 was characterised by greater confidence in social science but also by higher expectations of public policy.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Fevre, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WT, S Glam, Wales.",Fevre@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,15,16,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Workers with MNE experience contribute 20% more to the productivity of their plant than workers without such experience, even after controlling for differences in unobservable worker characteristics. The private return to mobility is smaller than the productivity effect at the plant level, which suggests that labor mobility from MNEs to non-MNEs represents a true knowledge externality.","Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Balsvik, R (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Bergen, Norway.",,,,,,,,37,130,147,0,37,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In theory, these systems could lead to great reductions in the use of private vehicles; however, in practice they have obtained limited success for two main reasons: the psychological barriers associated with riding with strangers and poor schedule flexibility. To overcome some of the limitations of the traditional schemes, we proposed studying a carpooling club model with two main new features: establishing a base trust level for carpoolers to find compatible matches for traditional groups and at the same time allowing to search for a ride in an alternative group when the pool member has a trip schedule different from the usual one. A web-based survey was developed for the Lisbon Metropolitan Region (Portugal), including a Stated Preference experiment, to test the concept and confirm previous knowledge on these systems' determinants. It was found through a binary logit Discrete Choice Model calibration that carpooling is still attached with lower income strata and that saving money is still an important reason for participating in it. The club itself does not show promise introducing more flexibility in these systems; however, it should provide a way for persons to interact and trust each other at least to the level of working colleagues.

An open-economy after-tax capital asset pricing model is used to derive the hypothesis that JGTRRA should lead to a portfolio reallocation by U.S. investors toward equities in tax-favored countries. A difference-in-difference analysis that compares U.S. equity holdings in affected and unaffected countries finds a substantial portfolio reallocation toward the former. This effect cannot be explained by several potential alternative hypotheses, including differential changes to the preferences of American investors, differential changes in investment opportunities, differential time trends in investment, changed tax evasion behavior, or changes in stock prices associated (or contemporaneous) with JGTRRA.","[Desai, Mihir A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Desai, Mihir A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dharmapala, Dhammika] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Desai, MA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Dharmapala, Dhammika/GPF-9205-2022","Dharmapala, Dhammika/0000-0001-9858-0565",,,,,51,38,43,0,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Reminiscent of the film Avatar, this expansion drives conflicts over land, territory and political control of space. This expansion is occurring in both overtly neoliberal regimes and in self-consciously post-neoliberal ones. This essay documents the convergence among the different regimes' ways of governing extraction and socio-environmental conflicts. We draw on Executive level statements and policy positions as well as on statements by indigenous peoples' organisations. Among the reasons for this apparent convergence are: long-standing resource curse effects; the need to generate resources to finance social policy instruments that are integral to the governments' overall political strategies; power and information asymmetries among companies and governments; and international relations. The convergences among Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru regarding the governance of extraction and the conflicts that it catalyses suggests the need for great critical caution before using the terminology of post-neoliberalism.","[Bebbington, Anthony] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Bebbington, Denise Humphreys] Clark Univ, Dept Int Dev & Social Change, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Bebbington, Denise Humphreys] Clark Univ, Inst Dev Community & Environm, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University; Clark University; Clark University,"Bebbington, A (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",abebbington@clarku.edu; dbebbington@clarku.edu,,"Humphreys Bebbington, Denise/0009-0005-9794-7835",ESRC [ES/D003040/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,175,208,1,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Although this is well known to occur with independent I(1) processes, this paper provides theoretical and numerical evidence that the phenomenon of spurious regression also arises in regressions between stationary AR(p) processes with structural breaks, which occur at different points in time, in the means and the trends. The intuition behind this is that structural breaks can increase the persistence levels in the processes (e.g., Granger and Hyung (2004)), which then leads to spurious regressions. These phenomena occur for general distributions and serial dependence of the innovation terms.","[Chu, Ba] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Kozhan, Roman] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Finance Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Carleton University; University of Warwick,"Chu, B (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, B-857 Loeb Bldg,1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",ba_chu@carleton.ca; roman.kozhan@wbs.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,4,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1081-1826,,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

One of them was the corporate economic theory - understood as a theory which asserted the fundamental role of the state in economic affairs. The protagonists of this attempt to integrate in Italy corporatism into economic science were L. Amoroso, G. La Volpe, E. Fossati, G. Del Vecchio, M. Fanno, G. Papi, and G. Masci, and therefore leading economists of the Italian school who adhered to both the Marshallian and Paretian traditions. The discussion in Italy was concerned more with economic policy problems than rigorous theoretical analysis. What interested the Italian economists was not the development of new theories, but the introduction of new economic institutions able to give concrete responses to the dramatic economic problems of the time. The principal result of economic reflection on corporatism was recognition of the state's central economic role also within a free-market economic system.","Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Pomini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",mario.pomini@unipd.it,,"POMINI, Mario/0000-0001-5046-2228",,,,,49,2,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

This paper analyzes how CDM projects may lead to leakage of emissions elsewhere in Non-Annex B countries. Leakage occurs because emissions reductions under a CDM project may affect market equilibrium in regional and/or global energy and product markets, and thereby increase emissions elsewhere. We also account for potential reverse or negative leakage effects in Non-Annex B from higher emissions cap in Annex B. Our conclusion is that net leakage typically is positive and sizeable, thus leading to an overall increase in global GHG emissions when CDM projects are undertaken.

When it has, it appears that the central character was designed to warn the early eighteenth-century reader against political challenges to the existing economic order. Insofar as Defoe's Crusoe stands for 'economic man', he is a reflection of historically produced assumptions about the need for social conformity, not the embodiment of any genuinely essential economic characteristics. This insight is used to compare Defoe's conception of economic man with that of the neoclassical Robinson Crusoe economy. On the most important of the ostensibly generic principles espoused by neoclassical theorists, their 'Robinson' has no parallels with Defoe's Crusoe. Despite the shared name, two quite distinct social constructions serve two equally distinct pedagogical purposes. Defoe's Crusoe extols the virtues of passive middle-class sobriety for effective social organisation; the neoclassical Robinson champions the establishment of markets for the sake of productive efficiency.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Watson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",matthew.g.watson@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,6,6,4,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This article examines how ideologies might permeate academic texts, by assessing the reach and influence of neoliberalism in research on boundaryless careers. Specifically, it asks: did the emergence and growth of scholarship on boundaryless careers support, challenge, or merely run parallel to the rising dominance of neoliberal ideology? It was found that a diversity of knowledge interests, including managerial, agentic, curatorial and critical interests underlie the production of research on boundaryless careers. However, all four of these knowledge interests are complicit in discursively constructing and aligning the notion of boundaryless careers with neoliberalism in two specific ways. Implications for scholarship on careers and work are discussed.","[Roper, Juliet] Univ Waikato, Dept Management Commun, Hamilton 3214, New Zealand; [Inkson, Kerr] Univ Waikato, Dept Strategy & Human Resource Management, Hamilton 3214, New Zealand",University of Waikato; University of Waikato,"Roper, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Management Commun, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3214, New Zealand.",jroper@waikato.ac.nz; sganesh@waikato.ac.nz; kinkson@waikato.ac.nz,"Roper, Juliet/O-9994-2017",,,,,,65,72,85,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We estimate the first indices of bilateral freight rates and directly incorporate these into a standard gravity model. We also take the endogeneity of bilateral trade and freight rates seriously and propose an instrumental variables approach.

First, we recognize that child schooling and labor are not the sole activities that children can engage in and include idleness as one of the choices. Second, we use a hierarchical model with spatially correlated random effects to analyze the determinants of the choice of children's activities. Lastly, we recommend that pro-schooling intervention be implemented in districts with favorable attitudes toward schooling and unfavorable attitudes toward idleness, while anti-child-labor interventions be implemented in districts where attitudes toward child labor are less favorable. We thus identify two groups of Indian districts to target appropriate government interventions.","[Chamarbagwala, Rubiana] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Tchernis, Rusty] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Chamarbagwala, R (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall,Room 105,100 S Woodlawn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rchamarb@indiana.edu; rtchernis@gsu.edu,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using the concept of Relative Liquidity Constraint (RLC)-a stochastic variable that captures the randomness of future individual constraints and market conditions-the study presents the first ex ante analysis that extends the investigation of the issue of seller heterogeneity to the point of the buying decision, that is, from the perspective of the buyer's (future seller's) point of view. We show that seller constraint, as well as the uncertainty of such a constraint, significantly depresses the expected selling price and increases risk.

As is shown, group beliefs can incorporate all information spread across individuals without individuals having to explicitly communicate their information (that may be too complex or personal to describe, or not describable in principle in the language). The group beliefs derived here take a simple multiplicative form if people's information is independent (and a more complex form if information overlaps arbitrarily).

This article attempts to answer this question, using product-level manufacturing import data from Japan. To make the comparison clear, this article also examines exports from the EU. The results indicate that more than 85 per cent and 83 per cent of products exported by the US and the EU, respectively, to Japan are also commonly exported from China. Both the US and the EU export products are priced higher than China's export products, regardless of industries. This result suggests that quality differences matter in explaining the high overlap of China's export products with US and EU export products. In some industries, however, the price differences of US and EU exports relative to China's exports are relatively small. This result implies that either Chinese firms are upgrading the quality of their products, or US and EU firms are improving their efficiencies such that they can compete with Chinese firms.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Kiyota, K (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",,,"Kiyota, Kozo/0000-0001-7649-9870",,,,,30,7,7,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2010,33.0,10,,,,,1302,1324,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01295.x,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,658UY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282516100006,0

In post-conflict countries within Africa, a re-evaluation of the trade union role is particularly pressing, given the impact of privatisation and restructuring on employment and the large informal sector workforce. Strategies for renewal in advanced economies include the organising model and community unionism, but to what extent are these strategies of value in emerging economies? This article draws on exploratory research in Mozambique to examine union change and development in the context of adversity and the possibilities of, and progress towards, union renewal. Findings reveal some progress on employment rights and engagement with the informal sector. However, future prospects rely on broader economic and institutional changes: improvements in infrastructure; better enforcement of employment legislation; and transition from informal to formal sector work.","Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Dibben, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",p.dibben@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Dibben, Pauline/0000-0002-4410-3189",,,,,62,14,15,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

While the mistake of giving the EU analytical primacy as a benchmark or model is to be avoided, it is argued that careful treatment of accumulated insights from EU studies (including a proper re-inspection of classical integration theory) brings clear methodological and meta-theoretical benefits for the project of comparative regional integration scholarship.","[Warleigh-Lack, Alex] Brunel Univ, Dept Polit & Hist, Sch Social Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Warleigh-Lack, Alex] UNU CRIS, Bruges, England; [Rosamond, Ben] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Brunel University; University of Warwick,"Warleigh-Lack, A (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Polit & Hist, Sch Social Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",alex.warleigh-lack@brunel.ac.uk,,"Rosamond, Ben/0000-0003-1487-7703",,,,,79,59,65,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Yet, research on the effect of democracy on economic growth volatility has consistently found that higher levels of democracy reduce volatility. Similarly, research has found that higher levels of economic development retard volatility. Using a novel empirical approach, this article presents evidence of an interactive effect between higher levels of democratization and economic development on growth volatility. Specifically, the marginal effect of political development on volatility is negative until countries reach per capita income levels of about $2,700, depending on the conditioning set. The marginal effect is insignificant for countries with higher levels of income. This implies that at a minimum, nearly 50% of the countries in our sample could enjoy less volatile economies with greater political development.","[Edwards, Jeffrey A.] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Thames, Frank C.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Edwards, JA (通讯作者)，N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 E Market St, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",jaedwar2@ncat.edu; frank.thames@ttu.edu,,"Thames, Frank/0000-0002-1853-628X",,,,,60,8,8,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For issuances made between 1997 and 2006, we find strong support for the market timing theory of capital structure. Controlling for past returns and growth, a REIT is more likely to issue equity when its price-to-net asset value ratio is high. This suggests that REITs issue equity in public markets when the cost of equity capital is lower in the public market than in the private market. Consistent with traditional market timing, REITs are more likely to issue equity after experiencing large price increases. We also find some support for REITs following the trade-off theory of capital structure.

Nationally, representative samples were conducted in 1997, at the start of the economic take off, and again in 2004. Children aged 0-60 months were included in the Surveys (N = 436, 552). Both surveys included a sociodemographic, dietary and health questionnaire, and anthropometric measurements from which height-for-age (HAZ); weight-for-age (WAZ) and weight-for-height (WHZ) Z-scores were calculated. Between 1997 and 2004, the prevalence of child overweight for all children increased from 21.8% to 31.7%, especially in urban areas (from 18.2% to 29.4%, p=0.01). Stunting prevalence among children >= 2 years old decreased (from 57.9% to 45.3%, p < 0.02), but for all age groups remained very high (34.7% overall, 46.5% rural and 28.5% urban in 2004). The economic take off in Equatorial Guinea appeared to coincide with substantial increases in the prevalence of child overweight whereas the prevalence of stunting decreased even if it remained high. The results suggest that the country is undergoing a nutrition transition and acquiring the concomitant double burden of under and over nutrition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Typically, the aggregation rules considered in the literature are social choice correspondences. In this paper the aggregation rules of interest are social welfare functions (SWFs). We investigate the problem of constructing a SWF that is non-manipulable. In this context, individuals attempt to manipulate a social ordering as opposed to a social choice. Using techniques from an ordinal version of fuzzy set theory, we introduce a class of ordinally fuzzy binary relations of which exact binary relations are a special case. Operating within this family enables us to prove an impossibility theorem. This theorem states that all non-manipulable SWFs are dictatorial, provided that they are not constant. This theorem uses a weaker transitivity condition than the one in Perote-Pea and Piggins (J Math Econ 43:564-580, 2007), and the ordinal framework we employ is more general than the cardinal setting used there. We conclude by considering several ways of circumventing this impossibility theorem.","[Duddy, Conal; Piggins, Ashley] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Perote-Pena, Juan] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Zaragoza,"Piggins, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",conal.duddy@gmail.com; jperote@unizar.es; ashley.piggins@nuigalway.ie,"Perote-Peña, Juan/F-2659-2016; Duddy, Conal/IYS-6034-2023","Duddy, Conal/0000-0002-7801-9305",,,,,38,4,5,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2010,34.0,3,,,,,411,428,,10.1007/s00355-009-0405-5,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,553SQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274387500005,0

The paper analyses the impact of the 1939 drought on the markets for rice and electricity in Japan. The authorities were ill-prepared for such a disaster but willing to use it for the purpose of covering for other problems. The drought thus accelerated the move of Japan's economic system towards a managed economy. A lower total rainfall in Japan in 1940 did not generate similar problems, suggesting that the broader political, economic, and social context is crucial to the identification of short-term climatic fluctuations as crises.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hunter, J (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0004-8992,,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

This rapid growth in cell phone use has led to concerns regarding their impact on driver performance and road safety. Numerous legislative efforts are under way to restrict hand-held cell phone use while driving. Since 1999, every state has considered such legislation, but few have passed primary enforcement laws. As of 2008, six states, the District of Columbia (DC), and the Virgin Islands have laws banning the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. A review of the literature suggests that in laboratory settings, hand-held cell phone use impairs driver performance by increasing tension, delaying reaction time, and decreasing awareness. However, there exists insufficient evidence to prove that hand-held cell phone use increases automobile-accident-risk. In contrast to other research in this area that uses questionnaires, tests, and simulators, this study analyzes the impact of hand-held cell phone use on driving safety based on historical automobile-accident-risk-related data and statistics, which would be of interest to transportation policy-makers. To this end, a pre-law and post-law comparison of automobile accident rate measures provides one way to assess the effect of hand-held cell phone bans on driving safety: this paper provides such an analysis using public domain data sources. A discussion of what additional data are required to build convincing arguments in support of or against legislation is also provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Under prospect theory, the new properties hold if the commonly used utility based measures of loss aversion are corrected by a probability based measure of loss aversion and their product exceeds 1. It is shown that prominent parametric families of weighting functions, while successful in accommodating empirical findings on probabilistic risk attitudes, may not fit well with the theoretical implications of the new loss averse behavior conditions.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Zank, H (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",horst.zank@manchester.ac.uk,,"Zank, Horst/0000-0002-7017-7122",,,,,92,13,15,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2010,68.0,3,,,,,243,261,,10.1007/s11238-008-9117-z,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,553ZH,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274404800001,0

The effect is reproducible across days and freeway sites: it was observed, without exception, in all cases tested. Predicted by an earlier theory, the effect arises because disruptive vehicle lane changing diminishes in the presence of a carpool lane. We therefore conjecture that smoothing can also be induced by other means that would reduce lane changing. The benefits can be large. Queueing analysis shows that the smoothing effect greatly reduces the times spent by people and vehicles in queues. For example, by ignoring the smoothing effect at one of the sites we analyzed one would predict that its carpool lane increased both the people-hours and the vehicle-hours traveled by well over 300%. In reality, the carpool lane reduced both measures due to smoothing. The effect is so significant that even a severely underused carpool lane can in some instances increase a freeway bottleneck's total discharge flow. This happens for the site we analyzed when carpool demand is as low as 1200 vph.

We recognise the specificity of the exports between the emerging East Asian and industrialised countries and employ a generalised gravity model. In the empirical analysis we use a panel comprising 25 years of quarterly data and perform unit-root and cointegration tests to verify the long-run relationship among the variables. The results provide strong evidence that exchange rate volatility has a negative impact on the exports of emerging East Asian countries. In addition, the results suggest that the pattern of bilateral exports is influenced by third-country variables. An increase in the price competitiveness of other emerging East Asian countries has a negative impact on a country's exports to a destination market, but the magnitude of the impact is relatively small. These results are robust across different estimation techniques and do not depend on the variable chosen to proxy exchange rate uncertainty. The results of the GMM-IV estimation also confirm the negative impact of exchange rate volatility on exports and suggest that this negative relationship is not driven by simultaneous causality bias.","[Chit, Myint Moe; Rizov, Marian] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London N17 8HR, England; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",Middlesex University; University of Sussex,"Chit, MM (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London N17 8HR, England.",,"Rizov, Marian/I-2597-2019; Chit, Myint/U-1501-2019; Willenbockel, Dirk/AAC-2191-2021","Rizov, Marian/0000-0002-8895-1980; Chit, Myint/0000-0002-0866-0340; Willenbockel, Dirk/0000-0002-6840-0954",,,,,68,72,85,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2010,33.0,2,,,,,239,263,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01230.x,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,551WG,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274242700004,0

Results from a series of fixed-effects regressions using a 1992-2002 panel of state-level data indicate that increased spending on higher education generally exhibits a relatively large negative effect on private sector employment or gross state product growth when the increase in education spending is financed through own-source revenue. Results do not identify a statistically significant relationship between K-12 education spending and economic growth. This finding is an important clarification in the literature because an analysis of combined higher and K-12 education spending yields an overall negative effect. Results do not provide consistent evidence of cross-state spillover effects associated with either form of education spending.,"[Deskins, John] Creighton Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Hill, Brian] Salisbury Univ, Salisbury, MD USA; [Ullrich, Laura] Winthrop Univ, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA",Creighton University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Deskins, J (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",johndeskins@creighton.edu,,"Hill, Brian/0000-0002-9671-0853",,,,,30,10,10,1,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Assuming exports prices are negotiated in the exporter's currency, menu costs give rise to two thresholds around (within) which incomplete ERPT is (not) observed. An error correcting process is triggered from a deviation in the ERPT cointegrating relation only when the deviation is large enough in absolute value to fall outside of a band defined by symmetric thresholds. Threshold autoregressive (TAR) cointegration techniques are used to investigate Quebec and Ontario pork meat export prices in the US and Japanese markets. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that our Equilibrium-TAR tests have greater power than a standard unit root test. Our empirical application suggests that Canadian pork exporters exercise market power in the US market. The evidence of incomplete ERPT in the Japanese market is weaker and differs across provinces. Evidence of thresholds is reported for both destinations, thus indicating the existence of significant menu costs for Canadian pork exporters in these markets.","[Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ, CREA, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Gervais, Jean-Philippe] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Rancourt, Yannick] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Laval University; North Carolina State University; Statistics Canada,"Larue, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ, CREA, 2425 Rue Agr,Room 4417, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Bruno.Larue@eac.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,44,9,9,1,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

One such example is his account of Frank Ramsey's contribution to optimal taxation in 1927. For him, and mainly for the public finance economists who rediscovered later Ramsey's contribution, Ramsey was a genius ahead of his time who used a mathematics too advanced for his contemporaries and was thus rediscovered only in the 1970S, when economists became more mathematically literate. In such rediscovery, a memorandum that Samuelsom wrote in 1951 for the us Treasury became central. I examine Samuelson's account and challenge it in some respects and explore the historical context of the emergence of the optimal taxation literature in the 1970S. Additional, I analyze the canonization of Ramsey in this field, stressing Samuelson's role in this process as a professor who liked telling stories about economists, especially about Ramsey, to his graduate students.","Univ Sao Paulo, FEA, Dept Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Duarte, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, FEA, Dept Econ, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",pgduarte@usp.br,,"Duarte, Pedro/0000-0003-3525-7036",,,,,126,11,11,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The ranking of the importance of individual technology options is robust across models. For the lowest stabilization target (400 ppm CO2 eq), the use of bio-energy in combination with CCS plays a crucial role, and biomass potential dominates the cost of reaching this target. Without CCS or the considerable extension of renewables the 400 ppm CO2 eq target is not achievable. Across the models, estimated aggregate costs up to 2100 are below 0.8% global GDP for 550 ppm CO2 eq stabilization and below 2.5% for the 400 ppm CO2 eq pathway.","[Edenhofer, Ottmar; Knopf, Brigitte; Baumstark, Lavinia; Leimbach, Marian; Lessmann, Kai] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Barker, Terry; Scrieciu, Serban] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Kypreos, Socrates] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Modeling & Syst Anal Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Criqui, Patrick] Univ Grenoble LEPII, Grenoble, France; [Turton, Hal] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Econ Grp, Zurich, Switzerland",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Cambridge; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; ETH Zurich,"Edenhofer, O (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de,"Scrieciu, S.

The analysis was based on an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) popularized by Pesaran et al. Empirical estimates reveal that military spending in India is indeed associated with income redistribution. The empirical approach indicates that there exists a long-run relationship between transfer payments as a percentage in GDP (TP), Defense expenditures as a percentage in GDP (ME) and budget deficits as a percentage in GDP (DEF) in India. Defense expenditures as a percentage in GDP, the budget deficits as a percentage in GDP have positive and significant impacts on transfer payments in the same fiscal year. But the budget deficit as a percentage in GDP has negative and significant impact on TP in the next fiscal year.","[Guo Zhonghou; Jiang Yiwen] Mil Econ Acad, Dept Def Econ, Wuhan 430035, Peoples R China",,,zhonghouguo@yahoo.cn,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-14-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,62,68,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BYE32,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298225400011,0

The regression results show a significantly negative relation between short-term debt and corporate performance. However, a negative but insignificant relationship between long-term debt and profitability was found. With regard to the relationship between total debt and profitability, the results exhibit a significantly negative association between leverage ratio and performance. This suggests that agency issues may lead to Chinese firms pursuing very high debt policy, thus resulting in lower performance.","[Li Xuefeng] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Sch Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University of Light Industry,,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,DONGHUA UNIV PRESS,SHANGHAI,"1882 YAN AN WEST RD, SHANGHAI, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-81111-752-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,107,111,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVE75,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291325600024,0

On the other hand, the Soviet system discouraged industrial managers from producing for export, and it often caused precious imports to be wasted. This struggle between industry and the Kremlin over foreign trade gave impetus to the treadmill of reforms launched by the Khrushchev leadership.","Univ Macau, Dept Hist, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Sanchez-Sibony, O (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Hist, Av Padre Tomas Pereira, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",osanchezes@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,10,10,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2010,62.0,9,,,,,1555,1578,PII 928814538,10.1080/09668136.2010.515798,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,673RX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283681800006,0

The results from a logit model of mortgage choice indicate that pricing variables and affordability are important considerations. We also find that factors, such as mobility expectations, income volatility and attitudes toward financial risk largely influence mortgage choice, with more risk-averse borrowers preferring fixed-rate mortgages. For households that are less risk averse, the mortgage type choice decision is less sensitive to pricing variables and income volatility, and affordability factors are not significant. These findings provide empirical support that underscores the importance of attitudes toward risks in mortgage choice.","[Coulibaly, Brahima; Li, Geng] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Coulibaly, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",brahima.coulibaly@frb.gov; Geng.Li@frb.gov,,,,,,,17,38,44,0,16,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1080-8620,,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2009,37.0,4,,,,,659,673,,10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00259.x,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,542UU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273524800004,0

Yet the great powers' social policy preferences remained relatively static from 1980 to 2000. This contradicts the conventional view that powerful states control IOs. We argue that highly institutionalized IOs like MDBs require a complete model of possible member-state coalitions encompassing the preferences of all member states-not just major powers. We develop multiple measures of state preferences and include all member states in our coalitional model. We evaluate our model and alternatives with an analysis of more than 10,000 MDB loans from 1980 to 2000. We find that when we include all member states weighted by their voting shares, principal preferences are significantly related to lending outcomes.","[Nielson, Daniel L.] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Lyne, Mona M.] Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tierney, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA USA",Brigham Young University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; William & Mary,"Nielson, DL (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",dan_nielson@byu.edu,"Lyne, Michael C/V-8732-2018","Lyne, Michael/0000-0002-4530-1195",,,,,54,43,49,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Our starting hypothesis is that the evolution of regional inequalities should follow a bell-shaped curve as national GDP per capita rises since growth by its very nature is unlikely to appear everywhere at the same time, as has been argued by a number of authors, from Kuznets [Kuznets, S., (1955), Economic growth and income inequality. American Economic Review 45(1), 1-28] to Lucas [Lucas, R.E., (2000), Some macroeconomics for the 21st century, journal of Economic Perspectives 14 (1), 159-168). We test this hypothesis econometrically using semi-parametric estimation techniques and regional data for a panel of European countries. Our results provide strong support for such a bell-shaped curve and are robust to changing the regional administrative units and the time period, as well as controlling for other possible determinants of regional inequalities. We also find support for this hypothesis when considering non-European countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The complexity introduced by the combinations of these factors affects the bidding strategies and auction outcomes in interesting ways-usually nonlinearly and sometimes non-monotonically. Of main concern to a seller is the effect of these factors on revenue. I find that revenue increases with the percent of common value in the two-dimensional value signal, decreases with uncertainty, and increases with the number of bidders. There is very little impact of information level on revenue when values are pure private and pure common.

Under the core solution concept, if a blocking coalition exists those agents abandon the current allocation without regard for the consequences to players outside the blocking coalition. Yet in certain circumstances, these players have an incentive to prevent formation of any blocking coalition; a game analyzed in Lagunoff (Games Econ Behav 7:54-61, 1994) is vulnerable to such circumstances. To obtain all core allocations and only core allocations, a mechanism must either restrict the actions of non-members of a proposed coalition, or ensure that non-members are unharmed by the departure of the coalition. These requirements illustrate the core's nonchalance toward agents not in blocking coalitions.","Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Platt, BC (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 149 Fac Off Bldg, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",brennan_platt@byu.edu,"Platt, Brennan/HJP-5741-2023","Platt, Brennan/0000-0002-5296-5205",,,,,31,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,SEP,2009,33.0,3,,,,,361,381,,10.1007/s00355-008-0363-3,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,480YR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268773700002,0

The procedure allows us to incorporate information from a vast number of time series, which are underutilized by historical national accounts. Therefore, our indicator provides an alternative measure for economic activity, based on a broader database. To investigate industrialization, we compare our aggregate measure of economic activity with sectoral activity indices. We find that the industrial transition was completed earlier than agricultural output and employment shares suggest, since the indicator for agriculture had already decoupled from the aggregate business cycle measure during the 1860s. Moreover, we find that stock prices are strongly correlated with our indicator, and lead it by 1-2 years. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this article we seek to cast new analytical light on what, in many respects, is an established narrative. To do this we draw on insights from the new institutional economics (NIE). Specifically, we draw on the complementary concepts of incomplete contracting and delegation. We demonstrate how the Commission utilized the discretion attendant to its delegated authority to interpret and apply the indeterminate language of treaty competition articles so as to alter the economic, political and legal environment as it pertained to merger activity. It did so to such an extent that Member States, long resistant to Commission proposals for a merger control regulation, came to regard legislative action as preferable to the uncertainty represented by the evolving status quo.","Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Doleys, T (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, MD 2205,1000 Chastain Rd, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",tdoleys@kennesaw.edu,,"Doleys, Thomas/0000-0003-3225-1069",,,,,63,4,4,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-9886,,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We show that depending on the level of the personal bias (weight on private preference), voting is either according to private preferences or according to signals. When voting takes place according to private preferences, there is an unique equilibrium with inefficiently high turnout. In contrast, when voting takes place according to signals, turnout is locally too low. Multiple Pareto-ranked voting equilibria may exist and in particular, compulsory voting may Pareto dominate voluntary voting. Moreover, an increase in personal bias can cause turnout to rise or fall, and an increase in the accuracy of information may cause a switch to voting on the basis of signals and thus lower turnout, even though it increases welfare.","[Ghosal, Sayantan; Lockwood, Ben] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Ghosal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Ghosal@warwick.ac.uk; B.Lockwood@warwick.ac.uk,"Ghosal, Sayantan/ABG-7926-2021",,,,,,14,27,30,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2009,33.0,1,,,,,25,50,,10.1007/s00355-008-0344-6,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,434XV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265308500002,0

An indirect control on these negative externalities associated with private transport may be pursued by means of policies aimed at improving quality and accessibility of public transit networks. To that end, one popular option is the design of an Integrated Tariff System (ITS): the crucial question remains whether such a policy can be effective in raising the number of public transport users. In this study, we use a twelve-year panel of 69 Italian public transit providers (with or without ITS) and estimate alternative specifications of the demand function. Results show that the impact due to ITS introduction is, on average, moderate. Results also highlight the importance of taking into account the specific features of ITS, such as its validity over an extended network, the availability of a single ticket option, and the application of zonal pricing schemes.

In the first systematic evaluation of World Bank post-conflict assistance, we estimate selection-corrected event history models of the effect of Bank programs on recovery and recurrence using an original dataset of all World Bank programs in post-conflict environments. Among key results, we find that the Bank tends to select aid recipients according to their pre-existing probability of conflict recurrence and that, once we control for this non-random selection, the Bank has no systematic effect on either conflict recurrence or economic recovery.","[Nooruddin, Irfan] Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Flores, Thomas Edward] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Nooruddin, I (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2140 Derby Hall,154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",teflores@umich.edu; nooruddin.3@osu.edu,"Nooruddin, Irfan/I-4618-2012","Nooruddin, Irfan/0000-0002-9128-2888; Flores, Thomas/0000-0002-9875-2344",,,,,73,23,28,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

These high sensitivities result from feedback: market participants optimally respond to shocks in a manner that amplifies a shock's initial impact, which in turn elicits further reinforcing responses. For example, a positive demand shock brings more buyers into a market. This improves the bargaining position of sellers, who then sell more quickly, decreasing the stock of sellers in the market.

These findings suggest that petroleum resources are likely to last far longer than many are now predicting and that depletion need not drive market prices above the relatively high levels prevailing over the past several Years.","[Aguilera, Roberto F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Mining Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Eggert, Roderick G.; Tilton, John E.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Colorado School of Mines,"Aguilera, RF (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Mining Ctr, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",raguilera@ing.puc.cl; reggert@mines.edu; glagos@ing.puc.cl; jtilton@ing.puc.cl,"Lagos, Gustavo/H-1548-2013","Aguilera, Roberto F./0000-0002-8182-628X",,,,,49,79,85,2,4,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2009,30.0,1,,,,,141,174,,,,,,34,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,390FK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262149500006,0

Two major factors are identified. Firstly, the focus of the SCO on tackling the so-called 'three evils' (terrorism, extremism, separatism) has won it favour with the prevailing leaderships of its member states. Secondly, the specific organisational framework adopted is appropriate for the region. The article concludes that the SCO is best characterised as a regional organisation concerned with non-traditional security and not as a hostile new 'Warsaw Pact' as suggested by some.","Univ Birmingham, Ctr Russian & E European Studies, European Res Inst, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Aris, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Ctr Russian & E European Studies, European Res Inst, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",stephen_aris@hotmail.com,,,,,,,53,67,76,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0966-8136,,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2009,61.0,3,,,,,457,482,PII 910352393,10.1080/09668130902753309,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,434SI,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265294000004,0

This research assembles a unique matched sample of household data from the Survey of Consumer Finance and the Consumer Expenditure Survey to estimate the consumption effects of financial and housing wealth. The micro-data permit numerous innovations in the assessment of wealth effects, including an analysis of the impact of wealth on both durable and non-durable consumption and a comparison of wealth effects as derive from gross versus after-debt measures of financial and housing wealth. Further, the research seeks to assess robustness of those estimates to deviations from trend and volatility in financial and housing wealth and among credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Overall, research findings indicate relatively large housing wealth effects. Among homeowners, the housing wealth elasticities are estimated in the range of .06 over the 1989-2001 period. In marked contrast, the estimated elasticities of consumption spending with respect to financial wealth are smaller in magnitude and are in the range of .02. Further, the estimated wealth elasticities appear robust to deviations from trend and volatility in the wealth measures. Research findings support the hypothesized behavioral distinction in household consumption spending across durable versus non-durable categories. Consumption propensities also diverge sharply across the credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Finally, there is little difference in wealth elasticities derived from measures of home equity versus house values. Research findings suggest the possibility of sizable reverse wealth effects. For example. a 10 percent decline in housing wealth from 2005 levels translates into a I percentage point decline in real GDP growth, a sizable reduction relative to the approximate 4 percent real GDP growth evidenced in prior years. Results of the analysis point to the sizable economy-wide risks associated with the recent retrenchment in house values. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

First, an entrant chooses his product, then the entrant negotiates the access price with two incumbents, and finally the firms compete on retail prices. Counter-intuitively, both the entrant and the access provider prefer that the entrant chooses a product that is a closer substitute of the product of the access provider than of the product of the other incumbent. This occurs because the access provider interacts with the entrant both in the retail market and the wholesale market. We also consider the cases where both parties make the access price offers and where the bargaining stage precedes the location stage. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This article provides insights into how the predominantly female (paid) workers' orientations to work, the desire to care and the intrinsic rewards from working in a non-profit context interact with the organization of work and managerially constructed workplace norms and cultures to offset the tensions in an environment characterized by scarce resources and poor working conditions. This article also outlines how the same environment of scarce resources causes strains in management's efforts to establish these cultures. Working with highly excluded service users, workers find themselves working at the edge of their endurance, beginning to participate in various forms of resistance, suggesting that even among the most highly committed, 'white knuckle care' may be unsustainable.","[Baines, Donna] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Cunningham, Ian] Univ Strathclyde, Dept HRM, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",McMaster University; University of Strathclyde,"Baines, D (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",bainesd@mcmaster.ca,,"Baines, Donna/0000-0003-3569-0083",,,,,48,47,53,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We focus on the four agencies that are known to have been operating at the time (Fitch, Moody's, Poor's and Standard Statistics). We provide a description of the rise of the market for grades and gather information on the products sold, price schedules, etc. We find that rating agencies did exhibit features similar to those that have attracted considerable interest recently: namely, they did not react until the crisis had already begun and then implemented massive downgrades. We conclude by suggesting that, given the less than stellar record of the agencies, their emergence in the 1930s as a regulatory tool will have to be explained in future research.","[Flandreau, Marc] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [Flandreau, Marc] CEPR, London, England; [Gaillard, Norbert] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Packer, Frank] Bank Int Settlements, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Flandreau, M (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",marc.flandreau@graduateinstitute.ch; gaillard@alumni.princeton.edu; Frank.Packer@bis.org,,,,,,,78,18,21,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels inland waterway vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of inland waterway transport compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of transport operations for inland waterway transport in North West Europe under several climate scenarios. It turns out, that the effect on the modal split is limited. Under the most extreme climate scenario, inland waterway transport would lose about 5.4% of the quantity that is currently being transported annually in the part of the European inland waterway transport market considered. The very dry year of 2003 can be seen as an analogue for this scenario. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

During the interwar period, women were often confined to routine back office positions, and could not advance past the level of clerk. Evidence from Williams Deacon's Bank shows that the salaries of younger women were very similar to their male counterparts; however, an ever-widening gender pay gap emerged after about 5 years seniority. The main reasons for this pay gap were higher exit rates for women, largely due to marriage bars, and lower returns to seniority. Promotion restrictions, though ubiquitous, account for a relatively small proportion of the gender pay gap. Despite the pay gap, the marriage bar, and the lack of promotion opportunities, a sizable proportion of female clerks were very loyal to the Bank and remained for 10 or more years. This was due to the absence of better opportunities elsewhere in the labour market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In three independent experimental surveys with Swiss and German university students as subjects (two web surveys and a survey using paper-and-pencil questionnaires in a classroom setting), each of the three techniques is compared to direct questioning and evaluated based on the more-is-better assumption. According to our results the RRT and the ICT failed to reduce social desirability bias in self-reports of plagiarism. In contrast, the CM was more successful in eliciting a significantly higher rate of reported sensitive behavior than direct questioning. One reason for the success of the CM, we believe, is that it overcomes the self-protective no bias known from the RRT (and which may also be a potential problem in the ICT). We find rates of up to 22 percent of students who declared that they ever intentionally adopted a passage from someone else's work without citing it. Severe plagiarism such as handing in someone else's paper as one's own, however, seems to be less frequent with rates of about 1 to 2 percent.","[Jann, Ben] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Krumpal, Ivar; Naeher, Anatol-Fiete] Univ Leipzig, Inst Sociol, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany",University of Bern; Leipzig University,,jann@soz.unibe.ch; krumpal@sozio.uni-leipzig.de; Fiete.Naeher@gmx.de,"Krumpal, Ivar/AAT-7735-2020; Jann, Ben/A-5655-2008; Jann, Ben/O-1237-2019","Krumpal, Ivar/0000-0003-2149-2203; Jann, Ben/0000-0001-9855-1967; Naher, Anatol-Fiete/0000-0002-7908-0175",,,,,31,29,29,0,26,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0021-4027,,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

According to this mechanism, virtuous service providers choosing to offer high quality services can obtain cost abatement. CU, reciprocally, have to pay for entering into the city, but can protect themselves against a city low quality of life by a self-insurance device. The interaction of these two categories of economic agents is modelled by a two-population evolutionary game, where the population of CU strategically interacts with that of service providers. From the analysis of the model it emerges that such a dynamics may lead to a welfare-improving attracting Nash equilibrium at which all CU choose to use environmental-friendly means of transportation and all service providers choose to offer high quality services. However, the basin of attraction of that equilibrium may have a rather complex morphology. In particular more attractors and/or limit cycles can be present. In such a context we indicate sufficient conditions making the virtuous equilibrium a global attractor for all trajectories starting at a mixed-strategy point.","[Radi, Davide] Univ Bergamo, Lorenzo Mascheroni Dept Math Stat Comp & Applicat, I-24127 Bergamo, BG, Italy; [Antoci, Angelo] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ Enterprise & Legislat, I-07100 Sassari, SS, Italy; [Galeotti, Marcello] Univ Florence, Dept Math Decis, I-50134 Florence, FI, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Sassari; University of Florence,"Radi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Lorenzo Mascheroni Dept Math Stat Comp & Applicat, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, BG, Italy.",davide.radi@unibg.it,"Radi, Davide/M-6403-2013; Dao, Rock/E-5736-2014; Antoci, Angelo/AAG-2800-2021; Radi, Davide/HHR-9023-2022","Radi, Davide/0000-0001-7809-1166; Antoci, Angelo/0000-0003-3719-0437; Radi, Davide/0000-0001-9752-4537",Fondazione Banco di Sardegna; Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi,Fondazione Banco di Sardegna(Fondazione Banco di Sardegna); Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi,"The authors wish to thank two referees of this journal, whose remarks and suggestions have allowed a substantial improvement of the work.

Countries play a two-stage game: in the first stage each country decides to join or not the coalition while, in the second stage, the quantity of pollution abatement is chosen. To analyze the stability of coalition structures in a multiple coalition game, we use the notion of the Largest Consistent Set (LCS) which allows players to be farsighted. Chwe (1994) developed the concept of farsighted stability: an outcome is stable and it is in the LCS if and only if deviations from it or potential further deviations are not unanimously preferred to the original outcome by the coalition considering the deviations. Applying this notion of stability in the IEA context we assume that, when a country or a sub-coalition contemplate exiting or joining an agreement, it takes into account the reactions of other countries ignited by its own actions. The goal of this paper is to identify the resulting stable structures and the LCS, examining the cooperation among countries with respect to an indicator of countries' environmental awareness. We show that large coalitions are possible outcomes of the game if the farsightedness is considered. In particular, we obtain general sufficient conditions that assure the farsighted stability of the Grand Coalition. In a computational way, we prove that if the environmental awareness is larger than a threshold value, the number of coalition structures belonging to LCS goes down with respect to the initial coalition structures and coalitions with singleton countries never exist. Moreover, we present a useful Maple algorithm to compare the cost functions and to determine direct dominance.","[Biancardi, Marta; Villani, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ Math & Stat, I-71100 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Villani, G (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Largo Papa Giovanni Paolo II 1, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",m.biancardi@unifg.it; g.villani@unifg.it,,"VILLANI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-3024-436X",,,,,23,3,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this regard, the goal of this paper is to examine the influence of the difference between reference price and observed price on the choice of tourism products with different degrees of awareness - well-known coastal destinations versus less well-known inland destinations. The author adopts the sticker shock formulation, in which tourists evaluate choice alternatives using differences between reference prices and actual prices; the article incorporates this formulation into the random parameter logit model, which allows the price response heterogeneity to be modelled explicitly. The results of the empirical application indicate distinct effects of the reference price observed price difference according to destination type: tourists take their expectations on prices into account more when making decisions for inland destinations than they do for coastal destinations. That is, for inland destinations they do not remain as indifferent as they do for coastal destinations when contemplating prices that are higher or lower than expected.","Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Nicolau, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ Accounting & Mkt, POB 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",JL.Nicolau@ua.es,"Nicolau, Juan Luis/AAZ-6589-2021; Nicolau, Juan Luis/I-4982-2016","Nicolau, Juan Luis/0000-0003-0048-2823",,,,,29,1,1,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

If voting to increase funds to the IMF is viewed as an observable signal of support for the IMF, these votes provide a historical record of legislative support for the IMF in the United States. I analyze roll-call voting on IMF financing from 1944 to 2009 at both the aggregate (congressional) and the micro (legislator) levels. At the aggregate level, I show that support for the IMF has fallen over time in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate. In the micro-analysis, I use a natural experiment to establish that this intercameral difference is the result of the Senate's larger and more heterogeneous constituencies, as opposed to other modeled and unmodeled factors. I also find that legislator support for the IMF is shaped strongly by ideology: regardless of chamber, left-wing legislators are as much as 31 percentage points more likely to support the IMF than right-wing legislators. Yet controlling for ideology, senators are more likely to support the IMF than representatives, and representatives are more sensitive to constituency pressures than senators. I attribute these differences to chamber-specific rules governing the size of constituencies.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Broz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jlbroz@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,51,23,26,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

By bringing sales work to centre stage, this study empirically examines the theoretical claim that legitimacy in advanced markets is constituted not only by macro-structures and institutions, but also in the course of sales encounters. Based on 50 interviews and on extensive observations of sales interactions in a computer store, this study presents empirical support to the theoretical claim that legitimate economic exchange is forged by an interactive dialogue between two distinct paradigms which co-exist on the sales floor: one based on market logic and the other on moral arguments. The article calls for an analytic framework for the study of economic action which transcends the rational-irrational dichotomy and which can account for the diverse interests and scripts of behaviour played out on the sales floor.","Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Darr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Room 7017,Rabin Complex, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",adarr@univ.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,40,11,12,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We capture asymmetries over the phases of economic and stock market trends and cycles using independent Markov-switching processes. We show that both output and stock prices contain significant transitory components, while consumption and dividends are useful to identify their respective permanent components. The extracted economic trend perfectly predicts all post-war recessions. Our results shed light on the nature of the bilateral predictability of the economy and the stock market. The transitory stock market component signals recessions with an average lead of one quarter, whereas the market trend is correlated with the economic trend with varying lead/lag times. Copyright.

First, politicians put relatively less weight on inflation (and more on output) in their preferred monetary policy reaction function. Second, their preferences are affected by political economy motives.

By using data for 88 regions in nine European countries, national policies and institutions are analysed in a fixed-effects panel-data model to detect their relative importance after controlling for unobservable regional factors. The main finding is that institutions only started to matter after the oil crisis. The strongest institutional effects on employment came from the net reservation wages and employment protection laws. The institutional effects on productivity were mainly channelled through the employment productivity trade-off. By restricting the supply of labour, these effects were positive on productivity in the short run. However, the article shows that the long-run effects were negative and that there may be institutional roots to the European productivity slow-down in the 1990s.","Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Enflo, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",kerstin.enflo@ekh.lu.se,,"Enflo, Kerstin/0000-0002-9904-8957",,,,,37,2,2,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

We consider 'one-shot' tests to evaluate the FL model under the rational expectations hypothesis and sequences of tests obtained under the adaptive learning hypothesis. The analysis is based on a comparison between the unrestricted and restricted VAR likelihoods, and the p-values associated with the LR test statistics are computed by Monte Carlo simulation. We also address the case where the variables of the FL model can be approximated as non-stationary cointegrated processes. Application to the 'hybrid' New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) in the euro area shows that (i) the forward-looking component of inflation dynamics is much larger than the backward-looking component and (ii) the sequence of restrictions implied by the cointegrated NKPC under learning dynamics is not rejected over the monitoring period 1984-2005.

While applied researchers are usually aware of this the detection of outliers and their appropriate treatment is often dealt with in a rather sloppy manner. One reason for this habit seems to be the lack of availability of appropriate canned programs for robust methods that can be used in the presence of outliers. Our paper intents to improve on this situation by presenting a highly robust method for estimation of the popular linear fixed effects panel data model and to supply Stata code for it.

We find that on the student population, there is essentially no correlation. A non-negligible fraction of the population behaves in an extremely cautious manner in the risk and ambiguity domain. When we drop this population from the sample, the correlation between our measures is also non-significant.

By eliminating the existing non-tariff barriers to the free circulation of goods, services, workers and capital by the end of 1992, the EU aimed to deliver substantial welfare gains in terms of higher productivity and lower costs, prices and mark-ups. While there exists some evidence that the measures undertaken have increased competition across the EU, the impact of such policies on productivity has received less attention and still remains an open issue. Using a difference-in-difference approach, this article shows that the completion of the internal market significantly increased the productivity of the EU sectors which were more likely to be affected by these policies, already during the implementation phase of the different measures (1992 and 1993). These results point to the fact that the firms that were mostly exposed to the reforms seem to have reacted promptly to the structural changes deriving from them. The estimated gains appear quantitatively important.","[Notaro, Giovanni] Autorita Garante Concorrenza Mercato, Rome, Italy",,"Notaro, G (通讯作者)，Pza Verdi 6-A, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.notaro@agcm.it,,,,,,,44,4,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The model incorporates strategic interaction between road operators in a cost-benefit framework and several competitive regimes are considered. It is then employed to establish the financial and socio-economic viability of a congestion pricing demonstration entering Madrid city centre, where road users have to choose between a free but highly congested road and a priced free-flowing road (semi-private regime). A logit estimation is undertaken with information from a questionnaire among road users in the Eastern Madrid area to obtain users' value of time and of congestion. The tolls obtained generate a traffic reallocation towards the new roadway such that revenues suffice to render the infrastructure socio-economically viable. The private and the low toll regimes generate similar welfare gains that are close to the first best. Yet the former supposes large losses to users. The low toll and the semi-private regimes do not raise such distributional concerns. However, the low toll regime requires a sufficiently high traffic growth rate to make it financially viable; this does not happen for the other competitive regimes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study applies the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology proposed by Banker et al (1984) to examine managerial efficiency in 2002 and 2006. The Malmquist productivity approach developed by Fare et al (1992) is employed to evaluate the change in managerial efficiency and management technology over the same period. The results show that medium-sized and small hotels tend to be more managerially efficient than large hotels. The total factor productivity declined slightly owing to a lack of investment in management technology. Instead, the hotels in the sample concentrated on improving managerial effort. This shortfall in technology investment could hamper productivity in the longer term.","[Untong, Akarapong; Kaosa-Ard, Mingsarn] Chiang Mai Univ, Inst Publ Policy Studies, 239 Huay Kaew Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Ramos, Vicente; Rey-Maquieira, Javier] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Edifici GM de Javellanos,Cra Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Chiang Mai University; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Untong, A (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Inst Publ Policy Studies, 239 Huay Kaew Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",akarapong_un@hotmail.com; mingsarn@chiangmai.ac.th; vicente.ramos@uib.es; javier.rey@uib.es,", Akarapong/AAE-3333-2021; Rey-Maquieira, Javier/G-1167-2016; Ramos, Vicente/P-5941-2015","Ramos, Vicente/0000-0003-1486-6537; Untong, Akarapong/0000-0001-7450-1420",,,,,46,14,14,0,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Our empirical approach tests whether the benefits of decentralizing local public good providers increases, decreases or leaves residential property appreciation rates unchanged. Past research in this area has been limited by the lack of variation in government structure within a region and by the self-selection of areas that decentralize governments. This research overcomes these limitations by 1) comparing appreciation rates for single-family homes that were located in areas that added local governments to appreciation rates for properties that were not; and 2) employing an estimation technique that border matches repeat sales to control for the self-selection of government structure. Overall, empirical results indicate that institutional decentralization has no influence on single-family property appreciation rates. It makes no difference whether the new government is the 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th new jurisdiction-the new government does not influence appreciation rates. Residential property values for homes located in jurisdictions that added security special districts experienced rates of appreciation that were lower than otherwise comparable properties. Recreation, fire, water, sewer and other special districts had no measurable influence on appreciation rates. Empirical results also indicate that more overlap among local governments reduces appreciation rates. New governments created in areas whose residents have greater income heterogeneity increase appreciation rates. The distance separating the new government from existing governments, the land area of the new government and the creation of multiple new governments have no influence on appreciation rates. Finally, these results depend on the border matching repeat sales estimation technique employed here.","[Thibodeau, Thomas G.] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Billings, Stephen] Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Billings, Stephen] Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll, Business Real Estate Fac, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Thibodeau, TG (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, 419 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",stephen.billings@uncc.edu; tom.thibodeau@colorado.edu,"Thibodeau, Thomas G/B-2507-2008",,,,,,41,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In that paper he considered a null model which could, but need not, contain spatial lags in both the dependent variable and disturbance term. Under the alternative, he considered one or more non-nested spatial models which could, but need not, also contain spatial lags. Although his suggested test was computationally simple and intuitive, it did not use the available information in an efficient manner. In this paper we suggest a modification of Kelejian's J-test which uses the available information in a more efficient way. We give large sample, as well as small sample Monte Carlo results. Perhaps counter to intuition, we also demonstrate that the J-test procedure cannot be used to establish a test for the structure of the error term. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using either a large sample or some statistically justified small subsamples, we find that long memory models consistently outperform their short-memory counterparts (GARCH & Stochastic Volatility models) over a variety of forecast horizons. We also find that asymmetric models (EGARCH & FIEGARCH) are the worst performers among all models. Our study complements and extends a recent study of Cotter and Stevenson (2008) which demonstrates the usefulness of long-memory models in modeling REIT volatility. We conclude that in addition to modeling REIT volatility, long-memory models should also be adopted to forecast REIT volatility.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Kang, Zhixin] Univ N Carolina Pembroke, Dept Econ Finance & Decis Sci, Sch Business Adm, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA",University of Guelph; University of North Carolina,"Zhou, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Mkt & Consumer Studies, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca; zhixin.kang@uncp.edu,,,,,,,55,22,22,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Rooting was initiated on MS medium without growth regulators. The rooted plantlets were acclimatised by transplanting them into organic soil:top-soil:sand mixture (1:1:1) for 2 weeks. This technology was transferred to village communities, involving the setting up of a tissue-culture laboratory together with flour- and paper-producing facilities. As such, the farmers have access to tissue-cultured plantlets for large-scale planting of 'Pisang Awak'.

The lower incidence of Fusarium wilt in the organic system was considered to be associated with a positive change in the properties of the soil. Horticultural parameters at shooting did not show significant differences between organic and conventional banana, except for a lower number of healthy leaves in the organic banana. No differences in the post-harvest quality could be found between organic and conventional banana. A smaller bunch weight was recorded for the organic banana; however, more harvested bunches resulted in a higher overall yield in the organic farming system. Promotion of the organic farming system for adoption by more banana growers could enhance the sustainability of the Chinese Taipei banana industry.","[Chang, C. M.; Chao, C. P.; Huang, S.

Eventually pressured to withdraw its application for unconfined release of RR wheat in 2004, I argue that Monsanto's proposed RR wheat economy crossed moral boundaries for the groups involved in the coalition against RR wheat. Specifically, Monsanto's anticipated RR wheat economy violated producers' expectations about their cultural-economic livelihoods: it proposed uncertainty in the realms of exchange and use value, moved public surplus into private hands and infringed on cultural attachments to wheat. My theoretical contribution hinges on the concept of moral economy, which is conventionally understood as promoting a 'cultural turn' in economic explanations. Instead, I show how Marx's labour theory of value similarly pointed to the inextricability of economic values and cultural processes and their attachment to all commodities including labour.","Univ Regina, Dept Geog, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada",University of Regina,"Eaton, E (通讯作者)，Univ Regina, Dept Geog, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",emily.eaton@uregina.ca,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In the early twenty-first century, both the US and the EU tightened the regulation of auditors. Due to its extraterritorial effects, the US reform legislation sparked a transatlantic conflict. Seeking mutual recognition of the respective auditor oversight systems, the European Commission endeavored to bring the European regulatory regime closer to the new US model. During the reforms of EU audit regulation, the profession, together with member states, successfully resisted a far-reaching convergence of European regulation to the US model of independent oversight, thus impeding the resolution of the transatlantic conflict. We argue that the profession's defense of the traditional model of European audit regulation results from two intertwined aspects: the profession's interest in keeping a share of power in the regulatory regime and its institutional embeddedness in distinct national and regional regulatory and market structures. In concluding, we discuss the implications of our findings for the relevant international and comparative political economy literature.","[Eberle, Dagmar] Mercator Res Ctr Ruhr, Essen, Germany; [Lauter, Dorothee] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Eberle, D (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Ctr Ruhr, Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,,54,6,6,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

When trade costs are high countries impose a uniform tax on all firms while nations will discriminate between mobile and immobile firms when costs are low.

It focuses on the link between the financialization - defined here as the ability to trade risk - and borrowing capacity, analyzing three case study countries: Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey. Both domestic and international bond markets are considered and differences in the ownership of government bonds in the three countries are highlighted. The financialization of different financial market actors is analyzed, concentrating on two of the most important, domestic commercial banks and individual investors, and the financialization of the structure of each market. It is argued that the greater the financialization, the greater the ability to exit or short. This increases the cost of borrowing and increases the likelihood, and severity, of crisis, thereby reducing government borrowing capacity.

In addition, this paper takes Haier as example to analyze the successful application of those traditional ethics thoughts in the process of the construction of enterprise ethics culture.

Finite sample performance is investigated via a Monte Carlo experiment. We show that in some cases not accounting for common factors when they are present can lead to overestimating the cointegrating rank.

S. American economies are closely interlinked. The growing intensity of economic interdependence has spurred the transatlantic coordination of rules and standards that could form non-tariff barriers to transatlantic commerce. But despite impressive government-to-government efforts to eliminate market barriers, the EU and the U. S. have frequently clashed over each other's regulatory policies. The aim of this special issue is to explore the domestic sources of cooperation or conflict in transatlantic regulation. The papers analyze the role of domestic factors through three theoretical lenses that are well-established in the study of multilevel systems: the principal-agent approach, the two-level game metaphor, and through a wider concept of institutionalism which emphasizes the interlinkages of societal interests and regulatory ideas with institutional frameworks. The papers reveal that domestic factors embody more obstacles to than opportunities for horizontal coordination. It is argued that transatlantic relations will likely undergo a 'double movement' of being simultaneously shifted upwards to become part of the global governance architecture, and downwards towards broader involvement of legislators in regulatory matters. Hence, transatlantic regulation might in the near future be more shaped by political leaders, rent-seeking interest groups and legislators than by networks of technocrats.","Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Wissensch, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Lütz, S (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Wissensch, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,60,7,7,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In this paper, a novel molecular marker technique known as sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) was studied to determine diversity and relationships among 29 banana genotypes. The results showed that 25 out of 64 primer combinations were polymorphic and 324 polymorphic bands were obtained. Based on the appearance of the markers, the genetic relationships were analysed by the unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis. The results showed that most genetic relationships among cultivars were correlated to their region of origin. All 29 cultivars could be clustered into two major clusters closely corresponding with the genome composition of the genotypes (AA genome and hybrids between AA and BB genome). Some cultivars examined in this study did not cluster according to their hypothetical genetic homologies, which would suggest missampling or misidentification. All results indicated that the amplification of SRAP markers is useful for estimating genetic similarity among banana genotypes.","[Wei, J. Y.; Wei, S. X.; Xie, Z. S.; Xu, G. Y.; Chen, Y.

Prior studies have found that a key component of the well-documented home court advantage is rest. We find that, over a 19-year period, the home team performed poorly against the spread when playing the second of back-to-back games, while the visiting team had 1 or 2 days rest.

Our Bayesian framework allows the number and pattern of structural changes in trend and variance to be endogenously determined. We find little evidence of postwar growth slowdowns across countries, and smaller output volatility for most of the developed countries after the end of World War II.

This approach generally relies on visitor surveys to estimate two parameters, average spending per segment and segment share, so that total visitation can be apportioned to each subgroup. Equivalently, this approach is to estimate the weighted average spending by taking into consideration the relative shares of each user segment. This paper first provides a statistical formula to compute the variance of weighted average spending by taking into account the stochastic nature of spending and segment shares. Second, simulation analysis is adopted to compare the accuracy and precision of the spending estimator based on different study designs. The results show that conducting additional short surveys to obtain information on user segments provides two advantages. First, it helps to reduce non-response bias since certain visitor groups have higher ratios of unreturned questionnaires, incomplete data or non-participation. Second, it helps to decrease the variance of the estimator so that the upper and lower bound of the confidence interval can be narrowed. The level of variance reduction will depend on the relative segment shares, the average spending, cases that are obtained, spending variation and the probability of giving full spending information across segments. The implications for survey design are offered in light of the results.","[Sun, Ya-Yen] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Kinesiol Hlth & Leisure Studies, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Wong, Kam-Fai; Lai, Hsien-Chung] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Inst Stat, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; National University Kaohsiung,"Sun, YY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Kinesiol Hlth & Leisure Studies, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",wongkf@nuk.edu.tw,"Sun, Ya-Yen/N-2051-2018","Sun, Ya-Yen/0000-0001-6788-7644",,,,,40,1,1,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Yet technological standards are common in international environmental agreements and now figure prominently among proposals to mitigate global warming. I show that technological standards can be combined with market instruments to create collective enforcement power. They allow states to internationally enforce technology installation, so the payoff to free riding decreases. A notable feature of the argument is that technological standards and market instruments are complements, while previous research has treated them as substitutes. Empirically, technological standards are most valuable if international cooperation is difficult to enforce and the rate of technological change in concerned industries is slow.","Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,48,16,17,2,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

A series of constraining measures taken previously have been loosened eventually. We investigate this situation using a political economy approach. Unlike in democratic countries, where interest groups play a crucial role in trade policy change, in China, given the political reality, leaders' will and trade partners' pressure are the determinant factors. We call this top-down and outside-in trade policy. Actually the idea of 'harmonious society' and 'scientific development' emphasised by top leaders in October 2006 paved the road for the following trade policy adjustment: i.e. reducing tax rebate, limiting processing trade, compressing the catalogue for foreign investment, etc. However, with the shock of a global financial tsunami, these measures get coastal areas relying on foreign trade heavily into trouble. The economic downturn in Pearl River Delta even astonished the decision-making body, calling on a quick reversal in foreign trade policy. If interest groups had been allowed to express their demand formally and adequately from the very start, the cycle of 'taking up first but giving up last' in policy design would have not taken place. In other words, the bottom-up and inside-out trade policy should be more stable. Although flexibility is necessary in the face of uncertainty, frequent and discretionary trade policy change usually produces effects of 'pro-government' not 'pro-market'. This is unfavourable for the transformation in China. The constraining trade policy in mid-2007 to mid-2008 has been a part of the government's desire to seek healthier development. However, with the inside and outside surroundings getting worse, the structural adjustment (long-run objective) has had to concede to the economic growth (short-run objective).","[Luo, Changyuan] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Luo, CY (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,21,10,12,1,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0378-5920,,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2010,33.0,11,,,,,1390,1413,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01322.x,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,685GB,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284616100002,0

The main findings of this paper are that there is a significant impact from prime working-age consumers on the stock price, and that this impact is robust for all G5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA). These findings survive many robust tests, and are consistent with the predictions from the life-cycle models.

This paper takes a long-run perspective and reviews the main determinants of widening global imbalances. To this aim, we first provide a set of newly derived statistical measures: while large external imbalances are not new in economic history, their persistence, their concentration on one economy (the United States) and the specific role of emerging market economies make the present episode rather unique. Second, we argue that the observed pattern of imbalances can be mostly understood as a result of various structural changes in the global economy, which have allowed a widening trend of external positions. Three main features set the most recent period apart from past episodes of growing external imbalances: (i) the emergence of new players, in particular emerging market economies such as China and India, which are quickly catching up with the advanced economies; (ii) an unprecedented wave of financial globalisation, with more integrated global financial markets and increasing opportunities for international portfolio diversification, also characterised by considerable asymmetries in the level of market completeness across countries; and (iii) the favourable global macroeconomic and financial environment, with record high global growth rates in recent years, low financial market volatility and easy global financing conditions over a long period of time, running until the outburst of the financial crisis during the summer of 2007. These structural changes that have been supplemented by cyclical or policy-induced factors ultimately facilitated the sudden, disorderly unwinding of global imbalances that is reflected in the current financial crisis.","[Bracke, Thierry; Bussiere, Matthieu; Fidora, Michael; Straub, Roland] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Bracke, T (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,54,12,12,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2010,33.0,9,,,,,1140,1174,,10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01266.x,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,648BR,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281665900005,0

In Guatemala, 2000, with nationally representative data, we selected 2261 households with at least one child aged 12-60 months and his/her mother. Nutritional status was assessed in children (e.g., stunting as height-for-age Z-score < -2) and mothers (e.g., overweight as body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2)) and identified the presence of both, child stunting and maternal overweight in the same household (SCOM). With logistic regression models we assessed the association of the malnutrition indicators with individual and household socio-economic and health characteristics. SCOM was identified in 18% of households. Socio-economic status (SES) of SCOM households was significantly lower than SES of households with non-stunted children. SCOM households, compared to those with normal-stature children and normal weight mothers, were more likely to have mothers of short stature (adjusted odds ratio-OR +/- 95% CI = 3.1 (2.1-4.7)), higher parity (1.2 (1.1-1.3)), currently working (1.7 (1.1-2.6), and self-identified as indigenous (2.0 (1.3-3.1)). Factors associated with stunting in children such as poverty, maternal short stature and indigenousness, were predictors of SCOM. These findings support the notion that SCOM is an extension of the malnutrition spectrum in the most disadvantaged population groups in countries that are in the middle of their nutrition transitions such as Guatemala. At the same time it revealed that these populations are already in the stage of chronic, nutrition related diseases associated with less physical activity and more access to highly processed foods of low cost, high dietary energy and low nutrient density in important population groups. The challenge for the decision makers and service deliverers is to guide SCOM households to deal equally with both extremes of the malnutrition continuum. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We test our hypotheses with a Tobit model that accounts for the two-stage allocation process and our limited dependent variables. Our results indicate that economic criteria are not the only determinants of funds allocation. Indeed, we find that the political situation within a country and a region and the relations between various layers of governance influence the allocation process.

Our procedures compare the benchmark to all the alternative models simultaneously rather than sequentially, and do not require re-estimation of models as part of a bootstrap procedure. Both procedures adjust MSPE differences in accordance with Clark and West (2007); one procedure then examines the maximum t-statistic, while the other computes a chi-squared statistic. Our simulations examine the proposed procedures and two existing procedures that do not adjust the MSPE differences: a chi-squared statistic and White's (2000) reality check. In these simulations, the two statistics that adjust MSPE differences have the most accurate size, and the procedure that looks at the maximum t-statistic has the best power.

Small farmers in particular specialized in animal produce. Agricultural protectionism, which was installed in response to increasing imports of overseas grain in the 1880s, primarily served the interest of large landowners specializing in bread-grain production. The impact of agrarian tariffs on the factor rewards of landowners, capitalists and workers is explored by means of a Computable General Equilibrium model of the Swedish economy in 1913. Landowners predictably benefited from agrarian tariffs, the more so if they specialized in bread-grain, as did rural workers. Urban capitalists would generally gain if agrarian tariffs had been dismantled. Real wages of workers in urban industries would most likely also improve, but the gain of urban workers was less clear-cut than for urban capitalists, being dependent on the degree of rural urban labour mobility in response to wage changes.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ Hist, Sch Business Econ & Law, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Bohlin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ Hist, Sch Business Econ & Law, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Jan.Bohlin@econhist.gu.se,,,,,,,45,4,4,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1361-4916,,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

A doctrinal paradox occurs when majority voting on a compound proposition (such as a conjunction or disjunction) yields a different result than majority voting on each of the elements of the proposition. For example, when most individuals accept proposition X; most individuals accept proposition Y ; but only a minority of individuals accept the compound proposition 'X and Y'. Conducting two elemental votes would lead to accept X and Y , but conducting one compound vote would lead to reject X and Y . In such a situation, do people manifest a stable preference as to which voting procedure should be applied? This research reports the results of two behavioral experiments using a within-participant design, which show that procedural preferences can be upturned by framing either positively or negatively the set of judgments to be aggregated. This shift in procedural preference leads to large swings in the final collective judgment endorsed by participants.","[Bonnefon, Jean-Francois] CNRS, CLLE LTC, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France; [Bonnefon, Jean-Francois] Univ Toulouse, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse,"Bonnefon, JF (通讯作者)，CNRS, CLLE LTC, 5 Allee Antonio Machado, F-31058 Toulouse 9, France.",bonnefon@univ-tlse2.fr,,"Bonnefon, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4959-188X",,,,,23,11,12,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2010,34.0,4,,,,,631,641,,10.1007/s00355-009-0421-5,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,571KK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275750500006,0

Research activity is higher at flagship institutions after the adoption of performance measures. Most of this increase in activity is with respect to the level of research funding and the number of articles produced. In contrast, research funding and the number of publications is dramatically lower at nonflagship institutions. There is some evidence that citations per publication at nonflagship institutions are higher after the adoption of performance standards.

It is argued that the content, form, and scope of competition regulation has undergone a major transformation over the past fifty years, which is related to broader socio-economic developments. Until the mid-1980s, competition policy formed part of the institutional nexus of the postwar order of 'embedded liberalism', underpinned by a Fordist accumulation regime and Keynesian welfare institutions. It exemplified strong neo-mercantilist and protectionist traits, allowing for significant distortions of competition, whenever justified for general reasons of industrial and social policy. Since the mid-1980s, gradually, a neoliberal 'competition only' vision came to dominate, giving rise to a more market-based competition regime, in which private rather than public actors prevail, and which seeks to create an ever-bigger 'level playing field' of free markets. This transformation is linked to the broader context of the disruption of the postwar social order and the rise of neoliberalism. A public-private alliance of transnational actors, consisting of the European Commission's DG Competition and transnational business elite networks, were the driving forces behind the 'neoliberalisation' of competition policy.","[Buch-Hansen, Hubert] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Wigger, Angela] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Polit Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Copenhagen Business School; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Buch-Hansen, H (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,"Wigger, Angela/GZB-9371-2022","Buch-Hansen, Hubert/0000-0002-8279-4179",,,,,72,56,59,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The effects of these flexibilities on market access opportunities are difficult to predict, creating particular problems for developing countries in assessing whether to support a proposed trade agreement. Some widely used ad hoc approaches for identifying likely sensitive products-such as the highest-bound-tariff rule-suggest that the impact of a limited number of such exceptions on average tariffs and market access is likely to be minor. Applying a rigorous specification based on the apparent objectives of policymakers in setting the prenegotiation tariff enables more accurate assessment of the implications of sensitive-product provisions for average agricultural tariffs, economic welfare, and market access under the Doha negotiations. The analysis concludes that highest-tariff rules are likely to seriously underestimate the impacts on average tariffs and that treating even 2 percent of tariff lines as sensitive is likely to have a sharply adverse impact on economic welfare. The impacts on market access are also adverse, but much smaller, perhaps reflecting the mercantilist focus of the negotiating process.

This article sheds light on this issue by examining the role of trust in the corruption-efficiency relationship. It argues that in countries with a relatively low level of trust, corruption tends to be more predatory and inefficient than corruption in countries with a relatively high level of trust, which tends to be less predatory (or relatively more 'efficiency-enhancing'). To illustrate their arguments, the authors first conduct a qualitative comparative case study of China and the Philippines. They then further subject their ideas to a quantitative test using a pooled data set of 65 countries in two time periods. Both their case study and statistical test support their general hypothesis that trust mitigates the negative effect of corruption on economic growth.","[Li, Shaomin; Wu, Jun (Judy)] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Business Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Li, SM (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Business Adm, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",,,,,,,,59,57,70,0,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, agricultural insurance does not function efficiently enough to accord effective protection to farmers in land contract rights transfer, and agricultural insurance and transfer of land contract rights become a dual dilemma. To address this difficulty, agricultural insurance is premised to improve the implementation of land contract rights transfer, in which appropriate safeguards are acquired. Thus, the introduction of game theory is necessary and feasible for analyzing the strategy by which farmers select agricultural insurance and land contracts. Based on game analysis, the players are the agricultural insurance and land contracts encountered by farmers; strategy is composed of agricultural insurance and land contract selection behaviors. Farmer behavior can achieve equilibrium of anticipated profits. Equilibrium then yields the outcome, which is the cooperation and win-win solutions that may be achieved between agricultural insurance and transfer of land contract rights. Thus, in the rational selection process of farmers, agricultural insurance and transfer of land contract rights can facilitate positive support, interaction, and development. These will help realize overall progress in system innovation with respect to agricultural insurance.

How does this system of private voluntary regulation relate to other strategies and regulatory approaches aimed at promoting just working conditions in global supply chains? This paper explores the potential and limitations of private voluntary regulation through a detailed matched pair case study of two factories supplying Nike, the world's largest athletic footwear and apparel company. These two factories have many similarities - both are in Mexico, both are in the apparel industry, both produce more or less the same products for Nike (and other brands) and both are subject to the same code of conduct. On the surface, both factories appear to have similar employment (i.e. recruitment, training, remuneration) practices and they receive comparable scores when audited by Nike's compliance staff. However, underlying (and somewhat obscured by) these apparent similarities, significant differences in actual labor conditions exist between these two factories. What drives these differences in working conditions? What does this imply for traditional systems of monitoring and codes of conduct? Field research conducted at these two factories reveals that beyond the code of conduct and various monitoring efforts aimed at enforcing it, workplace conditions and labor standards are shaped by very different patterns of work organization and human resource management policies. The promotion of these alternative work/human resources management practices can complement traditional monitoring efforts in ways that promoted improved labor standards.","[Locke, Richard M.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Romis, Monica] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Inter-American Development Bank,"Locke, RM (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,45,54,60,1,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

J,"Rethel, L",,,,"Rethel, Lena",,,The New Financial Development Paradigm and Asian Bond Markets,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,financial system development; financial crisis; bond markets; East Asia; economic constructivism,SYSTEM; POLICY; ARCHITECTURE; IMF,"For the better part of the last century, the debate between 'liberalisers' and 'interventionists' marked thinking about the relationship between finance and development. It has by now been superseded by the emergence of the discourse of financial system development, which links economic growth to the development of the financial sector. As the risks entailed by wholesale financial reform came to the fore in the financial crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, emphasis shifted from liberalising financial markets to building institutional frameworks to accommodate investment. Arguably, the emergence of the financial-system-development discourse occurred within a wider shift in the neoliberal paradigm towards institution building. These changes are particularly pronounced in East and Southeast Asia. This paper argues that a convergence of opinions has occurred between Asian financial policy elites, previously strong supporters of the bank-based developmental state model, and the liberalisers, represented through international financial institutions such as the IMF. This consensus is geared towards the expansion of capital markets and a generally more neoliberal, market-oriented mode of economic governance. To illustrate this claim, this paper traces institutional changes in Asian financial systems since the 1997-98 financial crisis. Although local characteristics remain, a common feature is the more salient role of bond markets in the financial system. This is the result of the conscious and deliberate development of local currency debt markets by policymakers. However, the new consensus narrows down the space in which economic policymaking takes place. Yet, by re-politicising financial system development, this space could be broadened again.","Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Rethel, L (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",L.Rethel@sotan.ac.uk,"Rethel, Lena/G-9574-2011","Rethel, Lena/0000-0002-7396-2054",,,,,96,24,26,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.
