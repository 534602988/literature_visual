Using a new dataset, this paper tests whether gold-standard adherence was negatively correlated with the cost of capital. Conditional on UK risk factors, there is no evidence that the bonds issued by countries off gold earned systematically higher excess returns than the bonds issued by countries on gold. This conclusion is robust to allowing betas to differ across exchange-rate regimes; to including other determinants of the country risk premium; and to controlling for the British Empire effect.

The forward-looking model allows us to explore issues for which it is uniquely well suited, including revenue-recycling and early action crediting. We find capital tax recycling to be more welfare-cost reducing than labor tax recycling because of its long-term effect on economic growth. Also, there are substantial incentives for early action credits; however, when spread over the full horizon of the policy they do not have a substantial effect on lifetime welfare costs.","[Gurgel, Angelo Costa] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP USP, Coll Econ Business & Accounting Ribeirao Preto, BR-14040900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Metcalf, Gilbert] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Tufts University,"Gurgel, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, FEA RP USP, Coll Econ Business & Accounting Ribeirao Preto, Av Bandeirnntes 3900, BR-14040900 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",angelocg@usp.br; paltsev@mit.edu; jreilly@mit.edu; gilbert.metcalf@tufts.edu,"Gurgel, Angelo C/D-9446-2013","Gurgel, Angelo/0000-0001-8331-9508; Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732",,,,,22,7,11,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This paper examines this hypothesis for reindeer herders in Norway where the herders, in contrast to pastoralists in, say, sub-Saharan Africa, face well-functioning credit markets. Using survey data including slaughter responses to a hypothetical meat price increase, we test whether keeping reindeer as insurance against risks affects the slaughter response. Furthermore, we examine whether status motives for keeping large herds affect the harvest response to a changing slaughter price.

Further, PPP tends to be supported for countries with high or moderate openness, low growth rates, high inflation rates and high nominal exchange rate volatility, respectively. Second, a single country characteristic seems inadequate to account for the validity of PPP. Third, PPP is supported if countries satisfy at least two characteristics of supporting PPP simultaneously.

Standard environmental economics has tended mostly to focus on the material incentives and regulations that transform the relative material costs and benefits of various/specific/certain actions. However, there exist behavioral aspects and social norms that affect how individuals value material and non-material incentives, and thus determine their decision to either cooperate or over-extract resources from a common-pool. This paper discusses the importance of social norms in shaping behavior in the commons through the lens of experiments-in particular, experiments conducted in the field with exactly those people who usually face these social dilemmas in their daily lives. Using a large sample of experimental sessions inclusive of around one thousand people, both villagers and students, I test some hypotheses about behavior in the commons, wherein regulations and social norms constrain people's choices. The results suggest that people evaluate several components of intrinsic and material motivations in deciding whether or not to cooperate. While responding in the expected direction to an imperfectly monitored fine for over extraction, the valuation of the private net cost of violating the regulation is not a sufficient explanation for participants' changes in behavior in the experiments. Even when violations have zero cost, people may react positively to an external regulator who issues a normative statement about a rule aimed at solving a particular social dilemma.","Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Cardenas, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.",jccarden@uniandes.edu.co,"cardenas, juan-camilo/B-4658-2009","cardenas, juan-camilo/0000-0003-0005-7595",,,,,72,56,62,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Evidence from syndicated lending and short-selling,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hedge funds; Short-selling; Private information; Conflict of interest; Syndicated loans,DEBT; RENEGOTIATION; RESTRUCTURINGS; INVESTMENT,"This paper investigates an important contemporary issue relating to the involvement of hedge funds in the syndicated loan market. In particular, we investigate the potential conflicts of interest that arise when hedge funds make syndicated loans and take short positions in the equity of borrowing firms. We find evidence consistent with the short-selling of the equity of the hedge fund borrowers prior to public announcements of both loan originations and loan amendments. We also find that hedge funds are more likely to lend to highly leveraged, lower credit quality firms, where access to private information is potentially the most valuable and where trading on such information could lead to enhanced profits. Overall, our results have important implications for the current debate regarding regulating the hedge fund industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Referring to ancient and modern sources we first conclude that institutions of majority rule entered Greek collective decision-making in the seventh century BC. We argue that this development must be seen in connection with the local economic growth pattern and the adoption of a highly idiosyncratic form of warfare, which enabled Greek city-states to mobilize a greater number of citizens for war. Military participation of citizens depends on parameters of warfare and economic parameters. We show that the reduction of the average costs of fighting, coupled with an increased decisiveness of conflict, may result in an increased military participation rate. The integration of elements of majority rule in the constitution of the city-states was the political consequence of this development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, the major part of the work has focused on the evaluation of yearly benefits and their components. Most guidelines list some indicators, such as the internal rate of return, the net present value per euro spent or the first-year benefit-cost ratio, but with no clear indication of how and in which cases they should be used. Building on the transport case, this paper aims to fill this gap. It recalls the teachings of economic analysis for project prioritisation, based on the principle of maximising the net present value. Through simulations, it examines how the various indicators perform, considering two situations, with and without budget constraints. It turns out that the various indicators perform roughly the same as long as the projects under comparison have similar benefit patterns over time, and using them does not induce losses that are too large, though the order of implementation is rather different from the optimal one. However, the indicators lead to huge under-optimisations when the projects have different patterns. The conclusion is that rigorous programme optimisation should be preferred to the use of indicators, and would encourage a wider use of cost-benefit analysis, which is presently too often limited to checking projects one by one.","[Quinet, Emile] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Quinet, Emile] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Quinet, E (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",quinet@enpc.fr,,,,,,,17,2,3,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Many location choice (e.g., residential location, workplace location, destination location) modeling contexts involve choice sets where alternatives are spatially correlated with one another due to unobserved factors. In the presence of such spatial correlation. traditional discrete choice modeling methods that are often based on the assumption of independence among choice alternatives are not appropriate. In this paper, a Generalized Spatially Correlated Logit (GSCL) model that allows one to represent the degree of spatial correlation as a function of a multi-dimensional vector of attributes characterizing each pair of location choice alternatives is formulated and presented. The formulation of the GSCL model allows one to accommodate alternative correlation mechanisms rather than pre-imposing restrictive correlation assumptions on the location choice alternatives. The model is applied to the analysis of residential location choice behavior using a sample of households drawn from the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Travel Survey (BATS) data set. Model estimation results obtained from the GSCL are compared against those obtained using the standard multinomial logit (MNL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model where only correlations across neighboring (or adjacent) alternatives are accommodated. Model findings suggest that there is significant spatial correlation across alternatives that do not share a common boundary, and that the GSCL offers the ability to more accurately capture spatial location choice behavior.

Probability of illness was estimated using the theory of utility-maximising behaviour of households subject to the conventional farm household production model, augmented by adding a health production function. Reduced model and instrumental variable probit specifications both show that perceived illness prevalence is significantly higher for household members working on wastewater irrigation farms than for those working with freshwater.

Following that the effect of intrapreneurial behaviour on job performance is also tested. Of 500 questionnaires distributed, 263 were found usable. Structural equation modeling procedure was employed to test the hypothesised relationships. The results indicate that except for organisational boundaries, other organisational architecture namely management support, work discretion, reward and reinforcement, and time availability were found to have positive significant effects on intrapreneurship.

Given the changes in the social and political context, consideration of the subject of religion can no longer be avoided. The paper identifies two implications of this for development studies. First, the assumptions of secularization and secularism that supposedly define the relationships between religion, society, and politics have to be revisited. Second, development studies must recognize that religion is dynamic and heterogeneous. Both development studies and religion are concerned with the meaning of progress or a better life, implying that attention has to be given to social and historical processes of meaning creation, requiring a shift from positivist to interpretivist research methods. The paper concludes by looking at how consideration of religion is transforming development studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This behavior is puzzling because it cannot be explained by traditional finance theories. A standard explanation of the disposition effect refers to prospect theory and, in particular, to the asymmetric risk aversion, according to which investors are risk-averse when faced with gains and risk-seeking when faced with losses. We show that for reasonable parameter values, the disposition effect cannot, however, be explained by prospect theory. The reason is that those investors who sell winning stocks and hold losing assets would not have invested in stocks in the first place. That is, the standard prospect theory argument is sound ex-post, assuming that the investment occurred, but not ex-ante, requiring also that the investment has to be made in the first place.","[Hens, Thorsten] Univ Zurich, Inst Banking & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Hens, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Banking & Finance, Plattenstr 32, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",thorsten.hens@bf.uzh.ch,,"Hens, Thorsten/0000-0002-0266-1561",,,,,29,67,86,4,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Further it also indicates the significant leverage effects to various behavioral triggers only in pre introduction period. Thus this sort of structural change in volatilities pattern in the post introduction period is attributed to the absorption of information in the currency market on continual basis.

It investigates the extent to which African countries have coordinated fiscal and macroeconomic responses to aid surges. In practice, we construct a panel dataset to assess the level of aid 'absorption' and 'spending'. This article departs from the recent empirical literature by utilising better measures for aid inflows and by employing cointegration analysis. The empirical short-run results indicate that, on average, Africa's low-income countries have absorbed two-thirds of (grant) aid receipts. This suggests that most of the foreign exchange provided by the aid inflows has been used to finance imports. The other third has been used to build up international reserves, perhaps to protect economies from future external shocks. In the long run, absorption increases but remains below its maximum. Moreover, we also show that aid resources have been fully spent, especially in support of public investment. There is only weak evidence that a share of aid flows have been 'saved'. Overall, these findings suggest that the macroeconomic management of aid inflows in Africa has been significantly better than often portrayed in comparable exercises. The implication is that African countries will be able to efficiently manage a gradual scaling up in aid resources.","Overseas Dev Inst, London SE1 7JD, England",,"Martins, PMG (通讯作者)，Overseas Dev Inst, 111 Westminster Bridge Rd, London SE1 7JD, England.",p.martins@odi.org.uk,,"Martins, Pedro/0000-0001-7305-0920",,,,,29,14,15,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The analysis reveals that public spending on road infrastructure is characterised by relatively high, but regionally strongly concentrated, returns in terms of rural household welfare. This is quite in contrast to the returns to public expenditures in education, which have attributes of much wider reach but less intensity. Public investments in agriculture show results that are low in magnitude and in statistical significance, mostly due to a poor link between public expenditures in agriculture and productivity in the sector.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div DSG, Washington, DC 20003 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Mogues, T (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div DSG, Washington, DC 20003 USA.",t.mogues@cgiar.org,,"Mogues, Tewodaj/0000-0002-3816-8445",,,,,39,11,14,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Assessing the impact of such policies requires forecasts of how humans adapt to changes in their economic environment. A prerequisite for a meaningful policy impact analysis is a profound knowledge why and to what extent economic agents behave in a bounded rational way. We propose that business management games be used to contribute to a better understanding since they provide an inexpensive opportunity to reach beyond the existing anecdotic evidence of behavioural anomalies. Modifying an existing business management game, in which investment, financing and production decisions have to be made, we demonstrate how bounded rationality can be quantified and separated into its two components: incomplete information and limited cognitive abilities. The resulting data indicate that the decisions made by the participants of the game have been strongly influenced by bounded rationality. They also show that both incomplete information and limited cognitive abilities are relevant components of the bounded rationality that has been displayed by the players. Regulatory impact analysts who base their forecasts a priori on the standard rational choice assumption cause the risk of measures being designed for economic agents that do not exist in reality.","[Musshoff, Oliver; Hengel, Philipp] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Hirschauer, Norbert] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agrarwissensch, Dept Agrarakon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",,,,,30,0,0,0,6,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The standard computation takes into account the number of hours worked as the labour input and net or gross fixed capital stock as the capital input. This article improves the computation by using labour services as the labour input (it is necessary to take into account the skills and efforts of the workers) and capital services as the capital input. Substitution of capital stocks by capital services means that only flow indicators are used for TFP measurement. This issue became more popular in recent time in line with the revision of the manual for national accounts - SNA 2008.

It is demonstrated that Iranian SMEs have a moderate level of knowledge quality. Considering the characteristic of knowledge quality, the contextual knowledge quality showed a higher relevance to knowledge quality. Amongst the requirements of knowledge quality, absorptive capacity showed a stronger connection to knowledge quality.

The analysis shows that managers' self-interested leverage choices deviate significantly from the optimal leverages that maximize firm values, partially explaining the suboptimal leverage ratios observed empirically (Graham, 2000). Both the extent and sensitivity of the deviations are affected by firm characteristics, debt features and default solutions. The shareholder-manager conflicts over risk level and cash payout vary dynamically with a firm's financial health. Managerial entrenchment does not mitigate the agency problems of debt since managers' discretionary decisions on milking properties or asset substitution could be driven by incentives to increase their own utility.

It presents a simple theoretical model of the firm decision to export and innovate that guides the econometric analysis. Consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model, the econometric results suggest a positive effect of firm innovation on the probability of participation in export markets. The results further reveal the heterogeneous effects of different types of innovations on the firm export participation. In particular, product upgrading appears to have a larger effect on the firm export participation than the introduction of cost-saving innovations.

Yet no empirical work has been performed to test whether the benefits are indeed statistically significant. This paper addresses several unresolved issues concerning the potential diversification benefits of commodities. First, we attempt to ascertain whether the alleged diversification benefits exist and are statistically significant. Second, to what extent are the diversification benefits unique to US investors? Would investors of a resource-based economy like Canada also benefit from adding commodities to their portfolios? Third, recent studies indicate that correlations among international equity returns are higher during bear markets than during bull markets. This type of regime-switching correlation behavior will mean lower diversification benefits from international investments when investors face a bearish environment at home. Do commodity futures display the same type of regime-switching behavior? To what extent do commodity futures offer real diversification benefits that are robust over time and across regimes? Finally, commodities may appear to be an asset for the more adventurous investors with higher risk tolerance. We want to know what type of investors should hold commodities. We demonstrate that the diversification benefit of commodities is a far more complex phenomenon than often understood in the finance literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The gap between the cif and fob value of a trade flow is a useful measure of aggregate trade costs, but only if the measure is based on a consistent volume of trade; mirror statistics are unsuitable. Using high quality Australian import data disaggregated at the HS 6-digit level, we find large country-by-country variations in trade costs. Distance, weight and size account for part of the variation in trade costs. Indicators of institutional quality pick up some of the variation in trade costs, but the relationship is not uniform across mode of transport and commodities; exporting countries' institutional quality is more strongly related to trade costs for air freight than sea freight, and the relationship is commodity-specific and strongest for manufactured goods. Country-specific characteristics influencing trade costs provide a link between institutions and economic development.","[Pomfret, Richard; Sourdin, Patricia] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Sourdin, Patricia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bologna Ctr, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Adelaide; Johns Hopkins University,"Pomfret, R (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",richard.pomfret@adelaide.edu.au; patricia.sourdin@gmail.com,,"Pomfret, Richard/0000-0002-1950-5856",,,,,37,13,15,2,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

I find that partial mergers normally occur as a response to negative economic shocks by firms that are larger and more diversified than firms in total mergers. An event study identifies positive and significant returns to partial merger announcements. Unlike total mergers whose value accrues mostly to the shareholders of small (acquired) firms, large and small firms in partial mergers receive comparable returns, which are particularly large to firms forming an equally owned JV.

We find strong evidence that ultimate ownership (i.e., the voting/cash-flow rights wedge) and family control have a positive and significant effect on bond yield-spreads, and a negative and significant effect on bond ratings. Control in the hands of widely held financial firms has a positive effect on bond ratings only, while State control has no effect on either bond yield-spreads or ratings. We also find that a higher protection of debtholders' rights generally reduces bond yield-spreads and increases bond ratings. Our results additionally show that, for both bondholders and rating agencies, the enforcement of debt laws is crucially important. Finally, we document a negative effect of debt covenants on debt costs when there is a high expropriation risk and poor creditor rights protection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While commentators constantly cite an increase in labor mobility as a major reason for the shift in the private sector from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, researchers to date have not been able to document any difference in mobility by pension type. This study argues that the inability to find such a relationship stems from ignoring the important role of job tenure. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the results of duration analyses that include the interaction of job tenure and pension type reveal that workers with between five and ten years of tenure at a firm are 23% more likely to leave a job with a defined contribution plan than with a defined benefit plan. This difference is consistent with differences in the timing of benefit level entitlement between the two types of plans.","[Haverstick, Kelly; Munnell, Alicia H.; Sanzenbacher, Geoffrey; Soto, Mauricio] Boston Coll, Ctr Retirement Res, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Haverstick, K (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Ctr Retirement Res, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",sazenba@bc.edu,,,,,,,40,9,14,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Results suggest that a 10% price subsidy would curtail consumption deficiencies by 4%-7% at an estimated cost of $734 million a year.

The increase in the number of driver's licence-holders and car availability is reflected in travel mode choice among older people: both men and women maintain their car-use habits at old age. Another clear finding is that older people today travel more than the comparable age groups 20-25 years ago: everyday trip rates are higher and activities outside home are more common. While commuting and work-related trips decline after retirement, shopping and leisure trips do not start to decline before high age. From the cohort analysis we see that leisure and shopping trips are maintained in the period after retirement, and the car is important to reach shopping malls, health service, leisure activities, visit relatives and other social company.

Whereas the former primarily deals with individual self-interest and extrinsic incentives, the latter deals with other-regardingness and intrinsic social motives. However, recent findings, mainly from the field of experimental economics, reintroduce aspects of justice into economic modeling. Other theories, evolutionary models for instance, take up the key findings and apply the economic rationale in order to find out why human traits which apparently run counter to individual self-interest may have survived. In this introductory note we date this discussion back to the days of Adam Smith and argue that he already set the basis for such a discussion. Apparently, Smith was well aware that principles of justice and the market may, at times, be contradictory. However, he also found that both served a common purpose, or so we will argue. We further aim at bringing together Smith's classical position with recent ideas, for instance Binmore's theory of justice, and see whether the one can be fruitful for the other.

In two surveys, data on the strategic behavior and performance of the same group of firms were gathered for the period from 1992 to 2002. The study expands existing literature, which provides little evidence whether the persistent commitment to a generic strategy over a longer period pays off or whether strategic change is the rule in SMEs, reflecting their flexibility as a potential competitive advantage. We consider the traditional generic strategies of cost-efficiency and differentiation, but also examine the group of firms that have no clear strategy or are stuck in the middle. Within this group, we distinguish between those companies that deliberately combine traditional low cost production and differentiation, i.e., follow a combination strategy, firms that change their strategy and those that have no strategy. We argue that a combination strategy is a viable strategic choice for SMEs in the long run. We found that the majority of firms pursued a persistent strategy over a 10-year period, but that companies that changed their generic strategy did not produce inferior results to those that adhered to a single strategy over the entire period. Our results reveal that firms that follow a combination strategy outperform companies with no generic strategy in terms of profitability and growth and achieve higher profitability than companies that follow a differentiation strategy.","[Leitner, Karl-Heinz] Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Gueldenberg, Stefan] Univ Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Liechtenstein,"Leitner, KH (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria.",karl-heinz.leitner@ait.ac.at,,"Leitner, Karl-Heinz/0000-0002-3885-9465",,,,,117,103,118,1,88,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

I employ the data set by Bassanini and Duval (2006) on labor market institutions in OECD countries and the KOF index of globalization. The data set covers 20 OECD countries in the 1982-2003 period. The results suggest that globalization did neither influence the unemployment replacement rate, the unemployment benefit length, public expenditures on ALMP, the tax wedge, union density nor overall employment protection. In contrast, protection of regular employment contracts was diminished when globalization was proceeding rapidly. In fact, domestic aspects, such as unemployment and government ideology are more important determinants of labor market institutions and deregulation processes in OECD countries than globalization. For this reason, working conditions of unskilled workers are not likely to deteriorate and the jobs of unskilled workers are not likely to disappear in the course of globalization. All this is, of course, not to insinuate that globalization has any benign influence on labor market institutions.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",niklas.potrafke@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,71,49,52,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Urban firms are larger, more capital intensive and have higher labor productivity than rural firms, yet there is no strong evidence of increasing returns to scale. The hypothesis that firms in rural towns have the same average total factor productivity as urban firms is not rejected; however, firms in remote rural areas are less productive. Rural firms grow less quickly than urban firms. These results can partly be attributed to differences in the quality of infrastructure, access to credit and transportation costs across rural and urban areas. Since rural firms operate in a business environment that is very different from its urban counterpart, lessons derived from urban investment climate surveys cannot immediately be transferred to rural areas.

J,"Kessides, IN",,,,"Kessides, Ioannis N.",,,Nuclear Power and Sustainable Energy Policy: Promises and Perils,WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The author examines the challenges and opportunities of nuclear power in meeting the projected large absolute increase in energy demand, especially electricity, throughout the industrialized and developing world, while helping to mitigate the threat of climate change. A significant global nuclear power deployment would engender serious risks related to proliferation, safety, and waste disposal. Unlike renewable sources of energy, nuclear power is an unforgiving technology because human lapses and errors can have ecological and social impacts that are catastrophic and irreversible. However, according to some analysts, advances in the design of nuclear reactors may have reduced their associated risks and improved their performance. Moreover, while a variety of renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, modern biomass, solar) will play important roles in the transition to a low-carbon economy, some analysts perceive that nuclear power is the only proven technology for generating electricity that is both largely carbon-free, not location specific (as with wind, hydro and solar), and amenable to significant scaling up. Thus given the projections of threats from climate change, and if the considerable strain experienced by world energy markets in recent years is a harbinger of things to come, then there is a rationale for examining the pros and cons of nuclear power as a supply option within low-carbon strategies. It should be noted that despite the emerging centrality of climate change and security of supply in the energy policy debate, nuclear power is still viewed with a great deal of skepticism and in fact continues to elicit considerable opposition. Indeed the views on nuclear power in the context of sustainable energy policy are highly divergent. A thorough evaluation of all aspects of the issue is warranted.

The use of royalty instruments such as the ad valorem and revenue-based royalties can generate revenues and, in the case of revenue-based instruments, modify harvest behavior, but only under limited circumstances.

In this paper, we show how takeover risk influences this relation. Bondholders of high-rated firms can suffer losses in a takeover, particularly if the takeover is largely funded with debt, resulting in a more positive (or less negative) correlation between stock returns and bond spread changes. Consistent with this notion and based on a large sample of data covering the period from 1980 to 2000, we find that high-rated firms which are likely to be taken over have a more positive correlation between stock returns and bond spread changes, while target firms with a poison put or an indebtedness covenant have a more negative correlation.

More concrete, the goal of our scientific approach is to determine, based on empirical analysis, if there is a relationship of dependency between the costs of systemic crises and central bank independence, an issue, otherwise, little explored in literature. In other words, we will try to answer the question: Do central banks with higher degree of independence manage systemic crises more effectively than with lower level of independence? At first glance, the answer would be that central banks with higher degree of independence are able to manage more efficiently systemic crises. The results of the empirical analysis based on a sample of 40 systemic crises, however, led us to another conclusion, namely those central banks with higher degree of independence showed a poor performance in reducing the costs and duration of the crisis, but managed to maintain lower inflation rates during these periods.","[Dardac, Nicolae; Giba, Adriana] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dardac, N (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",nicolae.dardac@fin.ase.ro,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,11,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,594,605,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000024,0

We employ the de facto classification of Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) that allows us to estimate the impact of relatively long-lived exchange rate regimes on currency crises with much greater precision. We find that pegged regimes significantly decrease the likelihood of currency crises compared with floating regimes. By using the combined data of exchange rate regimes and the existence of capital controls, we also find interesting evidence that pegged regimes with capital account liberalization significantly lower the likelihood of currency crises compared with other regimes. These results are robust to a wide variety of samples and models. From the standpoint of the macroeconomic policy trilemma, we can conjecture that pegged regimes with capital account liberalization are substantially less prone to speculative attacks because they can enhance greater credibility in their currencies by abandoning monetary policy autonomy.

This study further shows that what Merton defines as the option value of deposit insurance is actually a component of a bank's limited liability option under a third-party deposit guarantee. As such, it is already included in the value of the bank's equity capital, and the flawed definition makes the Keeley-Furlong model internally incoherent. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from two field surveys,JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Personal finance; Warranty; Cognitive skills,DECISION-MAKING; RISK,"Extended warranties are popular but expensive. This paper examines how consumers value these warranties, and asks whether economic considerations alone can account for their popularity. Results from two field surveys show that consumers greatly overestimate both the likelihood and the cost of product breakdown. However, these biases alone do not explain their willingness to buy warranties. In fact, we find evidence of probability neglect, in which warranty purchase decision depends on the magnitude of the possible consequences of not having insurance and not on the probability of having to suffer these consequences. The expected emotional benefits from having a warranty was the best predictor of purchase decision and willingness to pay. We also found that people with higher cognitive skills are less likely to overestimate the economic determinants of warranty value, yet are still highly influenced by emotional considerations when deciding whether to purchase a warranty.","[Huysentruyt, Marieke] London Sch Econ, Dept Management, London WC2AE 3LJ, England; [Huysentruyt, Marieke] Stockholm Sch Econ, SITE, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Read, Daniel] Univ Durham, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Read, Daniel] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Stockholm School of Economics; Durham University; Yale University,"Huysentruyt, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Management, 54 Lincolns Field Inn, London WC2AE 3LJ, England.",M.E.Huysentruyt@lse.ac.uk; Daniel.Read@Yale.edu,,"Read, Daniel/0000-0001-6672-9310",,,,,42,34,42,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

An analysis of the transfer of sugarcane land in two districts in KwaZulu-Natal over the period 2000 to 2006 permitted a comparison of the prices paid to commercial farmers both in private transactions and in the case of sales to government.

Economic theory suggests that some form of subsidy or contracting between the beneficiaries and the providers could result in an optimal supply of environmental services. Moreover, if the poor own resources that give them a comparative advantage in the supply of environmental services, then payments for environmental services (PES) can improve environmental and poverty outcomes. While the theory is relatively straightforward, the practice is not, particularly in developing countries where institutions are weak. This article reviews the empirical literature on PES additionality by asking, Do payments deliver environmental services, everything else being equal, or, at least, the land-use changes believed to generate environmental services? We examine both qualitative case studies and rigorous econometric quasi-experimental analyses. We find that government-coordinated PES have caused modest or no reversal of deforestation. Case studies of smaller-scale, user-financed PES schemes claim more substantial impacts, but few of these studies eliminate rival explanations for the positive effects. We conclude by discussing how the dearth of evidence about PES impacts, and unanswered questions about institutional preconditions and motivational crowding out, limit the prospects for using international carbon payments to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation.","[Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Ferraro, Paul J.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Duke University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Pattanayak, SK (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",subhrendu.pattanayak@duke.edu,"Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020; Ferraro, Paul/B-4435-2014","Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Ferraro, Paul/0000-0002-4777-5108",,,,,69,427,497,2,303,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

The study found that tourists cause 4.4% of global CO2 emissions. Also these emissions are projected to grow at an average rate of 3.2% per year up to 2035. This increase is problematic as globally a reduction of emissions by 3-6% is required to avoid 'dangerous' climate change. Using contemporary scenario techniques it appeared difficult to find a future tourist travel system consistent with CO2 emission reductions of up to 70% by 2050 with respect to 2005. Based on the model underlying the 30-year projection, 70 scenarios are presented in a 'landscape' graph exploring the effect of opportunities to reduce the emissions, but this attempt did not reach the large reductions envisaged. We therefore explored automated scenario generation as a way to define backcasting scenarios that both reach the emission reduction target and retain the highest possible economic value for the sector. The main contributions made by this study are (1) in comparing the value of different ways to approach a (desired) future and (2) giving insight into the kind of structural changes required within tourism and tourism transport in case very strong emission reductions are required. Finally the model showed signs of 'complex' behaviour. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the difference in implied volatility between pairs of call and put options to measure these deviations, we find that stocks with relatively expensive calls outperform stocks with relatively expensive puts by 50 basis points per week. We find both positive abnormal performance in stocks with relatively expensive calls and negative abnormal performance in stocks with relatively expensive puts, which cannot be explained by short sale constraints. Rebate rates from the stock lending market directly confirm that our findings are not driven by stocks that are hard to borrow. The degree of predictability is larger when option liquidity is high and stock liquidity low, while there is little predictability when the opposite is true. Controlling for size, option prices are more likely to deviate from strict put-call parity when underlying stocks face more information risk. The degree of predictability decreases over the sample period.

Our measures of country fundamentals have substantial explanatory power, even controlling for global factors and credit ratings.

There was more than one inflection to the phrase. Amsterdam was, in the first instance, built atop a subterranean forest of Norwegian origin. But southern Norway was also a vital resource zone, subordinated to Amsterdam-based capital. This paper follows the movement of strategic commodity frontiers within early modern Europe from the standpoint of capitalism as world-ecology, joining in dialectical unity the production of capital and the production of nature. Our geographical focus is trained upon the emergence of the Global North Atlantic, that zone providing the strategic raw materials and food supplies indispensable to the consolidation of capitalism - timber, naval stores, metals, cereals, fish and whales. I argue for a broader geographical perspective on these movements, one capable of revealing the dialectical interplay of frontiers on all sides of the Atlantic. From its command posts in Amsterdam, Dutch capital deployed American silver in the creation of successive frontiers within Europe, transforming Scandinavian and Baltic regions. The frontier character of these transformations was decisive, premised on drawing readily exploitable supplies of land and labour power into the orbit of capital. We see in northern Europe precisely what we see in the Americas - a pattern of commodity-centred environmental transformation, and thence relative ecological exhaustion, from which the only escape was renewed global conquest and ever-wider cycles of combined and uneven development.","Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Moore, JW (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",jasonwsmoore@gmail.com,,"Moore, Jason W./0000-0002-7237-9895",,,,,209,86,101,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Our results show that the appropriate response of fiscal policy to temporary shocks is not trivial in the absence of fiscal rules. Fiscal rules allow for a timely reaction, thereby avoiding possibly disruptive fiscal adjustment in the future: the more adjustment is delayed, the larger its necessary scale is.

Chandler's work on the modern corporation. Along with efforts to avoid transaction-cost problems, the management of firm-specific information and knowledge was central to the 19th-century transformation of US corporate structure that Chandler examined in The Visible Hand. Knowledge management also played a key role in the creation of intrafirm organizations for managing the creation of knowledge, management of innovation, and acquisition of technologies from external sources. Industrial R&D and the product diversification that emerged from the in-house R&D facilities of many of these firms contributed to the development of the so-called M-form corporation (examined by Chandler in Strategy and Structure), in which corporate management and strategy formulation were organizationally differentiated and separated from functional management. Finally, Chandler's last work on the success and failure of United States, Japanese, and Western European firms in the modern electronics, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals industries emphasized the role of the integrated learning base within these firms and the varying degrees of success with which established firms were able to sustain these learning bases and/or apply them to new markets and technologies.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mowery, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mowery@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,58,9,9,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, larger PWS are more likely to violate MCL standards than smaller PWS. Second, publicly owned PWS have slightly higher probability of violating MCL standards than privately owned systems. Finally, PWS serving residential areas are more likely to violate MCL standards, as opposed to PWS serving school districts or office buildings.

Many firms have small boards, comprised entirely or almost entirely of insiders or representatives of the controlling family or group. Even some very large firms have no independent directors. Formal board processes are limited. Audit committees are uncommon, but many firms use a substitute body-the fiscal board-which does not require that the firm have independent directors to staff the audit committee. Financial disclosure is mixed. Some firms voluntarily provide English language disclosure, but many do not provide cash flow statements or consolidated quarterly financial statements. Brazilian corporate law often provides limited protection to minority shareholders, but the Brazilian stock exchange, Bovespa, provides optional governance rules which go beyond the legal minimums.

But collective welfare failures (particularly externalities) and collective cognition failures (particularly mood swings) were as important, if not more so, in driving the crisis.

A partial equilibrium industry model with heterogeneous establishments and aggregate uncertainty shows that the EAS reduces steady-state labor productivity by encouraging labor hoarding, and in some cases, preventing the exit of least efficient establishments. The EAS also reduces job flows and increases average establishment-level employment. Although the impact on productivity is roughly proportional to the size of subsidized workers in most cases, the effects of the subsidy on output and employment volatility are more than proportional. First, the subsidy can lead to a sizable increase in output fluctuations over business cycles by symmetrically increasing the output response to shocks. This result is achieved through lower output via a subsidy during unfavorable times and higher output via less time and money spent on hiring during favorable times. Second, the subsidy meets its primary objective of reduced employment volatility. The reduction can be considerable when firing costs are high. J. Japanese Int. Economies 24 (1) (2010) 28-49.

We employ non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods to empirically construct the industry's 'best practice' frontier and measure firm efficiency as the distance from that frontier. Using these performance measures we examine if more efficient firms choose more or less debt in their capital structure. We summarize the contrasting effects of efficiency on capital structure in terms of two competing hypotheses: the efficiency-risk and franchise-value hypotheses. Using quantile regressions we test the effect of efficiency on leverage and thus the empirical validity of the two competing hypotheses across different capital structure choices. We also test the direct relationship from leverage to efficiency stipulated by the Jensen and Meckling (1976) agency cost model. Throughout this analysis we consider the role of ownership Structure and type on capital structure and firm performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to closing this gap by performing a case study of Nestle. The allocation of Nestle's aid is compared to that of Swiss ODA and NGO aid testing for both altruistic and selfish aid motivations. We conclude that Nestle's aid clearly lacks focus in terms of targeting poor countries, which appears to be the downside of the strong link between commercial presence and aid. Moreover, according to our Tobit estimations, Nestle grants mote aid to recipient countries with stronger democratic but also more corrupt institutions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Net and gross output approaches to measuring production are discussed and then tested using panel data from 37 dairy farms in KwaZulu-Natal from 1999 and 2007. Production functions for the three outputs: milk production, animals and farm-produced feed, are fitted as a simultaneous system to model the farms' production activities. This simultaneous model is complemented by a single equation reduced form that is fitted as a frontier, which allows estimation of the relative efficiencies of the individual farms. The results show that, with data this detailed, it is possible to refine the model until it fits very tightly. Indeed, in the gross output model that includes cows there is nothing left to call inefficiency and what was clearly a frontier becomes a mean response function.","[Mkhabela, T.; Vink, N.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Piesse, J.] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Thirtle, C.] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Thirtle, C.] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England",Stellenbosch University; University of London; King's College London; University of Pretoria; Imperial College London,"Mkhabela, T (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",thula@sun.ac.za; jenifer.piesse@kcl.ac.uk; C.Thirtle@ic.ac.uk; nv@sun.ac.za,"Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,31,6,7,0,1,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,MAR,2010,49.0,1,,,,,102,121,,10.1080/03031851003798686,0.0,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,621PU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279594200006,0

Moderate levels of noninflationary domestic debt, as a share of GDP and bank deposits, are found to exert a positive overall impact on economic growth. Granger-causality regressions suggest support for a variety of channels: improved monetary policy; broader financial market development; strengthened domestic institutions/accountability; and enhanced private savings and financial intermediation. There is some evidence that, above a ratio of 35 percent of bank deposits, domestic debt begins to undermine growth, lending credence to traditional crowding out and bank efficiency concerns. Importantly, the growth contribution of domestic debt is higher if it is marketable, bears positive real interest rates, and is held outside the banking system.

One scheme which has received relatively little attention is the Controlled Vehicular Access System (CVA) recently implemented in Valletta, Malta. This paper draws on the experience of Valletta with a move from a fixed annual charge (V-licence) for access into the city to a time-based road user charge implemented in May 2007. The aims of this paper are to identify the reasons why a fixed charge was initially introduced; to review the literature related to implementation of road user charging schemes around the world; to compare the V-licence with the CVA and identify the issues relating to the change from one scheme to another. Through the direct involvement of one of the authors in the design and implementation of the road user charge in Valletta, this paper is based on archival data, direct observation and qualitative interviews.

Panel data are used to examine land use allocations, agricultural asset accumulation, and agricultural input use and returns. Findings suggest that migration and remittances cause a household to reallocate land away from commercial cash crops toward the production of subsistence food crops. There is weak evidence that migration and remittances contribute positively to agricultural asset accumulation in the form of land and livestock holdings. Further, results suggest that migration and remittance do not affect agricultural input use and may decrease the returns to land and labour on farm, as migrant households farm their land less intensively than non-migrant households.","Macalester Coll, Dept Econ, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Macalester College,"Damon, AL (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",adamon@macalester.edu,,,,,,,20,47,56,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

At present, theoretical research is mainly focused on experience and lessons of foreign REITs, and private equity real estate investment trusts are more common In the practice areas. This article focuses on two aspects: First, the real estate investment trusts (REITs) compliance analysis in the construction of Low Rent Housing. Second, the real estate investment trusts (REITs) operational analysis in the construction of Low Rent Housing.

This is done by estimating an output distance function subject to theoretical regularity within a Bayesian framework. We find that failure to incorporate theoretical regularity conditions results in mismeasured shadow revenue and/or cost shares, which in turn leads to perverse conclusions regarding productivity growth. Our results from the regularity-constrained model show that total factor productivity of the large US banks grew at an average rate of 1.98% over the sample period. However, Our estimates also show a clear downward trend in the growth rate of total factor productivity and our decomposition of the primal Divisia total factor productivity growth index into its three components - technical change, efficiency change, and economies of scale - indicates that technical change is the driving force behind this decline.

We incorporate a rich set of controls for local retail market conditions as well as whether or not the Big-Boxes are in the same sector as the smaller stores.

Further development of agritourism can be expected over the next several years. An extensive analysis of the state of agritourism in the Czech Republic discovered that information on agritourism facilities is very diverse and confusing, lacking a specialized portal for agritourism. There are several thousand agritourism facilities in the Czech Republic, but most of them either do not have quality web sites, or have none at all. Many people have already switched their preference from traditional holidays by the sea to agritourism. Using new information and communication technologies (ICT) the awareness of agritourism opportunities can be greatly improved. It should be ensured that entrepreneurs in agritourism (mainly farmers) are aware that their own small farms can be presented on the web easily and with minimum cost, e.g. using the Web Content Management System (WCMS). A new portal solution has been designed, which will promote greater information sharing among the partners in the field of agritourism. The so-called long tail effect for small farmers is expected. This site should allow an easy option for the clients searching for suitable premises. It should also allow operators (farmers) to easily input data into the portal database on accommodation, offered services and general information on the area, etc.","[Havlicek, Zdenek; Lohr, Vaclav; Benda, Petr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Havlícek, Z (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",havlicek@pef.czu.cz,"Lohr, Václav/S-8581-2016; Benda, Petr/C-3376-2017","Lohr, Václav/0000-0002-2688-4049; Benda, Petr/0000-0001-9651-8258",,,,,8,2,2,0,17,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,327,334,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600037,0

To achieve this, the article uses both relatively simple approach using ratios related to the house prices (e.g. price-to-rent or price-to-income indicators) as well as international comparison and more advanced econometrical approach. Within this econometrical approach we apply both time series analysis for the Czech Republic as a whole and panel regression for the Czech regions. This analysis identifies overvalued property prices in 2002-2003 and 2007-2008. In 2007-2008, however, the rise in property prices was largely explainable by fundamentals, meaning that the price overvaluation in this period was considerably smaller than that in the first one. From the regional perspective, there is a higher degree of overvaluation in regions with higher property prices. The exception is Prague, which seems to be a specific region partly due to the properties of the estimation technique.","[Hlavacek, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Hlavacek, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Komarek, Lubos] Prague Sch Econ, Fac Econ Ostrava, CZ-11503 Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague,"Hlavácek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prikope 28, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",michal.hlavacek@cnb.cz; lubos.komarek@cnb.cz,"Komarek, Lubos/E-9748-2018; Hlaváček, Michal/E-9733-2018","Hlaváček, Michal/0000-0002-9495-2082",,,,,23,5,5,0,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We demonstrate that the omission of the previous month's stock returns can lead to a negatively biased estimate of the relation. The magnitude of the omitted variable bias depends on the approach to estimating the conditional idiosyncratic volatility. Although a negative relation exists when the estimate is based on daily returns, it disappears after return reversals are controlled for. Return reversals can explain both the negative relation between value-weighted portfolio returns and idiosyncratic volatility and the insignificant relation between equal-weighted portfolio returns and idiosyncratic volatility. In contrast, there is a significantly positive relation between the conditional idiosyncratic volatility estimated from monthly data and expected returns. This relation remains robust after controlling for return reversals.","[Huang, Wei; Liu, Qianqiu; Rhee, S. Ghon] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Rhee, S.

This paper explores the issues related to the development of accessibility measures for non-motorized modes, namely bicycling and walking. We note that difficulties in calculating accessibility measures arise primarily from problems with data quality, the zonal structure of transportation planning models, and the adequacy of models and travel networks for describing and predicting travel by non-motorized modes. We present practical strategies for addressing these issues. The application of these methods is illustrated with the calculation of accessibility measures for a small study area in Minneapolis, MN (USA).

This research may have important implications for investment decision makers in circumstances in which many investment options are available. However, the studies in psychology have typically examined the decisions of individuals who have no particular experience in the decision task. In this study, we examine whether individuals' investment decisions are affected by choice-set size (i.e., a limited vs. extensive choice set) and whether the effect is mitigated or changed for individuals who are more experienced with investment decisions. We find that the paradox of choice phenomenon is evident for participants who are less experienced with investing but not for more experienced participants. In fact, individuals who are more experienced with investment decisions were actually less likely to invest when faced with a limited choice set, contrary to the paradox of choice phenomenon. These findings suggest that the paradox of choice may not exist when individuals with investment experience make their decisions.","[Kida, Thomas] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Moreno, Kimberly K.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Northeastern University,"Smith, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jfs@som.umass.edu,,,,,,,63,18,21,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

For the latter component, we specify the commonly used simple mixture model such that the component is the cumulative sum of a process which is 0 with some probability (1-alpha) and is a random variable with probability U. Our estimation method transforms such a model into a linear state space with mixture of normal innovations, so that an extension of Kalman filter algorithm can be applied. We apply this random level shift model to the logarithm of daily absolute returns for the S&P 500, AMEX, Dow Jones and NASDAQ stock Market return indices. Our point estimates imply few level shifts for all series. But once these are taken into account, there is little evidence of serial correlation in the remaining noise and, hence, no evidence of long-memory. Once the estimated shifts are introduced to a standard GARCH model applied to the returns series, any evidence of GARCH effects disappears. We also produce rolling out-of-sample forecasts of squared returns. In most cases, our simple random level shift model clearly outperforms a standard GARCH(1,1) model and, in many cases, it also provides better forecasts than a fractionally integrated GARCH model.

In this paper, methods of tracing and summarizing are mainly adopted, together with basic ideas and measures of welfare economics. The paper first classifies all measures of housing welfare for migrant workers adopted by the local level. Then on the foundation of the theory of welfare economics, positions the migrant workers group in the whole framework of social welfare in China and define the definite scope and objective of public housing projects for them. The third, via Pareto optimal state and ordinal utility theory, evaluate the effectiveness of different housing patterns of migrant workers on the society. At last, considering cost-effectiveness analysis result, researches the suitability of different migrant workers housing modes according to different situations. The paper comes to the conclusion that, there are differences among demands of welfare housing for migrant workers considering regional and industrial features; housing support from local governments should be provided to migrations that cannot afford living in the city; and large-scale government constructions of housing for migrant workers are not suitable to many situations.","[Ma, Yiguan; Lv, Ping] Renmin Univ China, Dept Land & Real Estate, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,7,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,304,311,,,,,,8,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400022,0

It differs from previous studies by examining global inequality in each of the components of this index alongside that of the index as a whole, thus side-stepping ambiguities over weighting that are inherent to multidimensional well-being indices. The Gini coefficient, both population and non-population weighted, is used to measure the extent of inequality. Results indicate that the different components often provide very different information to the index as a whole, especially with respect to changes in global inequality over time. Most component variables show declines in global inequality, whereas the longevity component exhibits increased inequality since 1992.","[McGillivray, Mark] Deakin Univ, Alfred Deakin Res Inst, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia; [Markova, Nora] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Deakin University; Australian National University,"McGillivray, M (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Alfred Deakin Res Inst, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia.",mark.mcgillivray@deakin.edu.au,,"McGillivray, Mark/0000-0002-6461-2706",,,,,15,10,14,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Contrary to expectations, the growth elasticity of poverty was virtually indistinguishable across the three development episodes - a period of far-reaching policy liberalisation (1984-90); a second period of slower liberalisation (1990-96); and the period of recovery from the Asian financial crisis (1999-2002). Growth was pro-poor in all three periods, while the impact of growth on poverty was either augmented or offset by changes in inequality, depending on the period.

This paper addresses questions related to how to share between countries the carbon space and/or efforts to stay within it, in the perspective of sustainable development; different allocation mechanisms are reviewed, responding to criteria such as 'responsibility' for climate change,'capability' to engage in abating it, and 'potential' or future contribution. The carbon space remaining at any time will depend on effective mitigation up till that time, and will condense if more stringent maxima are to be set; per capita this space becomes smaller with rising population. Sharing the carbon space in a fair way requires convergence of currently widely unequal per capita emissions. If the world is to stay within the carbon space consistent with <2 degrees warming, then developed economies-the wealthiest sources of greenhouse gases should quickly and deeply engage in mitigation. Also, substantial mitigation is to take place in developing countries and that this will require substantial support to developing countries ( financially, technologically). Changing development paths can make a major contribution to climate change mitigation; this requires changes in investment, production and consumption patterns. Green New Deals as proposed in the context of a widened response to the current economic crisis could become a first phase of a fundamental transition towards a decarbonised global economy worldwide. Concerns to do with equity as well as sustainability must be incorporated and integrated into coherent transitory strategies.","Inst Social Studies, Dept Econ Sustainable Dev, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",,"Opschoor, H (通讯作者)，Inst Social Studies, Dept Econ Sustainable Dev, Postbus 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.",opschoor@iss.nl,,,,,,,54,7,9,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Both approaches have in common the fact that the bank provides its own estimates for the Probability of Default (PD) variable, which reflects the quality of the borrower. In this work, we propose a method of computing the rating in numerical form, which can later be converted to a PD estimate. We choose to use feed-forward neural networks for learning the functional relationship that underlies the rating, for their various advantages, and we aim at coping with the major disadvantage of neural networks which consists in the black-box perception by the final user. Most neural network models that have been developed for credit rating are based on classifying techniques, which means they assign each loan to a category, and all the loans in the same category will be assumed as having the same rating. In this paper we present a way of computing the rating in numerical form, for which we will use regression neural networks. We present the way a regression neural network approximates functional relationships, by examining the way the input signals are propagated. We specifically examine the functioning of the hidden layer neurons. It has been proved that regression neural networks are universal approximators. We exploit this advantage, as well as the fact that they are suitable for learning non-trivial non-linear functional relationships between variables. By replacing the network's hyperbolic tangent activation function with its piecewise linear approximation, we aim at obtaining a model in an intelligible form in order to comply with Basel II Accord that states that internal models have to be explained and presented to the authority for validation.","[Popov, Elena] QSP Syst ROMANIA, Bucharest, Romania",,,elenapopov@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,345,356,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100022,0

In the first paper the central issue is distinction between horizontal and vertical type of the IIT. The separation of the two types of trade is based on the comparison of unit values in exports and imports. Where the spread is relatively small, the products involved in trade are considered horizontally differentiated, where it is relatively large, the products are vertically differentiated. With a good portion of simplification the former is the 'good' while the latter is the 'bad' ITT, as relative prices are thought to reflect quality differences. That may be true in general, but in particular cases differences in unit value may be misleading. Especially in the case of the new-Member States a poor image inherited from the communist era may lead to misinterpretations in this field. In the second paper the author is concerned about domestic firms' suffering caused by emerging foreign competitors following inward FDI projects. Actually what we see described and analysed in the paper is, in a broader context, an adjustment process to increased competition. New players appear with better equipment, management, marketing, etc. and, with a minimal time lag, growth rates of sales of market incumbents go down. I think that is part of the game in an open and highly integrated economy. Moreover, as it was shown, the impact is provisional and in hardly more than one year is absorbed.","[Richter, Sandor] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,,richter@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,55,60,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_4,0.0,,,6,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000004,0

The paper is focused mainly on the position of consumers (as the final component of the pork agri-food chain) and their power to push the price level down against the efforts of retailers to push the price up. Imperfect competition and imperfect market structure of the pork agri-food chain might be assumed in this case. Price transmission in the pork agri-food chain is analysed based on the time series of pork wholesale price and pork consumer price that contain monthly data from January 1998 to May 2009. The price transmission is analysed in two periods - before and after EU accession. First of all, the nature of the time series is examined; then, the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) (as a suitable econometric tool for examining price transmission) is employed to analyse both short-run and long-run relationships between the prices analysed. Furthermore, the market structure and position of wholesalers and consumers are examined and evaluated. Moreover, the role of retail is determined and its impact on price transmission is discussed. The role of supermarkets and hypermarkets, their position and potential pressure could be crucial for an analysed relationship, i.e. price transmission of the wholesale and consumer price of pork in the Czech Republic. Finally, conclusions and suggestions are presented, based on the results of the processed analysis. The analysis represents a consecutive step in the former price transmission analysis, which was focused on the relationship between farm-gate price and the wholesale price of pork. Subsequently, the whole pork agri-food chain will be covered and fully described.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Sobrová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",sobrova@pef.czu.cz,"Rumankova, Lenka/H-4357-2018","Rumankova, Lenka/0000-0003-0734-6883",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,163,171,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600019,0

Based on a large-scale empirical study, this paper identifies strategic groups in the German brewing industry and analyzes the effects of group membership on economic performance. The brewing industry is an interesting research object. The severe economic crisis German breweries face in their home market and the deep structural changes reshaping the global beer industry are forcing German breweries to rethink their strategic position. The analysis reveals a limited number of strategic groups and significant performance differences between these groups. Both results are in line with the central hypotheses of the concept of strategic groups. The empirical results enable firm managers to benchmark their breweries against more successful strategic groups, to better adapt corporate and competitive strategies to firm environments, to identify more profitable strategic positions, and to take action to switch from one strategic group to another.","[Theuvsen, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Niederhut-Bollmann, Christoph] LU Lohnunternehmer Serv GmbH, Suthfeld, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Theuvsen, L (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,73,1,1,0,12,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Based on the published data the position of agriculture as a consumer of various sources of energy is described and the evaluation of trends in energy consumption in agriculture is discussed. The possibilities for the implementation of energy analyses of agricultural holdings are mentioned. On the other hand agricultural holdings are producers of renewable energy resources. In the process of plant production solar energy is bound into biomass which is traditionally consumed first as food, feed or green fertilizer. The utilization of biomass for the production of energy is an alternative use. It is connected with some aspects of technological and structural changes of the production. The economics of agricultural production is significantly influenced by subsidies and tax concessions as well as the production of renewal energy sources. The aim is the evaluation of the economic and energy efficiencies of agricultural holdings and their reciprocal connection with the emphasis on corporate social responsibility and the role of agricultural policy. The upcoming utilization of the PLANETE programme in France is given as such example. The knowledge of the energy balance should be used as a criterion for the public subsidy of agricultural holdings. This means that a positive energy balance in agriculture should be considered as a public good similar to its function for landscape creation. Based on the questionnaire survey the energy balance of winter wheat production in the various Czech agricultural holdings was carried out this year. The results should enable the evaluation of the differences between various holdings.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Vilhelm, V (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",vilhelm.vaclav@uzei.cz,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,12,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,181,199,,,,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600021,0

Three tentative results emerged from the regression analysis based on the firm balanced panel data 1998-2006. First it follows from a regression analysis that a positive relationship between size and R&D activity of the firm exists, which is non-linear however. Second the results indicate that a negative relationship between firm R&D personnel and industry concentration exists. If market concentration is a measure of competition than we can conclude that innovation is related to the competitive market structure. We arrived at the same conclusion when innovation was measured by intangible assets and competition was measured by Lerner index. Finally, our analysis concluded that although foreign firms are on average larger than domestic, a negative relationship between the foreign ownership of the firm and the number of R&D employees exists. In comparison to domestic firms, foreign firms have less R&D personnel.","[Zemplinerova, Alena] CERGE EI, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Zemplinerova, Alena] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zemplinerová, A (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Polit Veznu 7, CZ-11121 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",aln@cerge-ei.cz,"Zemplinerova, Alena/H-2948-2014","Zemplinerova, Alena/0000-0002-2440-8874",,,,,26,21,21,0,16,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Our findings suggest that block ownership is detrimental to the firm's market liquidity because of its adverse impact on trading activity-a real friction effect. After controlling for this real friction effect, we find little evidence that block ownership has a negative impact on informational friction.

Three major factors that underlie the usual discontinuity effect are reduced in the stochastic environment: greed, fear, and persuasion power. Two group mechanisms are proposed to explain the reversed discontinuity effect: the motivation to avoid guilt and blame when making decisions that affect others' welfare, and the social pressure to conform to certain norms when one is in a group setting.","[Gong, Min] Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Baron, Jonathan] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kunreuther, Howard] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kunreuther, Howard] Wharton Risk Management & Decis Proc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA USA",Columbia University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Gong, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Ctr Res Environm Decis, 406 Schermerhorn Hall,MC 5501,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mg3030@columbia.edu; baron@psych.upenn.edu; Kunreuther@wharton.upenn.edu,"Baron, Jonathan9/AAI-1488-2019","Baron, Jonathan9/0000-0003-1001-9947",,,,,40,27,34,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

In particular, the model predicts global return chasing (positive co-movement of US investors' net purchases with returns in many countries) which we show to be present in the data. Return chasing in our model can be due to superior performance of US investors, not inferior knowledge or naive trend-following. We also show that trades due to private information are strongly correlated across countries. A common (global) factor accounts for about half their variation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We show that these expectations measures have predictive power for consumer price index (CPI) inflation. They are better predictors of CPI inflation than household survey responses and more highly correlated with professional inflation forecasts, except for highly educated consumers, consistent with the view that more educated consumers are better able to articulate their expectations. We also document that households' inflation expectations respond to inflation news, as measured by the unpredictable component of inflation predictions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters. The response to inflation news tends to increase with households' level of education, consistent with the existence of constraints on household's ability to process this information.","[Inoue, Atsushi] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kiraz, Fatma Burcu] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; North Carolina State University,"Inoue, A (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",atsushi@unity.ncsu.edu; lkilian@umich.edu; fatmakiraz@yahoo.com,,,,,,,31,12,15,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Finally, budget deficits, government effectiveness, productivity and happiness appear unrelated to direct democracy. Institutional detail thus matters a great deal.

We collect supplementary data of two kinds for all couples (with or without children) in the survey. The first set of additional information is that respondents report on the intra-household allocation of each item of expenditure recorded in the diary. The allowed assignments are 'the whole family', 'the wife', 'the husband', 'the children', 'others' and 'not assignable'. The second addition is an extra set of 'sociological' questions concerning household financial management, autonomy and family background. We focus on the survey design and give some descriptive statistics from the survey. We also show how the distribution of expenditure on clothing, which is often used to look at intra-household allocation, is related to the distribution of expenditure on other goods.

Therefore, we have conducted our analyses on 1, 016 petroleum filling stations for the year 2005. For the following year, we have also obtained data of closed down stations due to business failure. We have conducted our analyses through binary logistic estimations and justified our model through Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Firstly, our results showed that the probability of petroleum filling stations to business failure was positively associated with being located in the southeastern part of Turkey, not having a large supermarket operating within the station, having protested bills and bad debts. Furthermore, likelihood of bankruptcy for the stations is adversely related with, serving vehicles working on LPG, being an acquired station, having canopy, having higher percentage of cash purchases and being located in the northwestern region of Turkey.","[Karan, Mehmet Baha; Arslan, Oezguer; Alatli, Murat] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Karan, MB (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",mbkaran@hacettepe.edu.tr; arslan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"KARAN, MEHMET BAHA/I-8458-2013",,,,,,18,2,2,0,7,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We find that there was a positive effect of being affiliated with a top 25 university in the 1970s; this effect weakened in the 1980s and disappeared in the 1990s. The decline in elite university fixed effect is due to the reduced importance of physical access to productive research colleagues, which in turn seems due to innovations in communication technology. One implication is that knowledge-based organizations should find it more difficult to capture rents vis-a-vis workers. We find that faculty salaries increased the most where the estimated spillover dropped the most. Despite the loss in local spillovers, elite universities still enjoy an edge in average productivity because of agglomeration of top researchers in prestigious institutions with high long-term research reputations.

Value pricing involves dividing a highway into free and priced lanes so that in equilibrium the highway effectively operates at two levels of service, with those users placing a higher value on travel time savings selecting the faster, priced route. A tractable analytical framework is developed which allows analysis of equilibrium and welfare on value priced highways when users vary in their value of time. The model is used to characterize optimal toll and capacity policies, as well as investigate the fiscal implications of value pricing. The analysis concludes with results on how welfare changes induced by value pricing are distributed over the population of users when the government finances any funding shortfall through a non-discriminatory taxing mechanism. A realistic numeric example is used to illustrate how the model can be applied to evaluation of actual and proposed value pricing implementations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A model is developed in which both housing and financial assets can be used as vehicles for household saving. Individuals face perfect capital markets and choose between owner-occupied and rented accommodations. For the model developed, it is shown that the tax advantage of owner-occupied housing is not fully removed even if imputed rents are subject to income taxation. However, deferred income taxation for both housing and savings in the form of financial assets Would result in an equal treatment of tenants and owner-occupiers. (C)) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

If labor and capital can move between jurisdictions, then attempts to tax these factors will lead to a vanishing taxpayer as factors flee from high-to low-tax regions. More broadly, globalization suggests that there will be some convergence in tax rates across countries. This paper questions this view by examining the impact of globalization on taxation using a two-country, two-factor, two-good model. In particular, we ask how globalization, measured by increased international factor mobility, affects the ability of governments to tax factors. Our quantitative analysis indicates that, while increased mobility reduces revenues to some extent, governments still retain significant ability to collect taxes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This paper derives optimal monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty about the true size of the cost channel. In a min-max approach, the central bank derives an optimal policy plan to be implemented by a Taylor rule. It is shown that uncertainty about the cost channel leads to an attenuated interest rate setting behavior. In this respect, the Brainard (1967) principle of cautious policy in the face of uncertainty continues to hold in both a Bayesian and a min-max framework.","Swiss Natl Bank, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Borsenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",peter.tillmann@snb.ch,,,,,,,41,26,27,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In Chile's new system, the disability assessment procedure includes participation by private pension funds (AFPs) and insurance companies, who finance the benefit, have a direct pecuniary interest in controlling costs and are able to pursue this objective by helping to set criteria and providing countervailing information. We hypothesize that these procedures and incentives will keep costs low, by cutting the incidence of successful claims. Using the Cox proportional hazard model and a retrospective sample of new and old-system affiliates (EPS, 2002), we find that disability hazard rates are only 20-35% as high in the new system as in the old traditional system.

In an attempt to bridge this gap, the present study investigated both constructive and destructive deviance at work and their relationship to employee personality. Using 89 hi-tech employees, constructive and destructive (interpersonal and organizational) deviance were regressed on the big-five factors of personality. Findings show that neuroticism and agreeableness were related to both types of constructive deviance, whereas conscientiousness was associated with both types of destructive deviance. Moreover, agreeableness was connected to interpersonal destructive deviance, whereas openness to experience was connected to organizational constructive deviance.

We liken the guarantee's value to that of a European-style contingent claims portfolio. The main feature emerging from our model is that a mutual guarantee system would give banks an adverse incentive to increase riskiness. To mitigate this incentive, we introduce a regulatory provision modelled using a path-dependent contingent claim. By comparing the mutual guarantee system with a non-mutual one, we show that the former is less expensive, but implies higher adverse incentives for the banks, especially for undercapitalized institutions.

The evidence indicates that the market tends to under-react to the insider trading information and insiders tend to be information-motivated traders.

In general, level playing fields impose the standards of the weakest regulator upon the best-regulated economies. However, they may be desirable when capital is mobile because they counter a cherry-picking effect that lowers the size and efficiency of banks in weaker economies. Hence, while a laissez faire policy favors the better-regulated economy, level playing fields are good for weaker regulators.

The present research focused on how to preclude one such pitfall, overvaluation of a focal environmental entity, in light of the psychological processes that have been recently shown to underlie this bias. Analysis of a survey of respondents' valuations of environmental entities demonstrated focal entity overvaluation, and that specifying alternatives to a focal entity was not sufficient to preclude positive bias. Only when respondents were required to provide valuations of multiple entities were Much more moderate, less biased, valuations obtained. The implication of this research is that when the value of an environmental entity is assessed, respondents should be asked to provide valuations of the target entity as well as other intra-category alternatives so that positive bias is ameliorated.

A method is discussed to determine, for a Marshallian demand function, equivalent variation in case of a block price system. The method is applied to compare, for the Metropolitan Region of SA o pound Paulo, alternative pricing policies on the basis of their demand, welfare and distribution effects of changing water prices. Results show that there is a trade off between average welfare and income distribution. A pro-poor price system may result in lower average welfare than a flat price system, but in higher individual welfare for the poor. Moreover, there is a trade off between revenues for the water company and income distribution. Even though pro-poor price systems may not be as good for average welfare as flat price systems, their direct effects on poverty are important. Introducing pro-poor price systems, however, may have financial consequences for the water companies.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Ruijs, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",arjan.ruijs@wur.nl,,,,,,,39,26,34,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our analysis focuses on the willingness to pay for anti-missile laser jamming countermeasures mounted on commercial aircraft compared with two other policies as well as the prospect of remaining with the status quo. Our findings are based a stated preference conjoint survey conducted in 2006 and administered to a sample from Knowledge Networks' national internet panel. The estimates range from $100 to $220 annually per household. Von Winterfeldt and O'Sullivan's (2006) analysis of the same laser jamming plan suggests that the countermeasures would be preferred if economic losses are above $74 billion, the probability of attack is larger than 0.37 in 10 years, and if the cost of the measures is less than about $14 billion. Our results imply that, using the most conservative of our estimates, a program with a cost consistent with their thresholds would yield significant aggregate net benefits.","[Smith, V.

This paper attempts to contribute to our understanding of how institutions matter by examining the effect of formal and informal institutional arrangements on economic progress. Formal institutions represent government defined and enforced constraints while informal institutions capture private constraints. The findings suggest that the presence of informal institutions is a strong determinant of development. In contrast, formal institutions are only successful when embedded in informal constraints, and codifying informal rules can lead to negative unintended consequences. This suggests that institutions cannot be easily transplanted in order to spur economic development.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Williamson, CR (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",williamsoncr@appstate.edu,,,,,,,40,206,240,2,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2009,139.0,3-4,,,,,371,387,,10.1007/s11127-009-9399-x,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,442FV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265827100008,0

Creditors demand and managers consent to a more restrictive Payout policy as a substitute for weak creditor rights in an effort to minimize the firm's agency costs of debt. Using a sample of 120,507 firm-years from 52 countries, we find that both the probability and amount of dividend payouts are significantly lower in countries with poor creditor rights. A reduction in the creditor rights index from its highest value to its lowest value implies a 41% reduction in the probability of paying a dividend, and a 60% reduction in dividend payout ratios. These results are robust to numerous control variables, sample variations, model specifications, and alternative hypotheses. We also show that the agency costs of debt play a more decisive role in determining dividend policies than the previously documented agency costs of equity. Overall, our findings contribute to the growing literature arguing that creditors exert significant influence over corporate decision-making outside of bankruptcy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In our model, agents' decision making may incorporate both risk and ambiguity, and we demonstrate that nonparticipation arises from the rational decision by some traders to avoid ambiguity. In equilibrium, these participation decisions affect the equilibrium risk premium, and distort market performance when viewed from the perspective of traditional asset pricing models. We demonstrate how regulation, particularly regulation of unlikely events, can moderate the effects of ambiguity, thereby increasing participation and generating welfare gains. Our analysis demonstrates how legal systems affect participation in financial markets through their influence on ambiguity.","[Easley, David] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [O'Hara, Maureen] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Easley, D (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",dae3@cornell.edu,,,,,,,42,136,161,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

By using this model in analyzing the networkability of cities, the connectivity of the air routes was estimated, using the air traffic and the number of air routes. Networkability is the quantitative measurement of the spatial interaction relationships in the international air network. Through this process, this study aims to analyze the structural changes of the global network in 1992 and 2004. As a result, it was observed that London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and New York were class 1 cities that were at the top in both years. Tokyo was included in class I in 1992, but not in 2004. Rome, Zurich, Singapore, Los Angeles, and other cities were identified as the class 2 cities in 1992, while Singapore, Tokyo, Madrid, Hong Kong, Bangkok, etc. were identified as the class 2 cities in 2004. These cities occupy the center of the global network, and the class 1 cities are connected to the class 2 cities, which perform the function of hubs in each continent, thus uniting the whole world as one network.

Larger incentive management fees lead to less counter-cyclical or more pro-cyclical volatility timing. But fund styles or aggregate fund flows could also account for this relation; therefore, we control for them and find that the relation between fees and volatility timing still holds. Results show that less aggressive fund styles are associated with pro-cyclical volatility timing, and that volatility timing and flow timing are negatively related. We also find that pro-cyclical timing mostly improves funds' average excess returns, Sharpe ratios, and alphas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal harvest rate is shown to fluctuate, but the cycle of the harvest rate lags the cycle of the biological growth function with the highest harvest rate occurring after biological conditions start to decline. Simulations contrast various fishing policies and illustrate the proclivity to crash a fishery if it is wrongfully managed as if there is a constant growth rate with i.i.d. environmental shocks.

Stochastic frontier analysis is applied to a unique Finnish data set. Manager age and education have strong yet complicated effects on efficiency. The impact of age on efficiency depends on education. A university degree is useful mainly in the largest banks of the sample. Educational background seems to be less important for young managers than for mature ones. Managing director changes are systematically followed by efficiency changes. Retirement typically causes an efficiency improvement whereas other manager changes can either improve or weaken efficiency. However, in many cases mature managers outperform their young colleagues.

The empirical literature points to rising per capita income as a primary determinant of rising motor vehicle use, known as motorization. This analysis of commuter car/bus mode choice shows that in addition to rising income, other factors may drive rising car use at the urban level. First, greater income inequality increases car use if car use is still low, and reduces car use if it is already high. Second, traffic congestion hinders buses more than cars. causing positive feedback between car use and travel time that reduces bus use and contributes to its abrupt collapse. Third, policy interventions to reduce congestion in urban areas, such as tolling car use and reserving lanes for buses, increase consumer surplus by maintaining bus service as an alternate travel mode, even as incomes rise. Socially optimal reserved bus lanes may achieve most of the gains from a socially optimal toll on car use. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Our first result demonstrates that the preferred tax rate chosen by the local government is positively affected by the magnitude of fiscal decentralization. The second result shows that the fiscal equalization policies of the central government have no influence on the speed of interregional growth convergence. Furthermore, the normative implication is obtained from our final results that there exists an optimal degree of fiscal decentralization to reach the central government's goal of growth maximization, but the magnitude of fiscal decentralization chosen by the central government is excessive to entail the highest regional welfare.","[Ogawa, Hikaru] Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Yakita, S (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Furocho Chikusaku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",ogawa@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,30,10,11,1,20,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2009,65.0,1,,,,,122,140,,10.1628/001522109X444198,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,457BA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266898600008,0

Local zoning and other forms of land use regulation are believed to contribute to increased housing prices by reducing supply and increasing the size of new housing. Suburban restrictions on rental housing are particularly likely to reduce mobility for low-income families. In this paper, I employ an instrumental variables approach to examine the effects of zoning on the quantity and price of rental housing in Massachusetts, using historical municipal characteristics to instrument for cur-rent regulations. Results suggest that communities with more restrictive zoning issue significantly fewer building permits for multifamily housing but provide only weak evidence of the effects of regulations on rents. The lack of effects on rents may reflect the low level of multifamily development, while analysis is complicated by development of subsidized housing under the state affordable housing law.

We find a positive and statistically significant correlation between wages and occupational fatality risk. The estimated effect is largest for unskilled workers. Unemployment reduces compensation for risk, which suggests that some of the assumptions under which compensating wage differentials can be interpreted as measures of workers' preferences for risk and income are invalid when unemployment is high. Workers may be unwilling to quit high-risk jobs when alternative employment is difficult to obtain, violating the assumption of perfect mobility, or some workers (e.g., new migrants) may be poorly informed about between-job differences in risk, violating the assumption of perfect information. These factors suggest our estimates of the value per statistical life (VSL) in China, which range from approximately US$30,000 to US$100,000, may be biased downward. Alternative estimates adjust for heterogeneity of risk within industry by assuming that risk is concentrated among low-skill workers. These estimates, which are likely to be biased downward, range from US$7,000 to US$20,000.","[Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Guo, Xiaoqi] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Harvard University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hammitt, JK (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, 718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jkh@harvard.edu,,,,,,,30,21,25,3,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In this model, entry causes crowding in variety space, so that the marginal utility of new varieties falls as market size grows. Crowding is partially offset by income effects, as richer consumers will pay more for varieties closer matched to their ideal types. We show theoretically and confirm empirically that declining marginal utility of new varieties results in: a higher own-price elasticity of demand (and lower prices) in large countries and a lower own-price elasticity of demand (and higher prices) in rich countries. The model is also useful for generating facts from the literature regarding cross-country differences in the rate of variety expansion.","[Hummels, David] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Lugovskyy, Volodymyr] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Hummels, D (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",hummelsd@purdue.edu; volodymyr.lugovskyy@econ.gatech.edu,,"Hummels, David/0000-0002-0280-8260",,,,,30,37,41,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze traditional trades/professions from rural areas in order to surprise these interconnections with environmental factors, economic aspects and local community. Traditional trades can be looked at from many points of view. First of them and the oldest one is the economic point of view. Employed populations in traditional fields are insuring a source of income and contribute to a raise of local wellbeing. The second aspect is bound by the attraction possibility of tourists in the area through the angle of these original activities, which are ever rarer due to the economic progress and competition. A third aspect, under which we are going to follow the trades, is referring to the development of the feeling of pride and community belonging, the maintaining of youth in the locality, at valuating the customs and folk traditions as a first step towards the perpetuation of these in the future. Last but not least we will analyze the connections between traditional trades and the natural framework as well as the impact of the above mentioned on the environment.","[Puiu, Nistoreanu; Ovidiu, Tanase Mihai] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Liliana, Nicodim] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Ovidius University,"Puiu, N (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",puiunistoreanu@yahoo.it; nicodimlili@yahoo.com; tanase_mihai_ovidiu@yahoo.com,"Liliana, Nicodim/AAB-5930-2021; Puiu, Nistoreanu/C-1021-2009; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu/Q-2955-2016; Nistoreanu, Puiu V/G-1735-2010","Puiu, Nistoreanu/0000-0002-8369-7899; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu/0000-0002-7101-2485;",,,,,9,1,1,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2009,11.0,25,,,,,61,68,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,437LN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265489100007,0

Our instruments for founder-CEO status are the proportion of the firm's founders that are dead and the number of people who founded the company. We find strong evidence that founder-CEO status is endogenous in performance regressions and that good performance makes it less likely that the founder retains the CEO title. After factoring out the effect of performance on founder-CEO status, we identify a positive causal effect of founder-CEOs on firm performance that is quantitatively larger than the effect estimated through standard OLS regressions. We also find that founder-CEOs are more likely to relinquish the CEO post after periods of either unusually low or unusually high operating performances. All in all, the results in this paper are consistent with a largely positive view of founder control in large US corporations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that this governance system and an ability to protect the common assets from infringement by outsiders are necessary for the success of these solutions.

Today, in the environment of globalisation, they are often seen as symbols of the economic and financial strength of economic areas in an international context. Globalization and integration (which influence each other) substantially change economic relations: They increase trade and factor mobility between regions thereby fostering interregional competition and affecting the interregional division of labour. The process of financial globalization has brought a massive change in the economic landscape of all countries across the globe. The international role of currencies is measured by the share in global markets, in particular, in debt securities markets, international loan and deposit markets, foreign exchange markets, and international trade. The concept of the global roles of currencies combines the domestic and international (cross-border) use of currencies and therefore captures the overall importance of different currencies in a globalized economy. The measure of a currency's global role is based on the size and stage of development of the underlying economy, as well as the size and stage of development of its financial markets and the scope of financial instruments available in this currency. The quantitative results show, that the dollar is still the dominant global currency, followed by the euro. However, in comparison with the measurement based on the international debt market the yen and pound sterling switched ranks and a slightly larger global role is attributed to the yen.","[Bednarova, Pavla] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,pavla.bednarova@tul.cz,"Bednářová, Pavla/HLP-4977-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,42,51,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000004,0

Policy-makers try to use tight fiscal policy based on high primary surplus to stabilize the economy. This study analyzes the composition of the budget, an indicator for the quality of fiscal policy and the persistence of the adjustments using ARFIMA methodology using monthly data for the period 1994:1 to 2005:11. Our results suggest that fiscal policy implemented in Turkey does not have a high quality due to the composition of expenditures. Although government is successful in cutting personnel expenditures, the results suggest that it did not implement these cuts with persistence. Moreover, decreasing transfer expenditures and a high share in expenditures were not pursued with persistence either. On the other hand, decreasing investment after 2000 both decreases the quality of the fiscal policy and has a future growth cost.","[Ozdemir, Zeynel Abidin] Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey; [Dincer, N.

CRM and MO imply influence on the company results. In spite of a systematic interest in MO and CRM since the eighties, there has been practically no attention paid to the interconnection between them. This study carries out some important interrelations between market orientation and customer relationship management. It links the general point of view, supported by a literature search, and the exploratory point of view ascertained in high-tech companies in the Czech Republic. The factual links between CRM and MO result from data obtained by a research project supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GA CR). The research project No. 402/07/1493 named 'Research on implementation of market orientation in high-tech firms' is led by Doc. Ing. Vladimir Chalupsky, CSc., MBA. This study uses the data from above mentioned research, but it examines a different topic (relations between CRM and MO). It is generally agreed that CRM should be understood as management philosophy, accepted by everyone in the company, and that CRM should not be simply understood as software. The concept of CRM is defined as organizing an active relationship with a customer, but there are evidences that customer relationship management is not only about customers, it is also about employees, suppliers and other interested parties. CRM is trying to achieve a competitive advantage, therefore, competition analyses need to be developed. This is the same as in the market orientation. The results show that CRM and MO have many identical bases. In addition, more CRM principles were founded in market oriented high-tech companies than in the others.","[Frejkova, Daniela] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,danielafrejkova@seznam.cz,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,94,102,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000010,0

In theory, the solution to this problem is innovation. Although most enterprises promoted technological innovation activities, they could not get out of the corner of product homogeneity. The primary reason is these enterprises simply and unilaterally focused on technological innovation, but neglected management innovation. Due to the decreasing influence of the dominant factor In modern technology structure, it facilitated the transmission and migration of technology and the foreseeability of technology development led enterprises in the same industry ended up in the same way. Technological innovation is both a high-input and high-risk activity, so overemphasis on technological innovation may make these enterprises ignore the demand of consumers, and even cause the deficiency of market competitiveness. Therefore, enterprises should break through the limitation of pure technological innovation and pay more attention to management innovation so that the two parts can reach an organic combination.","[Gao, Jian-bin] Jianggangshan Univ, Commercial Coll, Jian 343009, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",,,shgaojianbin@sohu.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,AMERICAN SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9798471-5-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,144,148,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNT76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275501800031,0

The recent expansion of corn-based bio-fuels industry has further strengthened the relationship between the two said markets. The objective of this study is to examine the interrelationship between oil, bio-fuels and corn prices. Design/methodology/approach- We use Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test and stochastic co-integration model to measure the volatilities of oil, bio-fuels and corn prices and use error correction model as well as short run Granger causality test to analyze the pass-through of these three variables comparatively. Findings- The results show that long-term co-integration among these three markets is prominent, and the ethanol price volatility has absolutely leading effects to oil and crop markets. Conversely, the oil price volatility has no leading effects to the ethanol markets. The study also finds that the ethanol prices correlate with the corn prices in the short-term positively but they have different long-term volatility processes. Therefore, we shall take effective measures to ensure the harmonious development between energy and crop markets. Originality/value- This study examines the relationship between oil, biofuels and corn markets.

We do this using a Markov-switching model that relies on historical patterns of BIF disbursements to define the probability of switching among three states of the banking industry's financial health. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed to project the financial condition of the BIF over a 50-year period. Our results indicate that the insolvency risk to the bank insurance fund has increased significantly due to industry consolidation, and is mainly due to the concentration of deposits in the 10 largest U.S. banking companies. We also find that recent deposit insurance reforms will cause only a marginal reduction in the risk of BIF insolvency. The increased risk associated with a more concentrated industry structure simply dominates the reform effect.

A planning system that directly takes into account environmental and socio-economic considerations in selecting alternative routes facilitates sustainable development. This paper presents a holistic and coherent spatial multi-criteria network analysis method for the generation of optimal routing alternatives under different policy visions, in a network of existing roads. The presented methodology was case-tested for the highly contested 340 km portion of the Via Baltica corridor in Poland, a part of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) program. The methodology shows its ability to serve as a versatile effect-based decision support system for transport route planning at a strategically higher level of planning, particularly for (geographically) large-scale investment schemes.

To overcome this obstacle the visual recurrence analysis is applied in this article. This method enables visualization of the state space reconstructed from a time series in the so called recurrent plot. Further, it quantifies various geometric structures occurred in recurrent plots and gives us more exact information about the nature of the undertying process generating the time series.

Customers and consumers create a special relationship to the mark. There are different models of the evolution of the concept of branding. Corporate brand as a concept implies a coordinated portfolio of marks. The practice of marketing is based on product quality, development of trademarks and a creation of a brand. Contemporary practice of marketing starts with the creation of brands which are given characteristics of trademarks and products. Brand, in general, expresses a mission and values that the company nurtures, and must be incorporated in the vision of the company. Starting point for building a brand is a belief that must realistically indicate the value related to the client.

This model was tested empirically for the Blantyre Shire Highlands using evidence from a panel survey and household case studies. Results showed no significant relationship between the supply of hired labour (ganyu) and the timeliness of weeding for maize, and that timely weeding was not a significant determinant of household maize deficits. This puzzle is explained by the diversification of the rural economy that has allowed households to develop alternative livelihood strategies to cope with maize deficits. Livelihood diversity helped poor households avoid the seasonal poverty trap and also helps explain the paradox of why the poorest region in Malawi escaped the 2001-2002 famine.","[Orr, Alastair] Nat Resources Inst, Kent, OH USA; [Saiti-Chitsonga, Donata] Kadale Consultants, Blantyre, Malawi; [Orr, Alastair] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England; [Mwale, Blessings] World Food Programme, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Saiti-Chitsonga, Donata] Kadale Consultants, Blantyre, Malawi",University of Greenwich,"Orr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Cent Ave, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England.",A.W.Orr@gre.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,24,30,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The purpose is to highlight the complexity of pathways to agricultural transformation associated with the seemingly simple idea of home-grown school feeding (HGSF), an idea that is increasingly held up as win-win. By reviewing the HGSF literature and the main theories underpinning it - structured demand, localism, family farmer development - we expose areas of inconsistency across the literature and programmes as well as possible tensions that may arise in attempting to pursue both market and social objectives in the same initiative. The arguments presented herein aim to provide a basis for moving towards clarity on (1) a theory of change for HGSF programmes; (2) the conditions under which HGSF programmes are more able to yield positive agricultural development outcomes and; (3) an agenda for moving forward on research and impact evaluation. This research agenda also speaks more broadly to important under-researched areas within the general social protection and agricultural development discourse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A cost difference approach for estimating a money-time threshold,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Money; Time; Thrifty Food Plan,POVERTY,"Food production at home requires money and time. Food assistance programs focus exclusively on the money cost, while ignoring the time cost. This one-dimensional focus could undermine the effectiveness of food assistance programs. In the spirit of Vickery (1977), this paper uses a cost difference approach to develop a money-time threshold, and several related metrics, to determine whether money or time is the most limiting resource in reaching the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) target. In our empirical analysis we find that when time is ignored, single headed households spend on average 35% more than required to meet the TFP target. However, when time is included, these households spend on average 40% less than required to meet the TFP target. In addition, we find that when time is ignored, 62% of single headed households on average spend enough money to reach the TFP target, but when time is included, only 13% of single headed households spend enough on average to reach the TFP target. Our empirical results suggest that time is more constraining than money in reaching the TFP target. These results imply that metrics solely focusing on money could severely underestimate the gap between actual expenditures and those required to reach the TFP target. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This article seeks to deepen our understanding of the concerns that may underlie negative attitudes to various kinds of risk reduction strategy in meat production, with the aim of distinguishing between forms of risk reduction in terms of their acceptability. The paper reports the result of a focus-group study. Six focus groups with Danish citizens (N: 5-9) were conducted during May 2006. The design of the groups took a bottom-up approach and included elements of meat quality, meat safety and risk reduction strategies. The study shows the dilemma risk reduction presents to members of the public. On the one hand, people want safe meat: on the other, the study showed that with the exception of hygiene practices, people generally have an aversion to risk reduction strategies. Some variation was found, however, in the rejection of the strategies. Thus, more acceptable strategies are characterised by a low degree of technological interference, and by being close to the consumer's experience in everyday life and/or familiar to the participants' picture of meat production. It is also important that the strategy does not alter the quality of the end-product (meat) in an unfavourable way. The implications of the results and the inherent dilemma for meat safety policy formation are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time it suffers from stubbornly high levels of child malnutrition against which only very slow progress has been made. This paper investigates the relationship between international migration and child malnutrition, using data from a recent nationally representative household survey. There are theoretical reasons to expect that migration may be exerting both positive and negative effects on nutrition and food security, so that understanding what the net effect may be is essentially an empirical question. Our results indicate that migration appears to be playing a positive role in enhancing child growth patterns (as measured by height-for-age z-scores) in the country. We explore some of the possible channels through which this effect might be operating and find that one such channel is by increasing households' kilocalorie consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studies how the overweight and underweight status of the rural children is associated with the out migration of others in their household. We find that migration is related to different nutritional outcomes for the left-behind children. The older children (aged 7-12) are more likely to be underweight; the younger (aged 2-6) are less likely to be overweight if left behind without the care of a grandparent.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new perspective in considering the impact of wars on relative wages in the food sector. We define the foodcost as the share of wages paid to the food sector versus total manufacturing wages. We try to estimate the effect of two types of wars (namely, civil and international wars) on the foodcost and explore the policies that are likely to reduce that cost. We use panel data for 41 countries from 1960 to 1999 to answer these questions. The empirical results show that civil wars positively affect the foodcost, while international wars apparently do not. The policy implication of this analysis is that, in the event of a civil war, policy-makers lack the resources to exert control on a rising foodcost. A rise in the foodcost could be translated into higher food prices or lower purchasing power over food, either of which may have devastating impacts on social and economic well-being. In the event of an international war, as opposed to a civil war, governments have a greater capacity to prioritize and mobilize resources. Therefore, the impact of an international war on the foodcost is positive but weak. The foreign aid remains an effective countervailing tool for reducing the increase in the foodcost.

The empirical results show that price volatility and feed price are important risk factors in the supply response function, while the negative asymmetric price volatility that was detected implies that producers have a weak market position.

Typical policy responses include increased food aid flows, government commercial imports and stock releases, and tight controls on private sector trade. This paper examines recent evidence from Zambia, using a simple economic model to assess the likely impact of maize production shocks on the domestic maize price and on staple food consumption under alternative policy regimes. In addition to an array of public policy instruments, the analysis evaluates the impact of two key private sector responses in moderating food consumption volatility - private cross-border maize trade and consumer substitution of an alternate food staple (cassava) for maize. The analysis suggests that, given a favorable policy environment, private imports and increased cassava consumption together could fill roughly two-thirds of the maize consumption shortfall facing vulnerable households during drought years.

But the gains in food production came at a cost, leaving a significant environmental footprint on the ecosystem. Global cropland, plantations and pastures expanded, with large increases in fossil energy, water, and fertilizer inputs, imprinting considerable footprint on the environment. Information from pre eminent publications such as Nature, Science, PNAS and scholarly journals is synthesized to assess the water and energy footprints of global food production. The data show that the footprints are significant, both locally, national and globally and have consequences for global food security and ecosystem health and productivity. The literature nearly agrees that global food production system generates considerable environmental footprints and the situation would likely get worrisome, as global population grows by 50% by 2050.

As a result they are rarely considered in poverty reduction programmes and rural development planning. In this paper, we investigate the dual role of fish as a food and cash crop through data collected in river fisheries in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Fishing in this very remote rural region of DRC is operated both by men and women, as part of a household multiple activity livelihood strategy. The data shows that poor households rely heavily on fishing for their supply of protein-rich food, in particular through women's subsistence catches. Fishing also appears to be the main source of cash-income for the majority of households, including local farmers. Based on these findings and a review of the literature, the paper argues that small-scale fisheries can play a fundamental role in local economies, especially in remote rural areas where they strengthen significantly the livelihoods of people through their role in both food security and cash-income generation.

One farmers' group in south-western Uganda has successfully sustained sales of potatoes to a fast-food outlet in Kampala. Farmers had to learn a series of new skills and integrate multiple technical, organizational, financial and marketing innovations.

Iron supplementation is not popular for long-term use, and cereal fortification is not feasible where milling occurs locally. Double-fortified salt (DFS: using both iron and iodine) is an alternative. The study undertakes a literature survey to find the effect of DFS on hemoglobin, and then uses a previous algorithm to make calculations for India. The benefit:cost ratio was estimated as 2.4:1 if only the benefits to children and women were included, and between 4:1 and 5:1 if anemia levels for men also decreased. This is just a little lower than the median ratio estimated for iron fortification of cereal staples (6.7:1), for home fortification for children less than two (37:1), and for biofortification - breeding for high iron - of cereals (high, but no exact figure available). Double-fortified salt is therefore a good alternative for improving iron status in populations where fortification of other staple foods does not achieve desired coverage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The NSLP provides states with both cash and commodity foods for school meals. This research assessed the success of the school commodity program by comparing states' available annual funding to the value of foods that states actually received from 2001 to 2009. Results indicate that an in-kind food funding system is not desirable for schools; states failed to receive entitled commodity food value in most years, resulting in annual funding losses for schools of $35-87 million. Inconsistent funding inhibits schools' ability to improve meals and, ultimately, child nutrition outcomes. In light of these results, it is recommended that a cash benefit should replace the National School Lunch Program's commodity food program. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology is supported by non-patent citations (NPCs) as an indicator of the extent to which scientific knowledge is used to support the development of patented technologies in the agrifood sector. The data suggest that scientific citations in patent documents are geographically more concentrated than patents, and that scientific citations are more common for agrifood products and chemical products than for agrifood machinery. Our econometric results show that internal factors related to the characteristics of technologies and firms, along with collaboration with a public research institution, are relevant factors that contribute to explaining the use of scientific knowledge by agrifood firms.

The price response behaviour of traders is found to be consistent with an asymmetric price adjustment mechanism, indicating coarse rice prices in Nepal respond to shocks originating in India. The results show that adjustments to negative price deviations from long-run stable equilibrium are faster than adjustments to the positive ones given a null threshold. Given that trade flows mainly from India to Nepal, Nepali traders would adjust their prices upward to align with the long-run equilibrium value relatively more quickly in the case of negative price deviations, than if the price deviations were positive. Such a high speed of adjustment to negative price deviations could be detrimental to net food buyers' food security status in the absence of a price stabilization mechanism. However, a price stabilization policy in Nepal, a food deficit and import dependent country, would hardly have any effect on prices unless further effort is made to build up the level of national food reserves for short-term food security interventions. In the current context of structurally low levels of national food reserves, an alternative short-term policy such as foreign aid, in the form of food or income transfers, targeting the most vulnerable households to price increases is necessary through social safety net programmes. In the long-run, an improvement of transportation infrastructure between market hubs (other than the Biratnagar trade basin) in the Terai (Nepal) and India would contribute to the reduction of transaction costs and create incentives for more competition in formal cross-border trade with India. In times of negative shocks such as the high food price crisis in 2008, restrictive food trade policies in India will continue to undermine household food security in Nepal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Qualitative evidence on dairy companies' assistance programs was gathered in the first stage through in-depth interviews at the level of the dairy companies. Quantitative data on 290 milk producing rural households in Poland was collected through a random survey in the second stage. The empirical analysis shows that dairy companies have played an important role in financial assistance, in particular for dairy-specific investments.

Given the finite resources allocated for emergency response, and the expected increase in incidences of humanitarian catastrophe due to changing climate patterns, there is a need for rigorous and efficient methods of early warning and emergency needs assessment. In this paper we develop an empirical model, based on a relatively parsimonious set of regularly measured variables from communities in Kenya's and north, that generates remarkably accurate forecasts of the likelihood of famine with at least 3 months lead time. Such a forecasting model is a potentially valuable tool for enhancing early warning capacity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A smaller number of the older in comparison to the younger consumed probiotic yoghurt drinks (OR = 0.48), foods with added vitamins and/or minerals (OR = 0.31), energy drinks (OR = 0.05) at least once a week. Younger people were more likely to report that they were ready to increase physical activity (OR = 0.21), cut down on or stop smoking (OR = 0.48) or drink less alcohol (OR = 0.46), but more of them would prefer to take medicines than food-related intervention (OR = 3.05).

Integration technology based on the use of agricultural by-products as fishpond inputs was the driver for intensification. Over all farms, fishpond productivity increased from 498 kg to 1609 kg fish/ha (2145 kg/ha/yr). During the project period, the number of active fish farmers increased from 15 to 192 (including 55 farms which participated only through information exchange). Over all farms, net returns from aquaculture increased by 5 times over pre-project levels. Productivity, intensity and profitability increased more significantly in periurban areas with good market access, compared to rural areas. Among farmers with good market access, average net income from the aquaculture enterprise rose from $118 up to $1485. Research-Extension Team (RET) support cost an average of $61,300 per year. Over 5 years, rural farmers recaptured 23% of the relevant RET investment compared to 442% by periurban farmers. Likewise, increase in production attributable to RET intervention was higher for periurban (253%) compared to rural (11.3%) fish farmers. Within 3 years of the end of extension support, rural farmers had returned to pre-project production levels, whereas periurban farms had better maintained their productivity and profitability. Findings indicate that, in areas with little or no access to markets, the number of fishponds and fish farmers can be increased and yields improved, increasing local food supplies, but sustainability in the absence of extension subsidies is questionable. To achieve either of the two principal goals for the sector, food security and/or poverty alleviation, investments need to be made in improving the availability of quality technical assistance to targeted farmers and finding means of reducing social conflict arising from perceived inequalities in the accrual of the benefits of development.

Method: A relatively simple and quick macro-simulation methodology was developed. Logic models were developed by local stakeholders and used to identify costs and dietary impacts of policy changes. Costs were confined to government costs, and excluded cost offsets. The best available evidence was combined with local data to model impacts on deaths from noncommunicable diseases over the lifetime of the target population. Given that the modelling necessarily entailed assumptions to compensate for gaps in data and evidence, use was made of probabilistic uncertainty analysis. Results: Costs of implementing policy changes were generally low, with the exception of some requiring additional long-term staffing or construction activities. The most effective policy options in Fiji and Tonga targeted access to local produce and high-fat meats respectively, and were estimated to avert approximately 3% of diet-related NCD deaths in each population. Many policies had substantially lower benefits. Cost-effectiveness was higher for the low-cost policies. Similar policies produced markedly different results in the two countries. Conclusion: Despite the crudeness of the method, the consistent modelling approach used across all the options, allowed reasonable comparisons to be made between the potential policy costs and impacts. This type of modelling can be used to support more evidence-based and informed decision-making about policy interventions and facilitate greater use of policy to achieve a reduction in NCDs.

We use a DEA-based model to estimate for each policy scenario the sample farms' profit potential in both technologies. The model enables identification of a farm's optimal technology based on its input-output observations. The empirical analysis is based on the annual accounts of 1300 Bavarian dairy farms. Results indicate that approximately 69% (78%) of the organic (conventional) farms have chosen their optimal farming system. The remaining organic (conventional) farmers could increase their profit on average by roughly 6% (10%) by switching to the other technology. Abolishment of the EU milk quota results in a considerable decline in the number of sample farms for which organic farming is the optimal technology, suggesting that, ceteris paribus, organic dairy farms may lose competitive advantage with the deregulation of the EU's milk market regime in 2015. Organic maintenance payments more than double the number of farms with a higher earning potential in organic farming, but their effectiveness could decline when the milk quota is abolished.

Focus is on the value chains of fruits, vegetables and spices. A survey was conducted in Grenada, Jamaica, Fiji and Vanuatu, aimed at identifying sources of risk which are most important to value chain stakeholders; the nature and quality of existing and potential risk management mechanisms; and the possibility of enhancing them in view of improving the functioning of the value chains. The sample included farmers, processors, traders, retailers, extension agents, Government officials and private services providers. Results reveal limited ability to handle price and production variability, clue to lack of both horizontal and vertical co-ordination along value chains, reduced use of support services, notably credit and underinvestment in equipment. In addition, lack of demand contributes to make insurance markets incomplete and characterised by undersupply or lack of customised products. Promoting light forms of vertical and horizontal co-ordination, such as production contracts and producers' associations, as well as value chain-based credit and finance may address some of the issues highlighted.

A major focus of China's agricultural modernisation program has been to build high-value supply chains and large, modern agro-industrial enterprises. This paper provides a critique of these efforts in the case of the high-value beef supply chain. It finds that interventionist policies to fast-track the development of high-value supply chains have perverse outcomes and that a more incremental and facilitative approach to modernisation should be pursued based around the development of mid-value supply chains.

We find 29 cases where private importers have directly or indirectly affected policy decisions in 21 countries. Most of the cases relate irrational fear of export losses to excessively precautionary decisions. These cases are based on two generally misleading premises: the belief that Europe or Japan represents the only market for exports, and the perception that non-GM segregation is infeasible or prohibitively costly in all situations. Our study also demonstrates the importance of information asymmetries across countries and agents and the role of risk aversion in seemingly irrational decision-making. The combination of these four factors helps us explain why presumed but unproven expected commercial losses still represents a significant impediment to biosafety policymaking in developing countries.

The empirical tests on the French Farm Census confirm the value of both Resource-Based Perspective and Transaction Cost Economics in understanding organizational choices in agriculture and food markets. Because asset specificity in wine trade is low on average, large wine producers have an advantage over smaller ones and so are more likely to venture into direct sale of generic wines. By contrast smaller wine producers are more likely to rely on the bulk wine market, which is less risky for them. In addition our model helps us to understand the effect of the State-sponsored certification of grape and wine quality, the Protected Designation of Origin system. All other things being equal, producers with vineyards of high reputation (PDO) are also more likely to bottle and sell their wines; we guess this is because they wish to capture the value of the PDO reputation, the collective brand name capital owned by the farmers. Finally, saving on transaction cost is only one side of the coin: the most educated wine producers can profitably reinvest their knowledge and capabilities into new activities. These choices have important consequence on the French Wine Supply Chain governance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate that only 38% of firms remained certified, as they gained significantly from retention of EU markets, gained access to US markets, captured new buyers, and reduced product wastage. However, 62% of the initially certified firms abandoned certification, as they did not realize most of the anticipated benefits from certification and continuing certification was not economically viable. Delisting by some processors led to profit losses among their raw fish and input suppliers amounting to $4-6 million per year, representing approximately 6-9% of the value of Philippine seafood exports to the EU and mainly affecting small aquaculture fish suppliers.

Past research focussed on consumers, but paid little attention to the food industry and its gatekeepers, especially in Africa. Therefore, a survey was conducted covering 39 respondents from the milling industry and supermarkets, the main processors and distributors of maize products, in seven urban centres of Kenya. Respondents, mostly from senior management, were well educated and had a good knowledge of biotechnology. Their major sources of information were the media for the supermarkets, and brochures and the food industry for the milling companies. Respondents generally appreciated the benefits of biotechnology, but had concerns about the environment, although few people considered GM food harmful to human or animal health. Most respondents found traceability of GM products important, but would prefer not to label them because of the costs and possible negative consumer reactions. Respondents were largely non-committal on the use of GM products in their companies, preferring to decide on a case-by-case basis. The few negative responses, mostly from the milling industry, were affected by high risk and low benefit perceptions. Most respondents do not like the idea of labelling GM food. Better communication between research and the food industry is now needed, and more research on the labelling of GM products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the existence of economies of diversification, scale economies and diversification efficiencies at the farm level were examined using a stochastic input-distance function approach. The results reveal strong evidence of diversification economies amongst most crop enterprises except the combination of modern rice and modern wheat enterprises. Ray economies of scale exist in Bangladeshi cropping system. Also, significant are efficiency gains made from diversification among cropping enterprises. The key policy implication is that crop diversification should be a desired strategy for agricultural growth in Bangladesh. Development of the rural infrastructure is also essential as this will not only improve technical efficiency but may also synergistically promote crop diversification by opening up opportunities for technology diffusion, marketing, storage and resource supplies.

However the challenge remains to make these markets benefit the poor and the environment. Increasing attention is being given to the potential role markets can play for agrobiodiversity conservation through product diversification and increasing competitiveness in niche and novelty markets. Several case studies were undertaken that explore the use of market-based approaches to on-farm agrobiodiversity management and livelihood improvement. This paper explores how the theory of collective action can provide a more synthetic understanding of how market chains operate, and the changes that could permit a more equitable distribution of benefits. The case studies illustrate the need for improved trust, mutual understanding of each actor's involvement, and an agreed process of collective action with a high level of community participation.

Such claims have been challenged or dismissed by many rice scientists, however. Despite the lack of clear and unequivocal endorsement by science, SRI seems to have spread widely and rather quickly to many rice-growing regions, including various areas of India. This paper discusses how and considers why SRI seems to have attracted the support of diverse stakeholders in Indian rice farming. As such, the SRI phenomenon should be taken seriously. Nevertheless, many scientific questions remain to be answered, concerning the biophysical mechanisms involved in SRI and their effects on plant performance and crop yields, the true spread of SRI practices among farmers and the system's impacts on farm livelihoods, rice production and resource use. Indian enthusiasm for SRI implies a level of dissatisfaction with conventional approaches to rice intensification and a demand for new methods that can address the perceived problems and challenges of agriculture in the future.

Using household survey data from Malawi, we examine whether an indicator-based system is more target and cost-efficient in reaching the poor than universal systems and the currently used mechanisms for targeting agricultural subsidies in the country. Estimation results suggest that targeting Malawi's poor and smallholder farmers with indicator-based systems may be worth the extra effort and may improve program targeting and cost efficiency. Even though under the proposed system administrative costs increase, simulation results indicate that it does not make a targeted program cost-ineffective. More importantly, the proposed system appears to be more target and cost-efficient than the 2000/2001 Targeted Input Program (TIP) and the 2006/2007 Agricultural Input Support Program (AISP), both of which were administered through community-based targeting systems. While TIP and AISP transferred about 50% of total transfer, under the proposed system, about 73% of transfers are delivered to the poor and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the costs of leakage to the non-poor are cut by more than 50% under the proposed system. We conclude from the above findings that the newly proposed system can potentially improve the targeting and cost efficiency of Malawi's development programs. However, such improvements depend on actual implementation of targeted programs, a critical issue that should not be set aside. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to mitigate the global food commodity price pressure on domestic markets, several major exporting and importing countries, mostly developing economies, adopted trade policy changes such as export bans (or raising export restrictions) or reducing import tariffs during the same period. This paper estimates the potential impacts of these policies on the world prices and trade of major agricultural commodities using a set of multi-country, multi-commodity, and partial-equilibrium models. Our findings suggest that over all, the trade policy responses in various countries increased the prices of all agricultural commodities, although the impact on the total net trade varies by commodity. The simulation results show that the overall impact of trade policy distortions on the world rice price is most significant at 24%, followed by wheat (14%) and barley (9%). In general, the poorer food-deficit countries/regions, which have limited power to manipulate their trade policies, experienced higher price increases compared to those major trading countries that adopted policy interventions. Also, the developing countries that are net importers which did not implement trade policy interventions experienced significant welfare losses resulting from interventions implemented by other major trading countries.

While belonging to a cluster may have positive externalities for proximate firms, there can also be congestion economies that counterbalance these advantages. Having identified existing ham-producing establishments in the Iberian ham cluster, a sample of 265 firms was selected and it was confirmed that as the number of neighbouring firms increases performance increases. Also, the proximity to larger firms in the same province benefit smaller firms. This positive effect that geographical concentration has on performance is explained by access to valuable natural resources, workers, higher demand, knowledge spillovers, and lower transaction costs, which may help managers and policy-makers in their investment decisions, as well as contributing to the dearth of existing research and its contradictory nature.

First, there is first-mover advantage in the branding of mackerel. For instance, unlike other brands of mackerel, Seki-saba as the pioneering brand can increase its brand equity. Second, other brands have opposing effects that increase and decrease the brand equity of the pioneering brand. We find the former is strongest in the early stages of fishery branding when there are few competing brands of mackerel, while the latter becomes stronger in later stages when many other brands emerge.

However, traditional methods of impact assessment are inadequate for biofortified crops, as they do not consider their nutritional benefits. Evidence for the nutritional impact of maize varieties with improved protein quality, collectively known as quality protein maize (QPM), was evaluated using meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies in target communities. A new and generalizable effect size was proposed to quantify the impact of QPM on a key outcome, child growth. The results indicated that consumption of QPM instead of conventional maize leads to a 12%(95% CI: 7-18%) increase in the rate of growth in weight and a 9%(95% CI: 6-15%) increase in the rate of growth in height in infants and young children with mild to moderate undernutrition from populations in which maize is the major staple food.

While not new, the concept evolved remarkably in recent years. It is approached from a multitude of perspectives, and intersects with broader bodies of literature - particularly around public policy, pro-poor growth, rights, humanitarian strategies, and aid effectiveness - as well as feeding into specific programmatic issues (e.g. conditionality, targeting and transfer selection). This blend of challenges and approaches has often made debates elusive and polarized. The paper examines the evolution and definitions of social protection, and unbundles critical policy, institutional and implementation quandaries. Taken together, these considerations shape a set of context-specific models of social protection.

Using data on household grain purchases, we analyse both the impact on dietary quality and the tax incidence among income groups of VAT reforms and excise duty reforms. The VAT reforms include subsidies of healthy products (products labelled with the Swedish National Food Administration's healthy symbol) funded by increased VAT on 'less healthy' products. The excise duty reforms contain a subsidy of fibre content, funded by excise duties on either added sugar or saturated fat. Our results suggest that the VAT reforms have a similar impact on dietary quality across all income groups, with increases in fibre intake, but also unwanted increases in the intake of nutrients frequently overconsumed: fat, salt and sugar. The impact on dietary quality of the VAT reforms is therefore difficult to evaluate. With the exception of the lowest income group, the excise duty reforms seem to have a positive health effect across all other income groups, with increases in the intake of fibre and reductions in the intake of saturated fat, sugar and added sugar. For the lowest income group we find the highest increase in the intake of fibre, but generally an increase in the intake of the other nutrients, too. The excise duty reforms also result in a more energy-dense grain diet, with increases in the intake of calories for all income groups. Both the VAT reforms and the excise duty reforms appear to be progressive. The lowest income group pays less food taxes and generally faces a lower overall post-reform price level. The income group that increases its tax payments most is the one with the highest income. This is also the income group that faces the largest increase in the overall post-reform price level.

Eighty percent of chronic disease deaths occur in low and middle income countries, and a responsive food policy is an absolute necessity. In this paper we analysed three trade-related food policy initiatives to reduce the supply of fatty meat in the Pacific, in order to help public health workers understand how to effect policy change in sectors beyond the health portfolio. We found that policy uptake and implementation were easier with advocacy, tailoring the policy to the political context, the selection of policy tools that align with Government priorities (e.g. trade commitments) - ideally tools that are already used by trade policy makers in other contexts - and a broad justification for the policy initiative. Barriers to policy success included a focus only on health concerns (not taking into account policy issues of other sectors), limited engagement from other sectors in proposing and developing these cross-sectoral policies, and lack of a clear enforcement mechanism.

The objective of this research was to study how health claims affect consumers' perception of other product attributes. A survey with a total of 4612 respondents from the Nordic countries explored consumers' perceptions of attractiveness, healthiness, naturalness, tastiness and ability to reduce risk of disease by comparing ratings of products with and without health claims. Used claims varied in their benefit, active ingredient, claim structure and framing. The results showed that health claims had a moderate but mostly negative impact on the perception of other product attributes; the most significant impact was decrease in perceived naturalness. Consumers could also interpret the benefits in claims as intended. The wording of the claim had only small impact on the perception of the products, whereas earlier market presence of the ingredient had a large impact: differences among the Nordic countries reflected the previous exposure to health claims. The findings from this study suggest that consumers do not imply other health benefits from health claims and the health claim per se is not likely to cause any unrealistic positive inferences in perceived product quality.

Their example incorrectly suggests that SEACERs play an additional role of regulating non-GM crop supply on the market. This would be inefficient from a policy economics perspective, especially in an open economy where global trade is taken into account. Therefore, we argue that analyzing flexibility of SEACERs in a market framework could lead to erroneous conclusions and in that case a simple farm level analysis such as presented in Demont et al.

Vertical integration may resolve hold-up problems and here we test for the importance of vertical integration and networks on innovation. We further examine the effects of network relationships on innovation behaviour. We use data from an extensive survey of 444 Danish firms over two years, 2000 and 2005 to estimate a bootstrapped zero-inflated Poisson regression model. The first and most significant result is that organization matters. Further we find that vertical integration as well as contractual arrangements are significant determinants for firms' innovation behaviour. The direction of integration is important as well. Also, economies of size seem to play an important role. Similarly, the export orientation of the firm is a significant determinant of innovation whereas the sector the firm is operating in is not significant for its innovation behaviour.

Given the expressed concerns for food safety, the promotion of food traceability systems has occurred in many countries. Although a considerable body of literature has examined the consumer responses in regard to food traceability, relatively little is known about the producers' adoption behaviors. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper investigates Taiwanese farmers' participation decision in relation to the Taiwan Agriculture and Food Traceability (TAFT) program; special attention is paid to understanding the roles of the farmers' program awareness and pesticide residue testing adoption in regard to TAFT participation. Using a national representative sample of the fruit and vegetable farmers in Taiwan, the results indicate that program awareness and pesticide residue testing adoption are the significant determinants of TAFT participation. An awareness of the government's promotion of the TAFT program and adoption of pesticide residue testing has significantly reduced TAFT non-participation by 28.2% and 21.9% points, respectively.

Based on a sample of 13,911M&A attempts worldwide during 1986-2006, this study provides an analysis of major determinants of M&A completion in the food processing industry. Friendly attitude, cash payment and experience with M&As emerge as strong deal facilitators. Bidding competition, pursuit of parallel transactions, target subsidiary status and acquirer public status are the most important deal breakers. Unlike the lenient antitrust approach of the Reagan administration, the 1998 UK Competition Act and various directives and regulations on food safety and quality associated with the completion of the internal European market in 1992 facilitated M&A completion. In contrast, the beginning of the Economic and Monetary Union, as marked by the introduction of the Euro in 1999, had a strong negative effect on completion likelihood. This study identifies substantial regional differences. Completion of M&As that involve Asian firms depends on distinct factors. Results for NAFTA are mostly in line with predictions derived from general economic theory, compared to other regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This fast growth, fueled by high expectations towards this new commercial technology and shareholder trust in the involved industry, has provided strong incentives for further research and development of new genetically modified plant varieties. Considering, however, the high financial stakes involved, concerns are raised over the influence that conflicts of interest may place upon articles published in peer-reviewed journals that report on health risks or nutritional value of genetically modified food products. In a study involving 94 articles selected through objective criteria, it was found that the existence of either financial or professional conflict of interest was associated to study outcomes that cast genetically modified products in a favorable light (p = 0.005). While financial conflict of interest alone did not correlate with research results (p = 0.631), a strong association was found between author affiliation to industry (professional conflict of interest) and study outcome (p < 0.001). We discuss these results by comparing them to similar studies on conflicts of interest in other areas, such as biomedical sciences, and hypothesize on dynamics that may help explain such connections.

Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The price disparity between healthful and less healthful foods appears to be growing. This study demonstrates a new method for linking longitudinal retail price data with objective, nutrient-based ratings of the nutritional quality of foods and beverages. Retail prices for 378 foods and beverages were obtained from major supermarket chains in the Seattle, WA for 2004-2008. Nutritional quality was based on energy density (kcal/g) and two measures of nutrient density, calculated using the Naturally Nutrient Rich (NNR) score and the Nutrient Rich Foods index (NRF9.3). Food prices were expressed as $/100 g edible portion and as $/1000 kcal. Foods were stratified by quintiles of energy and nutrient density for analyses. Both measures of nutrient density were negatively associated with energy density and positively associated with cost per 1000 kcal. The mean cost of foods in the top quintile of nutrient density was $27.20/1000 kcal and the 4-year price increase was 29.2%. Foods in the bottom quintile cost a mean of $3.32/1000 kcal and the 4-year price increase was 16.1%. There is a growing price disparity between nutrient-dense foods and less nutritious options. Cost may pose a barrier to the adoption of healthier diets and so limit the impact of dietary guidance.

In particular, we address the following specific questions: may researchers segment Chinese urban consumers in terms of their attitudes and perceptions toward GM foods? Are there any relationships between segmented consumer groups and other factors - such as their exposure to GM knowledge and socio-demographics? And, what policy implications can be drawn from this research to the future biotech development in China? Based on a large-scale survey data collected by the authors in 2002 and 2003 in 11 cities of China, this research applies consumer research methodologies. The combination of factor and cluster analysis enables us to identify successfully and consistently four Chinese consumer clusters based on their perceptions and attitudes toward GM foods, which include a food safety cluster, a nutritional technologist cluster, a GM skeptic cluster, and a cluster of GM for non-food promoter.

Reflecting the multiple goals for organic farming and for agricultural policy, a varied and complex range of policy measures have been developed and implemented to support the organic sector. However, balancing societal and consumer/market goals and balancing institutional and private stakeholder interests in the organic sector present particular challenges for policy-making. The key issues of current organic farming policy addressed in this special issue therefore specifically consider the two different dimensions of policy development - the dimension of policies and the dimension of politics.

At the same time, certain GM food products remain approved but are not on offer since retailers assume that consumers would shun labeled GM food. In our study we tested this claim by conducting a large-scale field study with Swiss consumers. In our experimental design, three clearly labeled types of corn bread were offered at five different market stands across the French and German-speaking part of Switzerland: one made with organic, one made with conventional, and one made with genetically modified (GM) corn. In addition, we tested the consistency between purchasing decision at the market stand and the previous voting decision on GMOs in 2005 by means of an ex-post questionnaire. The results of our discrete choice analysis show that Swiss consumers treat GM foods just like any other type of novel food. We conclude from our findings that consumers tend to appreciate transparency and freedom of choice even if one of the offered product types is labeled as containing a genetically modified ingredient. Retailers should allow consumers to make their own choice and accept the fact that not all people appear to be afraid of GM food. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous arguments have been proposed to explain overshooting, including financial speculation, depreciation of the United States (US) dollar, low interest rates, and reductions in grain stocks. However, observations that international rice prices surged in response to export restrictions by India and Vietnam suggested that trade-related factors could be an important basis for overshooting, especially given the very tangible link between export volumes and export prices. In this paper, we revisit the trade story by closely examining monthly data from Thailand (the largest exporter of rice), and the United States (the largest exporter of wheat and maize and the third largest exporter of soybeans). In all cases except soybeans, we find that large surges in export volumes preceded the price surges. The presence of these large demand surges, together with back-of-the-envelope estimates of their price impacts, suggests that trade events played a much larger and more pervasive role than previously thought.

Here, this research gap is addressed by using farm survey data front Nigeria. Econometric analyses are employed to examine the mechanisms through which off-farm income affects household calorie and micronutrient supply, dietary quality, and child anthropometry. We find that off-farm income has a positive net effect on food security and nutrition. The prevalence of child stunting, underweight, and wasting is lower in households with off-farm income than in households without. Using a structural model, we also show that off-farm income contributes to higher food production and farm income by easing capital constraints, thus improving household welfare in multiple ways.

This paper investigates whether farmer organizations are able to help small-scale farmers obtain access to supermarkets as well as examines the role that supermarkets and public support play in the emergence and development of these organizations. The paper is based on case studies of a number of stakeholders marketing vegetables, flavored rice and litchi fruit in Vietnam. Eight farmer groups operating in the form of private commercial organizations act as regular supermarket suppliers for the selected products. Their ability to supply supermarkets is related to the combination of functions they make available to their members, especially with regard to promoting and controlling quality for which they receive public support. Their participation in flexible contracts with supermarkets, shops and schools is also a key issue. Supplying supermarkets via farmer associations increases farmers' profits per kilo compared to traditional chains, but the quantities supplied to supermarkets remain limited. The paper argues that changes in farmer organizations are not primarily due to supplying supermarkets, but rather to public and international support for food quality improvement which has been of benefit to supermarkets.

However, farmers' certification proceeds at an unequal speed worldwide with some countries representing a large number of certified producers and others representing very few, if any. This study aims at analysing the adoption of two private food standards, BRC Food Technical Standard and GlobalGAP, at an aggregated cross-country level using data of 2007. Negative binomial models are applied to quantify the determinants of standards' spread at an aggregated level. The results of the econometric analysis reveal some (potential) barriers for farms and firms in developing countries to access this type of organisational innovation. Certificates of both standards seem to be issued more likely in countries with established trade relations with Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, home countries of the standards. Furthermore, larger countries and countries with better institutional quality host more certified firms. Finally, a country's level of economic development displays a clear non-monotonic relationship to the number of certified enterprises. Although no evidence for a general exclusion of developing countries can be found, the main implication of this paper is that third-party certification for export purposes seems to reinforce already existing trade relations, potentially hampering new entrants.

In our analysis, we evaluate the impacts from a BSE outbreak on the price volatility transmission along the Spanish food marketing chain by using a smooth transition conditional correlation (STCC) GARCH model. Our work is the first to assess price volatility responses to food scares. Results suggest that two distinct regimes involving different price volatility behavior can be distinguished, one characterized by turbulent markets and another where markets are calming down.

The magnitude of loss may be 10 to 50 tons C/ha. Soils with severe depletion of their SOC pool have low agronomic yield and low use efficiency of added input. Conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices, can enhance the SOC pool, improve soil quality, increase agronomic productivity, advance global food security, enhance soil resilience to adapt to extreme climatic events, and mitigate climate change by off-setting fossil fuel emissions. The technical potential of carbon (C) sequestration in soils of the agroecosystems is 1.2-3.1 billion tons C/yr. Improvement in soil quality, by increase in the SOC pool of 1 ton C/ha/yr in the root zone, can increase annual food production in developing countries by 24-32 million tons of food grains and 6-10 million tons of roots and tubers. The strategy is to create positive soil C and nutrient budgets through adoption of no-till farming with mulch, use of cover crops, integrated nutrient management including biofertilizers, water conservation, and harvesting, and improving soil structure and tilth.

Yet, food insecurity is still a major challenge to several millions of people in the country and it is questionable whether the different food security programs implemented over the past years have been successful. Using a propensity score matching method to control for pre-intervention differences, this study examined the impact on household food calorie intake of an integrated food security program (IFSP), which had been implemented in Northwestern Ethiopia by two non-governmental organizations as a case study. The estimated results provide evidence that IFSP has a positive and statistically significant effect on food calorie intake. In particular, IFSP has raised physical food calorie intake by 30% among the beneficiary households. However, we also found that IFSP has differential impact depending on family size, landownership and gender of head of household. Overall, the paper provides evidence that supporting integrated food security programs is important to improve food security in rural areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our understanding of the importance, nature and food security implications of urban agriculture is however plagued by a lack of good quality, reliable data. While studies based on survey data do exist for several major cities, much of the evidence is still qualitative if not anecdotal. Using a recently created dataset bringing together comparable, nationally representative household survey data for 15 developing or transition countries, this paper analyzes in a comparative international perspective the importance of urban agriculture for the urban poor and food insecure. Some clear hints do come from our analysis. On the one hand, the potential for urban agriculture to play a substantial role in urban poverty and food insecurity reduction should not be overemphasised, as its share in income and overall agricultural production is often quite limited. On the other hand, though, its role should also not be too easily dismissed, particularly in much of Africa and in all those countries in which agriculture provides a substantial share of income for the urban poor, and for those groups of households to which it constitutes an important source of livelihoods. We also find fairly consistent evidence of a positive statistical association between engagement in urban agriculture and dietary adequacy indicators. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In Ethiopia, steps taken to liberalize markets in the 1990s and promote fertilizer and seed packages have yet to generate payoffs in terms of higher cereal yields, lower food prices, or reduced dependency on food aid. This raises concern about the performance of the agricultural sector, specifically in terms of the systems for providing improved seed, fertilizer, credit, and extension services. This paper examines the evolving roles of the public and private sectors in intensifying cereal production in Ethiopia. Findings suggest that while Ethiopia has an admirable record of supporting agriculture, its state-led policies has now outlived their usefulness. These findings for Ethiopia offer lessons that are potentially applicable to other sub-Saharan African countries facing similar challenges. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the EU-funded SAFE FOODS project a novel risk analysis framework has been developed that attempts to address potential shortcomings by increasing stakeholder (including consumer) input, improving transparency, and formally incorporating benefit and non-health aspects into the analysis. To assess the viability of this novel framework, the views of food risk experts from the EU and beyond were sought using a distributed online questionnaire process called Delphi. In this paper the main results of this survey are described, revealing varying levels of support for the key innovations of the novel framework.

In the study, four components of Uganda's NFCS including legislation, competent authority, inspection services, and laboratory services were evaluated for compliance with FAO/WHO, European Union (EU), and the United States (US) market recommendations for guaranteeing aquaculture product safety. Using a checklist, component elements were benchmarked and scored, and components ranked for compliance with the recommendations. On a scale of 0-5, where 0 denotes none, I very low, 2 low, 3 some, 4 almost total, and 5 full compliance, only laboratory services had a barely acceptable score of 3.3 (some compliance). The rest including legislation which is central in setting the level of controls by the other three components scored below three, and the combined score for all components was only 2.2, indicating that Uganda's NFCS was still short of the requirements to allow entrepreneurs to access markets in the EU and other developed countries. The low score is partly attributed to the dynamics of this country's fledgling aquaculture industry and the rapidly evolving food safety requirements in the international markets.

This channel of health and nutrition determination has never been studied. In order to assess and test the empirical possibility of this channel, we estimate the responses of health and nutritional status of autarkic agricultural households in Rwanda with respect to differences in socio-demographic characteristics and the main agricultural outputs and inputs while controlling for local environment and sampling scheme. Several food outputs are found to have a positive influence on health and nutrition, whereas the production of traditional beers has a negative impact. Moreover, greater land negatively affects health and nutrition, conditionally on agricultural production, perhaps because of a larger relative workload for households who have a large farm. An alternative interpretation of the estimates is that they inform on the validity of the common hypothesis of perfect agricultural input/output markets with no effect of agricultural inputs/outputs on health and nutrition status. This hypothesis is rejected. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cross-sectional data were collected in 2008 through a pan-European consumer survey (n = 2400) with samples representative for age and region in France, Poland and Spain. Four distinct consumer segments based on health-related attitudes are identified: low interest in healthy eating consumers (29.4%), positive health enthusiasts (28.2%), health strivers (35.0%) and health uninvolved (7.4%). The segments differ significantly with respect to fish consumption, attitudes and knowledge about the health benefits of fish, interest in potential informational cues when purchasing fish, and individual socio-demographic characteristics. The segment low interest in healthy eating is characterised by younger age, more males, higher BMI, low fish consumption and low interest in information, and herewith emerges as a relevant though difficult to reach segment from a food and health policy perspective. Positive health enthusiasts and health strivers have a strong involvement with food, and a strong interest in healthy eating. Both segments have a very favourable disposition towards fish consumption, which would fit with their focus to either stay healthy (positive health enthusiasts) or improve their current health status (health strivers). Health uninvolved consumers do not care strongly about health in general; though attach high importance to eating healthily. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The accuracy in weight assessment is influenced by a number of social-demographic and economic factors; many of them have opposite effects and cancel out each other. This paper examines changes in misperception of body weight among overweight women in the United States, using data from the 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Changes in characteristics of the population, such as the increased share of Hispanics in the US population, between these two time periods explain only a small portion of the changes in the accuracy of body weight assessment. Most of the differences come from changes in the association between population characteristics and the likelihood an overweight woman underestimates her weight status.

Rethinking food security responses in protracted humanitarian crises,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food security; Social protection; Disaster risk reduction; Food price crisis; Relief to development,,"The recent rise in the price of food worldwide defied easy categorization. However, the impact of the price hikes on developing country consumption served to refocus attention on food security. Much attention was paid to short-term buffering of nutrition in tandem with new investments in agriculture - a dual approach that served to reinforce a longstanding bifurcation in analysis and programming between emergency and development categories, suggesting that emergency responses deal with immediate needs while development means addressing underlying causes with a longer-term lens. The notion of the relief to development continuum has long been dismissed as conceptual framework, but has never really been replaced as a programmatic framework. This paper suggests a multi-dimensional way of conceiving of these categories and a more systematic way of thinking about response. Ethiopia is noted as an example where elements of this new approach are taking shape but even Ethiopia has not adopted all of these components in an integrated way, and the programming there has not been comprehensively evaluated.

It starts from the recognition that a multitude of actors and norms shape today's agrifood system. The resulting opaqueness of the systems makes it extremely difficult to understand and explain processes and outcomes of agrifood governance. Given the sustainability challenges facing the agrifood system, improvements in our understanding of what the interaction of global and local actors and norms means on the ground are urgently needed, however. The section, therefore, analyses agrifood governance in India across a selected group of cases. It does so by employing a systematic framework emphasizing the material and ideational dimensions of power and their interaction. The section has chosen India as the setting in which to analyze this interact:ion due to the crucial role the food demand and supply of this rising power plays in today's agrifood system. This article provides the special sections' analytical framework, which uses the interplay of material and ideational dimensions of power as a focal lens. In addition, the article applies this framework to an empirical study of the political conflict around GMO foods in India, specifically the case of 'Golden Rice'. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The anticipated increase in the population to 2050 will increase the dependency on fertiliser inputs. The paper examines the different potential sources of energy and hydrogen required for this essential fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into plant-available nitrogenous fertiliser and concludes that methane from natural gas is clearly the most suitable source. In the absence of a cost-effective alternative source of hydrogen it is recommended that an on-going requirement for methane is acknowledged and that consideration be given to strategic reserves for the production of food. Phosphorus is also an essential and unsubstitutable nutrient for plants and animals, but while the global reserves of atmospheric nitrogen are effectively unlimited, the reserves of phosphate rock are finite. Recent estimates of the reserve suggest that at the current rate of use this resource will become exhausted within some hundreds of years. The annual increment of phosphorus contained in the human population is estimated to be in the order of 1 Mt/yr, which is a small proportion of the quantity mined. There is a clear requirement to ensure that phosphorus is recycled to a large extent, so that the rate of exhaustion of the reserves of phosphate rock is significantly reduced. Legislation relating to the management of phosphorus appears entirely associated with its potential to upset natural ecosystems, with apparently no regulations yet requiring the efficient use and reuse of a scarce resource.

These developments include, first, conflicts over approving (or not) the very first genetically modified food crop in India and a related experiment in participatory decision-making; and second, proposals to revamp the existing biosafety regulatory system (with its checks and balances across diverse sources of authority) with one that elevates scientists and scientific expertise to the pinnacle of decision-making power. The article analyzes the distinct means by which legitimacy is sought to be conferred upon the means and ends of anticipatory risk governance, as reflected in these two examples. I contrast claims to legitimacy deriving from innovative experiments in participatory democracy with legitimacy claims based upon objective science, showing that despite acknowledged need for the former, the latter is still being prioritized. The article concludes by identifying the contours of an evolving science-society contract in India, as revealed by these cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Households losing a productive adult did not replenish the lost labor, regardless of economic status, sex or status of the deceased adult.

Moreover, the policy network analysis showed that the public debate in New Zealand is dominated by stakeholders involved in R&D activities whereas advocacy groups, retailers and regulatory agencies tend to be the central players in the Swiss debate. These findings help to explain the more defensive approach to sustainable agriculture in Switzerland and highlight the importance of stakeholder interests in the shaping of the domestic agenda in agricultural policy. While the Swiss approach tends to be more in accordance with the conventional legal principles of sustainable development, the New Zealand approach may turn out to be more effective in addressing the future challenges of sustainable agriculture.

Evidence from a migration lottery program,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Migration; Remittances; Child health; Diet; Natural experiment,NUTRITION,"The impact of migration on food security and child health is likely to differ depending on whether children themselves migrate or whether they remain behind while other household members migrate. However, existing studies have not been able to examine how impacts differ in these two scenarios because parallel data are required for both the sending and receiving country. Moreover, self-selection into migration makes unbiased estimation of either impact difficult. We overcome these problems by using a unique survey of Tongan households that applied to migrate to New Zealand through a migrant quota which selects households through a random ballot. This survey covers both migrant children in New Zealand and non-migrant children in Tonga, with the migration policy rules providing a source of exogenous variation for identifying impacts. Our estimates of short-run impacts show that diets diverge upon migration: children who migrate experience improvements, while diets worsen for children who remain. There is also suggestive evidence of a divergence in health outcomes, with increases in weight-for-age and height-for-age found for migrant children, and decreases found for children who remain behind while other household members migrate.

It is expected that biofuels will form an important element of global transport energy mix (in the order of 20-30% of total requirement) over the next 40 years and beyond. Over this time, there will be a transition from so called first generation biofuels, based on commodity agricultural crops with food/feed uses, to advanced biofuels, sometimes called second and third generation biofuels, based primarily upon lignocellulosic feedstocks. It remains unclear whether these advanced biofuels, based on lignocellulosic materials, will entirely replace first generation or if second generation will be supplemental to first generation. This expansion in biofuels will be coupled to a substantial increase in alternative fuels (electricity, hydrogen, biogas and natural gas) and modal shifts. Biofuel production from agricultural commodity crops that exhibit strong sustainability criteria will remain important (e.g. sugarcane) with supportive and competitive aspects for food security. Land requirement projections estimated for a range of potential biofuel development trajectories range widely and are inherently uncertain. Under the most active scenario that delivers substantive greenhouse gas reductions in transport by 2050 (relative to 2005 levels), approximately 100 Mha of additional land is projected. In the 'business-as-usual' scenario, in which transport energy demand rises by 80% by 2050 from present levels, a land use requirement of 650 Mha is projected. Significant potential exists for producing biofuels that possess high productivity and sustainability profiles through continued research, development and demonstration. Policy and regulation at a global level, that focuses biofuel development on these goals in ways that are synergistic with food agriculture, will simultaneously help to decarbonise transport and maintain a diverse and financially robust agricultural (and forestry) sector.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the risks and benefits of this development to poor urban consumers in Vietnam. The analysis is based on surveys of food purchasing practices conducted in Hanoi from 2004 to 2006. It shows that poor consumers depend on a diversified network of formal and informal outlets to ensure food accessibility, credit opportunities and low prices. Poor consumers purchase very little from supermarkets due to material constraints (price, transport, etc.), although they have a high opinion of supermarkets and in particular the quality of the products sold. In order to be favourable to poor consumers, food distribution policies should aim to maintain the balance of the different forms of outlets and enforce public quality standards to guarantee the right of all to safe food.

We link recent production trends to household incomes using a regionalized, recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium and microsimulation model. Results indicate some inconsistency between recent growth and poverty measurements in Tanzania. We also find that the structure of economic growth may have constrained the rate of poverty reduction. Agricultural growth has been driven by larger-scale farmers who are less likely to be poor; and has been concentrated among crops grown in specific regions of the country. Slow expansion of food crops and livestock also explain the weak relationship between agricultural growth and nutrition outcomes. We find that accelerating agricultural growth, particularly in maize, strengthens the growth-poverty relationship and enhances households' caloric availability, while also contributing significantly to growth itself.

Egypt has experienced several food crises (the latest in 2008), which put an halt to attempts to reform in depth the system of food subsidies because of social unrest. In this paper, we use a Mixed Demand approach to analyze the consumption structure of Egyptian households. Our model specification takes into consideration the characteristics of the Egyptian food subsidy system, where some food items have predetermined quotas while others are associated with predetermined (subsidized) prices. Price, income and quota elasticities are estimated from the Egyptian family expenditure survey, and welfare change measures are derived by income class. Simulations of various options to eliminate subsidies on selected food items are conducted. We estimate the negative welfare impact of the reforms, especially in the context of increasing food prices, by comparing welfare effects of policy options by income quartiles and by household category (rural, urban).

This paper argues that a careful assessment of the different emissions produced by different actual and potential diets is needed to evaluate whether or not restricting the consumption of farmed animal products could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and if so, by how much. It is also argued that the question of whether or not the consumption of farmed animal products should be restricted must be addressed in the light of information derived from various sustainability indicators, rather than on the basis of a narrow focus on greenhouse gas emissions. A case study from the UK is used to develop a broader understanding of how dietary modifications might reduce a range of problems associated with the consumption of farmed animal products. It is argued that even more comprehensive studies of the different Global Health Impacts (GHIs) are needed to assess the merits and demerits associated with the consumption of farmed animal products.

Consumption of melamine caused infants to develop kidney stones which, if left untreated, could cause renal failure and death. More than 290,000 people (most of them infant children) were poisoned and at least six babies are confirmed to have died from ingesting the melamine contaminated infant milk powder. The Chinese government imposed very high penalties on people and companies involved in the melamine scandal, including lifetime prison sentences and even executions. The problems in China's dairy industry were a result of rapid growth fueled by large investments from multinational dairy firms, development of a highly modern and concentrated processing sector that obtained its raw materials from millions of small, poor and uneducated traditional farmers and government support and encouragement for growth but with little emphasis on inspection and safety issues.

The comparison is between the carbon emissions resultant from operating a large-scale vegetable box system and those from a supply system where the customer travels to a local farm shop. The study is based on fuel and energy use data collected from one of the UK's largest suppliers of organic produce. The findings suggest that if a customer drives a round-trip distance of more than 6.7 km in order to purchase their organic vegetables, their carbon emissions are likely to be greater than the emissions from the system of cold storage, packing, transport to a regional hub and final transport to customer's doorstep used by large-scale vegetable box suppliers. Consequently some of the ideas behind localism in the food sector may need to be revisited. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The study also covers the environmental impact of the production process. These are key issues due to the current environmental, organoleptic and food traceability requirements of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Furthermore, product differentiation is sought after in today's ever more demanding markets. The production of olive oil in Andalusia (Spain) is the most important agricultural food industry in the whole region and it represents 30% of world olive oil production. Three data sources have been used: a comprehensive survey to a sample of olive oil producers, their financial reports, and the opinion of a group of experts in olive oil production techniques interviewed by means of the Delphi survey. With this data and after the construction of indicators, a production frontier is elaborated by applying an extension of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique. This will allow for the measuring of the relative technical efficiency indices and set specific efficiency indices for both the quality of the oil produced and the environmental impact of the production process. Those factors impacting on efficiency are determined by a truncated regression model with bootstrap. The results show a medium-high level of relative technical efficiency and highlight the importance of efficiency factors involving production and marketing associations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Agricultural productivity, soil health, water security, and food quality in storage and distribution are identified as the primary determinants of food security that can be impacted by developments in nanotechnology. The framework is developed in two stages: (i) mapping nanotechnology to agri-food thematic areas across the agricultural value chain and (ii) from the thematic areas to the food security determinants. Using published literature and patents data, a model to organize and map nanotechnology research to the agri-food thematic areas and food security determinants is developed through a specially designed database. The model allows identification and prioritization of potential areas for nanotechnology applications to enhance food security. Comparisons of this technology with green revolution technologies and agricultural biotechnology indicate a possibility of greater and faster impact on all components of the agri-value chain with concurrent social, ethical, legal and environmental implications.

Consumer acceptance is conditioned by the risk that they perceive from introducing food into their consumption habits processed through technology that they hardly understand. Besides, information is insufficient in the consumer ambit and moreover, it is influenced by ideological and ethical determining factors. The factors were analysed that influence this consumer-perceived risk through a structural equation model. This study was conducted in Spain, concretely in the province of Alicante, located in the southeast of this country. The main conclusion from this research is that the introduction of GM food into agro-food markets should be accompanied by adequate policies to guarantee consumer safety. These actions would allow a decrease in consumer-perceived risk by taking special care of the information provided, concretely relating to health. For, the most influential factor in consumer-perceived risk from these foods is concern about health. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using farmer cooperatives in Ethiopia as a case in point, the paper examines the role of RPOs in supporting smallholder commercialization, and the extent to which principles of an inclusive, bottom-up approach relate to their marketing performance. Based on a combination of nationally-representative household- and cooperative-level survey data, we find that poorer farmers tend not to participate in these organizations although they may indirectly benefit from them. When they do participate, they are often excluded from decision-making processes. Finally, we investigate the relationship between marketing performance and inclusiveness and uncover evidence of significant tradeoffs between them. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and transport to a port in Sweden (wholesale point) of 84 common food items of animal and vegetable origin. Energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for food items produced in different countries and using various means of production were compared. The results confirmed that animal-based foods are associated with higher energy use and GHG emissions than plant-based foods, with the exception of vegetables produced in heated greenhouses. Analyses of the nutritional value of the foods to assess the amount of protein delivered to the wholesale point per unit energy used or GHG emitted (protein delivery efficiency) showed that the efficiency was much higher for plant-based foods than for animal-based. Remarkably, the efficiency of delivering plant-based protein increased as the amount of protein in the food increased, while the efficiency of delivering animal-based protein decreased. These results have implications for policies encouraging diets with lower environmental impacts for a growing world population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Propensity score matching (PSM) and regression-based approaches applied to farm-level survey data are used to achieve the objective of the study. The PSM and regression-based approach accounts for the potential bias due to selection problems from observable variables. Results of the impact analysis using both empirical approaches indicate that AWD, particularly the Safe AWD variant, reduces the hours of irrigation use (by about 38%), without a statistically significant reduction in yields and profits. This reduction in irrigation time translates to corresponding savings in the amount of irrigation water and pumping energy used. However, further analysis of the impact estimates suggests that the potential magnitude of the selection bias based on unobservable variables may still be able to eliminate the measured impact from the PSM and regression-based techniques that only control for selection based on observable variables. Hence, the current impact results have to be interpreted with caution and further data collection is needed to construct a panel data that would allow one to account for selection problems due to unobservable variables and, consequently, better estimate the AWD impact.

We ask whether the current state of affairs represents a market failure, and-if so-what might be done about it. We argue that while today's industrial food system has its advantages, the asymmetric information problems inherent to this system have resulted in a lemons-style breakdown in the market for processed foods. The appropriate policy response to such situations (namely, verifiable quality standards) is well known, but such policies are likely (in the short run) to reduce profits for existing large industrial producers of food. In light of the food industry's long history of success at regulatory capture, we propose the formation of a new independent food standards agency devoted to protecting the interests of the American consumer.

It examines approaches that have been proposed for mitigating emissions at each stage in the chain and looks at how these sit within wider discussions of sustainability. It finds that efficiency-focused technological measures, while important, may not only be insufficient in reducing GHGs to the level required but may also give rise to other environmental and ethical concerns. It gives evidence showing that in addition to technological mitigation it will also be necessary to shift patterns of consumption, and in particular away from diets rich in GHG-intensive meat and dairy foods. This will be necessary not just in the developed but also, in the longer term, in the developing world. This move, while potentially beneficial for food secure, wealthier populations, raises potentially serious nutritional questions for the world's poorest. A priority for decision makers is to develop policies that explicitly seek to integrate agricultural, environmental and nutritional objectives. (C) 2010 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This paper reviews existing hunger indices and critically assesses their quality against a number of desirable properties. Hunger indices are found to be unsatisfactory in a number of ways: they ignore distributional issues; they neglect the occurrence of food and health shocks; and are sometimes based on unreliable data. Anthropometric measurements, stunting in particular, emerge as powerful indicators of hunger and are ideal for addressing a number of policy relevant issues. The paper also introduces a conceptual framework for an index measuring country commitment to fighting hunger. The constitutive elements of this index are illustrated: political will, anti-hunger policies and programmes. Suggestions are made on how a commitment index can be built and what are the data requirements. (C) 2010 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

That is about one third of all rice traded in world markets. With such high dependence on imports. Africa is highly exposed to international market shocks with sometimes grave consequences for its food security and political stability as attested by events during the 2008 food crisis. In this paper, it is argued that Africa can turn the rising trends in world markets to a historical opportunity to realize its large potential for rice production. After a review of the policy responses of African countries to the 2008 global rice crisis, the opportunities and challenges for enhancing domestic rice supply are discussed. The competitiveness of rice production in Africa is analyzed for selected countries and rice ecologies. The potential for increasing paddy production is illustrated using a spreadsheet simulation that considers alternative rice sector development scenarios. Reducing the yield gap and expanding cultivated rice areas under lowland and irrigated hold the greatest potential for substantially increasing paddy production in Africa. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Low financial support was found in those member states with a high level of conflict or a low value-based level of conflict.

An novel feature of the design of our CE was that it was informed by a means-end-chains (MEC) to reveal key attributes to be included in the CE. In addition, we included the Dutch eating behaviour questionnaire (DEBQ) to collect information on all participants underlying eating behaviours. We find that bread type is a major factor in determining choice, and that the inclusion of a functional ingredient yielded relatively small measures of value. We also find that there are differences in willingness-to-pay (WIT) between respondent segments and that segment membership is explained by the DEBQ information. Finally, we find that respondents have a stronger preference for a simple health statement compared to, or in addition to, the implied benefits that result from consuming a functional food product. These findings are important in informing both pricing and promotional messages for a functional bread product. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To take into account the complexity of EU protection in the F&N sector, in particular the seasonality of protection and the Entry Price System, we conducted our analysis at a very disaggregated level (eight digits of the nomenclature, monthly data). We showed that, on average, Mediterranean countries do have significant preferences compared to other countries exporting to the EU. However, the magnitude of the preferences differs among countries; Morocco has the highest preference, while Syria and Israel have the lowest. We simulated a multilateral reduction in the MFN tariffs (as planned in the Doha Round) and showed that this would reduce the heterogeneity within the zone by more strongly eroding the preferences of the most advantaged countries. The classification of Entry Price products as sensitive products would either benefit or have no effect on most Mediterranean countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a national survey with a hypothetical food-choice experiment to estimate a more comprehensive measure of consumer willingness-to-pay for food-safety improvements. Our approach differs from previous evaluations of food-safety improvements because we: (1) provide the respondent with information about the promised change in the probability of pathogen contamination in retail food packages rather than changes in the probability of becoming ill, (2) elicit changes in respondents' subjective probability of becoming ill, and (3) elicit predicted changes in the quantity demanded for products that have enhanced food-safety properties. We estimate the consumer's choice between a safety-enhanced and an existing product, the change in subjective probability of contracting foodborne illness associated with the enhanced product and the change-in-demand for the enhanced product in a manner that recognizes the correlation among unobserved elements. The aggregated results suggest benefit estimates that are significantly larger than previous estimates for similar improvements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we take into account the nature of the contamination risk to investigate the complementarities between private and public mechanisms for those voluntary systems to be implemented by a firm. We show two main results. First, when the firm directly markets its products to consumers a strong mandatory threat is a sufficient condition to implement voluntary systems whatever the risk of contamination. In contrast, when the mandatory threat is weak voluntary systems should be more implemented in industries where the risk of food contamination is low (pesticide residue) than in industries where the risk of contamination is high (pathogenic contamination). Second, when the risk of food contamination is low and the firm is embedded in a supply chain where the retailer can impose its own safety system, a well-designed penalty contract will induce a voluntary implementation whatever the mandatory threat.

It shows that there have been linear increases in crop yields since the 1960s. However, yields of barley, oats, rye, triticale and wheat have leveled off in Switzerland since the early 1990s, which contrasts linear trends in cereal yields that is usually assumed for Europe. We show a relationship between the introduction of agricultural policy measures towards environmentally friendly cereal production that fostered widespread adoption of extensive farming practices and the observed leveling-off of crop yields. Thus, this paper emphasizes that agricultural policy can be an important reason for slowing crop yield growth. Agricultural policy measures will be one of the key driving forces of future crop yields. Thus, the potential leveling-off of crop yields that is indicated in this study should be considered in analyses of future land use and food supply as well as in the evaluation of agri-environmental measures and policy reforms.

While it stresses that any approach needs to be proportionate to the aim of achieving coexistence, very few studies have actually attempted to assess whether the proposed spatial ex ante coexistence regulations (SEACERs) satisfy this proportionality condition. In this article, we propose a spatial framework based on an existing landscape and introduce the concept of shadow factor as a measure for the opportunity costs induced by SEACERs. Our empirical findings led us to advance the proposition that flexible SEACERs based on pollen barriers are more likely to respect the proportionality condition than rigid SEACERs based on isolation distances. Particularly in early adoption stages, imposing rigid SEACERs may substantially slow down GM crop adoption. Our findings argue for incorporating a certain degree of flexibility into SEACERs by advising pollen barrier agreements between farmers rather than imposing rigid isolation distances on GM farmers. The empirical questions of proportionality and flexibility have been largely ignored in the literature on coexistence and provide timely information for EU policy makers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Jongwanich, J",,,,"Jongwanich, Juthathip",,,The impact of food safety standards on processed food exports from developing countries,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food safety standards; Processed food trade; Developing countries,TRADE,"This paper examines the impact of food safety standards on processed food exports in developing countries. A panel data econometric analysis of processed food exports in developing countries was undertaken. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standard (SPS) is incorporated into the model to capture the impact of food safety standards. The empirical model shows that food safety standards imposed by developed countries could impede processed food exports from developing countries. This could emerge because practically, SPS is less transparent than tariffs or quotas. There is an ample room for developed countries to tweak the standards stronger than necessary to achieve optimal levels of social protection, and to twist the related testing and certification procedures to make their competing imports more competitive. In addition, limited supply-side capacity of developing countries, especially in terms of resources, manpower as well as institution, constrains the countries to overcome food safety standards. Because of the potential benefits that could emerge from imposing food safety standards such as a reduction in transaction costs and trade friction, developing countries should view SPS not just as a trade barrier but also as an opportunity to upgrade quality standard and market sophistication. Supply-side capacity in developing countries needed to be improved, especially upgrading agriculture sector. Multilateral efforts are also needed to mobilize additional financial and technical assistance to help redress constraints in developing countries in meeting the required food safety standards imposed by developed countries.

Even with strict adherence to the production practices and increasing availability, the majority of consumers are still not aware of organically produced alternatives. Awareness of organics does not necessarily translate into actual consumption. Achieving awareness and understanding the linkage between awareness and purchasing organics is fundamental to impacting the demand for organically grown products. This study focuses on the responses of Spanish consumers regarding their state of knowledge about organic foods products. Consumer demographic characteristics, knowledge of enriched foods, and price perceptions are shown to impact awareness and consumption. Multinomial logit models are used to predict probabilities of awareness. Then probit models are estimated to link awareness and the actual consumption of organic foods. Factors impacting both awareness and consumption are explored using simulation methods and the coefficients from the logit and probit models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ward, R.

The objective of this study was to develop and implement a sound, robust and repeatable approach with and for the FNC to identify regional causal relationships between coffee quality and environmental characteristics as bases for labels of denomination of origin. Environmental differences between coffee-growing areas in the departments of Cauca and Narino were statistically significant for several characteristics, including the number of dry months, annual precipitation and diurnal temperature range. The dominant varieties (Caturra and Colombia) did not show major differences in quality attributes, and were pooled for the analyses with the environmental data. There are significant differences in biochemical and sensorial product characteristics between the two departments. The spatial patterns in product characteristics exhibit a non-random, regionally-changing structure that is related to those in the environmental data. The generated results provided ample evidence to support the application for regionally-based denominations of origin. Recommendations were derived to help mainstreaming the developed approach and thereby facilitate policy decisions for its use in other geographies and with other crops. Furthermore, the importance of systematic interdisciplinary institutional collaboration for large-scale denomination of origin projects was corroborated for food policy dialogue and decision making. It seems plausible that producers of high-quality products within other commodities are likely to follow the FNC in seeking denomination of origin for their goods. The presented approach is crucial to facilitate policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate changes in the dispersion of the entire distribution of BMI following FSP participation using a quantile regression model in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. For women, we find that the mean OLS estimate of FSP participation underestimates the extent of the positive association with BMI at the top quantiles in both cross-sectional and longitudinal individual fixed effects models. Controlling for individual fixed effects in the quantile regression model reduces the estimated magnitude of the association by a factor of three to four, although the estimates remain statistically significant for women. For men, a marginally statistically significant positive association of FSP participation with BMI is found at the top quantiles compared to no statistically significant mean estimate although the association is no longer statistically significant when time-constant individual heterogeneity is adjusted for in the individual fixed effect models.

To bridge this gap, this study examines the effect of mother's nutritional label use on children's body mass index and overweight. Using data from the 2001 National Health Interview Survey in Taiwan, a two-stage econometric model is proposed and estimated with a semiparametric method. Results indicate that mother's nutritional label use leads to lower probability of children becoming overweight or obese, and a non-linear relationship between mother's nutritional label use and children's BMI is evident. For mothers who seldom use nutritional labels, label use does not lead to a reduction in children's BMI. In contrast, for mothers who are frequent nutritional label users, label use contributes negatively to children's BMI. However, the magnitudes of these effects are relatively small, suggesting that additional instruments or policies are needed if further reduction in children's body mass index is desired.

Already less resilient production areas will suffer the most, as temperatures will rise further in tropical and semi-tropical latitudes and water-scarce regions will face even drier conditions. International trade plays an important role in compensating, albeit partially, for regional changes in productivity that are induced by climate change. While a well-functioning international trade system can support the adaptation to climate change-related challenges, trade policies as such are imperfect instruments to induce less emissions globally. A well-functioning international trading system can support the adaptation to climate change-related challenges. Hence welfare gains from reforms to trade policies may be greater than normally measured if they also reduce GHG emissions globally. (C) 2010 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Our review suggests that CGIAR research contributions in crop genetic improvement, pest management, natural resources management, and policy research have, in the aggregate, yielded strongly positive impacts relative to investment, and appear likely to continue doing so. Crop genetic improvement research stands out as having had the most profound documented positive impacts. Substantial evidence exists that other research areas within the CGIAR have had large beneficial impacts although often locally and nationally rather than internationally. However, the right-time, right-place nature of successful policy research and the relatively limited geographic scale of much natural resource management research often limits he overall scale of impacts of these programmatic thrusts vis-a-vis genetic improvement research. We conclude that given the evidence available, the CGIAR's portfolio of research allocations has become overly skewed toward natural resource management and policy research over time. Hence, restoring somewhat the share of resources allocated to crop genetic improvement is warranted. In addition, the CGIAR needs to prioritize impact assessment of resource management and policy research to deepen its understanding of the social and environmental impacts of its work.

The results of the simulations performed suggest that the impact of the EPA on production and consumption of bananas in the EU will be limited, while benefits for ACP countries will be significant (at the expense of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) exporters). An agreement between the EU and MFN countries to end the outstanding WTO disputes on bananas and/or the conclusion of the WTO Doha round may bring an erosion of the preferential margins currently enjoyed by ACP countries of such an order of magnitude as to cancel out most of these benefits.

However, correlation analyses using a simple regression approach, such as the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), do not prove that FAFH Causes weight gain. We use a first-difference estimator to establish a causal relationship between FAFH and dietary intakes. Using dietary recall data from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 1994-1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, we find that FAFH does indeed increase caloric intake and reduce diet quality, but that the effect is smaller than if estimated using OLS. Thus, models based on associations are likely biased upward, as much as 25% by our estimates.

Considerable emphasis has been placed on developing country impacts, but a gap in the literature remains on the stakes for rich country farmers despite the large role these countries play in global agricultural protection. The research here considers the particular case of US rice households and their sensitivity to Japanese market access reform. Using an applied general equilibrium model with multiple farm households we highlight the distributional impacts among these producers. We argue that concessions to Japan on market access make domestic reforms in rice a difficult political sale in the US since the wealthiest producers bear the largest losses. Improving our understanding of the distributional impacts and political realities of the richest countries is critical to informing the negotiating process because the gains to the world's poor can only be realized with creative policy redress in these rich nations.

The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6% of the total cultivated area. More than 70% of Africa's poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country-and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

The success of regulations depends on the commitment of individuals to change behaviour in ways that comply with regulatory obligations. Understanding and predicting the motivation of individuals to change their behaviour is critical in assessing the likely effectiveness of proposed regulations. In this paper we present a novel framework for understanding and predicting the motivation of an individual to comply with regulations. The framework is based on two central ideas. The first idea uses the involvement construct to predict the motivation of individuals to comply. The second idea separates the influence of the regulation on individuals' motivation to comply from the influence of the underlying policy issue on the motivation of individuals to comply. Through application to a case study we show the framework's merit in predicting an individual's possible behavioural responses to a regulation and how it assists regulatory agencies develop strategies to enhance compliance.

A risk governance framework that formally institutes stakeholder (including consumer) consultation and dialogue through a transparent and accountable process has been proposed, with due emphasis on risk communication. This paper delivers actionable policy recommendations based on consumer preferences for different approaches to food risk management. These results suggest that risk communication should be informed by knowledge of consumer risk perceptions and information needs, including individual differences in consumer preferences and requirements, and differences in these relating to socio-historical context associated with regulation. In addition, information about what is being done to identify, prevent and manage food risks needs to be communicated to consumers, together with consistent messages regarding preventative programs, enforcement systems, and scientific uncertainty and variability associated with risk assessments. Cross-cultural differences in consumer perception and information preferences suggest a national or regional strategy for food risk communication may be more effective than one applied at a pan-European level.

The application of such methods is, however, sometimes controversial, and the frequently considerable costs involved must be weighed against the limited resources available to develop underutilised species, as well as against the many alternative methods available for promotion. Through database searches, we take an evidence-based approach to assess whether there are clear examples where biotechnology has been used practically to enhance the cultivation of underutilised plants at a field level. We conclude that tissue culture and micropropagation techniques have proven useful, but for other applications benefits are generally unclear at present, although ongoing work suggests genomic and genetic modification approaches may in future be significant for a subset of underutilised species. Successful outcomes, however, appear to be limited by a lack of integrated thinking during the use of biotechnology methods. We review the particular limitations and risks associated with applying biotechnology to underutilised crops, including the negative consequences of technology centralisation. In addition, the specific actions needed to ensure that smallholder farmers in low-income countries better benefit during the use of biotechnology on underutilised species, by placing a stronger emphasis on partnerships and by proper monitoring of benefits along value chains, are described.

Contingent valuation survey instrument was administered to a sample composed from the Ipsos web-based panel. Fishbein's model of reasoned behavior and mediation hypothesis were combined to model the relationship between WTP (behavioral intentions) and sets of explanatory variables including attitudes, perceived attributes (about family farms, farmland preservation programs, government involvement in agricultural markets, and ecological state of our world), and socio-demographic profiles. Results show that, while exerting a highly significant impact on WTP, attitudes mediate the effects of the attribute variables on WTP: i.e., the attributes influence WTP directly as well as indirectly through attitudes. The estimated mean WTP was $515 per taxpayer annually. Aggregating individual WTPs across the US taxpayers above 20 years old produces $105 billion, representing a crude estimate of the economic value that the US consumers place on the multifunctional roles of US agriculture.

Using unique data collected from customers, vendors, and markets in a rural region of New York State, we develop an empirical model of subjective and objective measures of vendor performance to identify important factors for improved market sustainability. The empirical results suggest four interrelated planning recommendations when considering market and public policy interventions: (1) establishing larger, centrally located markets with public sector contributions, (2) targeting variety in products and vendors, (3) prioritizing attention to marketing and promotion, and (4) reducing cost burdens to underserved, low-income residents. As rural areas are spatially unique, future research across a variety of rural communities and regions will be important to the further development of sound initiatives aimed at improving market performance and access to healthy foods.

Our data show that, although the potential is high, the insufficient supply of irrigation water, excessively expensive chemical fertilizer, and moderately costly labor hinder the scheme from achieving that potential. First of all, an improvement in irrigation is crucial as it increases yield not only directly but also indirectly through its complementary relationship to chemical fertilizer. We also find that an improvement in credit access is important as it can increase the application of chemical fertilizer and labor by making the acquisition of these expensive inputs through markets possible. The unavailability of hired and exchange labor during peak seasons is another constraint to the intensive use of labor. The introduction of rice varieties with a shorter maturity duration would relax the timing of transplanting and thus spread out the peak seasons' labor demand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the policies of many agencies and compliance with Sphere minimum standards require that the recipient community participate in decisions about the assistance they receive including targeting, regardless of the causes of the emergency. This paper analyzes current practice in the targeting and management of humanitarian food assistance in complex emergencies, the constraints to recipient communities' participation, and the possibilities for participatory approaches to improve targeting. Access and security considerations, limited staff time and capacity, and other constraints have long meant that the actual oversight of food aid distributions in complex emergencies is left in the hands of local leaders at the village or camp level. Introduced institutions include Food Relief Committees, or other specially-organized bodies to deal with targeting and distribution questions. Differences in the accountability and legitimacy of these leaders and committees, together with post-distribution dynamics over which agencies have little control, account for much of the way in food assistance is actually distributed and utilized.

This paper aims to shed light on this debate, drawing on new empirical evidence from Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Our data derive from a two-wave panel survey conducted in 2006 and 2008. Ethiopia has experienced unprecedented rates of inflation since 2007, which have reduced the real purchasing power of PSNP cash payments. Our regression findings confirm that food transfers or 'cash plus food' packages are superior to cash transfers alone - they enable higher levels of income growth, livestock accumulation and self-reported food security. These results raise questions of fundamental importance to global humanitarian response and social protection policy. We draw out some implications for the design of social transfer programmes and describe some steps that could be taken to enable 'predictable transfers to meet predictable needs'.

(2009) discuss the effects of alternative spatial ex ante coexistence regulations (SEACERs) in the context of the EU regulatory framework. We retain from Demont et al. (2009) that small pollen barriers should be considered as a possible regulatory option in all identifiable situations in which they are as effective as large isolation distances. This idea is in accordance with the proportionality principle of the 2003 EC Recommendation. But further analysis of how consumer choice and consumer welfare are affected should be conducted before supporting the idea that SEACERs should be flexible, that is that GMO farmers should always have the option of paying their non-GMO neighbours to implement the SEACERs in their own fields. We reject the authors' argument that pollen barriers are necessarily more easily negotiable among neighbours (more flexible) than are isolation distances. We contest the relation of proportionality to the size of market signals for IP products. We contest the idea of shifting coexistence regulation from ex ante to ex post. We believe that any economic analysis of coexistence measures should include their welfare effects on consumers as well as on producers.

But they also tend to be regular events, every three decades or so, suggesting there is an underlying cyclical cause. If so, farsighted donor and government investments in raising agricultural productivity, and policies on behalf of stable food production and prices, might go a long way to preventing food crises in the future. Preventing food crises rather than trying to cope after the fact with their impact on the poor is the only way to avoid substantial, perhaps permanent, damage to the welfare of poor households. Lessons from the world food crises in 1972/73 and in 2007/08, especially lessons from how the world rice market functioned, point the way toward improved food policy management at national and international levels in the future.

Progress in meeting the first goal can be measured by the difference in well-being between participants and eligible non-participants. This gap in well-being though can be affected by progress made toward the second goal of increasing participation rates. In particular, if those with the lowest levels of well-being disproportionately enter the program, the gap can increase. To examine whether this tension between goals exists empirically, we consider the case of the Food Stamp Program and its effect on food insecurity in the United States, using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In particular, we use variation in State policies (the change in administrative error rates and the combined value of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and food stamp benefits) to analyze whether increasing participation rates leads to increases in the difference in food insecurity rates. Controlling for other factors, we find evidence of the tension between these two program goals insofar as States with policies which encourage participation have higher differences in the food insecurity rates of participants and non-participants.

The European Union (EU) adopted major policy changes for processed fruits and vegetables in 2001 and again in 2008, and we employ a simulation model to examine the effects of the three policy regimes in place before and after each of the changes. Our analysis incorporates the heterogeneity of processing firms in the EU and considers how they responded to the different policy regimes. Simulation results indicate that the EU subsidies increased EU tomato production by 3.8% for the regime that began in 2008 and 9.1% for the regime that began in 2001 compared to no subsidies. The policy regime that was in place from 2001 through 2007 led to the greatest distortions in global processing tomato markets, in part because it directed more of the benefits to EU growers and less to EU processors and consumers. Thus changes in 2001 reformed policy by redistributing gains within the EU, while changes in 2008 reformed policy by reducing distortions in global markets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Severe food safety scandals were observed recently in China. These events not only caused direct economic and life losses, but also created distrust in the Chinese food system domestically, as well as internationally. While much attention has focused on the problems plaguing the Chinese government's food inspection system, little research has been dedicated to analyzing Chinese consumers' concerns surrounding food safety. In this paper, we measure consumer preferences for select food safety attributes in pork and take food safety risk perceptions into account. Several choice experiment models, including latent class and random parameters logit, are constructed to capture heterogeneity in consumer preferences. Our results suggest that Chinese consumers have the highest willingness-to-pay for a government certification program, followed by third-party certification, a traceability system, and a product-specific information label. The results of this study call for the direct involvement of the Chinese government in the food safety system. A stricter monitoring system will not only improve consumer well-being in the short-run, but also restore consumers' trust leading to a social welfare increase in the long run. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It also assesses the impacts of food price increases on various household groups. Taking the 2007-2008 global food crisis as an example, we show that prices for domestic grain products are highly correlated with world market prices. This is true both for products for which Ghana is highly import-dependent (e.g., rice) and the products for which Ghana is self-sufficient (e.g., maize). The econometric results also show that price transmission is high between regional producer markets and markets located in the country's largest cities, and the distance between producer and consumer markets and the size of consumer markets matter in explaining the price transmission. The welfare analysis for households as consumers shows that the effect of world food prices appears relatively modest for the country as a whole due to relatively diverse consumption patterns within country. However, the national average hides important regional differences, both between regions and within different income groups. We find that the poorest of the poor-particularly those living in the urban areas-are hardest hit by high food prices. The negative effect of the food crisis is particularly strong in northern Ghana.

The analysis uses data from a large sample survey of farmers in South West England and the results indicate that CAP reform is not stimulating rapid agricultural restructuring, rather it appears to be reinforcing many existing trends towards diversification and an increasing polarisation between the largest and smallest farms. CAP reform is impacting unevenly on the farm community and different farming situations are associated with different types of reaction. Market signals may become a more powerful driver of farmer behaviour, in which case the 2003 reforms will have proved successful in providing farmers the freedom to farm without coupled subsidies. On the basis of the results presented in this paper though, only a minority of farmers seem both well placed and well disposed to exploit such opportunities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Often, too little attention is directed at (a) the most appropriate types of organization; (b) whether organization makes less or more sense in the case of producers of an and undifferentiated commodity or a higher value product; (c) whether the public or private sector is best placed to support farmer organizations; and (d) the conditions necessary for ensuring their economic viability. Research in Mexico and Central America explored these issues for commodity maize and high value vegetables, respectively. The benefits of farmer organization are more evident in the vegetable sector. characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access. However, horticultural farmer organizations in Honduras and El Salvador include less than 5% of total horticultural producers. This is possibly due to farmer organizations' limited business skills and non-replicable organizational models. There is less incentive for maize farmers to organize to access output markets as the transaction costs are relatively low. The benefits of maize farmer organization are clearer when it comes to accessing inputs such as credit, seed and fertilizer. Farmer organization is a critical factor in making markets work for the poor, but the role and timing of public and private investment in these organizations is poorly understood.

The current paper examined the ways in which various organisations involved in food and nutrition policy development negotiated the legitimacy of their inclusion in policy processes through claims about who they represented and how, with a specific focus upon older people (aged 60+) as an example of the hard to reach. This study is set in the context of theoretical considerations around the forms of representativeness that have been identified in the literature. A thematic analysis of 52 interviews with organisations and stakeholders active in the area of food and nutrition policy in England. UK explores these competing modalities of representation and how they are used both to claim legitimacy for self and to discount the claims of others. Different scripts of representation are deployed by various stakeholders and there is evidence of the strategic and the simultaneous deployment of different representativeness claims. The notions of expert representativeness permeate other modalities of representativeness, suggesting that the dominant framework for food and nutrition policy development is based upon technocratic models of decision-making. This highlights the way in which public views can be distanced from the framing of policy questions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper starts from the premise of a 'food, energy and environment trilemma' (Tilman et al., 2009), where all demands to expand the area of cultivated land present high risks of increasing the carbon footprint of agriculture. Having reviewed the main drivers of demand for food and for liquid transport fuels, the paper weighs the controversies surrounding biofuels arising from food-price spikes, the demand for land, and consequent direct and indirect land-use change. It suggests that we need a more complex, and geographically differentiated, analysis of the interactions between direct and indirect land-use change. The paper then reviews evidence of land availability, and suggests that in addition to technical availability in terms of soil, water, and climate, political, social, and technological factors have significantly shaped the competition for land in different global regions, particularly the three major biofuel producing ones of the USA, Brazil and Europe. This point is further developed by reviewing the different innovation pathways for biofuels in these three regions. The main conclusion of this review is firstly that any analysis requires an integrated approach to the food-energy-environment trilemma, and secondly that strategic political direction of innovation and sustainability regulation are required to bring about major shifts in agriculture leading to sustainable intensification of cultivation (Royal Society, 2009), rather than the continued expansion of cultivated area. The consequent perspective is one of considerable global variety in technologies, agricultural productive systems, and use of natural resources. This contrasts sharply with the world of a dominant global and integrated technology platform based on petro-chemicals to which we have become accustomed.

This framework identifies both the initial level of on-farm infection and the potential for new infection post farm-gate as key parameters influencing the relative effectiveness of on-farm and abattoir interventions. In addition, the potential for cost economies of scale in implementing interventions at abattoir compared to on-farm is shown to be a further factor determining the relative cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Overall, it is suggested by the analysis in this paper that successful abattoir interventions will typically be more cost-effective than successful on-farm interventions.

Financial support for farmers during the conversion period has been made to help expand organic production as this was seen as a barrier to conversion. Meanwhile, farmers have been marketing products produced in this conversion period and labelled as such, the extent to which is described here for the UK, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland and Italy. Consumers' attitudes towards, and willingness-to-pay for, conversion-grade food in these countries is examined. It was found that consumers would be prepared to pay a premium for conversion-grade produce of around half the premium for organic produce with vegetables attracting a higher premium than meat. Finally, the potential of policies for marketing conversion-grade products to encourage more conversion is examined, together with barriers to achieving this. It is concluded that barriers to marketing such products, particularly from retailers, will be formidable. Thus, alternative policies are suggested. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The agricultural system of rice, wheat, and barley production on selected farms in the southern Murray Darling Basin in Australia is used as a case study. Further insights are gained through a review of the data published in pre eminent journals. Together the analysis indicates that boosting water productivity and improving energy use efficiency in crop production operations are the two possible pathways to reducing the environmental footprints of water and energy inputs in food production.

FDA or general health claim, however, did not change the behavioral intentions of regular soy users. These results suggest that soy consumption status moderates the impacts of health claims on behavioral intentions.

However, in assessing the impacts of soaring food prices on urban consumers' access to food it is important to consider food price changes relative to changes in per capita incomes. In this study, we use the case studies of Zambia and Kenya, where data are available on food prices, wage rates, incomes, and other indicators of urban purchasing power to answer two main questions: (i) how did staple food purchasing power at the height of the food price crisis compare to levels over the last 15 years? and (ii) did the food price crisis exacerbate an already declining trend in staple food purchasing power, or did it reverse a trend of stable or improving staple food affordability? Results indicate that staple food purchasing power in urban Zambia and Kenya improved markedly in the 10-12 years prior to the food price crisis. Most measures of bread and maize meal affordability at the start of the crisis in 2007 were at levels 1.0-4.3 times higher than in the mid-1990s. These gains for urban consumers were slashed but not completely reversed during the food crisis. Between 2007 and 2009, maize meal and bread were still more affordable in urban Zambia than all periods between 1994 and 2003. In urban Kenya, staple food purchasing power as of 2008/2009 was comparable to levels in 2000/2001-2004/2005 according to some indicators, while other measures suggest that the food price crisis reduced staple food purchasing power to levels lower than any other year in the period 1994/1995-2007/2008.

A conceptual model is derived and tested via structural equation modeling on a sample of 222 rural consumers. The results show that attitude is explained by consumers' food safety concern, ethical lifestyle and price perceptions. Attitude partially mediates the effects of ethical lifestyle and price on intention to purchase organic produce as well as the effect of ethical lifestyle on intention to purchase free-range produce. Attitude assumes a more central role in fully mediating the effect of food safety concern on intention to purchase organic produce, as well as the effect of price on intention to purchase free-range produce.

Developing policy in such situations is affected by varying stakeholder perspectives on the issues. This study uses the UNICEF malnutrition framework and a rapid assessment methodology to compare how stakeholders at community, provincial and national levels describe the food and nutrition situation. Consistent differences in problem definition by administrative level and between agriculture and health sectors were apparent. Stakeholders at all administrative levels widely agreed on the need to improve incomes and employment to ensure food security because of the many constraints to agricultural production. Provincial and national level stakeholders further agreed on the need for nutrition education at all levels of society.

J,"Gadema, Z; Oglethorpe, D",,,,"Gadema, Zaina; Oglethorpe, David",,,The use and usefulness of carbon labelling food: A policy perspective from a survey of UK supermarket shoppers,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon footprint; Carbon label; Food policy: sustainable development; Behavioural change; Consumer demand,HEALTH,"Both the process of carbon footprinting and carbon labelling of food products are currently voluntary in the UK. Both processes derive from the UK's policy for sustainable development and in particular, the UK's Framework for Environmental Behaviours that strongly advocates a social marketing approach towards behavioural change. This paper examines whether carbon footprinting and labelling food products, borne from an overarching policy imperative to decarbonise food systems, is a tool that will actively facilitate consumers to make 'greener' purchasing decisions and whether this is a sensible way of trying to achieve to a low carbon future. We do so by drawing from a survey exploring purchasing habits and perceptions in relation to various sustainability credentials of food products and particularly 'carbon', using a combination of descriptive and cluster analysis. The data, from 428 UK supermarket shoppers, reveals that whilst consumer demand is relatively strong for carbon labels with a stated preference rate of 72%, confusion in interpreting and understanding labels is correspondingly high at a total of 89%, primarily as a result of poor communication and market proliferation. Three statistically distinct clusters were produced from the cluster analysis, representing taxonomies of consumers with quite different attitudes to carbon and other wider sustainability issues. Whilst the majority of consumers are likely to react positively to further carbon labelling of food products, this in itself is unlikely to drive much change in food systems. As such, the data imply that a concerted policy drive to decarbonise food systems via voluntary carbon footprinting and labelling policy initiatives is limited by a fragmented and haphazard market approach where retailers are being careful not to disaffect certain products by labelling others within the same category. Consumers may want to make choices based on the carbon footprint of products but do not feel empowered to do so and relying on consumer guilt is inappropriate. The paper concludes that the establishment of effective linkages between food policy and food market actors to drive a targeted and coherent carbon labelling policy is needed. This would provide consumers with the opportunity to make informed choices, especially within food product categories and negate the need for retailers to depend on the demand side of the supply chain to achieve carbon reduction targets.

Moreover, farmers' preferences have rarely been considered. Here, we address these gaps by analyzing different market channels for sweet pepper in Thailand. Using data from a survey and choice experiment with farmers, we find that there is a general preference for marketing options that do not involve a contract. Additional provision of inputs and credit can increase the attractiveness of contracts. Yet, the most important factor for farmers is to personally know the buyer they deal with, which may be related to issues of trust. Some policy implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrary to recent analyses of overall trade disputes, the results show that some determinants such as legal capacity and monetary means are not statistically significant.

These findings are set in the context of international risk communication research. The findings are examined using the three basic elements of a simple communications framework: the message sender; the channel through which the message is communicated and the receiver of the message. The barriers to effective communication are examined and special reference is made to the barriers affecting the communication of domestic food safety risk. Barriers identified include personal, infrastructural and message related factors, such as lack of interest, lack of appropriate facilities and conflicting messages. Based on an evaluation of the views of the scientific community and the public, we make suggestions on how future food safety communications could be tackled to better address the identified barriers. Both suggested long and short term policies are considered in the context of a heterogeneous public and scientific community. Short term suggestions provide an opportunity to address the challenges faced by those who are currently exposing themselves to a high level of domestic food safety risk.

To assist vulnerable rural households improve their food security, the British Department for International Development implemented a seed relief program from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 that emphasized recycling of maize open pollinated varieties (OPV). Using data collected from 597 households in six districts in 2006, this study assesses the effectiveness of the program in terms of its targeting of beneficiaries, the flow of information from participating NGOs to beneficiaries on the need to recycle the seeds, and the level of recycling done at the end of the program. The empirical results suggest that the targeting method participating NGOs use inadvertently excludes relatively vulnerable households while including large proportions of relatively well-endowed households in the program. The choice of varieties to distribute is guided more by the ecological adaptability of available commercial seeds and less by preferences of beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the fact that seed selection information is critical in encouraging beneficiaries to recycle distributed seed, not all of them received it. In conclusion, it may be stated that the program undoubtedly contributed to increased food productivity by vulnerable households but its overall effectiveness could have been enhanced through (i) the involvement of the beneficiaries in the choice of types of seed to be distributed, (ii) better targeting of beneficiaries, and (iii) improved information flow between NGOs and beneficiaries.

For developing countries, which produce 90% of the world's output, aquaculture is a source of protein, employment, income and of foreign exchange. Southeast Asia is an area which has experienced this blue revolution. Total aquaculture output in the region increased from less than two million tonnes in 1990 to more than eight million tonnes in 2006. Moreover, the region's pace of expansion has accelerated. Annual average growth rates in output from 2000 to 2006 were more than double those from 1990 to 2000. Already more than a quarter of food fish in Southeast Asia comes from aquaculture. Aquaculture matters because fish products are important in the diet of much of Southeast Asia. The population generally has a high per capita consumption of fish, and fish are a major source of animal protein in a region where levels of animal protein are below the world average. Output from the capture fisheries has increased but growth rates are slowing. To maintain present levels of per capita consumption of fish in the region, whose average population is projected to grow by 16% by 2015, requires continued expansion of aquaculture. The paper focuses on commercial or profit-oriented aquaculture. It produces protein, but also rural employment and income. It also has the potential to generate taxes for governments and foreign exchange, and by improving economic efficiencies and competitiveness hold down the cost of aquatic products. Contributing to food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth, aquaculture is an important and growing sector in the region and merits study.

Retailers impose more stringent standards than what is mandatory. An example is EurepGAP, a quality standard for good agricultural practices that imposes traceability as a main obligation. This research investigates the choice of traceability at the farm level in the Portuguese pear industry. Results suggest that in this industry farm-level adoption of EurepGAP traceability is best explained by the choice to sell to the United Kingdom (UK). For farmers selling to the UK, the odds of choosing the EurepGAP traceability level are significantly linked to membership in particular producer organizations, farm productivity, producing products under a protected designation of origin (PDO), and farmer's age. While retailers and farmer organizations seem to drive traceability, policy adjustments may be required to reduce adoption costs upstream and extend compliance among producers that sell directly to consumers and market independently.

There is, however. great variation in the socioeconomic configuration of this value chain. In some regions of India, the cultivation of tree-borne oilseeds is organised in a social forestry mode, in which poor landless people are paid to perform reforestation tasks and receive usufruct rights to collect oilseeds; in other regions, peasant cooperatives, subcontracting arrangements between farmers and transnational corporations, or large-scale plantations are promoted. There are also many different end uses and ways of processing biodiesel, from village-level projects for rural off-grid electrification to large scale processing.

For the 2004-2005 season, FT-organic growers received an average premium of 12.8 cents per pound. yielding a gross income gain of 5% of total household income or about 26 dollars per household member. The gain is net of the costs of cooperative participation but not of other costs incurred to become certified and suggests that price premiums alone have a limited potential to increase household returns from growing coffee. More broadly speaking, the finding raises questions about the persistence of substantial price premiums associated with social or environmental labeling initiatives.

Within these households, distinguishing the incidence of food insecurity between adults and children is often difficult because most surveys rely on the reports of adults. In this paper, we address this shortcoming of previous work by using a survey from over 6000 households in Zimbabwe where interviews were conducted with both an adult caregiver and a child. Using two measures of food insecurity, we find that reports of adults and children differ within households with lower reports of food insecurity among children, with children in the youngest age groups particularly being protected from food shortages. An exception to this general rule, though, is in better-off households where children are often more likely to be food insecure than adults. Findings also demonstrate the need for multiple measures to comprehensively capture the full picture of food insecurity in the household. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing an instrumental variable approach to control for the endogeneity of migration, our results indicate that short-term migration has a positive effect on overall per capita food expenditures, per capita calorie consumption and food diversity. Long-term migration also appears to be positively related to consumption, but impacts are often insignificant and of a lesser magnitude than short-term migration. The results provide no evidence of negative effects of migration, and support the view that short-term migration is a mechanism by which households maintain food security. The results suggest that to improve food security the Vietnamese government should enact policies that facilitate short-term migration flows as well as the transferring of remittances.

In contrast, over-consumption, particularly of over-refined cereal-based foods, has contributed to the development of an epidemic of metabolic diseases in some developed countries. This review highlights recent progress in modifying crops and agronomic practice to increase health benefits. Mineral concentrations or bioavailability in crop edible parts can be increased by fertilisation, breeding or biotechnology. It is also possible to modify crops using transgenic technology to enable or increase the biosynthesis of vitamins and long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, or to modify the composition of starch or dietary fibre. Although technologically feasible now or in the near future, the development of micronutrient biofortified or composition-modified crops would also depend on other factors such as consumer acceptance, cost, regulations and national or international intervention.

We present a comprehensive literature review, supplemented with qualitative data obtained from interviews with experts in the field, to examine the policies and practices designed to ensure the safety of food produced by the Chinese aquaculture industry. The food safety system has many parts that are administered by different governmental organizations with poor coordination among them. The system apparently operates as two entities: one for products destined for the export market and based largely on the requirements of importing countries, and the other with lower standards and levels of enforcement for domestic market products. The top-down approach focuses more on the end product rather than the production practices. There are several indications that regulations pertaining to antibiotic use are not being followed. Recent events have brought the issue of overall food safety to the attention of the Chinese public and the Government is acting positively towards addressing deficiencies of the system. Chief among these is the Food Safety Law which comes into effect in June, 2009. But the central government must work in concert with provincial and local authorities to improve the infrastructure for inspecting and tracking food from farms to the end consumers to ensure a greater degree of safety of aquatic food for the Chinese population.

Increasing urbanization and corresponding changes in consumer preferences, behaviour and purchasing power are the identified causes for the rise of supermarket-processor dairy chains. This study shows also that emerging dairy chains provide new market opportunities to Ethiopian farmers, but the existence of retail-industrial monopolies and monopsonies jeopardize farmers' economic benefits to a great extent.

In South Asia, Nepal has the lowest per capita income, highest dependence of population on agriculture and second highest poverty rate. At the same time, Nepal has the lowest average tariffs in South Asia and has taken several steps to downsize its public food distribution system and remove a host of agricultural subsidies. The outcomes from these policy reforms in Nepal are mixed. Aggregate indicators of food sufficiency and security (per capita food availability, extent of malnourishment) show improvement in Nepal since liberalization. Relative to other South Asian countries, Nepal is doing better on some indicators, like extent of undernourished population, while on other indicators, like stunting of children, Nepal is actually doing the worst. More importantly, the gains from liberalization across regions in Nepal have been uneven. The reason for such an uneven outcome is lack of complementary policies from the government that would lead to spatial integration of markets (e.g. the creation of physical and marketing infrastructure). Liberalization has in effect reinforced the ex-ante hierarchy across regions in Nepal. The paper then reviews the role and reform of the Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) within this broader context.

Pesticide treatment histories are almost always unknown, especially on imported produce, posing an empirical question: to what extent do FDA's residue testing methods used on imported produce correspond to the pesticides used on the crops? In this article I show that FDA residue testing would have missed residues of the majority of pesticides used on two crops exported to the US from Costa Rica in 2003, suggesting that FDA residue testing on imported produce is inadequate in its coverage.

Using a polynomial distributed lag structure for agricultural research within a simultaneous system of equations framework, this paper first demonstrates that agricultural research contributes significantly to productivity growth in SSA. Productivity growth is again shown to raise per capita incomes, with income increases finally having significant poverty-reducing effects. With an aggregate rate of return of 55%, the payoffs to agricultural research are also impressive. Agricultural research currently reduces the number of poor by 2.3 million or 0.8% annually. While the actual impacts are not large enough to more than offset the poverty-increasing effects of population growth and environmental degradation, the potential impacts of agricultural research are far greater. Apart from low research investments, SSA faces several constraints outside the research system that hinder realization of potential research benefits. The results show that doubling research investments in SSA would reduce poverty by 9% annually. However, this would not be realized without more efficient extension, credit, and input supply systems.

There is a striking and worrying degree of inconsistency when one compares available estimates, which is due to methodological and empirical problems associated with all three approaches. Hence, the true extent of food insecurity and undernutrition is unknown. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of each approach and make concrete suggestions for improvement, which also requires additional research. A key component will be the planning and implementation of more comprehensive, standardized, and timely household surveys that cover food consumption and anthropometry, in addition to other socioeconomic and health variables. Such combined survey data will allow much better assessment of the problems' magnitude, as well as of trends, driving forces, and appropriate policy responses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although government-implemented cash transfer schemes have gained popularity throughout Latin America, these schemes are just emerging in Africa. While where there is evidence of the beneficial impact of cash transfers on food security from Latin American countries, there is a dearth of evidence from resource poor countries in Africa. In order to fill this gap, we conducted a longitudinal, randomized community control study of the pilot SCTS in Mchinji, Malawi from March 2007 to April 2008. In this study, we describe the impact of approximately US$14 per month on food security among recipient households compared to control households using indicators of food consumption and expenditures and dietary diversity. We present compelling evidence, whereby each of the tested outcomes yields large effect sizes that are highly statistically significant, demonstrating a sizeable impact of cash transfers on food security and food diversity in rural Malawi. The SCTS appears to be an effective tool within the National Social Welfare Policy for improving food security in the country's destitute households. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing these effects is complex in multiple-product, multi-process supply chains such as the dairy industry. In this study, we develop a spatially-disaggregated transshipment model for the US dairy sector that minimizes total supply-chain costs, including assembly, processing, interplant transportation and final product distribution. We employ the cost-minimizing solution as benchmark to compare alternative scenarios of increased supply chain localization. Our results indicate: (1) short-run limits to increased localization, (2) modest impacts on overall supply-chain costs, and (3) large cost re-allocations across supply chain segments, regions and products. We find that increased localization reduces assembly costs while increase processing and distribution costs. Cost increases are larger in regions with smaller raw milk supplies and during the season when less raw milk is produced. Minimizing distances traveled by all dairy products results in tradeoffs across products in terms of cost and distance traveled. The relationship between increased localization and costs appears to be nonlinear. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, I describe how the peak of the worldwide food price crisis affected anthropometric statistics among young children in El Salvador, and how households with access to international migrants were not affected as negatively as households without such access. In 2008, El Salvador experienced food price inflation of 15%, and the evaluation of Red Solidaria, El Salvador's conditional cash transfer program, shows that height-for-age (HAZ) Z scores among children under 3 years old declined by 0.2 standard deviations on average. In this paper, I use the Red Solidaria evaluation data to assess whether children in households with access to remittances or international migrants were better off than households without access to migration income. Using both repeated cross-sectional data and individual panel data. I find that as theory would expect, children in households with access to international migrants have much lower declines in their HAZ scores. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

From the beginnings of the consumer society until the present day the modernization process has made its imprint on the guidelines public bodies have issued to the public on caring for their health and diet. Beginning in the sixties with a welfare idea of a healthy diet, very typical of the decade, and meant for a population with nutritional problems, today we have guidelines for an overfed population. The social trends dominant in each historical moment are shown throughout this transformation process and the dietary recommendations have been part of the social change. However, the perceptions of the administration itself on what constitutes a healthy diet have also made their mark on the criteria. The modernizing nature of the paternalistic administration of the sixties can be easily seen in contrast with the public bodies of the eighties competing with the messages from the food and agricultural businesses. As the 20th century drew to a close, dietary advice was in keeping with a background dominated by considerations on the nature of social change and in which both public bodies and citizens trusted in the truths of science as a reference point for correct action. At the beginning of the 21st century reflexivity and questioning of scientific power appear and also an increase in public preoccupation with food risks. Each stage is analysed relating historical background and dietary recommendations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It uses a price comparison methodology (nominal rates of assistance-at the border and the farm-gate), with adjustments for exchange rate distortions in the first part of the sample period (1981-1994). On average, distortions to agricultural incentives have been reduced. In the early 1980s, on average, China's domestic prices were far below international prices. There were substantial variations, however, between imported (which were being protected) and exported goods. During the 1980s and 1990s the gap between domestic and international prices for both imports and exports narrowed initially mainly due to the elimination of domestic policy distortions. Between the mid-1990s and 2004, trade liberalization policy furthered narrowed the gap between world and China farmgate prices.

However, for some subpopulations, consuming fish containing higher levels of methylmercury may pose a health risk. This research seeks to identify the impact of including a seafood warning disclosure in the advertisement of a can of tuna fish on consumers' purchasing behaviors. An experimental survey is employed to examine the resulting impact for two segments of the population - those considered at risk for methylmercury overexposure and all others. Findings indicate the use of warning disclosures increases respondents' negative product perceptions without significantly altering positive product perceptions. Attention to the warning is short-lived and does not significantly impact perceived healthful levels of consumption.

This is approached through an evaluation of a government-led programme in Tanzania, which is attempting to increase smallholder farmers' incomes and food security through a market-oriented intervention. Findings suggest that more mature groups with strong internal institutions, functioning group activities, and a good asset base of natural capital are more likely to improve their market situation. Gender composition of groups also affects group marketing performance, as an enabling factor for male-dominated groups. Structural social capital in the form of membership in other groups and ties to external service providers, and cognitive social capital in the form of intra-group trust and altruistic behaviour are not significant factors in a group's ability to improve its market Situation.

Using improved agricultural technologies can increase productivity in smallholder agriculture and thus raise household income and reduce poverty. Data from a nationally representative rural household survey from 2005 is used to assess the impact of four technologies - improved maize seeds, improved granaries, tractor mechanization, and animal traction - on household income in Mozambique. To ensure the robustness of the results, three econometric approaches were used: the doubly-robust estimator, sub-classification and regression, and matching and regression. The results show that, overall, using an improved technology did not have a statistically significant impact on household income. This may be associated with a widespread drought that occurred in 2005. Despite drought, distinguishing between households based on propensity score quintiles revealed that using improved technologies, especially improved maize seeds and tractors, significantly increased the income of those households who had better market access. Thus, to allow households to benefit from the use of improved technologies, policy makers need to reduce structural impediments to market participation by ensuring adequate road infrastructure and enabling access to markets.

Most studies that try to address this question suffer from flaws in sampling design, inappropriate metrics, and/or failure to measure biodiversity baselines. We discuss how these failings can be addressed, and what existing information tells us about the key debates on this topic. The evidence available suggests that trade-offs between biodiversity and yield are prevalent. While there are some wildlife-friendly farming systems that support high species richness, a large proportion of wild species cannot survive in even the most benign farming systems. To conserve those species, protection of wild lands will remain essential. Sustainable intensification could help to facilitate sparing of such lands, provided that as much attention is given to protecting habitats as to raising yields. We discuss the general circumstances under which yield increases can facilitate land sparing, recognising that policies and social safeguards will need to be context-specific. In some situations, bringing degraded lands into production could help reduce pressure on wild lands, but much more information is needed on the biodiversity implications of using degraded lands. We conclude that restricting human requirements for land globally will be important in limiting the impacts on biodiversity of increasing food production. To achieve this, society will need to integrate explicit conservation objectives into local, regional and international policies affecting the food system.

Whereas the total number of registered maize seed companies in major maize producing countries increased four-fold between 1997 and 2007, the quantity of seed marketed barely doubled suggesting that the seed production and deployment environment is less than perfect. A study involving over 92% of all seed providers in east and southern Africa in 2007 showed that a number bottlenecks affect the entire maize seed value chain. The lack of access to credit constitutes a significant barrier to entry. Until governments and development partners make credit available to seed entrepreneurs directly or through risk sharing arrangements with commercial banks, national seed companies will not grow leaving the seed sector monopolized by the regional and multinational seed companies. In addition, the transfer of genetic materials between public and private sectors should be improved to allow easy access by seed companies to suitable and adapted varieties. To allow for rapid regional spillovers of varieties released in one country to similar agro-ecologies in different countries, the implementation of the harmonized regional seed laws and regulations should be expedited. Finally, the best strategies that increase the adoption of improved maize varieties should be explored and implemented to enhance seed demand. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We begin with a historical analysis of the changes in leadership among producer countries, namely the dethroning of Cote d'lvoire by Costa Rica. We show that this geographical shift has been accompanied by massive organisational changes: the pineapple sector is increasingly driven by large downstream actors who derive their power from the ability to impose their definition of quality to the whole chain, and from economies of scale and scope. Although varietal innovation plays a key role throughout the period, commercial and logistical innovation are of increasing strategic importance. However, because of the constraints imposed by the concerned supply chains, small farmers risk being excluded or marginalized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We seek to analyse the supply chain and examine the benefits that are distributed to its various actors by comparing three different olive oil products: PGI, organic and conventional olive oil with the use of two dimensions: size of production and success of the producers. The data come from quantitative and qualitative research to different actors across the supply chain and from published and unpublished local and national sources. The findings indicate that olive farmers are cut-off from the benefits of the products to a great extent. Small bottlers are the ones that receive the most benefits, as they can ignore big retailers.

A pro-active emerging risk system for biofuel by-products is essential in order to prevent the occurrence of emerging hazards in feed and livestock production. In the current study, two biofuel by-products were elaborated upon, namely Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) resulting from bioethanol production and microalgae slurry resulting from biodiesel production. A holistic approach was used in which both factors from within the feed chain as well as outside the feed chain were incorporated. A list of critical factors linking dynamics in the biofuel production chain with possible feed safety risks was established after consultation of experts in in-depth interviews. Subsequently, a workshop was organized to determine the most important critical factors. Indicators (signals that indicate a change in critical factors) and information sources were linked to these factors for the individual cases. Based on expert judgment, the most important critical factors identified for the two selected cases were: chain complexity, composition of the feed product, origin of raw materials and climate change. Ranking of the indicators showed that in both cases the number of chain stages was the most important general indicator for feed safety risks. The study showed that following this approach resulted in the selection of critical factors and indicators for emerging feed safety risks related to the use of biofuel by-products. Once critical values (upper and/or lower limits) are assigned to the indicators, the system can support decisions to take actions in an early stage in order to prevent emerging risks in feed due to the use of DDGS or microalgae slurry.

First, it investigates whether the estimation of the importance of sunk costs is sensitive to persistence bilateral (firm-destination) effects such as specific market knowledge compared to firm-specific effects such as managerial skills or product quality. Second, it analyses the effects of firm and market characteristics on firms' export decisions. Third, it tests whether the importance of sunk costs varies with destination as well as firm characteristics. The main results are: (1) that firm-destination effects are more important than general, unobserved firm characteristics, (2) that more productive and larger firms are more likely to export and that firms' expectations from exporting increase with market size and exchange rate stability, and (3) that the importance of sunk export costs varies with firm and market characteristics.

However, these goals have recently been challenged by emerging forces including climate change, water scarcity, the energy crisis as well as the credit crisis. This paper analyses the overall role of these forces and population growth in redefining global food security. Specifically, global water supply and demand as well as the linkages between water supply and food security are examined. The analysis reveals that the water for food security situation is intricate and might get daunting if no action is taken. Investments are needed today for enhancing future food security: this requires action on several fronts, including tackling climate change, preserving land and conserving water, reducing the energy footprint in food systems, developing and adopting climate resilient varieties, modernising irrigation infrastructure, shoring up domestic food supplies, reforming international food trade, and responding to other global challenges.

The level of specific support for organic farming is put into perspective, as other support payments and market returns contribute larger shares to total farm revenue in all the countries analysed. Modelling analyses show that support payments will continue to play an important role in the profitability of organic farms in Western Europe after implementation of the 2003 reform of Common Agricultural Policy in the EU.

We also find that producers and other supply chain participants should be concerned primarily with maintaining the appearance of pork products. Retailer specific factors such as location and type of outlet can also substitute for product traceability. Store location and product appearance, however, are complementary attributes.

However, evaluating the returns of public investment is limited by methodological challenges. We use hedonic and panel data methods to examine the returns to different types of rural public investments including roads, irrigation and extension advice. The use of diverse identification strategies reduces the risk of using a narrower set of results driven primarily by a particular methodology.

Data from 4130 households from the nationally representative 2005/2006 Ghana Living Standards Survey are used for the analysis. Since migrants self-select into migration, an instrumental variable approach is taken to analyze the relationship between migration and total food expenditures per capita, food expenditures across a range of food categories and shares of food expenditures across these categories. Overall, the results indicate that migration does not substantially affect total food expenditures per capita, and has minimal noticeable effect on food expenditure patterns. Looking at results in different settings, the analysis indicates that only in high migration regions does migration appear to increase overall food expenditures resulting in a shift towards the consumption of potentially less nutritious categories of food, such as sugar and beverages and eating out of the home. The results raise questions about the value of migration for improving the food consumption of migrant sending households. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we review the present state of production and dissemination of meteorological long-range (seasonal) forecast information and the use of such products in agricultural applications. There has been rapid development of dynamical prediction systems in particular, and several centres routinely provide seasonal forecasts of rainfall and temperature with global coverage. Currently the uptake of long-range forecast products by users has been limited, and the potential value is far from being attained. Various factors that inhibit usage are described. Further investment in the infrastructure is required, both in creating relevant specific products and in disseminating and applying them effectively. Investment in research is also required to investigate opportunities and beneficial strategies for a wide range of regions and activities, with closer interaction between the meteorological and agricultural communities and relevant intermediary agencies.

Managing soil organic carbon (C) is central because soil organic matter influences numerous soil properties relevant to ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Even small changes in total C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil physical properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil C are important for ensuring sustainability of all soil functions. Soil is a major store of C within the biosphere - increases or decreases in this large stock can either mitigate or worsen climate change. Deforestation, conversion of grasslands to arable cropping and drainage of wetlands all cause emission of C; policies and international action to minimise these changes are urgently required. Sequestration of C in soil can contribute to climate change mitigation but the real impact of different options is often misunderstood. Some changes in management that are beneficial for soil C. increase emissions of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) thus cancelling the benefit. Research on soil physical processes and their interactions with roots can lead to improved and novel practices to improve crop access to water and nutrients. Increased understanding of root function has implications for selection and breeding of crops to maximise capture of water and nutrients. Roots are also a means of delivering natural plant-produced chemicals into soil with potentially beneficial impacts. These include biocontrol of soil-borne pests and diseases and inhibition of the nitrification process in soil (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) with possible benefits for improved nitrogen use efficiency and decreased nitrous oxide emission. The application of molecular methods to studies of soil organisms, and their interactions with roots, is providing new understanding of soil ecology and the basis for novel practical applications. Policy makers and those concerned with development of management approaches need to keep a watching brief on emerging possibilities from this fast-moving area of science. Nutrient management is a key challenge for global food production: there is an urgent need to increase nutrient availability to crops grown by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Many changes in practices including inter-cropping, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing crops, agroforestry and improved recycling have been clearly demonstrated to be beneficial: facilitating policies and practical strategies are needed to make these widely available, taking account of local economic and social conditions. In the longer term fertilizers will be essential for food security: policies and actions are needed to make these available and affordable to small farmers. In developed regions, and those developing rapidly such as China, strategies and policies to manage more precisely the necessarily large flows of nutrients in ways that minimise environmental damage are essential. A specific issue is to minimise emissions of nitrous oxide whilst ensuring sufficient nitrogen is available for adequate food production. Application of known strategies (through either regulation or education), technological developments, and continued research to improve understanding of basic processes will all play a part. Decreasing soil erosion is essential, both to maintain the soil resource and to minimise downstream damage such as sedimentation of rivers with adverse impacts on fisheries. Practical strategies are well known but often have financial implictions for farmers. Examples of systems for paying one group of land users for ecosystem services affecting others exist in several parts of the world and serve as a model.

They are implemented by diverse agencies, and widely promoted: for instance the FAO alone managed 400 such projects between 2003 and 2005. However, seed aid suffers from a lack of critical attention, perpetuating widespread myths among practitioners, policymakers, and the larger humanitarian community. This paper challenges five predominant myths about seed aid: (1) seed aid is needed whenever food aid is; (2) seed aid can do no harm; (3) disasters wipe out seed systems; (4) effective implementation is a straightforward logistical exercise, and; (5) improved seed is the best form of aid. These myths are juxtaposed with recent empirical work across a range of countries, particularly in Eastern and Southern Africa. The perpetuation of such myths highlights a serious absence of scrutiny of emergency seed aid, and helps explain why such aid is repeated year after year in many sites, with little apparent positive effect. The paper argues that the invisibility of seed aid is a major cause for the lack of oversight and concludes that donors and farmer beneficiaries must become centrally involved in seed aid governance.

Using around 9000 farm surveys across Africa, we explore how farmers choose one of the farm types and how the net revenue of each type varies across the range of climate in Africa. The results indicate that an integrated farm increases in number while a specialized farm decreases across Africa under climate predictions for 2060. The relative profitability of each system against each other also changes. An integrated farm becomes relatively more profitable over specialized farms half a century from now. The impacts of climate change on integrated farms range from 9% loss to 27% gain depending on climate scenarios. Behavioral models can capture portfolio diversification benefits that agro-economic models cannot measure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The regulation has emerged as a non-tariff trade barrier for heritage foods from developing Countries that are viewed as exotic from the EU perspective. We show how the regulation has discouraged investment in supply chains and market development, and how this negatively affects income generation and rural poverty alleviation in developing countries. Focusing on plant-derived foods, this paper proposes to recognize traditional exotic foods in current EU law as a food category sui generis with food safety evidence requirements being proportionate to the risks they may pose. We argue that development activities promoting export food chains must increasingly accommodate legitimate food safety concerns about neglected food species in project design and seek to generate data to enhance regulatory acceptance in target markets.

In this paper, we assess the likely impacts of allowing FSP participants to purchase only healthy foods when using food stamps. Our results indicate that FSP participants would probably increase their consumption of healthy food, but the implications for their purchases of unhealthy food are not clear. Market-wide consequences are even less clear, because changing what may be purchased using food stamps would lead to higher prices for healthy foods and lower prices for unhealthy foods and these price effects would feed back into consumer decisions, with adverse effects on consumption patterns of both participants and non-participants in the FSP. In addition, more restrictive rules on the use of food stamps would discourage participation in the FSP. We conclude that, while reforming the FSP may indeed to lead to better diets among participants, it is likely to be an ineffective and inefficient instrument for bringing about desired nutritional outcomes unless accompanied by additional policy instruments.

J,"Bilgin, M",,,,"Bilgin, Mert",,,Scenarios on European energy security: Outcomes of natural gas strategy in 2020,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,METHODOLOGY; RENEWAL,"This paper adopts a futuristic methodology and analyzes the role of natural gas in European energy security in order to transform economic and policy uncertainties into meaningful scenarios. It implements trend analysis to forecast the volume of gas needed until 2020 by elaborating the estimates of the EU Commission and scenario building to come up with alternative futures forging different regional implications. The economic analysis stems from four scenarios as introduced by the EU Commission: (1) baseline scenario with average oil price of 61$/bbl; (2) baseline scenario with average oil price of 100$/bbl; (3) New Energy Policy scenario with average oil price of 61$/bbl; (4) New Energy Policy scenario with average oil price of 100$/bbl. The policy analysis is derived from the options, restraints, priorities and strategies of the concerned actors which include the EU Commission, selected EU members, suppliers and transit countries. The analysis on actors results in four policy scenarios: (1) Russia first; (2) Russia everywhere; (3) security first; (4) each for itself. The matrix, which excludes the possibility of unprecedented developments such as a drastic increase in European shale gas production or continuing global recession, clusters 16 contingencies. The paper, within this context, gives an idea on how alternative policy options of European energy security may lead to different futures based on oil prices, environmental commitments and strategic initiatives of the concerned actors.

Our results show that politicians maintain control over allocation of timber rights, that taxation constitutes an insignificant share of the value of the timber resource, and that the distribution of timber revenues hardly contributes towards the official forest policy justifications. Our analysis suggests that politicians wield control over rent-seeking opportunities that are exchanged for political support through patron-client networks.

Herein, we consider a management problem in which a bioeconomic system exhibits simultaneity in processes governing productivity and damage. In this case, it may benefit the producer to sacrifice productivity to reduce the costs associated with increased damage. We specify empirically a structural damage relationship that explains the biological process by which an invasive species damages a host and estimate the structural model and its reduced form with an exceptional dataset on infestation of olives by the olive fruit fly. We contrast the results of these models with the approach typically taken in the economic literature, which expresses damage as a function of pest density. The population-based approach introduces significantly greater bias into the individual grower's choice of damage-control inputs than estimates based on the structural model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Manned and robotic exploration throughout and beyond our solar system also fosters reconsideration of our obligations to future generations and allows for expansion of membership in the class that constitutes those generations. This paper argues that the concept of future generations should not be limited to Homo sapiens, as currently defined.

Some argue that when institutions reinforce similar incentives markets work best. Others disagree and argue that for markets to function well institutions must compensate for each other's shortcomings rather than reinforce each other's incentives. This paper uses evidence from the US financial crisis of 2008 to adjudicate this debate. It argues that different types of institutional complementarities are necessary in combination to ensure market stability and successful economic performance. Without such balance, complementarities that are beneficial for a while may go wrong later. In this regard, the paper also draws attention to the dynamic and historically specific nature of institutional complementarities.","[Campbell, John L.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Sociol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Campbell, John L.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Int Ctr Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",Dartmouth College; Copenhagen Business School,"Campbell, JL (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Sociol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",john.l.campbell@dartmouth.edu,"Campbell, John L/HNR-2256-2023",,,,,,83,61,65,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

It seeks to show an evolution away from a traditional focus on broad-based technological priority setting to a much more focussed and adapted set of applications. The inherent limitations of prioritisation processes are discussed. The more limited aim of articulating specific fields is noted. Recent trends in research and innovation policy have opened new opportunities for the application of foresight. Systemic and demand-side policies require a shared vision on the part of purchasers and suppliers. The role of foresight in such contexts needs both to be enhanced and better understood. An increasing structural focus for foresight exercises is associated not only with broader R&I system reform but also with an engagement with new-wave innovation policies. The success of demand-side measures such as cluster policies and the use of procurement or regulation to stimulate innovation is dependent upon the formation of a common vision between the supply and demand sides, opening the possibility for the application of foresight approaches. We note the emergence of a combination of corrective, disruptive and creative roles. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

When the firm is privately informed about the workers' performance, it can sharpen incentives by strategically disclosing the intermediate results. But the policies that enhance final-stage effort may dampen incentives at the intermediate stage. In our model, the optimal disclosure policy has a simple form: disclose only if all workers perform poorly. This result offers a novel justification for partial disclosure in performance feedback. Also, it contrasts with the existing literature that focuses on the extreme policies of full disclosure and no disclosure.","[Goltsman, Maria] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Mukherjee, Arijit] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Michigan State University,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",arijit@msu.edu,,"Goltsman, Maria/0009-0008-7765-1115",,,,,33,48,60,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Large scale fires are not part of the natural disturbance of tropical rain forests but this threat has increased in the last few decades. Under global warming, Indonesia is projected to have higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns. Southern Indonesia is predicted to be drier whereas the north is likely to become wetter. Inter-annual climate variability associated with phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation may cause big decreases in rainfall. This paper reviews the nature and extent of fire problem and the effectiveness of the current policy and institutional provisions in Indonesia in addressing forest fires under projected future climate change. We then consider possible strategies for improving their effectiveness. The review results indicate that first. Indonesia has enacted a number of regulations and established various institutions to tackle forest and other wildfires, but these have proved ineffective. Second, under future climate change scenarios and current fire management practices, Indonesia's tropical rain forests could be more susceptible to fire. Third, effectiveness could be improved by addressing the underlying causes of fires, involving a wide range of stakeholders in formulating the regulations and enhancing law enforcement.

Focusing on religiously affiliated mutual funds, I garner empirical evidence to investigate whether the moral orientation of investors impacts their financial market behaviour. I partition mutual funds into religious SRI, religious non-SRI, secular SRI and conventional funds and look for differences in levels of fund asset stability using data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) from 1991 to 2007. This stability refers to the extent to which investors hold on to their fund shares with little regard to past return performance and over all fund flow volatility. Religious SRI assets are found to be the most stable fund category and I adjudicate whether the structural characteristics of religious groups or the moral orientation of religious investors best explains this empirical finding.","Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Peifer, JL (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jared.peifer@cornell.edu,,,,,,,67,27,36,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

To understand this discrepancy between theoretical ambitions and actual practice with regard to accommodating change we followed professional futurists around. We observed that futurist curtail and slice time and we identified two temporal repertoires that inhibit different views on how (academic) knowledge about past and present is used in assessing the future: historic determinism and futuristic difference. Our empirically informed analysis is a story about ambitions in line with the futuristic difference, the re-introduction and rise of historic determinism and finally the fall of futuristic difference. Our analysis of foresight in action and foresight output yields that the retreat to historic determinism is a major pitfall for futurists in general. Our story suggest that the futures studies community needs to develop and encourage more adequate responses to the 'siren' of historic determinism. Practitioners who aim to employ futuristic difference throughout the foresight endeavour would then be better equipped to succeed in their ambitions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Its elaboration is an extremely important operation for the optimum results of cash flows, the timing of collection and payment to secure permanent payment ability for the company. Before proceeding to the elaboration of treasury budget, it is necessary to check the relations with the other budgets, such as the transport expenses and the sales. Also, the funds provisions should be made before the beginning of the new year and they could apply to periods as long as a day, a month, three months, a semester or a year, depending on the available dates or the payment deadlines of the company. The elements which bring information on the treasury, which appear in the yearly financial reports offer the possibility to estimate the incomes and payments if there are taken into consideration the debt deadlines on short term. If we consider that in the activity of any company, debt, available funds and duties appear permanently, the information offered by the annual accounts turn out to be insufficient for the normal activity of a company. Taking into consideration the fact that the treasury budget is the result of other budgets, its control will allow making a first estimation for the whole activity. Also, it refers to the following aspects: making available, at the most appropriate time, the cash necessary for the company, identifying in good time the differences between the provisions and the accomplishments in order to adopt the necessary correction measures and to establish responsibilities. Finally, the efficiency of the treasury management depends on the quality of the estimates, but also on the intelligence of the correction measures. Research has shown that daring budgets lead to the improvement of the company results. The inability to reach the levels required in the treasury budget is often perceived as failure, although keeping to the budget provisions should not become a purpose in itself","[Budugan, Dorina; Georgescu, Iuliana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,dorina.budugan@uaic.ro; iuliag@uaic.ro,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI, FACULTY ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADMINSTRATION",IASI,"22 CAROL 1ST BLVD, IASI, 700505, ROMANIA",,,978-973-640-658-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,223,227,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BZM22,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302002900036,0

Reflections on the problem of value and time a propos an awkward practice in medical research,JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,clinical trials; research; value; benefits; gift; money; Kenya; Africa,RESEARCH SUBJECT,"Based upon Kenyan ethnography, this article examines the gap between the bioethics aversion to value transfers in clinical trials, and research participants' and researchers' expectations of these. This article focuses upon so-called 'transport reimbursement' (TR): monetary payments to participants that are framed as mere refund of transport expenses, but which are of considerable value to recipients. The interest in this case lies not so much in the unsurprising gap between regulatory norms and poor study subjects' lives, but in the way in which this discrepancy between bioethical discourse and materialities of survival is silenced. In spite of the general awareness that TR indeed is about the material value of research, about value calculation, and expectations of return, it is not publicly discussed as such - unless ironically, in jest, or in private. This double-blindness around 'reimbursement' has provoked discussions among ethicists and anthropologists, some of which propose that the work that generates scientific value should be recognised as labour and participants, accordingly, paid. Here, this paper argues that such a re-vision of trial participation as work rather than as a gift for the public good, risks abrogating the possibility of 'the public' that is not only a precondition of public medical science, but also its potential product. The supposedly radical solution of tearing away the veils of misrecognition that 'free' gifting ideology lays upon the realities of free labour, though analytically plausible, fails to recognise the utopian openings within clinical trial transactions that point beyond the present - towards larger forms of social association, and towards future alignments of scientific possibilities and human lives.","[Geissler, P.

Natural resource management on public lands generates many interesting policy issues as the competing goals of conservation, recreational opportunity provision, and revenue generation often clash. As demand for recreational cave diving sites increases, this article provides natural resource site managers with the first statistical estimate of divers' willingness to pay (WTP) to dive cave and cavern systems. Using a contingent valuation model (CVM) and correcting for hypothetical bias, we find that divers' median WTP for cave diving opportunities at the site of interest is between $52 and $83 per dive. Model results also provide weak evidence of diver sensitivity with respect to scope, as individuals are willing to pay more for dives that are judged to be higher in quality.","[Huth, William L.] Univ W Florida, Dept Mkt & Econ, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA; [Morgan, O.

This article studies the potential for cooperation in straddling stock fisheries when the cooperative coalition of countries acts as a Stackelberg leader against the remaining singleton countries. Within the Stackelberg fishing game with several interested parties, the result shows that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state fish stock, but also in the total rent of the fishery. Further the outlook for cooperation is better within the Stackelberg game, where the cooperative coalition acts as a leader than in the Cournot game. At the stable equilibrium of a Stackelberg game, not only is the steady-state fish stock higher but also the total resource rent, participants' rent, and non-participants' rent are higher than those of the Cournot-Nash stable equilibrium. The new-entrant issue is a problem jar the conservation of fish stock in the Stackelberg game. Self-financed transfers with commitments of the initial stable coalition will increase the level of cooperation. The theoretical findings are illustrated by a numerical example of how to reach stable fell cooperation and used to indicate possible ways forward for the South China Sea fisheries.","[Le Kim Long] Nha Trang Univ, Nha Trang City, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam; [Flaaten, Ola] Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",Nha Trang University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Long, LK (通讯作者)，Nha Trang Univ, Nha Trang City, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam.",lekimlong@gmail.com; olaf@nfh.uit.no,", Le Kim Long/AAI-3988-2020",,[SRV2701],,"The authors are grateful to project SRV2701 for financial funding and two anonymous reviewers of this journal for their helpful comments on previous drafts.

This paper tries to establish the current trends in financing car acquisitions in Romania for both new and second -hand automobiles, investigating also the evolution and correlations with the main factors that affect car sales and consumer brand preferences.","[Micuda, Dan] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ, Pitesti, Romania; [Cruceru, Gheorghe] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University; Transylvania University of Brasov,,dan.micuda@gmail.com; g.cruceru@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",2502-0226,2558-9652,978-973-598-940-8,PR INT C BUS EXCELL,,,2011,,,,,,,306,309,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH82,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000316634500075,0

While point estimates differ, particularly when earnings equations are estimated for the smaller samples of subgroups of the workforce, the general findings are robust to this measurement issue.

Research in industrialized countries suggests that such programs are sometimes ineffective, because they mainly attract relatively clean participants free-riding on unrelated pollution control investments. We use plant-level data on more than 100,000 facilities to analyze the Clean Industry Program, Mexico's flagship voluntary regulatory initiative. We seek to identify the drivers of participation and to determine whether the program improves participants' environmental performance. Using data from the program's first decade, we find that plants recently fined by environmental regulators were more likely to participate, but that after graduating from the program, participants were not fined at a substantially lower rate than nonparticipants. These results suggest that although the Clean Industry Program attracted dirty plants under pressure from regulators, it did not have a large, lasting impact on their environmental performance.

This approximation to teacher quality is appropriate in a country like Venezuela as opposed to the US since the rigidity of the tertiary school system significantly limits mobility between majors. I combine data from the national college entrance examination from 1984 to 2003 with labor market data from the household surveys to construct a panel of data for quintiles of the test score distribution and age groups by states. The results suggest that teacher wage premia and wage dispersion have little effect on the quality mix of applicants to teaching. Most students' preference for teaching is unresponsive to wage levels relative to other occupations and to wage growth prospects within teaching. If wages have a positive effect on the performance of educational systems, this paper argues that it is unlikely to be through the selection of the most talented individuals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A driving force behind the expansion was believed to be the Student Loan Fund (SLF), introduced in 1996. During the first 10 years of its operation, the SLF has lent to more than 2.6 million students, with the loan value totaling $5.7 billion. However, there has been no systematic evaluation of the scheme. This paper provides a very first attempt to evaluate the SLF.

This study examines the above issues using five-minute intraday transaction data and performs an ex post test of arbitrage, ex ante test of arbitrage, and regression analysis.

I examine how UA arises from three interrelated dimensions of metabolic rift-ecological, social and individual. By rescaling production, reclaiming vacant land and 'de-alienating' urban dwellers from their food, UA also attempts to overcome these forms of rift.

Most studies find evidence for inefficiency but provide no theoretical explanations for differences in efficiency. This study used principal agent theory to explain differences in efficiency between hospitals. Two agency issues are examined: (1) quality of care in the relationship between hospital and patient, and (2) internal organisation, i.e. the relationship between the hospital and its main departments. It was found that efficiency and quality go together. This implies that the potential harmful information asymmetry between hospitals and patients does not appear to be a major problem, because increasing efficiency does not seem to reduce quality. Further, we find no relationship between the efficiency of departments and the efficiency of the entire hospital. The interest of hospital departments is currently not in line with the interests of the entire hospital.","[Ludwig, Martijn; Van Merode, Frits; Groot, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Med & Life Sci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Groot, W (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Med & Life Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",w.groot@beoz.unimaas.nl,"Van Merode, Frits/AHA-2021-2022","Van Merode, Frits/0000-0003-1918-3487",,,,,34,36,42,3,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Scenarios are a common technique for investigating the future, but can be time consuming and challenging to develop, particularly when more than a single organisation is involved. An approach is presented here which shifts the focus of scenario building from the company level to the sector level, whereby a range of organisations engage collectively on a topic of mutual importance. A rapid technique was developed, with simple scenarios being constructed in 2-4 h. This process was implemented in 13 multi-organisational workshops with participants from the construction and building industries, sectors which are traditionally short-term and reactive in their outlook. The resulting feedback, observations and experiences are discussed, together with examples of how the resultant scenarios have been applied. An example of causal map reflection (exposing an individual's causal map to others) is also presented, described and critiqued. It was found that the process was successful in engaging participants in thinking about and discussing the future, appreciating the interconnectivities of the related issues, and understanding the collective implications of their potential decisions, as well as facilitating the socialisation of participant thinking and the construction of collective futures.

In the vertical dimension, it has greatly reduced the range of autonomous policy choices in the member states, and it has helped to expand the reach of European competences. At the same time, however, 'integration through law' does have a liberalizing and deregulatory impact on the socio-economic regimes of European Union member states. This effect is generally compatible with the status quo in liberal market economies, but it tends to undermine the institutions and policy legacies of Continental and Scandinavian social market economies. Given the high consensus requirements of European legislation, this structural asymmetry cannot be corrected through political action at the European level.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Scharpf, FW (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",fs@mpifg.de,,,,,,,97,305,311,0,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

On the contrary, using the expected net future value criteria implies an increasing term structure of discount rates up to the largest possible interest rate. We reconcile the two approaches by introducing risk aversion and utility maximization. We show that if the aggregate consumption path is optimized and made flexible to news about future interest rates, the two criteria are equivalent. Moreover, they are also equivalent to the Ramsey rule extended to uncertainty. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

These programs aim to influence the accumulation of human capital, as well as reduce poverty. In terms of educational outcomes, a number of impact evaluation studies have shown that such programs have led to an increase in school enrollment, ensured regular school attendance and led to a reduction in child labor. Theoretically, such cash transfer programs may also be expected to exert a positive impact on students' test scores. but related empirical evidence is scarce. Accordingly, this paper evaluates the impact of a cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarrollo Humana of Ecuador, on students' cognitive achievements. The paper uses a regression discontinuity strategy to identify the impact of the program on second grade cognitive achievement. Regardless of the specification and sample used, we find no impact of the program on test scores, suggesting that attempts at building human capital, as measured by cognitive achievement, require additional and alternative interventions.

The vast majority of economic literature on license buyback programs focuses on the changes to economic efficiency of the fleet, often citing changes to the composition of fleet size. However, managers have little guidance in deciding how to structure a buyback auction, despite the fact that the auction structure plays a key role in determining which licenses are retired and in the composition of the remaining fleet. With the Texas Park and Wildlife Department's Inshore Shrimp License Buyback Program as a basis for auction design, this research uses three experimental treatments to analyze how individuals respond to various reverse auction structures. In terms of the quickest license expiration, our experiments suggest that fisheries managers should select a binding auction with no sequential quality. However, we find that managers would see higher average bids from fishers in comparison to the two sequential auctions. The results are also relevant to other environmental programs in which environmental services are purchased over time in a sequential reverse auction.","[Freeman, Matthew A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, AgCtr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Freeman, Matthew A.] Louisiana Sea Grant, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Woodward, Richard T.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Freeman, MA (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, AgCtr, 101 Agr Adm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mfreeman@lsu.edu; r-woodward@tamu.edu,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA04NMF4330080]; Texas AgriLife Research; Cooperative State Research, Education & Extension Service [TEX8604]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Texas AgriLife Research; Cooperative State Research, Education & Extension Service","We gratefully acknowledge the support for this research provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Fisheries Initiative grant #NA04NMF4330080.

The answers to the survey are statistically processed, in an attempt to objectify concepts which belong to the fuzzy realm of the spirit, and to draw conclusions regarding the evolution of the European culture, on these coordinates. While happiness is more often discussed, in relation to consumerism and to wealth, which led to the emergence of a recent trend trying to recover its immaterial nature, the relationship between happiness, religiosity and honour is seldom examined. This may serve as a motivation for the present study, whose conclusions show that apparently secular concepts, as honour and happiness, are instilled with a religious understanding of the world, which needs, after millennia of faith and deceit, to be redefined and explained.","[Lefter, Viorel; Cornelia, Mihaela; Vasilache, Simona] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lefter, V (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",vlefter@ase.ro; mihaela.c.dan@gmail.com; simona.vasilache@gmail.com,"Vasilache, Simona N/B-2909-2010; Dan, Mihaela Cornelia/AAP-5047-2021","Dan, Mihaela Cornelia/0000-0001-7907-742X",,,,,16,3,3,0,19,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We identified the maturity of the bonds and the local decentralization level as very significant factors for the interest spread. So, when the maturity of the loan increases, the effect is a decreasing spread. In the same time, as the municipality is more independent from the central budgetary resources, the municipal bonds become more credible. As effect, their remuneration is lower, proportionally with the smaller risk the investors assume. The most important risk we have to analyze in the municipal bonds area are the market risk, the liquidity risk and the credit risk. The premium attached to them has to reflect the coupon value, because every extra risk has to be remunerated. But our computation demonstrated that the coupon rate is smaller than it should be, because the liquidity premium was negative. So our conclusion is that Romanian municipal bonds we studied are incorrectly paid.","[Mosteanu, Tatiana; Lacatus, Carmen Maria] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Mosteanu, T (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",tatiana_mosteanu@yahoo.com; cmlacatus@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Demographics of the gay and lesbian population in the United States: Evidence from available systematic data sources. Demography,37(2),139-154: and others]. Yet there is very little scholarship on the experiences of sexual minorities in college. We discuss several ways that sexual orientation could matter for college outcomes, and we provide the first empirical evidence on this question by using confidential data on over 40,000 students from the 1997, 1999, and 2001 waves of the Harvard College Alcohol Study. We identify sexual minorities by using responses to questions about the sex of the respondent's lifetime sex partners. After conditioning on observable demographic characteristics and institution fixed effects, we find that (compared to their heterosexual peers): (1) gay males have higher college grade point averages and perceive their academic work as more important; (2) gay and bisexual males are more likely to report the presence of a faculty member or administrator with whom they could discuss a problem; and (3) gay and bisexual males place more importance on participating in student organizations, volunteer activities, the arts, and politics. Among females, we find that: (1) bisexual females are less satisfied with the education they are receiving, spend less time Studying, and perceive their academic work as less important; and (2) lesbian and bisexual females place more importance on participation in the arts and politics. These patterns suggest important and complex relationships between sexual orientation and college outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The need for remediation is particularly high among students who are low income, Hispanic, and black. Female students are also less likely than males to be ready for college-level math. This article estimates how much of these gaps are determined by the courses that students take while in high school. Using data on students in Florida public postsecondary institutions, we find that differences among college-going students in the highest math course taken explain 28-35 percent of black, Hispanic, and poverty gaps in readiness and over three-quarters of the Asian advantage. Courses fail to explain gender gaps in readiness. Low-income, black, and Asian students also receive lower returns to math courses, suggesting differential educational quality. This analysis is valuable to policy makers and educators seeking to reduce disparities in college readiness.","[Long, Mark C.] Univ Washington, Daniel J Evans Sch Publ Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Iatarola, Patrice] Florida State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Conger, Dylan] George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; George Washington University,"Long, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Daniel J Evans Sch Publ Affairs, Box 353055, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",marklong@u.washington.edu; iatarola@coe.fsu.edu; dconger@gwu.edu,,,,,,,39,67,157,0,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Since STAs are issued when ozone levels are predicted to exceed a particular threshold, we use a regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of STAs. We also use traffic conditions in Southern California, an area without STAs, to estimate difference-indifferences models.

To achieve this goal we applied the Future-Structured Mental Model Approach (Future-SMMA) and interviewed 10 farmers concerning their future perspectives and expectations to derive their future visions. Subsequently, 10 experts were interviewed about the feasibility and the consequences of farmers' future visions. Applying the Future-SMMA, we analyzed farmers' future visions and found that farmers take account of social and environmental threats and that their visions are optimistic. In addition we compared farmers' and experts' perceptions of external constraints on farmers' future and discovered that the future visions of farmers and experts were inconsistent. Finally, we determined how farmers' livelihood assets and self-perception influence the formation of farmers' future visions and found that the more a person was able to differentiate his livelihood assets the more differentiated were the future visions of that person. In discussing our findings, we deduce that the inconsistency of future visions found is due to diverging attitudes towards future scenarios and differing opinions about who should take responsibility for the knowledge management of farmers.

However, the existing difficulty in ensuring uniformity in these criteria as implemented by the INTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) necessitates resort to a universal scale for assessing the legitimacy of health and safety precautions by reference to an objective cost-benefit analysis. This paper attempts to apply the J-Value scale, developed in the United Kingdom, to gauge expenditures in industrial risk prevention, to evaluate the reasonableness of WTO Member State product safety regulations in a readily quantifiable, judicially instructive manner. The J-Value can be implemented by WTO panels ex post and government regulators ex ante in order to assess whether or not a specific measure aimed at ensuring human health and safety is actually an unnecessary barrier to international trade. In keeping with WTO principles, key features of the J-Value formula allow for different tolerances towards health risks depending on the view of the Member States that implement them, based on factors such as life expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).","City Univ London, City Law Sch, London, England",City University London,"Collins, D (通讯作者)，City Univ London, City Law Sch, London, England.",david.collins@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The observed mean surveillance cost was a,not sign 713. If French recommendations were strictly applied, the estimated mean cost would vary between a,not sign 680 and a,not sign 1,069 according to the frequency of abdominal ultrasound. The predicted determinants of cost were: age, recurrence, duration of surveillance since diagnosis, and adjuvant treatments.

Until recently, nearly all gender-segregated schools were private, and comprehensive data for public school comparisons are not yet available. To investigate the effects of single-sex education, I focus on within private sector comparisons, and additionally address selection bias using an index comparing expectations to outcomes and quantile regressions. Compared to graduates from private coed schools, girls' school alumnae are no more likely to pursue college degrees, and both genders are less likely to meet their own educational expectations. However, single-sex schooling may support gender equity, as single-sex schools yield the least segregated college major choices. On the other hand, higher mean starting salaries among single-sex school graduates do not persistent in regression results. Much of the benefit from single-sex schooling accrues to students already likely to succeed, but selection bias does not explain all gains. There are some benefits for African-American men and low income students. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines how visions of future society have been employed in climate science and multilateral negotiations. Using elements of utopian and dystopian thought, we have categorized UNFCCC documents, IPCC assessments, and special reports and peer-reviewed climate policy articles. Our results indicate that utopian thinking surfaces with reference to sustainable development and emissions scenarios. Such visions of future society fall into three categories: projections, dystopian thought, and utopian thought. Dystopian thought is mainly evident in the rhetoric of various actors, and is used to spur action or inaction, to avoid either economic catastrophe by acting too fast or ecological catastrophe by not acting fast enough. Utopian elements in climate change science and policy refer to decoupling greenhouse gases and economic growth, evenly distributing the benefits of economic globalization, and smoothing technological development. The present piecemeal invocation of sustainable development concepts in climate science and policy emphasizes the difficulties of integrating environmental, social, and economic concerns. The article concludes that utopian thinking regarding sustainable development could result in more integrated and holistic visions of future society in climate science and policy.

Assumptions about the form of the utility function, the depiction of preference heterogeneity, and the definition for the choice set are shown to jointly identify a partition of preference space which explains observed behavior. The borders of the partition reflect substitution patterns. The regions in the partition set-identify preferences. Assumptions about the distribution of preferences within each region point-identify partial equilibrium welfare measures. Together, these observations provide a framework for decomposing the structural identification of non-market values. The new framework allows analysts to explain how their modeling assumptions influence estimates for benefits and costs. This addresses federal guidelines for quantifying uncertainty in the modeling assumptions which enter benefit-cost analysis. The framework is demonstrated by decomposing estimates of the MWTP for air quality. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Our results show that while educational segregation has fallen substantially over our sample period, this has not translated into less occupational segregation.

We extend the analysis to the case in which factors move freely between the three goods, as in a Heckscher-Ohlin-type framework.

However despite the successful adoption of such systems in some countries around the world, economics continues to have relatively little influence on fisheries policy This lack of influence is particularly noticeable in developing countries, precisely where the contribution that effectively managed fish resources might make to the GDP is most urgently needed. The key requirement to increase the adoption of economically rational fisheries management is to convince policymakers to focus explicitly on the wealth-generating potential of fish resources. Such a focus provides a general policy framework within which other approaches, such as rights-based, incentive-based, and ecosystem-based, may be nested.

It upholds the salience not only of equality in opportunities but also equality in outcomes. The contribution argues that inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, and class undermine the ability to provision and expand capabilities, and it examines the macroeconomic policies that are likely to promote broadly shared development. It explores how the macroeconomy acts as a structure of constraint in achieving gender equality and in turn how gender relations in areas like education and wage gaps can have macro-level impacts. Further, it underscores that the interaction of the macroeconomy and gender relations depends on the structure of the economy, the nature of job segregation, the particular measure of gender inequality, and a country's international relations. Finally, it outlines policies for promoting gender equality as both an intrinsic goal and a step toward improving well-being.","Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Elson, D (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",drelson@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,36,40,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In Latvia, compared to the other world and European countries, the culture of shopping centres is a relatively new phenomenon. Shopping centres in Latvia, especially in the capital city, gradually become not only the centres for shopping, but also for entertainment and recreation. The research hypothesis - the location of shopping centres in Latvia depends on the economic development of regions. The research aim is to assess the location of shopping centres in the districts of Latvia. The research showed that a rapid emergence of shopping centres took place in Latvia during 1999-2006 when annually 7 new shopping centres were opened on average, half of which were located in Riga. Therefore in 2007, a large number of shopping centres and large leasable areas for retail commerce were concentrated in the city of Riga, and this market is saturated, while in other districts of Latvia the niche of shopping centres is relatively empty, especially in the North-Eastern border area of Latvia. In Latvia, the largest leasable areas and a large number of shopping centres are located in clusters with a high (in Riga) and medium (in the districts of Riga, Jelgava, Liepaja, and Daugavpils) level of economic development. Only one shopping centre (in the districts of Bauska, Saldus, Kuldiga, and Madona) or not a single one (in the districts of Aluksne, Balvi, Gulbene, Kraslava, Limbazi, Ludza, Preili, and Valka) functions in the districts that are included in the cluster of the lowest economic development level in the country. It implies that the location of shopping centres in Latvia depends on the economic development level of a district. There is a potential for opening new shopping centres in the districts of Tukums, Aizkraukle, and Cesis in the future.","[Muska, Aina; Ozolina, Ilze] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ, Dept Business & Management, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,,"Muska, Aina/AAG-5994-2019","Muska, Aina/0000-0001-9646-6806",,,,,5,3,3,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,189,197,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700024,0

The Greenseeker (GS) uses pulses of red and near infrared light to determine the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In contrast with airborne imagery, this active optical approach is independent of sky conditions and offers side-views of the canopy. We collected both GS data and airborne imagery during the 2006 through 2007 growing seasons on two research juice grape blocks and a commercial wine grape vineyard all located in south-central Washington State. Overall, the imagery-based NDVI values were higher than the side-viewing GS in both juice grapes and wine grapes; the age of the leaves doesn't explain this result. The analysis to date demonstrates that (1) accurate (sub-meter) GPS locations are critical for research in trellised perennial crops such as grapes, and (2) additional analysis is needed to determine the best approaches for spatial interpolation of the GS data.","[Perry, E.

A John Deere eGator was used as the autonomous vehicle. The sensors used for executing the maneuver are video camera, laser radar (ladar), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and wheel encoder. The video camera and the ladar aid in detecting and navigating the headland. The sweeping ladar aids in accurately determining the end of the row. The yaw angle measured by the IMU provides the vehicle-turning angle, and the wheel encoder is used for speed control and dead reckoning to confirm end of row. The headland turning maneuver of the vehicle was tested in a citrus grove. Performance measures of the vehicle, while executing the maneuver, are reported. Headland turning ability combined with row navigation ability enables an autonomous vehicle to completely navigate a citrus grove.","[Subramanian, V.; Burks, T.

The SAMs are constructed in an innovative way that allows for the economic dependency and utilization of natural resources, especially marine resources, to be examined in detail. The SAM utilizes data from a mix of publically available secondary sources and data collected directly from local governments. The SAMs are then subjected to an economic base analysis to develop indices of economic dependence. The results of this study indicate that while fishing and fish processing are no longer a major source of gross measures of output, employment, wages, or gross regional product (GRP) in any state or even county on the West Coast; from an economic export income perspective cities such as Westport, Washington are heavily dependent on these industries for their economic base.","[Watson, Philip] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Beleiciks, Nick] Oregon Employment Dept, Salem, OR 97311 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Watson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, POB 442334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",pwatson@uidaho.edu; nick.beleiciks@state.or.us,"Watson, Philip/AAW-7523-2020","Watson, Philip/0000-0002-0540-2370",NOAA Fisheries; Northwest Fisheries Science Center,NOAA Fisheries(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Northwest Fisheries Science Center,The authors thank NOAA Fisheries and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center for their support of this research.,,17,11,11,0,8,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Prominent among these are high school exit exams, standardized tests that, in some states, students must pass to earn a high school diploma. Proponents of these tests argue that by incentivizing students, they induce them to work harder and, therefore, improve their high school performance and, perhaps, longer-run outcomes; some of these proponents argue that these exams would be even more helpful if they were set at a higher standard. Critics worry that these exams prevent some students from graduating and cause others to dropout; they contend that these effects are worse if standards are higher. In this paper we investigate the impacts of an increase in the exit exam standard in Florida. Using difference-in-difference methods, we show that this had few of the negative effects claimed by critics. We cannot detect any positive effects of the higher standard, although such effects may be too small to be picked up with our data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Explanatory variables include economic, social, demographic and institutional variables as well as variables related to capacity and production technology in the health care sector. The study applies a co-integrated panel data regression approach to derive short-run relationships and furthermore reports long-run relationships between health care expenditure and the explanatory variables. Our findings suggest that there is a positive short-run effect of ageing on health care expenditure, but that the long-run effect of ageing is approximately zero. We find life expectancy to be a more important driver. Although the short-run effect of life expectancy on expenditure is approximately zero, we find that the long-run effect is positive, so that increasing life expectancy leads to a more than proportional, i.e. exponential, increase in health care expenditure.","[Bech, Mickael; Christiansen, Terkel; Lauridsen, Jorgen] Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Khoman, Ehsan; Weale, Martin] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England",University of Southern Denmark,"Bech, M (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, JB Winslowsvej 9B, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.",mbe@sam.sdu.dk,"Bech, Mickael/G-2588-2011","Weale, Martin Robert/0000-0002-2016-0437; Lauridsen, Jorgen T./0000-0001-9889-6236; Bech, Mickael/0000-0003-3084-2068; Christiansen, Terkel/0000-0001-5674-5712",,,,,28,32,35,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, I argue that under certain circumstances, import-dependent firms may very well be able and willing to mobilize politically and defend their anti-protectionist trade interests in the political arena.

The findings reveal that BTL from sustainably managed forest biomass and woody waste may have a lower overall environmental impact than fossil diesel. The benefits of using BTL instead of fossil diesel are largely due to savings in fossil energy use, which offer savings in GHG emissions since a large part of the lifecycle CO2 emissions are biogenic. Improvements in the impact category photosmog or summer smog have also been reported. On the other hand, wood based BTL may increase eutrophication and acidification, and increased ozone depletion and toxicity may also be expected. While global indicators like climate change, non-renewable resources and ozone depletion are fairly easy to interpret, the local indicators such as eutrophication, acidification, photosmog and toxicity are site specific, and an LCA will not take into account where, when and at which rate the emissions occur, which are important parameters when estimating local pollution effects. In addition, increased logging or the establishment of short rotation plantations may impact biodiversity, land-use changes and the value of nature. The reported results differed when assessing the same fuel due to differences in methodology and data assumptions. For the methodological part, differences in system boundaries, system completeness and chosen allocation methods contributed to the ranges in results. Differences regarding data inputs, such as plant efficiency and fuel consumption were also important for the differences in results. The most influential or sensitive factors within the reviewed studies were the assumed type of feedstock, plant efficiency and drivetrain. The reported production costs of BTL are in the range of 0.70-1.12 euros per liter. The costs are largely influenced by plant scale, biomass costs and plant efficiency. Biofuels are generally not considered a cost effective climate mitigation means, but there are no other feasible solutions than biofuels for the heavy transport sector in the short to medium term.

However, teachers' classroom practices and the teaching 'process' may matter more to student learning than teachers' observed resume characteristics (such as certification and experience). There may also be important differences in teacher characteristics across government and private schools which may help explain the large documented public-private achievement differences often found ill studies. This paper delves into the black-box representing 'teaching' to uncover the teacher characteristics and teaching practices that matter most to pupil achievement. This is done using unique school-based data, collected in 2002-2003 from government and private schools from one district in Punjab province in Pakistan. The data allow exploitation of an identification strategy that permits the matching of students' test scores in language and mathematics to the characteristics of teachers that teach those subjects. Within pupil (across subject rather than across time) variation is used to examine whether the characteristics of different subject teachers are related to a students' mark across subjects. The data are also unique in asking all subject teachers questions pertaining to their teaching practices and these, often unobserved, 'process' variables are included in achievement function estimates. Our pupil fixed-effects findings reveal that the standard resume characteristics of teachers do not significantly matter to pupil achievement. Perversely, however, teachers are found to be rewarded with higher pay for possessing these characteristics, highlighting the highly inefficient nature of teacher pay schedules. Our findings also show that teaching 'process' variables matter significantly to student achievement. There are important differences across school-types. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth of Foresight and Futures Studies as a discipline has been less robust than the internal logic of the field would predict, potentially indicating an opportunity for theoretical renewal. Foresight is often justified on managerial grounds, with the argument that a discipline is needed to guide decision-making in a technologically aggressive, post-industrial society. Some within Foresight and Futures Studies have argued for the active development of alternatives to these managerial justifications. However, the links between Strategic Management and Futures Studies are robust and the embrace of cross-disciplinary dialogue has proven invigorating in some other disciplines. An evaluation of the goals and logic of Foresight from the standpoint of mainstream Strategic Management gives a novel perspective on the field, highlighting its importance to information processing. Finally, Foresight speaks to well-established normative problems with short-term biases in managerial contexts.

We then use data from the Department of Energy's Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Registry to compare reported reductions to actual emissions. We find that participants in the program engage in highly selective reporting: in the aggregate, they increase emissions over time but report reductions. In contrast, non-participants decrease emissions over time. Participants tend to be large firms facing strong regulatory pressure; pressure from environmental groups reduces the likelihood of participation, suggesting such groups viewed the program as a form of greenwash.

The present study differs methodologically from others reported in the literature. The underlying hypothesis is that members of the public have an aversion to patients being in a severe health state irrespective of the reason for their being there, and that this aversion will affect the social valuation of a health program after taking account of the magnitude of the health improvement. This effect will be observable in a program which (compared to another) takes a person out of a severe health state-the usual case discussed in the literature-or in a program which (compared to another) leaves a person in a severe health state. The present study tests this second implication of the hypothesis. We present data consistent with the view that after taking account of health improvement, health programs are preferred which do not leave people in severe health states. Alternative explanations are considered and particularly the possibility that data reflect a social preference for individuals achieving their health potential. Both explanations imply the need to reconsider the rules for prioritising programs. In this analysis, Person Trade-Off (PTO) scores are used to measure social preferences ('value' or 'social utility') and Time Trade-Off (TTO) scores are used to measure individual assessments of health improvement and initial severity. Econometric results suggest that severity is highly significant and may more than double the index of social value of a health service.","[Richardson, Jeff R.

This paper argues that the WTO's Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) could play an important role in defusing the trade-disrupting potential of SPS regulation. The most promising avenue is to review in greater detail the policy-making procedures that lead to SPS measures. How transparent and independent are countries' risk assessments of health hazards? Which provisions have countries taken to account for trade effects when selecting SPS measures? Do countries give foreign interests adequate possibility to voice their concerns over proposed SPS regulation? If reviews motivate countries to improve their policy-making processes, this will contribute to making SPS regulation less trade-restrictive and more effective in protecting health. To reach this objective, special trade policy reviews dedicated exclusively to SPS regulation might be introduced as a complement to the current reviews of countries' overall trade policies. Such a move could serve as a model for establishing further issue-specific reviews that address technical barriers to trade, trade in services, and other complex regulatory challenges.","ECIPE, Brussels, Belgium",,"Zahrnt, V (通讯作者)，ECIPE, Brussels, Belgium.",valentin.zahrnt@ecipe.org,,,,,,,56,3,3,2,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2011,10.0,2,,,,,217,247,,10.1017/S1474745610000418,0.0,,,31,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,763UC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290584200003,0

This would result then in a deterioration of the wage share and rising inequality within developing countries. In 1980s, Turkey implemented liberalization policies to promote globalization of the Turkish economy by raising trade and capital flows. Using a sectoral panel data, this paper shows that low-wage competition followed by trade liberalization reduced the wage shares in the manufacturing industry. The analysis also exhibits that the financial liberalization and rising capital flows hurt workers by increasing macroeconomic volatility, leading to financial crises that affected the functional income inequality.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Oyvat, C (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",coyvat@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,52,11,15,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Nevertheless, it is a sign of our era and essentially results from the legal pluralism that characterizes it. Increasing adjudication also makes the study of this concept even more fascinating. The phenomenon of fragmentation manifests itself with particular tension in international trade law. Private interests and commercial transactions can be irreversibly affected by the absence of legal security or, worse, by the existence of contradictory rulings delivered by adjudicating bodies, which constantly compete for increasing jurisdiction and thus influence. This article reviews the discussion of fragmentation of international Into and critically analyses the problem of absence of coherence in regulating trade. By focusing on adjudication, permissible sources of law, and interpretation, it argues for more openness towards non-trade law when interpreting trade rules.","[Delimatsis, Panagiotis] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Delimatsis, Panagiotis] WTI, Bern, Switzerland",Tilburg University; University of Bern,"Delimatsis, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.delimatsis@uvt.nl,"Delimatsis, Panagiotis/JNS-9156-2023","Delimatsis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-4121-1555",,,,,123,25,25,1,12,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The Swedish environmental policy is based on 16 environmental objectives that national authorities are responsible for. They are evaluated annually and also in-depth every fourth year. Here we describe and explore a futures study project for introducing a more long-term thinking in the work with the environmental objectives, tested in the in-depth evaluation 2008. An experience was that it is difficult to design a collective scenario work in a case with a wide variety of objectives and with individuals with different backgrounds. However, this difficulty makes it even more important to incorporate futures studies in authorities work. Scenario work is often subcontracted, leading to a constant lack of futures studies competence and thinking at the authorities. Another experience is that despite the difficulties, experts at the authorities did start thinking more in terms of opportunities with futures studies. A general conclusion from the work was that there is an interest and need for futures studies at the authorities in charge of the environmental objectives. The possibly most important conclusion from this project was that the authorities need to build up their own competences in futures studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) for 1996-2007, the paper finds that hours of paid work increase life satisfaction for both men and women, while housework hours are statistically significant only for retired men and women. Childcare (for children ages 3 to 4 years) and caring for adults affect women's life satisfaction negatively but are statistically insignificant for men. Some of these differences might be explained by the fact that women and men in the sample assign differing weights to satisfaction with different life dimensions.

However, despite their usefulness, most large firms in the US have not granted such indexed options. According to academic research (Hall and Murphy (2003)) on executive stock options, the probability of expiring in the money is too small to be an incentive for risk-averse executives to work more efficiently. In addition, in bear markets even a typical indexed option model (Johnson and Tian (2000b)) can provide payoffs to executive that are too high with regard to their performance. This paper develops a new indexed option model with different implications from those of existing indexed option models. First, this paper shows that the new indexed option has higher probability of expiring in the money than existing indexed options. Second, it finds that the existing indexed option can generate excess rewards to even poorly performing executives in bear markets, and that averaging indexed options can remedy this problem.","Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Kim, HS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea.",fstar@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This paper takes Carroll's stakeholders-social responsibility matrix as theoretical foundation, summarizes the characteristics of economic status and CSR of foreign-funded enterprises in China's economic transition period, and elaborates the connotation of CSR of foreign-funded enterprises from five dimensionalities (that is, economic responsibility, legal responsibility, ethical responsibility, philanthropic responsibility, and environmental responsibility) and seven aspects (stakeholders, customers, employees, governments, communities, business partners, and other non-governmental organizations), which will help foreign-funded enterprises perform CSR practically and make contribution for the development of global economy and common prosperity of human society.","[Liu Xiaqing; Dou Yuting] Shandong Inst Business & Technol, Coll Foreign Studies, Jinan 264005, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University,,liuxiaqing111@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,6,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-56777-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,150,154,,,,,,5,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BZX98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303279700023,0

The novelty in this dispute was the EC attempt to broaden the concept of what constitutes an appealable measure. The EC challenged whether a WTO decision regarding zeroing could apply to subsequent proceedings that might modify duty levels and asked the AB to decide whether the United States' continued use of zeroing in the context of a given case was consistent with WTO obligations. The AB stated that in its attempt to bring an effective resolution to the zeroing issue, the EC is entitled to frame the subject of its challenge in such a way as to bring the ongoing use of the zeroing methodology in these cases, under the scrutiny of WTO dispute settlement.

The paper is based on a wider study of farming systems in Timor Leste. One of the main challenges faced by farmers is the low productivity and quality of the produce. This is due to current farm management and post-harvest practices as well as the lack of farm inputs. Product quality is a problem due to poor product handling. Marketing is hampered by the poor transport and road network system, inadequate communication, the lack of storage facilities, and the lack of a grading and standardisation system in the industry. Given the high local demand for vegetables and the potential for exports, it is important to address these challenges for producers to benefit from market opportunities and to increase their incomes. Dealing with these challenges will require a whole value chain approach.","[Rola-Rubzen, M. F.; Janes, J. A.; Correia, V.

In particular, this paper uses a case study approach to compare a failed 'value-adding' company with a similar but successful farmer company. The evidence revealed weaknesses in institutional and managerial arrangements within both companies but the flaws ran much deeper in the failed company. To achieve best practice, it is recommended that (i) all directors be nominated only by shareholders; (ii) proportional voting rights replace democratic voting rights; and (iii) share trading between shareholders be permitted and facilitated. Facilitators should allow shareholders to set company objectives; ensure that they understand its institutional arrangements and apply good governance practices; help new companies to establish processes for developing and implementing business strategies; and have a clearly defined exit plan to focus on capacity building rather than managing.","[Rosairo, H.

Total crew hours dedicated to fishing activities remained roughly constant, while employment in redundant pre- and post-season activities declined due to the consolidation of quota on fewer vessels. We find little evidence of substantial changes in the share contracts used to compensate fishermen. Finally, we explore a wide array of remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the post-rationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined as a result of a combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of paying for fishing quota in the new system.","[Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Garber-Yonts, Brian] NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Bldg 4, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wilen, James E.] Giannini Fdn, Davis, CA USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Abbott, JK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Joshua.K.Abbott@asu.edu; brian.garber-yonts@noaa.gov; wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center,NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This work was funded by the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center.,,38,12,17,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The purpose of this article is to engage with the legal scholarship on the principles that are relevant to innovation. To date, the discussion has focused on two distinct approaches - what may be termed the economic and the fairness perspectives. The former may be seen as a justification for the current regime, while the latter has focused on the perceived needs of workers (in large part in opposition to the employers). Our argument is that these two approaches are both incomplete. In an attempt to get closer to a workable framework for the effective allocation of benefits, we offer a third approach; one that is based on the practices that are central to the employer-worker relationship.(1)","[Dent, Chris] Melbourne Law Sch, Intellectual Property Res Inst Australia, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fenwick, Colin] Melbourne Law Sch, Ctr Employment & Labour Relat Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Newitt, Kirsten] Ergon Associates, London, England",,"Dent, C (通讯作者)，Melbourne Law Sch, Intellectual Property Res Inst Australia, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",c.dent@unimelb.edu.au,"Dent, Chris/R-1155-2019","Dent, Chris/0000-0002-1801-713X",,,,,56,5,6,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

J,"Lim, CL; Wang, JY",,,,"Lim, C. L.; Wang, JiangYu",,,China and the Doha Development Agenda,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In contrast to early predictions during its accession, China has not sought to play a leadership role in the Doha Round negotiations or to rewrite WTO rules in a systemic manner. However, China's role in the negotiations came into prominence during the 'mini-ministerial' held in Geneva in July 2008. Now included in the seven-member group (G-7), China came under fire from the United States and the European Union for failing to demonstrate greater leadership. This article seeks to explain the nature of that criticism and argues that over-reliance on the question of 'Chinese leadership' as an explanatory concept could aggravate broader misperceptions about China's position in the Doha Round. According to these misperceptions, China has 'broken cover' and that it has become more 'assertive' while becoming more 'protectionist'. In other words, there is the view today that China has emerged as a fresh obstacle to the conclusion of the Doha Round talks. This article analyses that misreading and argues that an analysis of China's position in the negotiations must be tempered by a more nuanced understanding of certain tensions and mixed positions within China's overall approach. The article seeks to explain China's current position in the goods negotiations, on agriculture and non-agricultural market access, and in the services and rules negotiations. It also tries to explain the complexities of China's alignment with developing country members and how that is likely to translate into various negotiating positions on specific issues. Finally, the article discusses a range of factors that are likely to play an important, continuing role in shaping China's perception of specific trade issues and, more importantly, its perception of the overall worth of an eventual outcome to the Doha Round. These range from China's reflections on the success of the 2001 accession process, its domestic political constraints, the emergence of a successful FTA programme, and resort to out-of-WTO aid for developing country nations, as well as the potential longer term impact of the current global economic crisis.","[Lim, C.

At the same time, the core group played a fundamental role and was the key in explaining the forum's success. Without this group, the forum's performance would have been considerably diminished, probably down to a level that would not justify its existence.","[Bravo, Giangiacomo] Univ Turin, Dept Social Sci, Turin, Italy; [Bravo, Giangiacomo] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Bravo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Social Sci, Turin, Italy.",giangicomo.bravo@unito.it,"Bravo, Giangiacomo/I-2081-2013",,,,,,57,11,11,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This paper uses probit and ordered probit models to forecast central banks' direct interventions in the foreign currency markets as a result of exchange rate volatility using data from three transition economies with varying dollarization ratios. We show that, in these three economies, central banks' interventions can be predicted to a degree by measuring dollarization as the ratio of dollar-deposits to M2 monetary base.

However, past literature failed to explain status dynamics such as mobility in the status order where highly uncertain goods make quality hard to measure. This paper contributes to the understanding of this relationship by identifying various social mechanisms behind quality evaluation processes. It also explores why certain products are considered to be more valuable than others. The results demonstrate that only through exchange relations and active participation in the marketplace (what I call status actions) can actors affect the social definition of what are perceived as high-quality products. The results also provide evidence of two major market outcomes: conservativism and centralization. The findings improve the understanding of the evolution and dynamics of status in uncertain markets from both micro- and macro-sociology of markets. These processes are illustrated in a study of the art market in Israel.","Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Corp Reputat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Yogev, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Ctr Corp Reputat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",tamar.yogev@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,39,47,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Despite the fact that publication/launch dates of the first books/research projects on Futures Studies go back to few decades ago, it is only in the past few years that promotion of this discipline has gained momentum. Our aim in this paper is to present an overview of the development of Futures Studies in Iran since 1960s. We briefly explore the history of Futures Studies in Iran and explain why it has taken a technocratic line, as opposed to other possibilities (e.g. corporatist, environmentalists, citizen visioning (anticipatory democracy), etc.). In particular, we present an analysis of an ongoing and comprehensive foresight project whose objective is to provide Iranian top decision makers with a set of scenarios concerning future developments in a number of areas of science and technology until 2025. The main argument of the paper is that in response to the demands made by the policymakers, Iranian scholars, academics and technologists are trying to equip themselves with the latest techniques and know how for long-term planning and vision-building. However, due to various limitations the ride has not been an easy one. To overcome the obstacles, those who are at the forefront of developing indigenous versions of technological and theoretical aspects of Futures Studies have resorted to the method of trial and error and learning through doing. The paper critically examines the weaknesses and points of strength of this approach in the context of Iran. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To the contrary, the author suggests that the Futures community's failure at changing the existing 'market driven paradigm' has more to do with... an unwillingness to get our hands dirty and to play in the same sandbox as our clients. To that end the author targets in particular, a piece suggesting that making the Causal Layered Analysis more complex, exclusionary and 'new and improved' is the best way to make inroads into the economic liberalism model now in control.

After accounting for the joint endogeneity, we find that environmental innovation is an important driver of reductions in US toxic emissions.

Other cancer indications are mentioned in order to illustrate current approaches of cancer in Portugal. Current national data on cancer patients are scarce and there are divergencies in methods of data collection and treatment amongst regional cancer registries. However, the available data is sufficient enough to understand the dimension of CRC, with age-standardised incidence of 37 per 100,000 and mortality of 31 per 100,000 annually. An ongoing project is restructuring health services to improve efficiency and quality, however, some problems exist. The regional inequity of access to health care facilities and long waiting times for diagnostic examinations and surgery are major examples. Despite the non-availability of clinical guidelines, a pilot screening programme started at the beginning of 2009 in the Centre Region of the country.

The value of these forests for human use, coupled with the difficulty of determining whether a forest stand is occupied by nesting marbled murrelets, poses a dilemma for land managers. Should they implement a costly survey to gather information on whether a potential nest site is occupied, or should they allow human use, effectively assuming the site is unoccupied? This article demonstrates the application of the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) as a framework for addressing this question. The analysis yields a policy in which the optimal action is a function of the decision-maker's subjective probability that a potential nest site is occupied by marbled murrelets. By incorporating stochastic state dynamics and the choice of Whether to invest in learning, the POMDP provides a formal representation of adaptive management when active learning is possible.","Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Silver Spring, MD 20901 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Tomberlin, D (通讯作者)，Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20901 USA.",david.tomberlin@noaa.gov,,,,,,,21,13,13,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Today we are ill-suited for the challenges we face, and those who hold power too often lack the mind and integrity needed to use it wisely. Organizations by their very nature often act irrationally.

Forces are in motion that cannot be stopped. Conditions including global warming, mass starvation, and political instability continue to worsen. As global warming has made all but the extreme northern and southern hemispheres uninhabitable, the remaining diminished populations there lose contact with each other.

In particular there is a clear difference between discourse as knowledge and discourse as ideology. Epistemically the two are very different. with each making different types of claim. The paper examines the influence of an ideological discourse on international forest policy, namely neoliberalism. A variant of classical liberalism, neoliberalism emphasises an increased role for markets, an enhanced role for the private sector and voluntary regulation. It is argued that all three of these principles have systemically penetrated the international soft law on forests that has been negotiated since 1992 and up and including the 2007 Non-Legally Binding Instrument on all Types of Forests. Neoliberal policies also underpin forest certification schemes and the tradeable emission permits systems adopted under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. Adopting a Foucauldian approach the paper views the construction of neoliberal discourse and its reiteration in the forests issue area as an expression of power that establishes the limits of international forest policy, tending towards certain policies and inhibiting the selection of others. It is argued that contrary to what is often asserted, neoliberalism depends on a strong state, one that introduces market-based disciplines to new areas and creates political space that can be occupied by private sector businesses.

This paper examines the potential utility of 'strategic foresight' in considering possible housing futures for Australia. It examines the particular foresight methods employed, and processes used, to develop possible housing futures in the year 2025 and their policy implications. The paper concludes that foresight analysis, although not without its problems, creates the opportunity to move beyond current thinking and 'path dependent' policy parameters, enabling discussion of housing futures in a way that prompts critical discussion of the institutional arrangements and policies that shape housing policy in the present.

In 2001, WTO Members began working towards a solution to this problem. Their work led to a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS obligations and a proposal for a formal amendment of the TRIPS Agreement. However, the waiver remains underutilized and the amendment still lacks the necessary support of WTO Members for it to come into effect, suggesting that Members need to re-evaluate their commitment to affordable medicines while testing the workability of the waiver before snaking it permanent. Moreover, the potential of bilateral approaches to the problem of access to medicines for developing countries in the context of international trade is not being realized. On the contrary, preferential trade agreements concluded with the United States (US), in particular, are extending patent protection and diminishing flexibilities available under the TRIPS Agreement to address public health concerns. A pattern of contradictions exists between the WTO rhetoric on the one hand and Members domestic frameworks, bilateral agreements, and unilateral actions on the other. When it conies to attaining a coherent approach under international law towards reconciling patents and public health, the outlook is bleak.","[Mitchell, Andrew D.; Voon, Tania] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Mitchell, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",a.mitchell@unimelb.edu.au; tania.voon@unimelb.edu.au,"Mitchell, Andrew D/AAO-3714-2021","Mitchell, Andrew D/0000-0001-8399-8563; Voon, Tania/0000-0001-7925-9389",,,,,41,25,25,1,19,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Results show that farmers are willing to spend an additional amount of about 28% of Current pesticide expenditure for avoiding health risks. The validity of results is established in scope tests and with a two-step regression model. WTP depends oil farmers' experience with poisoning, income variables, and Current exposure to pesticides.

Compared to its predecessor, the GAT-17, the WTO applies a much more detailed and legalistic approach to accession, due to its broader scope of policy coverage and the enforcement powers of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. In WTO accession cases, WTO incumbent members have a superior bargaining position. The present study provides evidence that the elapsed time from WTO application to accession has increased with the number of completed accessions, suggesting a process of learning by WTO members to bargain for more demanding concessions from applicants. Regarding the terms of accession, the number of rules commitments has increased, and the level of bound tariffs has fallen, as the number of completed accessions has increased. In view of the difficult cases remaining in order to complete universal WTO membership, the author proposes more flexibility in accession requirements, along the lines of the GATT tradition.","Babson Coll, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA",Babson College,"Jones, K (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA.",kjones@babson.edu,,,,,,,54,19,20,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2009,8.0,2,,,,,279,314,,10.1017/S1474745609004261,0.0,,,36,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,449YE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000266366200001,0

We consider inflation targeting as an institutional arrangement with far reaching consequences for the distribution of power between different state agencies. Therefore, like other processes of institutional change, its adoption is not the simple outcome of smooth processes of learning and acceptance of more rational and efficient practices. Rather, it is the result of political conflicts among state actors seeking to improve their positions in the political-economic field. On the basis of a detailed study of the political conflicts that emerged around the adoption of inflation targeting in Israel between the central bank and the Ministry of Finance, we illustrate the contested character of the institutionalization of the neo-liberal policy paradigm and highlight the actions of local political actors as a major mechanism through which worldwide diffusion of institutional practices takes place.","[Rosenhek, Zeev] Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Raanana, Israel; [Maman, Daniel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Open University Israel; Ben Gurion University,"Rosenhek, Z (通讯作者)，Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Raanana, Israel.",zeevro@openu.ac.il,"Maman, Daniel/B-1200-2008; Rosenhek, Zeev/J-3187-2019","Maman, Daniel/0000-0002-7656-8722; Rosenhek, Zeev/0000-0001-8739-7378",,,,,65,20,23,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We draw on a body of social theory concerned with the way that meaning is produced and assimilated by society: specifically, the social construction of knowledge, which is distinguished from its near-neighbour constructivism by its focus on inter-subjectivity. We show that social constructionism, at least in its weak form, seems to be implicit in many epistemological assumptions underlying futures studies. We identify a range of distinctive methodological features in foresight studies, such as time, descriptions of difference, participation and values, and examine these from a social constructionist perspective. It appears that social constructionism is highly resonant with the way in which knowledge of the future is produced and used. A social constructionism perspective enables a methodological reflection on how, with what legitimacy, and to what social good, knowledge is produced. Foresight that produces symbols without inter-subjective meaning neither anticipates, nor produces futures. Our conclusion is that foresight is both a social construction, and a mechanism for social construction. Methodologically, foresight projects should acknowledge the socially constructed nature of their process and outcomes as this will lead to greater rigour and legitimacy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Crop Adapted Spray Application (CASA) system will consist of three sub-systems: i) Crop Health Sensor - CHS, ii) Crop Identification System - CIS, and iii) Environmentally Dependent Application System - EDAS. The Crop Health Status (CHS) is to be determined by a spectral sensor that analyses light reflected from apple leaves in the bandwidth 400-1600nm. With this sensor a plant stress due to apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) or powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha) infection is identified in real time in order to determine the dose and timing of chemicals according to the crop health situation. For target identification (CIS), a new ultrasonic sensor has been developed that delivers real time data on target characteristics such as tree canopy width and density, based on the echo signal of ultrasound reflected from the fruit trees. A spray application system was also developed to apply variable, site-specific spray volume according to the tree width and density at different tree levels. In order to protect sensitive areas neighboring the orchards, the environmental circumstances will be identified (EDAS): wind velocity/direction by ultrasonic anemometer and orchard boundary, and sensitive areas such as surface water, melioration wells, sensitive crops, public areas, etc. by GIS/GPS. EDAS is being developed to adjust application parameters according to the wind situation and sprayer position in relation to sensitive areas. Nozzles can be altered to adjust droplet size; a novel fan construction allows the supporting airflow to the left and right hand sections of the nozzle to be adjusted independently, so that spray distribution is optimized and spray loss is minimized.","[Doruchowski, G.] Res Inst Pomol & Floriculture, Dept Agroengn, Skierniewice, Poland; [Balsari, P.] Univ Turin, DEIAFA, Grugliasco, Italy; [Van de Zande, J.] Wageningen Univ, Plant Res Int BV, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Turin; Plant Research International; Wageningen University & Research,"Doruchowski, G (通讯作者)，Res Inst Pomol & Floriculture, Dept Agroengn, Skierniewice, Poland.",,"Doruchowski, Grzegorz/AAP-4341-2020","Doruchowski, Grzegorz/0000-0002-4413-6474",European Commission [016279],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Thanks to European Commission for financial support within the ISAFRUIT project (contract No.: 016279), Paolo Marucco, Marcel Wenneker, Waldemar Swiechowski, and Ryszard Holownicki for contribution to CASA concept development and measurements as well as Mario Tamagnone and Tadeusz Jedrachowicz for technical assistance.",,6,10,11,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,251,259,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100029,0

Using the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, we find that the expansion caused men to increase education by about a year on average and gain about 8% higher wages; women obtained a slightly greater increase in education and a similar increase in wages. Clearly, there was a sizeable gain from being born late enough to take advantage of the greater educational opportunities offered by the expansion. Treating the expansion as an exogenous increase in educational attainment, we obtain instrumental variables estimates of returns to schooling of about 6% for both men and women.

This article finds that more democratic countries undertake greater market access commitments under the multilateral General Agreement on Trade in Services (CATS). I argue that non-democratic regimes take fewer commitments, because these reduce their discretion in granting rents to ensure the support of small groups. In contrast, for democratic regimes, commitments that lock-in levels of access have lower costs because voters generally do not favour increased protectionism. Democracies also have greater incentives to take commitments since they signal good economic policy-making to voters. Moreover, the article finds that endowments have a direct impact on commitments. I argue that greater human capital endowments translate into greater pressures from industry groups for international commitments. The empirical analysis provides support for these propositions. The analysis also suggests that economic size and regulatory capacity are positively linked to CATS commitments.","WTO Secretariat, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Roy, M (通讯作者)，WTO Secretariat, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,50,10,10,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The paper begins with an overview of the evolutionary approach in the study of organizations, which is followed by the identification of units of analysis including habits, routines and cognitive frameworks. A conceptualization of the co-evolution of practices at multiple levels is then put forward, focusing on the role played by cognitive frameworks in the interpretation and anticipation of futures. In the process of these developments, three key tensions are identified including a temporal tension, tension between levels and tension with localism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we examine an entry deterrence model between an incumbent perfectly informed about the initial stock of a CPR and an uninformed potential entrant. In our model, the appropriation of the CPR by the incumbent reduces both players' future profits from exploiting the resource. In the case of complete information, we show that the incumbent operating in a high-stock common pool overexploits the CPR during the first period since it does not internalize the negative external effect that its first-period exploitation imposes on the entrant's future profits. This inefficiency, however, is absent when the commons totally regenerate across periods. Under incomplete information, we identify an additional form of inefficiency. In particular, the incumbent operating in a low-stock CPR underexploits the resource in order to signal the low available stock to potential entrants, deterring entry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It nurtured political liberty in Europe; it ushered in the industrial revolution in Britain and then around the world; it raised incomes everywhere; and it cleared away centuries of obscurantism and superstition. But it also brought into being a 'spirit of capitalism' that is individualist, expansive, acquisitive, ruthlessly rational and insatiable. This spirit has been responsible for commodifying relations and turning the natural world into a 'resource base' on the one hand, and a sink for wastes at the other. The industrial scale of this objectification and destruction of the natural setting has proceeded to the point where it is global, and now threatens our industrial civilization with collapse. My purpose in this paper is to sketch an account of how industrial capitalism might be 'naturalized', so that it continues to grow and deliver improvements in the quality of life without destroying humankind's resource base, and the biosphere as well. My focus is on rules and institutions rather than policies or prescriptions. My argument is that a green economy is already growing within the old, fossil-fuel economy, and that through competitive dynamics it will dominate by mid-century - unless blocked politically by vested interests.

Evolutionary psychology is a continuation of this process and, like previous integrations, has generated substantial resistance from different social and political circles. Looking into the future, we can outline the nature of the resistance from socio-political conservative and socio-political progressive forces. Such worldview conflicts can be particularly contentious on topics related to human behavior and human nature, as they tend to challenge the central tenants of these conflicting worldviews. There is also, however, a set of future conditions that would promote evolutionary psychology and the conceptual integration of behavioral science disciplines. These conditions include a strong understanding and value placed on scientific conceptual integration as well as support by science education that emphasizes critical thinking and inquiry. Evolutionary psychology would also be aided by hard protections (e.g., laws and regulations) against political interference in science. In addition to typical resistance to conceptual integrations, the success of evolutionary psychology depends on overcoming a number of counterintuitive aspects of how evolution by natural selection works. These include the difficulty of visualizing the evolutionary process, the long time scales involved in the evolution of complex adaptations, the seductiveness of mind/body dualism, and the human desire for immediate explanations of all phenomena.

A review of existing literature suggests that much has been written regarding the process of scenario development and the benefits of the process, but the detailed analysis of scenario building outcomes, which encompass a large number of issues and their complex interconnections, has not been made explicit for studying and enhancing understanding of a complex societal problem. This paper presents a systematic method for analysing such complex outcomes in order to facilitate reflective thinking on important issues within the wider context for policy development. The method was employed in a series of participative scenario development workshops, which yielded several causal maps around the theme of construction industry skills. A collective map merging the individual subject-specific causal maps was created to help provide a more holistic overview of the pertinent issues surrounding the construction skills debate. The analysis of this collective map promotes a better understanding of the issue in the wider context, the consequence of possible future events and actions, and of the pre-requisition required for certain events/desired outcomes to take place. The main benefit that could be derived from the method is the opportunity to help facilitate and encourage debate and discussion amongst key stakeholders regarding scenario theme, in this case skills improvement within construction. Due to its flexibility and adaptability, the method could potentially be applied to other areas requiring longer range planning and which contain multiple stakeholder perspectives.

I use methods from the futures studies field, particularly macrohistory, to provoke our current patterns of city making. From macrohistory, the grand patterns of social change reveal some of the key systems dynamics influencing the rise and fall of cities in civilisation. The key urban system dynamics in the broadest sense provide a meta-framework of emerging issues shaping new urban challenges or opportunities for our towns and cities. The hope drawn from the past and present is to focus our urban interventions in the key areas to create future cities of wonder and purpose. The implications of the emerging issues (critical focus areas of city foresight) that arise from the macrohistorical analysis are discussed using the case study of the Maroochy 2025 community visioning project. 2025 is a community driven project to develop shared visions and action plans for the Maroochy Shire(1) towards the year 2025, for the purpose of creating an empowering and community owned response to the challenges facing them locally and globally.

One of the three possible forms of material injury is threat of injury. The threat of injury claim represents a preventive mechanism that prompts the investigating authorities to act before actual material injury is inflicted on the domestic industry. The major difficulty in assessing a threat of injury claim resides in the prospective nature of the investigating authorities analysis. Since material injury has not yet occurred at the moment of the analysis, the investigating authorities must determine whether, based on the facts available, material injury is likely to occur in rite near future. In order to prevent speculation and abuse, the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement sets forth the elements to be considered for the prospective assessment, such as an analysis based on evidence and facts, a clearly foreseen and imminent change in circumstances, and the economic factors relevant for the determination. The WTO case law adds to these rules, making it clear that the situation oldie domestic industry prior to the initiation also plays a role in the prospective analysis. Nevertheless, important matters occurring in practice during anti-dumping investigations at European Union (EU) level remained currently unaddressed. The most significant is the choke of the reference period that stands as a basis for the investigating authority's analysis, cumulation of imports from several countries in threat of injury investigations and calculation of the injury margin. This article aims at addressing these issues based on a recent anti-dumping investigation finalized in September 2009, Seamless Tubes, and scrutinizes whether the European Institutions' approach in this case was in accordance with the WTO standards.",,,,f.d.dascalescu@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Previous research has explored how practice nurse care differs from that provided by general practitioners (GPs) in terms of costs and health outcomes, and has highlighted the importance of matching skills and experience with roles and responsibilities. However, there has been little research to compare the characteristics of patients seen by GPs and practice nurses in primary care. We aim to investigate the factors associated with the use of practice nurse visits, and to compare these with the factors associated with GP use. We jointly model the use of practice nurse and GP visits using a bivariate probit regression model with a large set of covariates taken from two rounds of the Health Survey for England (2001, 2002). We find that practice nurse use is associated with age and gender, health, socioeconomic and supply variables. There are differences in the factors associated with practice nurse and GP use. Chronically ill patients are more likely to see a practice nurse, while acute ill health has a stronger association with the probability of seeing the GP. Practice nurse use is also correlated with a narrower range of health conditions compared with GP use. We also found differences between practice nurse and GP visits with respect to the association with economic activity, ethnic group, number of children, degree of urbanisation, and distance to practice.","[Vallejo-Torres, Laura] UCL, UCL Res Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Morris, Stephen] UCL, UCL Res Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, UCLH UCL Comprehens Biomed Res Ctr, UCL Div Res Strategy, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Vallejo-Torres, L (通讯作者)，UCL, UCL Res Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",l.vallejo-torres@ucl.ac.uk,"Vallejo-Torres, Laura/AHE-1828-2022; Vallejo-Torres, Laura/L-9322-2015","Vallejo-Torres, Laura/0000-0001-5833-6066; Vallejo-Torres, Laura/0000-0001-5833-6066; Morris, Stephen/0000-0002-5828-3563",Medical Research Council Funding Source: Medline,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,27,6,7,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The presence of these dependency relationships among household members poses challenges for benefit estimation since it is unlikely that the conditions necessary for recovering the underlying individual preferences from household choices are satisfied in this setting. We propose a conceptual framework that highlights the role of these dependencies in the choice models used to estimate the willingness to pay for environmental quality improvements. We design a complementary stated preference survey that describes hypothetical dependency relationships for household members of different ages to test the implications of our conceptual model. Respondents' stated choices take into account the proposed care-giving responsibilities for young children and teenagers but not for older adults. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The paper examines the attitudes of entrepreneurs and local decision-makers towards the development of tourism- and recreational service enterprises adjacent to three small, different-aged national parks in southern Finland: Linnansaari, Seitseminen and Repovesi. Four distinct groups of entrepreneurs could be formed on the basis of their attitudes to business. The most advanced group (adapters) were aware of both the demand for tourism services and their enterprises' business resources. The second group (adopters) were resource aware but had ideas for new business ventures rather than knowledge of demand. An informed satisficer group exhibited satisficing attitudes (where lifestyle aspirations are placed before business growth and development) but who were well informed and could be related to the adopters. The final group of entrepreneurs were simply satisficers. There was a greater proportion of adapter entrepreneurs adjacent to the oldest park, while entrepreneurs adjacent to the youngest park were predominantly satisficers or informed satisficers. The adopter class of entrepreneurs was most common in the two older national park areas. The majority of local decision-makers in the municipalities adjacent to the national parks preferred to develop tourism together with other sectors of the economy, although industrial alternatives were preferred. The decision-makers fell into three groups with respect to their preferred ways and means of developing tourism-based local enterprise: supporting existing enterprises, lowering the threshold for (new) enterprise, and developing the business infrastructure and funding arrangements. The greatest support for new enterprises was found in the Repovesi area, the district with the greatest proportion of satisficing entrepreneurs. Decision-makers preferred to support existing businesses adjacent to the oldest park, Linnansaari, with its greater proportion of adapter and adopter entrepreneurs and fewer satisficers. Opportunities for business will not be realised if local enterprises fail to perceive or respond to them, or if decision-makers fail to play an active role in encouraging tourism enterprises by means of support schemes or by developing the tourism infrastructure. Regional differences in the development of tourism-related services therefore depend on the attitudes of the key actors and their ability to encompass new economic activities and their associated institutions and discourses.

However, only recently have researchers begun to examine impacts of specific aspects of CBAs on student and district outcomes. This article uses a unique measure of contract restrictiveness generated through the use of a partial independence item response model to examine the relationships between CBA strength and district spending on multiple areas and district-level student performance in California. I find that districts with more restrictive contracts have higher spending overall, but that this spending appears not to be driven by greater compensation for teachers but by greater expenditures on administrators' compensation and instruction-related spending. Although districts with stronger CBAs spend more overall and on these categories, they spend less on books and supplies and on school board-related expenditures. In addition, I find that contract restrictiveness is associated with lower average student performance, although not with decreased achievement growth.","Univ So Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Strunk, KO (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",kstrunk@usc.edu,,,,,,,48,51,67,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The literature on obligations to future generations suggests, philosophically, that intervention might be justified under certain circumstances. Additionally, the world community has intervened in the affairs of other countries for humanitarian reasons, such as in Kosovo, Somalia, and Haiti. However, intervention to deal with serious energy problems is a qualitatively different and more difficult problem. A simple risk analysis framework is used to organize the discussion about possible conditions for justifiable intervention. If the probability of deaths resulting from unsustainable energy policies is very large, if the energy problem can be attributed to a relatively small number of countries, and if the risk of intervention is acceptable (i.e., the number of deaths due to intervention is relatively small), then intervention may be justifiable. Without further analysis and successful solution of several vexing theoretical questions, it cannot be stated whether unsustainable energy policies being pursued by countries at the beginning of the 21st century meet the criteria for forcible intervention by the international community.

To do this we first establish the working context for these reflections by exploring fragments of biography and the immediate catalyst which was a recent seminar held over 5 days, beginning in the rural Swedish town of Ed and, for the last 2 days, at University West in Trollhattan. We then set out to explore the normative and theoretical context of our approach before finally moving to an exploration of the concept of WIL via CLA and scenarios. Our overall goal is to describe some features of an expanded concept of WIL as it relates to intercultural learning. In doing this we hope to generate processes that facilitate the kind of learning necessary if we are to enable teachers and students to build sustainable futures they can realistically aspire to.

Using national time-use surveys for the late 1990s and early 2000s and regression techniques, the study not only finds large gender discrepancies in time use in each country at all stages of life but also determines that institutional contexts, in particular the design of family policies and employment regimes, do shape gender roles in different ways, and that Sweden displays the lowest gender gap in time allocation across the life course.","[Anxo, Dominique] Linnaeus Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Univ Platsen 1, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden; [Mencarini, Letizia] S Cognetti Martiis Univ Turin, Coll Carlo Alberto, I-10024 Moncalieri, To, Italy; [Mencarini, Letizia] S Cognetti Martiis Univ Turin, Dept Econ, I-10024 Moncalieri, To, Italy; [Pailhe, Ariane; Solaz, Anne] INED, F-75020 Paris, France; [Tanturri, Maria Letizia] Univ Padua, Dept Stat, I-35121 Padua, Italy; [Flood, Lennart] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Padua; University of Gothenburg,"Anxo, D (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Univ Platsen 1, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",dominique.anxo@lnu.se; letizia.mencarini@unito.it; pailhe@ined.fr; solaz@ined.fr; tanturri@stat.unipd.it; lennart.flood@economics.gu.se,"Anxo, Dominique/AAC-1109-2021; Pailhe, Ariane/Q-1772-2016; Tanturri, Maria Letizia/J-5906-2012",,,,,,55,154,169,1,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

However, in the last decade, the profitability of VFSs has been challenged by several issues including lower productivity, higher domestic prices, various export barriers, an increase in the volume of imported vegetables and environmental deterioration. This study was an attempt in part, to investigate the reasons for the decrease in the competitiveness of VFSs in upland areas of Java and Sumatra, in particular the social and gender circumstances. The present study was conducted in the three main upland vegetable producing centres in Pangalengan, Kejajar and Berastagi-Simpang Empat by distributing 150 questionnaires to farmers. Significant differences in social circumstances between Javanese (Pangalengan and Kejajar) and Sumatran farmers (BSE) were observed in the VFS practices in terms of the cultural and economic situation of households, farm size, education level, labour and wages, land ownership and investment, as well as the type of cultivation and cropping patterns. The VFSs in the three regions were also compared with regard to resource and labour inputs. Pangalengan could be categorized as a high-input system while BSE was a low-input system. Many farmers in Pangalengan rented land while this was less prevalent in the other two regions. Differences were also found with regard to the number of women in the work force, in particular for different cultivation activities. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the VFSs in Pangalengan and Kejajar have improved their competitiveness through the more intensive use of inputs and high intensive farming practices. Social factors were observed to have less impact.","[Arsanti, I. W.; Boehme, M.

Such differences are relevant, as network theory suggests that structural characteristics-as well as the contents of networks-strongly influence the type and amount of benefits generated. Through the application of dyadic regression techniques, this study examines the determinants of the size and socioeconomic heterogeneity of individual networks. Research findings suggest gender segregation of networks and considerable differences in the structure and content of men's and women's networks. These differences relate to the gendered division of labor and to women's time poverty in particular. Our results are relevant in a context where policy makers increasingly consider social networks an important policy tool. We caution against a gender-blind alignment on existing social networks and argue for detailed mapping and unpacking of social networks through a gender lens.","[D'Exelle, Ben] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Holvoet, Nathalie] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Antwerp, Belgium",University of East Anglia; University of Antwerp,"D'Exelle, B (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Holvoet, Nathalie/N-8096-2019","Holvoet, Nathalie/0000-0003-4413-1208",,,,,59,18,22,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The study revealed that the wholesale fruit market in the city constitutes a strategic link between the upstream and downstream chain partners in fresh fruit distribution. Fresh fruit flows from the farm to the wholesale market through several different market players that are product and area specific. Fruit suppliers from different regions and imports prolong the seasonality for apples and grapes; bananas, sweet lime and papayas are available throughout the year; while mangoes are primarily available during the post-harvest period. For the local distribution of selected fruit, three downstream supply chains emerge: retail (the majority), food service and processing. Market agents at each level in the supply chains have forged alliances with their upstream and downstream chain partners to cope with market imperfections and transactions under uncertainty because of the perishable product nature. Vertical coordination for the organized sub segment (food service) is based upon contractual arrangements, whereas for the unorganized segments of food service (retail and processing), it is based upon verbal and mutually understood arrangements. The major thrust of the chain partners at each level of the supply chain is to maintain a regular flow of the products they handle at competitive prices.","[Goel, V.] Punjab Agr Univ, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India",Punjab Agricultural University,"Goel, V (通讯作者)，Punjab Agr Univ, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India.",,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66050-89-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,895.0,,,,,,121,128,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR09,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323845300015,0

The HLC is a cheap and reliable technique to produce data on mosquito densities in a defined area. It requires only a human volunteer to sit over night with his legs exposed, a headlamp to spot mosquitoes, and a rubber tube and plastic cup to catch them as they come to feed on him. The HLC formed the central methodological and operational strategy for a malaria control that took place in Dar es Salaam, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This paper analyses the epistemic and economic value of this experimental scenario by examining in detail the work it entails. In conceptualizing the different species of productivity associated with the HLC, of particular interest is the surprising fact that he is there. This paper argues that the interplay of mobility and immobility offers a way to rethink the value of research within interlocking circulations of capital, science, mosquitoes and men.","[Kelly, Ann H.] Univ London, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Anthropol, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Kelly, AH (通讯作者)，Univ London, London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Anthropol, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,,Wellcome Trust Bioethics Grant [2173],Wellcome Trust Bioethics Grant(Wellcome Trust),"My first thanks go to the CORPs, Gerry Killeen, Prosper Chaki, and the public health entomology team working with the IHI in Dar es Salaam.

This study extends this work by adjusting the recommendations, making concrete proposals for two gender-related indicators, and presenting illustrative results for these proposed measures. These new measures include the calculation of a male and female Human Development Index (HDI), as well as a gender gap measure (GGM) to replace the GDI as a measure of gender inequality. The study also proposes and implements several modifications and simplifications to the GEM. With these adjustments, a number of Sub-Saharan countries now rank much higher, countries in the Middle East have lower scores in both measures, and some European countries fare notably worse in the revised GEM.","[Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Cambridge, World Bank, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Cambridge; The World Bank; University of Munich,"Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,28,83,93,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In the literature, recurring crises are treated based on the classic theory of market turbulences/ crises triggered by Brownian statistics but this strategy is not capable to analyze the complex interaction between multiple markets and contagion. It is suggested an intuitive treatment of the adverse shocks to financial markets that propagate with a jump in one region/ segment with direct effects on increasing the likelihood of a different jump in another region/ segment by using Hawkes jump-diffusion model. This is a dynamic model equipped with a drift component, a volatility component and mutually exciting jumps.

In the view of firm's profit maximization, it adopts a partial-equilibrium model to analyze firm's decision about producer currency pricing (pricing in the exporter's currency) or local currency pricing (pricing in the importer's currency). When more of export commodities are differentiated with less price elasticity of substitution it is more profitable to make producer currency pricing. So, policy making should be concerned with optimization of trade structure in the long run. Chinese exporters can have more bargaining power with importers about the choice of invoicing currency when they export more differentiated products and China's cross-border trade yuan settlement can be largely expanded in the long run through this way.","[Shi Longxiang; Wu Liangkun] Shanghai Inst Foreign Trade, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,,Slx760723@shift.edu.cn,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-56166-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,288,291,,,,,,4,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BDG21,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313086900056,0

The empirical results of the study, using high-frequency intraday data collected from a sample of seventy-eight firms issuing both A-shares and B-shares and employing a bivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, show that after the regulation change, the volatility in A-shares increases the volatility in B-shares, thus increasing the risk of the whole market, whereas the latter reduces the former, thus reducing the risk of the whole market. A further investigation of the determinants influencing these structural changes shows that the following factors can encourage structural changes that reduce overall market risk: government ownership, institutional ownership, firm size, B-share proportion, and market-to-book ratio. Conversely, the following factors can encourage structural changes that increase overall market risk: dual roles of chief executive officer and chairman and the joint effect of firm size and B-share proportion.","[Jiang, Hai] Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhian; Li, Donghui; Sim, Ah Boon] Univ New S Wales, Sch Banking & Finance, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jiang, Hai] Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Jinan University,"Jiang, H (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhianchen@unsw.edu.au; tjiangh@jnu.edu.cn; donghui@unsw.edu.au; a.sim@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,50,8,8,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The EU has become a major player in the political arena and seeks to reach worldwide agreements on 'mitigation' policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite speaking with one voice at the global scale, the effects of climate change on European territories vary widely according to local circumstances. The ESPON scenarios explore what those impacts could be, and what effect EU climate change adaptation policies would have. The first scenario envisions an EU policy limited to emergency funds following extreme events like floods and droughts. In the second scenario, the EU takes a much more proactive stance by funding radical and costly adaptation strategies. The exercise demonstrates the difficulty in identifying the cost-effectiveness of each approach. Territorial effects are often indirect and affect a variety of economic, social and ecological systems. Moreover, a great deal of uncertainty exists surrounding their magnitude and timing.

This increase is puzzling, as it is much larger than that of other college-educated women, and it occurred over a period of declining teacher aptitude. I estimate the contribution of changes in teacher demographic characteristics, increases in the returns to an MA, and changes in teacher certification requirements to increases in teacher MA attainment rates. I find that the majority of the rise in attainment not attributable to secular trends and increases in the average age of teachers can be explained by increases in the returns to an MA among teachers. The increase in MA returns among teachers presents a second puzzle, as there is little evidence that master's degrees increase teacher productivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem for an individual private school of who to admit and how much to charge in tuition, is complicated by the existence of peer-effects: the value students place on attending school is increasing with the average ability of the entire class at that school. This feature, coupled with the fact that students can always attend public school for free, places constraints on the types of classes the private school can admit. In my model, students have an ability type that is known to the school through testing, as well as a wealth type that is private information. Students report their wealth to the school and on the basis of the results from the ability test and wealth reports, the school institutes an allocation rule and a payment rule. Allocation rules which only admit all high ability students and no others, or all high wealth students and no others are not feasible. I utilize a simple example to show how in a revenue-maximizing allocation, the private school always under-admits the highest ability students relative to the allocation rule that maximizes social welfare.

The trading zone approach has been extensively discussed for the full-information case. We consider incomplete information concerning the emitters' abatement costs, their locations, and pollution dispersion. We derive the optimal number of trading zones and the optimal number of permits per zone and analyze under which conditions a system of independent trading zones is superior to other policy measures. Our results show that appropriately sized permit markets are well-suited to regulating non-uniformly mixed pollutants under informational constraints if firms are not too heterogeneous.

An instrumental variables approach is used to identify the effect of family size. Instruments for the number of children are twins at last birth and the sex mix of the first two children. The effect of birth order is identified, by examining the relation with years of education for different family sizes separately. No significant effect of family size on educational attainment of the oldest child is found. Birth order has a significant negative effect. Potential mechanisms behind the birth order effects are investigated. The results show that birth order effects are not affected by the average age gap between children. Information on financial transfers shows that earlier born children have a higher probability of receiving money from their parents than later born children, also the amount they receive is higher. These results indicate that the allocation of parental resources is a potential mechanism behind the birth order effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All English-language articles published from January 1997 to January 2008 were reviewed. Ten Markov models and three decision analytical models were identified. All models had a societal perspective and all but one had lifetime horizons. They were all based on common patient states of disability, mortality and recurrence of stroke. Inputs used in the models were transparent and valid. Intracranial hemorrhage, cardiovascular events and data closely related to local settings were not systematically considered. One-way sensitivity analyses were the most common, but few parameters were tested and these varied between models. Consensus key drivers were therefore difficult to determine. The overall structure of the models reviewed was sound. However, they should include more systematically cardiovascular events and intracranial hemorrhage, as well as local epidemiological data.

About 3/4 of respondents state that they have already heard about tropical deforestation and biodiversity. People rank carbon storage as the most important contribution of tropical forests, followed by biodiversity and support to local communities. The mean stated WTP is about CHF 110.- per year. All other things being equal, the stated WTP is about 24% higher for a tax payment vehicle compared to a voluntary payment. Education and income have a positive impact on WTP. WTP is also higher when the respondents judge that the main contribution of tropical forests is towards biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Since the exams are biennial, it is necessary to take account of the teacher's work in the intervening year. Even adjusting for measurement error, the teacher fixed effects are widely dispersed, and there is a strong positive correlation between a teacher's gains in literacy and numeracy. Teacher fixed effects show a significant association with some, though not all, observable teacher characteristics. Experience has the strongest impact, particularly in the early years of a teacher's career. Female teachers do better at teaching literacy. Teachers with a master's degree or some other form of further qualification do not appear to achieve significantly larger test score gains. Overall, teacher characteristics found in the departmental payroll database explain only a small fraction of the variance in teacher performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the economic sustainability of this system by calculating net present values (NPVs) at the time of a second harvest in two strips clear-cut in 1989, in the Peruvian Amazon. NPVs were calculated under three growth models or scenarios: (1) realistic (all light environments), (2) optimistic (higher light as could be achieved under intensive forest management), and (3) growth potential (fastest growing individuals). For each scenario, we calculated the production and value of timber products (sawnwood, roundwood, and charcoal), and their cost of harvesting, processing and transport. For comparison purposes, these calculations were also done for a deferment-cut treatment, applied in 1989 to half of one of the two strips. The three growth models predicted a production of 1.88 to 22.43 m(3)/ha of sawnwood, 81 to 92 pieces/ha of roundwood, and 11 to 19 ton/ha of charcoal from clear-cut strips. The total value of these products ranged from $3112 to $10,511/ha, assuming that sawnwood was purchased at certified prices. The total cost of harvesting, processing, and transport of timber products ranged from $3020 to $6167/ha. Net earnings ranged from -$75/ha to +$4344/ha. The net present value (NPV) of the clear-cut strips with certified sawnwood ranged between -$54/ha and +$1271/ha at a 5% discount rate, and between -$73/ha and +$78/ha at a 15% discount rate, the most realistic rate for Peru. These values were much lower than +$131 to +$540, the range of NPV at 15% discount rate for the deferment-cut treatment with certified sawnwood. The strip clear-cutting system is not economically sustainable due to slow tree growth, low income from timber products, and high costs for this system. Cutting cycles longer than 40 years may be required to increase timber yields and make this system profitable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J,"MacKay, B; McKiernan, P",,,,"MacKay, Brad; McKiernan, Peter",,,Creativity and dysfunction in strategic processes: The case of scenario planning,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INNOVATION; MODEL,"This paper attempts to open up a new line of enquiry into the dysfunctions of creativity within strategic processes. Generally, the impact and results of introducing creativity (and innovation) into organisational life are perceived to be wholesome and beneficial. But recent research in the area of organisational psychology has documented a 'dark' side to its introduction, e.g., low employee morale, stress, theft, sabotage, destructive conflict. Learning from this work and shifting the domain to strategic management, this paper focuses on scenario planning a strategy process widely regarded by participants and facilitators as creative and innovative in structure, content and output. First, the creative credentials of the process are established with reference to the literature and definitions from the creative and cultural industries. Second, the process is deconstructed into activities and each is examined for the extent of its embedded creativity. Third, informed by case evidence, four dysfunctions of the scenario planning process are conjectured: creativity layered on fantasy; heightened expectations and confusion; pride and passion; and creativity leading to excess. The paper concludes by suggesting four options for handling these potential dysfunctional effects and, in the light of the dialogue presented, re-interprets the definition of scenario planning presented earlier in the text.

A EuroQol valuation instrument with 16 health states to be valued on a visual analogue scale was sent to a random sample of 2,754 adults. The initial response rate was 35%. Eventually, 548 (20%) respondents provided useable valuations for modeling. Valuations for 245 health states were modeled using a random effects model. The selection of the model was based on two criteria: health state valuations must be consistent, and the difference with the directly observed valuations must be small. A model including a value decrement if any health dimension of the EQ-5D is on the worst level was selected to construct the social health state valuation set. A comparison with health state valuations from other countries showed similarities, especially with those from New Zealand. The use of a single preference valuation set across different health economic evaluations within a country is highly preferable to increase their usability for policy makers. This study contributes to the standardization of outcome measurement in economic evaluations in Belgium.","Adm Ctr Kruidtuin, Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",,"Cleemput, I (通讯作者)，Adm Ctr Kruidtuin, Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr, Doorbldg,10th Floor,Kruidtuinlaan 55, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Irina.cleemput@kce.fgov.be,,"Cleemput, Irina/0000-0003-4479-8950",,,,,30,39,40,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, there exist very few empirical studies that analyze the effect of trade policy on international prices. With detailed data on unit values and tariffs, I show how policy actions in Europe disrupted the global shrimp market in a non-negligible way and set the stage for the anti-dumping case in the United States. The loss of Thailand's preferential trade status in Europe and the international differences in food-safety standards during the antibiotics crisis shifted especially Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese shrimp exports away from Europe toward the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s. I document how those shifting markets have decreased US prices for shrimp significantly compared to those in Europe.","Univ Virginia, CEPR, Darden Business Sch, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Debaere, P (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, CEPR, Darden Business Sch, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",DebaereP@darden.virginia.edu,,,,,,,25,12,12,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2010,9.0,2,,,,,353,374,,10.1017/S147474561000011X,0.0,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,592DJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277355300003,0

Futures 40 (2) (2008). Evidence given for Slaughter's assertions is investigated. His assertions are then analysed partly by way of hermeneutics, CLA and deconstruction including address of Koestler's holon theory,jung's archetypes, and Lakoff and Johnson's conceptual metaphor. The potential of Slaughter's analysis involves the opening up or furthering of generative dialogue, specifically through extending the possibilities of CLA. As instituted, however, it enacts a premature foreclosure of such potential, partly through offering an inadequate and inaccurate evaluation of CIA. This paper specifically problematises the notion that CIA is not substantively postconventional, whilst pointing to unproductive modernistic tendencies in Slaughter's analysis. In so doing, it opens up new avenues for integral futures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The differences between these approaches, for any integrative understanding of futures, are presented as arising from stylistic preferences and biases which are usefully highlighted with a range of metaphors. These however highlight the challenge of any more integrative understanding, especially in the light of hidden dynamics of exclusion in a questionable effort to demonstrate that one approach is better than another in a complex human endeavour-especially when the future is sensed strategically through other metaphors than vision. Consideration is given to the possible use of a pattern language to address such issues, especially given questions regarding the adequacy of text on a conventional surface to hold complex significance and interrelationships. It is concluded that integrative futures is then the strange quest for how cognitively to embody the extremes represented by Wilber and Lorimer in the present-to evoke the greater harmony through engaging creatively with the dissonant pattern of imperfections.

Using several existing and lately developed measures, we inspect the gender wage gap by college major to investigate whether gender wage discrimination exists in a specific field of study in Taiwan. We find that controlling for the major dummies does enhance the proportion of the characteristic effects in the Oaxaca-type decomposition. This finding is similar to those results found in western countries. However, using decomposition methods designed to assess within sector wage gaps, we find gender wage differences are statistically negligible in all majors except medicine. Our results can provide useful information on the economic returns to different disciplines to current and future college students, institutions, and government policy-makers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

With reference to the Economic Participation and Opportunity Index (one of four components in the WEF Gender Gap Index (GGI)), this article assesses whether or not Australia is deserving of this recognition. Closer analysis shows that convergence in the participation gap flowed from increased participation in part-time, low-paid, and precarious jobs. Research also shows that women's entry into professional jobs has led to the feminization of some positions and that vertical segregation remains an ongoing problem. In highlighting these disparities, this article questions the capacity of the GGI to provide an adequate understanding of women's labor market participation and economic attainment.","[Barns, Angela; Preston, Alison] Curtin Univ Technol, Women Social & Econ Res Unit, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Barns, Angela] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Occupat Therapy & Social Work, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Preston, Alison] Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Grad Sch Business, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University; Curtin University,"Barns, A (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Women Social & Econ Res Unit, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",a.barns@curtin.edu.au; a.preston@curtin.edu.au,,"Preston, Alison/0000-0002-8326-8197",,,,,59,13,14,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In point of fact, the returns of financial time series are rather distributed leptokurtic than normally. Moreover, the empirical distributions are often skewed. In these cases, the assumption of normal distribution results in over- or underestimation of VaR and ES especially when the quantiles are very high/low. Therefore it is necessary to put emphasis on respecting the leptokurtic and skewed return distribution. In this paper, we interpret the one out of the method how to estimate VaR and ES with respect to the empirical distributions. We describe the analytical solution of VaR and ES under normal distribution and under normal mixture distribution condition and we compare the estimates according to both approaches. We also present the estimation method of distribution parameters. Thus, we briefly describe and derive the maximum likelihood method based on the iterative EM-algorithm.

Most estimates of capacity have been carried out using DEA. This study introduces order-m frontiers and the free disposal hull (FDH) as additional methods to estimate fishing capacity and compares capacity estimates for a group of fishing vessels based on the DEA, FDH, and order-m models.

The implementation of LDA is illustrated by the assessment of credit fraud losses in retail banking. The analysis is performed for two types of operational risk events: internal (employee) and external (client or counterparty) fraud. The data under research mostly consist of losses sustained by Russian and other CIS banks during the retail lending boom in 2005-2008. EVT is applied to the tail of internal fraud losses severity distribution, which contains extreme outliers. The results (i.e. the estimates of expected loss, VAR and Shortfall) clearly indicate the difference between external (high frequency-low severity) and internal fraud (low frequencyhigh severity) types of events.","Govt Russian Federat, Finance Acad, Moscow, Russia",Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation,"Zolotareva, E (通讯作者)，Govt Russian Federat, Finance Acad, Moscow, Russia.",k_ovchinnikova@mail.ru,"Zolotareva, Ekaterina/AAK-9840-2021","Zolotareva, Ekaterina/0000-0002-1516-7378",,,,,30,0,0,0,12,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Teacher value-added to reading test scores is estimated for four different teacher types: English, math, science and social-studies. The initial results indicate that reading output is jointly produced by math and English teachers. However, while falsification tests confirm the English-teacher effects, they cast some doubt about whether the math-teacher effects are free from sorting bias. The results offer a mixed review of the value-added methodology, suggesting that it can be useful but should be implemented cautiously. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, the theoretical framework addresses the relation between a policy subsystem's receptiveness to new ideas and actors and the actual presence of new actors and/or new ideas induced by international impulses (independent variables). and the likely influence of the configuration of these factors on strategy processes and their output. Depending on actual subsystem configurations, we deduce four ideal types of strategy processes and outputs (dependent variables): change-oriented, output-oriented, process-oriented and rhetorical strategies. Empirically, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the effects of one legally binding and two non-legally binding international agreements in terms of the changes induced by means of national strategy processes: the Austrian Biodiversity Strategy, the Austrian Forest Dialogue, and the Austrian Strategy for Sustainable Development. These strategies all have their roots in the UNCED Conference in 1992. The respective discourses and agreements introduced new idea sets to national policy processes also promoting participatory, long-term. cross-sectoral and multi-level strategy processes. The empirical analysis confirms effects of the international impulses in terms of introducing new ideas and actors. However, our case studies also point out that the actual effects of similar international impulses for change seem to be systematically mediated by the pre-existing domestic policy subsystem configurations, resulting in substantially different strategy processes and outputs, ranging from quite substantive changes to a mere rhetorical fulfillment of international agreements.

While some research supports this strategy, little research assesses the relative costs of these smaller schools. We use data on over 200 New York City high schools, from 1996 through 2003, to estimate school cost functions relating per pupil expenditures to school size, controlling for school output and quality, student characteristics, and school organization. We find that the structure of costs differs across schools depending upon mission-comprehensive or themed. At their current levels of outputs, themed schools minimize per pupil costs at smaller enrollments than comprehensive schools, but these optimally sized themed schools also cost more per pupil than optimally sized comprehensive schools. We also find that both themed and comprehensive high schools at actual sizes are smaller than their optimal sizes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These CNS side effects, such as dizziness and confusion, have been shown to lead to an increased risk of falling with subsequent fractures in elderly patients being treated with opioids. The risk of experiencing fractures has been shown to be dependent on the substance administered. Therefore, a health economic model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the most commonly used strong opiods in Germany, focussing on opioid-related fractures. By means of a Markov model, the consequences of hip, spine and forearm fractures due to the prior administration of transdermal (TD) buprenorphine, TD fentanyl, oral oxycodone as well as oral morphine were assessed from the perspectives of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) and the German social security (GSS) system over a time horizon of 6 years. The most frequently prescribed strength/package-size combinations of these opioids were taken into consideration, including generics where available. The results of the present analysis predict that TD buprenorphine is dominant compared to TD fentanyl and oxycodone by showing better effects [life years gained/quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained] at lower cost. From the SHI perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to morphine is a,not sign 6,801.61 per life year gained, and a,not sign 7,766.11 per QALY gained. From the GSS perspective, the ICER is a,not sign 2,496.77 per life year gained and a,not sign 2,850.83 per QALY gained. The model is robust regarding probabilistic variations of all parameters in the sensitivity analyses. Focussing on fractures due to the prior administration of strong opioids, TD buprenorphine is less costly and more effective than TD fentanyl and oxycodone and represents a cost-effective treatment option versus morphine in patients with chronic pain from both the SHI and GSS perspective in Germany.","[Hass, Bastian; Lungershausen, Juliane; Hertel, Nadine; Kotowa, Wioletta] IMS HEALTH GmbH & CO OHG, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, D-90402 Nurnberg, Germany; [Nautrup, Barbara Poulsen] EAH Consulting, Julich, Germany; [Liedgens, Hiltrud] Grunenthal GmbH, Aachen, Germany",Grunenthal Group,"Hass, B (通讯作者)，IMS HEALTH GmbH & CO OHG, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, D-90402 Nurnberg, Germany.",BHass@de.imshealth.com,,,,,,,43,9,10,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Long-term welfare dependence increases if the individual is placed in a welfare dependent community. The number of contacts is either irrelevant or negatively related to welfare receipt; not controlling for residential self-selection yields the opposite conclusion.

An empirical study aimed to collect information about the varying differences in time and space perspectives among participant individuals (undergraduate and PhD students at Yeditepe University and managers at Siemens-Turkey) and any other possible factors affecting the participants' choices. Two sets of statements are generated representing the time and space perspectives of participants using the modified constructs found in the literature such as Time Strata, Space-Time Graph, and Different Time Frames and Activities. Our sample population of 185 individuals indicated a time horizon of 4.8 years and space horizon of 530 km. Majority of the sample population is observed to be concerned with issues that affect only their close environment over a short time period of next week, along with their larger geographical area as the city. A few of the sample population indicated to have a global perspective on time and space that can further reach into the future. Literature suggesting different individuals having different perspectives on time and space, depending on culture, past experience and the nature of the problems are instrumentalized in our study by relating it to the foresight tools and methodologies. Such varying perspectives may explain individuals/managers' time and space horizon in which they think and act/execute. Based on the analysis of space/time preference of participant individuals, policy makers will benefit from incorporating the diversity of time and space dimensions into their strategic thought and national policy roadmaps. This exploratory study is comprised of the assessment of differing definitions and approaches to the future via individuals' space and time perspectives. It aims to contribute to foresight methodologies and approaches, as well as bringing a significant impact on the quality and success of the national foresight project results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Konstantinov, B",,,,"Konstantinov, Boyan",,,Human Rights and the WTO: Are They Really Oil and Water?,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It is remarkable how many critiques of the approach of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to human rights include the phrase: 'WTO should ...'. In many cases WTO actually 'shouldn't' because even if it 'would' it 'couldn't'. With the exception of the Dispute Settlement Procedures (DSP) the WTO does not really have an independent institutional decision-making power. It is nevertheless true that this international forum of free trade has remained remarkably conservative regarding human rights even after the end of 'the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) years' and the establishing of the WTO. Many scholars accuse the WTO of organizational isolationism and advocate for overcoming this practice. Criticism focuses especially on the apparent non-responsiveness of the organization to human rights issues - despite the huge impact free trade has on such matters - and unwillingness to discuss human rights, or cooperate with international agencies that protect them. In present days, the International Bill of Rights is commonly recognized as a human rights standard. Human rights are mainstreamed in the EU body of law, as well as soft law documents such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the UN Agenda for Development. Recently, they are incorporated in the organizational statues and programme methodologies of institutions such as the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The WTO seems to stay away from this process. We aim to explore the reasons for this conservative attitude of the WTO towards human rights, while trying to establish historical parallels with the gradual adoption of human rights as core standards in other international entities such as the European Union. We attempt to tackle the relationship between WTO membership and the human rights situation in its Member States and the possible implications that continuing admission of non-democratic countries - e.g., Russia - might have. We also explore the understanding of some scholars that human rights are 'seeping into the WTO system' - and briefly analyze some examples that could illustrate this process.","Columbia Law Sch, CLS LLM Program 08, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Konstantinov, B (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, CLS LLM Program 08, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,15,5,6,0,17,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Bycatch occurs when targeted and non-targeted species coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective. One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and non-targeted species, and the fishing season is closed when one of these TACs binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy options available to regulators. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Given the difficulties of Western science with complex environmental problems, any insights from the holism of indigenous knowledge are of major interest. Based on examples from Inuit and other northern peoples, it appears that indigenous knowledge approaches complex systems by using simple prescriptions consistent with fuzzy logic. Specifically, indigenous knowledge pursues holism through the continued reading of the environment, collection of large amounts of information, and the construction of collective mental models that can adjust to new information. Such an approach serves the assessment of a large number of variables qualitatively. as opposed to focusing on a small number of variables quantitatively.

This argument is supported by a review of the limitations of associational evidence in assessing causal hypotheses. The paper also discusses the benefits of experiments and quasi-experiments, outlines some quasi-experimental methods, and highlights threats to their validity. It then illustrates the quasi-experimental method by assessing the validity of a quasi-experiment that aims to estimate the impact of the Endangered Species Act on property markets in North Carolina.

However, among feminist economists it is widely recognized that women's patterns of care provision have adverse implications for their access to economic resources in later life. The feminist economics literature examines many of the interactions between women's caring roles and their access to resources, particularly women's capacity to access economic resources through publicly mandated or regulated pension schemes. This article reviews research that places women's patterns of work and care at the center of analyses of retirement pension policy in an effort to provide a summary of research on gender and pensions policy and to contrast the extent to which differing institutional and policy frameworks accommodate women's caring roles.","Curtin Univ Technol, Grad Sch Business, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Jefferson, T (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Grad Sch Business, POB U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Therese.Jefferson@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,"Jefferson, Therese/0000-0001-7393-7046",,,,,104,49,51,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Two cluster farming approaches were identified: an area based and a commodity based approach. In the area based approach, farmers came together based on the proximity of farms and trading posts, while in the commodity based approach, farmers planted the same type of vegetable and combined their produce to achieve a higher volume. The main objectives of cluster farming are to consolidate smallholder farmers' produce, to deliver in bulk to save on transport and transaction costs, and to increase income. This paper examines the socio-economic impact of cluster farming on smallholder vegetable farmers. A total of 84 smallholder farmers from three cluster groups were interviewed using a structured survey questionnaire. Results show that only one cluster group improved their average monthly income. However, 91% of the respondents believed that they were financially better off after joining the cluster. Participating farmers received other mostly non-monetary benefits such as improved access to wet and institutional markets, market information, market and production linkages, technical and financial support, and production inputs.","[Montiflor, M.

This study proposes an approach to evaluate the potential of Australian fruit and vegetable exports to China in a free trade environment. The approach is based on scaled evaluation criteria that encompass the major factors constraining food exports from Australia to China. They include tariffs and tariff barriers, evidence of recent export activity, price sensitivity, potential future demand, demand stability, opportunities for chain improvement and overall competitiveness. A study of 12 Australian food categories revealed six with the highest potential, including fruit. The outlook for vegetables was less optimistic. The evaluation approach used could be applied to any country wishing to evaluate potential opportunities to export horticultural produce to China, or to a more detailed study of horticultural export opportunities alone.","[Sun, X.; Collins, R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Nat & Rural Syst Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Sun, X (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Nat & Rural Syst Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,"Collins, Ray/B-3531-2010",,,,,,27,0,0,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,153,160,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700017,0

The objective of the research is to get insight into the factors that influence adoption of reduction techniques for pesticides and nutrients in ornamental plant production, and compare them with those in other horticultural sectors. After selection of the most appropriate reduction techniques by a panel of experts an inquiry was set up on 80 businesses specialised in production of ornamental plants and 168 other horticultural businesses. For each business in the inquiry an environmental score was calculated on the basis of the number of adopted reduction techniques. Based on a theoretical framework the influence of personal characteristics of the firm manager (biographical characteristics, attitudes, communication behaviour) and business characteristics (business size) on the environmental score was analysed. By means of a categorical principal component analysis the explanatory variables were reduced to 5 independent dimensions. For the ornamental plant producers the results of a regression analysis revealed a significant influence of the attitude towards environmental sound production, whereas for the vegetable producers communication behaviour revealed to be important. No significant influence of the investigated factors was found for fruit producers. The sectoral differences can be explained by the fact that the external pressure for environmental sound production is different for each sector. Also the different commercialisation structure and resulting system of knowledge exchange is important. The results of the research show that stimulating the adoption of reduction techniques will be more difficult in the sector of ornamental plants, where a change in the attitude of the grower is needed.","[Van Lierde, D.; Taragola, N.; Vandenberghe, A.; Cools, A. -M.] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Social Sci Unit, Merelbeke, Belgium",Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research,"Van Lierde, D (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Social Sci Unit, Merelbeke, Belgium.",,,"Taragola, Nicole/0000-0002-7234-8300",,,,,26,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,83,91,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700009,0

Focus of the present evaluation is the exposure of total direct costs, survival rates and the types of care distribution of patients with AD. Methods The analysis was based on anonymised data of patients with Alzheimer's disease who were insured by a large German statutory health insurance (Barmer Ersatzkasse-BEK) in 2005 over 12 months (n = 35.684). The study population was classified into three treatment groups: patients who received memantine and no other antidementia drugs, psychotropic drugs or sedatives/hypnotics (memantine group); patients who neither received memantine nor other antidementia drugs but psychotropic drugs and/or sedatives/hypnotics (PHS group); and patients who received no antidementia drugs and no psychotropic drugs or sedatives/hypnotics (no AT group). A Markov model was designed to assess the costs of each treatment group depending on the type of care over a 5-year period. Results The results obtained for the PHS group were the following: after 5 years, 25.1% were in inpatient health care, 1.1% in partial inpatient care, 5.4% in outpatient care, and 64.5% of patients died. Only 3.9% did not require care. On average, direct costs to the amount of 7.948 (sic) incurred per patient and year and 13.099 (sic) per surviving patient. In the group without pharmacotherapy, 20.6% were in inpatient care, 0.3% in partial inpatient care, 12.8% in outpatient care, and 52.5% of the patients died. For 13.8% of the patients, care was not necessary. The annual costs amounted to 6.760 (sic) per patient and 9.926 (sic) per surviving patient. The results obtained for the memantine group were more beneficial: annual costs per patient amounted to 6.100 (sic) and to 8.376 (sic) per surviving patient. Conclusions The results demonstrate that non-antidementive therapy for Alzheimer's disease causes higher costs especially for care. The memantine group proved to be superior compared to PHS group and no AT group, despite higher costs in the specific drug category.","[Kiencke, Peter; Daniel, Dietmar; Grimm, Christine; Rychlik, Reinhard] Inst Empir Hlth Econ, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany",,"Kiencke, P (通讯作者)，Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Ziegelfeld 28, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany.",peter.kiencke@ifeg.de,,,,,,,11,16,17,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In an attempt to kerb this growth, many health authorities, particularly in Europe, have introduced numerous regulatory measures that have affected the market, especially on the supply side. These measures include the system of reference pricing, the reduction of wholesale distributors' and retailers' markups and compulsory reductions of ex-factory prices. We assess the impact of these cost containment measures on expenditure per capita, prescriptions per capita and the average price of pharmaceuticals financed by the public sector in Catalonia (Spain), from 1995 to 2006. We apply an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series model using dummy variables to represent the various cost containment measures implemented. Twelve of the 16 interventions analysed that were intended to contain the overall pharmaceutical expenditure were not effective in reducing it even in the short term, and the four that were effective were not so in the long term, thus amounting to a moderate annual saving.","[Moreno-Torres, Ivan; Puig-Junoy, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Res Ctr Econ & Hlth CRES, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 3408005, Spain; [Raya, Josep M.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, EUM, Barcelona 3408005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Moreno-Torres, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Res Ctr Econ & Hlth CRES, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 3408005, Spain.",ivan.moreno@upf.edu,"Raya, Josep Maria/AAR-7073-2020; Puig-Junoy, Jaume/D-7047-2013","Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X; Puig-Junoy, Jaume/0000-0003-1695-3108",,,,,19,24,25,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We examine two wildlife disease management strategies that have seen growing use, sometimes in combination: (i) trapping-and-culling infectious animals (disease control), and (ii) trapping-and-translocating healthy animals to a reserve, with possible future reintroduction. A reserve can improve conservation when there is no disease. But, when infection exists, we show investing in the reserve may counteract disease control. We find jointly pursuing both strategies is sub-optimal when the reserve is costly to maintain. Numerically, we examine management of Devil Facial Tumor Disease, which has generated extinction risks for Tasmanian Devils. Disease control (though not eradication) is generally part of an optimal strategy, although a reserve is also optimal if it can be maintained costlessly. This implies preserving the original population by addressing in situ conservation risks, rather than translocating animals to a reserve and giving up on the original population, is generally the first-best.

These recommendations represent two sides of the same coin: higher federal spending alongside higher federal taxes. The pension rise is likely to reduce participation in the labour force. The proposed tax rise would discourage mining activity as miners considered their options to delay or abandon projects.

At first glance, these issues are scarcely manageable independently, much less collectively. At the core of these challenges are our underlying motivations and behaviors that spawned these challenges. As a species that is numerous and active in the altering of our planet, Homo sapiens, specifically, men, have been and will likely continue to hold sway over much of the global economic and political power that will influence the outcome of these challenges. Consequently it is important to understand the underlying motivations and evolutionary underpinnings that influence the decisions of all men, especially those in positions of power. While it is impossible to predict individual behaviors or policies of succeeding generations, this paper suggests that a thorough comprehension of the core aspects of human male life history such as patterns of mortality, trade offs between reproductive effort and survivorship as well as subsequent behavioral evolution can provide some glimpse into roots of behavior, policy, and the future of our species.

While these sea change locations will face a range of issues associated with rapid growth such as infrastructure provision and enhancement of social capital, anticipated environmental impacts are likely to add significant challenges. Climate change is likely to have dramatic impacts on sea change communities through diminished potable water supplies, rising sea levels, storm surges, and increased intensity of flood events - with indirect impacts on health, financial sectors, and biodiversity. Given the inherent diversity within sea change communities with regard to age, culture, and socio-economic status there are likely to be differences in ways of adapting, the ability to adapt, and the desired direction of any changes. Cognizant of the potential enormity of climate change impacts, the need for rapid responses, and the diversity within communities, this paper proposes a participatory and transformative method to work with communities in responding to climate change and variability within rapidly urbanising coastal locations. The method focuses on determining probable futures for various communities of place and interest within sea change areas and aims to build the capacity for dynamic on-going learning to achieve those futures, both within and between the communities. Through this process community members may be empowered with dynamic and future-orientated learning skills that build upon community knowledge, innovation, and resilience. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While a large and growing literature has sought to estimate the impact of these schools on student achievement, comparatively little is known about demand for the policy itself. Using election returns from three consecutive referenda on charter schools in Washington State, we weigh the relative importance of school quality, community and school demographics, and partisanship in explaining voter support for greater school choice. We find that low school quality-as measured by standardized tests-is a consistent and modestly strong predictor of support for charters. However, variation in performance between school districts is more predictive of charter support than variation within them. At the local precinct level, school resources, union membership, student heterogeneity, and the Republican vote share are often stronger predictors of charter support than standardized test results.","[Corcoran, Sean P.] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Stoddard, Christiana] Montana State Univ, Dept Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",New York University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Corcoran, SP (通讯作者)，NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY 10012 USA.",sean.corcoran@nyu.edu; cstoddard@montana.edu,"Corcoran, Sean Patrick/IST-7442-2023","Corcoran, Sean Patrick/0000-0002-0640-2751",,,,,37,11,13,3,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), I find a positive effect of full-time maternal post-secondary enrollment on the reading scores of kindergarten students after controlling for child-specific, time-persistent unobserved heterogeneity. This effect is especially strong when the sample is narrowed to children with married mothers or in households where a father is present. No similar effect is found for kindergarten math scores.

Multivariable Regression analysis (MRA) was employed in order to investigate the relation between import and export of wood with the above mentioned variables. The results showed that there is a significant relation with significant level of 5% between wood import as a dependent variable and population, GDP and the amount of domestic wood production as independent variables. There was also a significant relation between wood export and population, GDP, amount of domestic wood production, and world oil price. Time series analysis and autoregressive procedure were then used to predict the export and import of wood. Results showed that it is possible to predict the wood export via a first order autoregressive model. The mean of the wood export in the distant future was calculated to be 2133.37 tons per year.

The European Communities and Its Members States Tariff Treatment of Certain Information Technology Products (hereinafter 'EC-IT Product') case has opened up Pandora's box: would original ITA products, after technological change, still be included in the ITA? In light of the terms of relevant concessions being interpreted, the Panel establishes that the ITA could be dynamic along with new technology in that the addition if new technology or features would not necessarily warrant the exclusion of the ITA products from the duty-free coverage. However, because of the limitation on the scope of coverage through terms and conditions or the use of HS interpretative rules, ITA products might be excluded as a result; this is not necessarily supportive in terms of the ITA. The author argues that the dispute settlement mechanism does not provide a satisfactory systemic solution for the ITA. In this regard, the author proposes that establishing an 'understanding' on the maintenance of product coverage of current ITA under technological change, which includes the use of 'like product' analysis and the development of an 'indicative good practices guidance', might serve as a pragmatic tool and the starting point for further discussions towards finding the 'simple, transparent, and expeditious solution' contemplated by the ITA Committee.","Soochow Univ, Dept Int Business, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China,"Lin, TY (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Int Business, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",tylink-ry@scu.edu.tw,,"Lin, Tsai-yu/0000-0003-4913-6454",,,,,7,4,4,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

There is evidence that injury deaths attributable to alcohol respond differently to changes in state excise taxes on alcohol-specific beverages. This study examines the direct relationship between injury deaths and excise taxes without testing the degree of the association between excise taxes and alcohol consumption. The study finds that beer taxes are negatively related to motor vehicle accident mortality, while wine taxes are negatively associated with suicides and falls. The positive coefficient of the spirit taxes on falls implies a substitution effect between spirits and wine, suggesting that an increase in spirit tax will cause spirit buyers to purchase more wine. This study finds no evidence of a relationship between homicides and state excise taxes on alcohol. Thus, the study concludes that injury deaths attributable to alcohol respond differently to the excise taxes on different types of alcoholic beverages.","[Son, Chong Hwan; Topyan, Kudret] Manhattan Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Bronx, NY 10471 USA; [Topyan, Kudret] Amer Univ Bulgaria, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria",Manhattan College; American University Bulgaria,"Topyan, K (通讯作者)，Manhattan Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Bronx, NY 10471 USA.",kudret.topyan@manhattan.edu,,"TOPYAN, Kudret/0000-0002-4408-7094",,,,,51,10,12,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

J,"Kapoor, R",,,,"Kapoor, Rakesh",,,Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Ziauddin Sardar's characterization of 'postnormal times' elegantly captures the mood of despair, uncertainty and insecurity in the West due to the multiple shocks of terrorism, economic recession and climate change. However, the prevailing mood in India, most of Asia and developing countries in general is confidence and optimism for the future. The label 'postnormal times' is inappropriate for resurgent Asia and other 'emerging markets'. Similarly, these countries - as illustrated by examples from India - need more modernization and efficiency to save and improve the lives of their citizens. This paper argues that the seeming normality of twentieth century in the West was an illusion arising out of the ignorance and neglect of environmental and health consequences of unbridled industrial growth. The distorted assumptions of neoclassical economics are largely to blame for this. It is now time to pay back for those excesses. A new normality will emerge only by addressing these distortions and by creating democratic global institutions that can reflect the changed global balance of power of the 21st century. The intellectuals, opinion-makers and leaders of the world have to exercise their ethical responsibility and creative imagination to enable this new normality to emerge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to an extensive set of child and household-level characteristics, we use information on U.S. counties to control for potential confounding effects of the local economic and noneconomic environment on children's household transitions between states of food insecurity and food security. The time horizon of our analysis affords insight into factors underlying children's formation of non-cognitive skills and the efficiency of classroom-based educational production in elementary school. Overall, we find significant negative developmental effects for children with food insecurity at home; and that children experiencing an early transition from food insecurity in 1st grade to food security in 3rd grade have even larger impairments that persist through 5th grade.

Results point to an even more marked resistance against restrictions of physician choice among individuals with chronic conditions in both countries.

In order to do that, we used the cointegration-based error correction mechanism in vector autoregression models. A special attention it was given to the problem of non-stationarity and cointegration. The results indicate that the shadow economy grows constantly during 1998-1999 until it reaches its maximum at the end of 1999(38.12% in 1999Q2). Then, it decreases slowly and stabilizes around 27% of official GDP. Evaluating the Granger causality relationship between the unemployment rate and the size of the shadow economy, the results support a unidirectional granger causality that runs only from the unemployment rate to the shadow economy. Using the generalized impulse response functions, the analysis leads to the finding that a 1% increase in the unemployment rate contributes to shadow economy decrease by 3.7% over the next 8 quarters.","[Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania; [Dobre, Ion] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Alexandru, AA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania.",adrianaalexandru@yahoo.com; dobrerio@ase.ro,"Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria/D-2755-2015","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria/0000-0002-9847-1200",IDEI [1805],IDEI,The paper represents also a portion of the results provided by the ongoing research for the Grant 1805 under the IDEI Program PN.

The first has recurrently shown its inability to explain the major stylized facts of the last two decades. The second now receives more attention as a possible alternative but the field has been so underexplored by so few people that the task is somehow promethean. Is it possible to explicitly state laws of motion of capitalism? Previous failed attempts justify some scepticism. A review of the multiplicity of meanings and conceptualizations of 'economic laws' suggests first that the existence of general quantitative regularities, which economists are fond of, is quite unlikely. Second, it is possible to identify explicit partial and temporary regularities that are indexed upon a given institutional configuration of capitalism. Third, mobilizing the results of past historical analyses and building upon the contributions of some key economists and social scientists-Marx, Polanyi, Schumpeter, Kaldor, Wallerstein and Kindle-berger-the article proposes seven conjectures about possible 'laws of motion of capitalism'.","[Boyer, Robert] CEPREMAP, Paris, France; [Boyer, Robert] GREDEG, Sophia Antipolis, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Boyer, R (通讯作者)，CEPREMAP, Paris, France.",robert.boyer@ens.fr,,,,,,,41,24,27,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The clinical trial, which was elaborated in the mid-twentieth century, refined this method, by making it possible, for the first time, to reproduce and standardize unexpected clinical events on a mass, industrial scale. This paper argues that the clinical trial needs to be understood within the larger complex of Taylorist interventions seeking to regulate accidental movement in the workplace. This evolution of productive methods is in turn enmeshed in the shift from the private regulation of accidents (tort law) to the social administration of risk by the welfare state. When placed within this perspective, the specificity of the mid-to-late twentieth-century clinic as a scene of production emerges in all its complexity - for while the randomized clinical trial is organized by the same regulation of movement and accident imposed on the industrial workplace, the risks borne by the 'human subject' have never been included within the portfolio of social risks to be administrated and redistributed by the welfare state.",,,,melinda.cooper@sydney.edu.au,,"Cooper, Melinda/0000-0001-8341-8282",,,,,42,15,16,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Exploring annual sales data of new passenger vehicles at the model level in 48 U.S. counties from 1999 to 2005, we find that new vehicles demanded by consumers are less fuel-efficient on average as a larger share of people become overweight or obese. The OLS results show that a 10 percentage point increase in obesity and overweight reduces the average MPG of new vehicles demanded by 1.4 percent, an effect requiring a 12 cent increase in gasoline prices to counteract. The 2SLS results after controlling for possible endogeneity in overweight and obesity prevalence put those two numbers at 5 percent and 54 cent, respectively. These findings, robust to a variety of specifications, suggest that policies to reduce overweight and obesity can have additional benefits for energy security and the environment.

We build a general equilibrium model of an open economy to identify the political-economy determinants of regulation. With a newly created dataset of SO2 and NOx regulations for coal-fired power plants and a patent-based measure of the technology frontier, we estimate the determinants of environmental regulation diffusion. Our findings support the hypothesis that international economic integration eases access to environmentally friendly technologies and leads to earlier adoption, ceteris paribus, of regulation in non-innovating countries. However, we also find evidence that domestic trade protection promotes earlier adoption allowing shifts of regulatory costs to domestic consumers. Furthermore, international market power permits large countries to shift costs to foreign consumers. Other political economy factors, such as the quality of domestic coal, are also important determinants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
