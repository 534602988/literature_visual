However, it also deters a skilled manager from undertaking efficient long-term projects that risk low short-term earnings. This paper demonstrates how risky debt can overcome this tension. Leverage concentrates equityholders' stakes, inducing them to learn the cause of low earnings. If they result from investment (poor management), the firm is continued (liquidated). Therefore, unskilled managers are terminated and skilled managers invest without fear of termination. Unlike models of managerial discipline based on total payout, dividends are not a substitute for debt-they allow for termination upon non-payment, but at the expense of investment since they do not concentrate ownership and induce monitoring. Debt is dynamically consistent as the manager benefits from monitoring. In traditional theories, monitoring constrains the manager; here, it frees him to invest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Many of these reforms originated at the cantonal level. However, the institutional diversity among Swiss municipalities hardly has diminished. A cross-sectional analysis for the 137 largest Swiss cities and villages in 2004 shows that direct democratic rights and a high degree of fiscal autonomy lead to a lower level of local debt.

Using Indian manufacturing firm data, it finds that the transition of market structure and productivity after liberalization did follow a smooth transition process. Instead of the previously assumed instantaneous 'big-bang' shift just after reforms, it actually took years for the Indian manufacturing industries start to react to the reforms, and the transitional impact of reforms took approximately four to eight years to complete. There is strong evidence of increased competition after the transition, with shrinked returns to scale (RTS) in most industries except for leather and chemical industries. The results on total factor productivity (TFP) are mixed: most import-competing industries, which suffer most from the shrinking of market size experienced no change or decreasing TFP growth; whereas the export-oriented industry, as the industry which benefits most from economy of scale, enjoyed a huge TFP growth following the reforms.

We work within the framework originally established by Berg. Dickhaut, and McCabe (1995) in which trust is measured experimentally as the ability to generate reciprocity in response to an initial offer of money within a two-person game. An incentive is conveyed both by means of variations in the multiplier applied to the first player's initial offer and by giving the first player the opportunity to insure themselves against the possibility that the second player will fail to reciprocate their initial offer. Measured trust is strongly responsive to both these incentives. Thus third parties have the ability to influence the outcome of the game, not only, as in the analysis of Charness, CoboReyes, and Jimenez (2008), by punishing failure to reciprocate and rewarding 'good' initial offers, but also by offering protection which strengthens the first player's risk efficacy, or ratio of assets to risk.

We estimate our model on data from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances. We find evidence consistent with minority equal access to bank credit lines and nonbank non-line-of-credit loans in highly competitive loan markets; in less competitive markets we find evidence consistent with unequal access to these loans. We also find evidence consistent with unequal minority access to bank non-line-of-credit loans, regardless of loan market competitiveness. Our findings differ from previous research which treats small-business loans as a homogenous product and finds evidence consistent with unequal minority access to small-business loans generally.

To address this question, this paper studies the trends and cycles of informal employment. It first presents a theoretical model of long- and short-run behavior of informal labor. Then it analyzes these relationships empirically, using the share of self-employment in the labor force as the proxy for informal employment. In the long run, informality is larger when labor productivity is lower, government services weaker, and business flexibility less prevalent. In the short run, informal employment behaves counter-cyclically, indicating that it acts primarily as a safety net. The degree of counter-cyclicality, however. varies inversely with the size of informal labor itself. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate both the reasons and the implications of hedge funds' activities in the primary loan market. We examine the characteristics of firms that borrow from hedge funds and find that borrowers are primarily firms with lower profitability, lesser credit quality, and higher asymmetric information. Our results suggest that hedge funds serve as lenders of last resort to firms that may find it difficult to borrow from banks or issue public debt. We also examine the effect of hedge fund lending on the borrowing firms and find that borrowers' profitability and creditworthiness improve subsequent to the loan. This beneficial effect of hedge fund lending is corroborated by our finding of positive abnormal returns for borrowers' stocks around the loan announcement date.

Yet Germans make a four times higher share of trips by foot, bike, and public transport and drive for a 25% lower share of trips as Americans. Using two comparable national travel surveys this paper empirically investigates determinants of transport mode choice in Germany and the USA. In both countries higher population density, a greater mix of land-uses, household proximity to public transport, and fewer cars per household are associated with a lower share of trips by automobile. However, considerable differences remain: all groups of society in America are more car-dependent than Germans. Even controlling for dissimilarities in socio-economic factors and land-use. Germans are more likely to walk, cycle, and use public transport. Moreover, Americans living in dense, mixed-use areas, and close to public transport are more likely to drive than Germans living in lower density areas, with more limited mix of land-uses, and farther from public transport. Differences in transport policy that make car travel slower, more expensive, less convenient, and alternatives to the automobile more attractive in Germany may help account for the remaining differences.

Banking supervision is measured in terms of enforcement outputs (i.e., on-site audits and sanctions). Our results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between on-site audits and bank risk, while the relationship between sanctions and risk appears to be linear and negative. We also consider the combined effect of effective supervision and banking regulation (in the form of capital and market discipline requirements) on bank risk. We find that effective supervision and market discipline requirements are important and complementary mechanisms in reducing bank fragility. This is in contrast to capital requirements, which prove to be rather futile in controlling bank risk, even when supplemented with a higher volume of on-site audits and sanctions.","[Delis, Manthos D.] Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Staikouras, Panagiotis K.] Univ Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece",University of Ioannina; University of Piraeus,"Delis, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",,"Staikouras, Panagiotis/AAM-3202-2021",,,,,,62,113,119,6,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In industries where value creation depends on innovation and development of new products, mergers are likely to be inefficient even though they increase the market power of the post-merger firm. In such industries, a stand-alone structure where independent firms compete both in the product market and in the market for employee human capital leads to a greater profitability. Furthermore, our analysis shows that multidivisional firms can improve employee incentives and increase firm value by reducing firm size through a spinoff transaction, although doing so eliminates the economies of scale advantage of being a larger firm and the benefits of operating an internal capital market within the firm. Finally, our article suggests that established firms can benefit from creating their own competition in the product and labor markets by accommodating new firm entry, and the desire to do so is greater at the intermediate stages of industry/product development.

Various methods of accommodating structural breaks were considered when forecasting daily exchange rate volatility using GARCH models. In sharp contrast to previous evidence from currencies of developed countries, accommodating structural breaks, however, did not improve out-of-sample forecasts of exchange rate volatility, i.e., a simple GARCH(1,1) with expanding window model performed best in forecasting exchange rate volatilities in these emerging markets.","[Su, Yongyang] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Finance & Decis Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Zirve Univ, Dept Econ, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin] Kadir Has Univ, Dept Int Finance, Istanbul, Turkey",Hong Kong Baptist University; Zirve University; Kadir Has University,"Su, YY (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Finance & Decis Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nasdaq2010@hotmail.com; kenlau123@hotmail.com; mhbilgin@khas.edu.tr,"Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/K-6487-2017; Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019","Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592",,,,,39,4,4,0,11,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

These results are obtained both when we consider herding into individual stocks and herding into stocks in general. Herding depends on the firm's systematic risk and size, and the professionals are less sensitive to these variables. The differences between the amateurs and the professionals may be attributable to the latter's superior financial training. Most of the results are consistent with the theory that herding is information-based. We also find that the herding behavior of the two groups is a persistent phenomenon, and that it is positively and significantly correlated with stock market returns' volatility. Finally, herding, mainly by amateurs, causes market volatility in the Granger causality sense. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, places with high marginal costs also tend to have high marginal damages. Ton-for-ton trading reduces emissions in low damage areas (rural) while increasing emissions in high damage areas (cities). From 2000 to 2007, conservative estimates of the value of mortality risk suggest that trades increased damages from $0.8 to $1.1 billion annually relative to the initial allowance allocation and from $1.5 to $1.9 billion annually relative to a uniform performance standard. With U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) values, trades increased damages from $2.4 to $3.2 billion annually compared to the initial allowance allocation and from $4.4 to $5.4 billion compared to a uniform performance standard. It is not clear that the ton-for-ton SO2 cap and trade program is actually more efficient than comparable command and control programs. The trading program needs to be modified so that tons are weighted by their marginal damage.

Current tax deductions, credits, and exclusions, which are collectively known as tax expenditures, reduce tax revenues and create complicated incentives that affect the ways taxpayers earn and spend their incomes. Because these tax provisions distort behavior relative to a neutral tax code, it is possible that eliminating some or all of them could simultaneously raise revenue and reduce tax-induced distortions of economic activity. Sweeping changes in tax expenditures have been recommended in several recent high profile reform proposals. The papers in this special issue of the National Tax Journal examine the revenue effects of the distribution of benefits from, and the efficiency costs of current tax expenditures. These papers will be a valuable input for the analysis of potential reforms, and will help to identify unresolved issues that deserve further research attention.","[Poterba, James M.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Poterba, James M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Poterba, JM (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",poterba@mit.edu,,,,,,,6,13,19,0,5,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Handling these micro-scale spaces within the broader context of outdoor - urban environments is a significant challenge in transportation analysis and geographic information science. This complexity stems from the greater computational requirements, the specificity of indoor network data structures, as well as the inherent perceptual intricacies of 3D visualization. As built environments grow in size and in complexity, two-dimensional urban geography research reveals its limits. This paper advocates for 3D network-based urban research and showcases the feasibility of this approach for three specific types of urban analytical functionalities, namely route planning, spatial accessibility assessment, and facility location planning. The latter modeling functionality can be viewed as foundational elements for comprehensive network-based three-dimensional analytics of urban environments. The effectiveness of the data modeling scheme and of the integrated software application 3DCityNet is discussed through the three coupled geospatial modeling functionalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They provide daily returns that are in a multiple or a negative multiple of the daily returns on a market benchmark. In this paper, we examine the characteristics, trading statistics, pricing efficiency and tracking errors of a sample of leveraged ETFs. We find that these ETFs are traded mainly by retail traders with very short holding periods. Price deviations (from NAV) are small on average, but large premiums and discounts are prone to occur. More interestingly, the behavior of premiums is different between bull (i.e., those with a positive multiple) and bear ETFs (i.e., those with a negative multiple). Our findings are consistent with the argument that the end-of-day rebalancing of the funds exposures increases market volatility at the close of a trading day.

Yet environmental management differs from a firm's production in one important respect: while a firm seeks efficient input allocation to maximize profit, an environmental planner allocates abatement efforts to render the production of damage agents as inefficient as possible. We characterize a solution to the multiple pollutants problem and show that the optimal policy is often a corner solution, in which abatement is focused on a single pollutant. Corner solutions may arise even in well-behaved problems with concave production functions and convex damage and cost functions. Furthermore, even concentrating on a wrong pollutant may yield greater net benefits than setting uniform abatement targets for all harmful substances. Our general theoretical results on the management of flow and stock pollutants are complemented by two numerical examples illustrating the abatement of eutrophying nutrients and greenhouse gases.","[Kuosmanen, Timo] Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, Helsinki 00100, Finland; [Kuosmanen, Timo; Laukkanen, Marita] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Econ Res Unit, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Laukkanen, Marita] Govt Inst Econ Res, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Aalto University; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Kuosmanen, T (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Econ, Runeberginkatu 22-24, Helsinki 00100, Finland.",timo.kuosmanen@aalto.fi; marita.laukkanen@mtt.fi,"Kuosmanen, Timo/B-5532-2008","Kuosmanen, Timo/0000-0001-9232-5387; Laukkanen, Marita/0000-0003-3189-189X",,,,,23,18,18,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The data show that from 1997 onward, the impact of multilateral aid is strongly and robustly associated with lower corruption levels, while bilateral aid is shown to be an insignificant determinant. An increase in any official development assistance (ODA) pre-1997 is associated with higher levels of corruption or has no impact at all.

This paper tests the extent to which distressed mortgage borrowers benefit from three types of state foreclosure polices: (I) judicial foreclosure proceedings, (2) statutory rights of redemption, and (3) statewide foreclosure-prevention initiatives. Based on an analysis of borrowers in default who reside in 22 cross-state metropolitan statistical area pairs, state policies generally have weak effects. Both judicial foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure prevention initiatives are associated with modest increases in loan modification rates. Using a matching procedure, a lender's letter promoting mortgage default counseling was associated with increases in loan modifications, decreases in loan cures, and decreases in foreclosure starts. The effects of the letter were also stronger in states with judicial proceedings. (C) 2011 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.","[Collins, J.

In particular, the theory and application of social discount rates and regional welfare weights are considered from the perspective of the European Commission as both supranational planner and provider of major funding for investment in the EU-12 area. The aim is to provide answers to three main questions. First, should different discount rates be applied in the appraisal of projects impacting on the Turkish and Greek regions of the island? Second, if different discount rates apply, then what approach should be taken in the discounting of costs and benefits for projects impacting on the entire island? Finally, what is the best method to estimate regional welfare weights for Cyprus and how should these weights be applied in social CBA in order to take proper account of the considerably lower average standard of living in North Cyprus? This particular case study serves to highlight a practical procedure, with suitable theoretical underpinnings, for the calculation and incorporation of regional welfare weights in social CBA more generally and especially with regard to Europe.","[Evans, David J.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Kula, Erhun] Bahcesehir Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Oxford Brookes University; Bahcesehir University,"Evans, DJ (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",djevans@brookes.ac.uk; erhun.kula@bahcesehir.edu.tr,,,,,,,45,7,9,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We begin by attempting to elucidate the debate that has recently occurred on the appropriate choice of the discount rate. We offer three justifications for maximizing the discounted sum of generational utilities, and find only one of these to be a satisfactory justification of that practice: the possibility that the human species may become extinct. This implies that a very small discount rate (large discount factor) should be used. We argue that the justification for discounting, inherent in the approaches taken by many economists, is that of 'the present generation of hegemon,' which is unacceptable. The role of the Ramsey equation in deducing the discount rate in these theories is explained. As an alternative to discounted utilitarianism, we propose a principle of sustainability; we describe optimal paths that have been calculated for the sustainabilitiarian (Rawlsian) objective function, and paths that will sustain growth in welfare, at a positive rate. We report results concerning optimal paths when the uncertainty of existence of future generations is taken into account. In sharp contrast to the utilitarian model, it turns out that under some conditions, the 'sustainabilitarian' can ignore the uncertainty regarding the date at which humans become extinct. There is a striking difference between the solutions of the discounted utilitarian program and the sustainabilitarian program under uncertainty.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Roemer, JE (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",john.roemer@yale.edu,,,,,,,27,37,41,3,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper brings together the existing literature in the fields of airport environmental capacity, non-acoustic factors of noise annoyance, NIMBYism and environmental conflicts. We also analyze the socio-environmental conflict between Barcelona airport and the community of Gaya Mar. This case shows that the lack of trust between parties, the impossibility of predicting noise exposure, the absence of opportunities for civil society to speak and the difficulty of accessing relevant information foster annoyance and mobilization in the communities that live around the airport.

In a theoretical model of a regionally heterogeneous economy, we show how different regional rates of technical progress due to trade and FDI interact with constraints to unskilled labor mobility. As favored regions benefit more from trade, their growing demand for skills drains skilled workers from disadvantaged areas, and average incomes in the former grow faster than in the latter. Moreover, this unbalanced regional growth may also raise inequality within each region. It could even reduce absolute income per capita in the less favored region. We test these predictions with Chinese data from the Open Door era. Results confirm that different regional growth rates have increased both interregional and intraregional inequality.

Credit cards allow consumers to borrow money very easily in order to satisfy their desire to purchase. In two web-based experiments, we found that compulsive shoppers often overspent and were rarely influenced by price. Their overspending was partially mediated by their excessive use of credit cards. Furthermore, compulsive shoppers were less conscious of their budgets, especially when they used credit cards. They also obtained more pleasure from accomplishing a shopping trip and were more distressed by delayed product delivery than normal shoppers. Finally, compulsive shoppers in Taiwan were more compulsive than those in the United Kingdom: they displayed many of the above symptoms of compulsive buying more saliently. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The new exchange, if implemented, is expected to consist of the 30 largest market cap stocks from each member country. While countries that have agreed to join include Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, other countries in the regions are still considering whether the move will benefit their local investors. This paper aims to investigate this issue by comparing the benefits of adding international large-cap stocks into a portfolio as oppose to adding local mid and small-cap stocks. The stochastic dominance between ASEAN40 and each of its underlying index returns is studied to compare the two options. ASEAN40 consists of the 40 largest market cap stocks from 5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and each country index consists of large, mid, and small cap stocks in its local market. Results show that ASEAN40 dominates the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand at all levels which means that investors who have monotonic utility function would be better off when investing in large-cap stocks and diversify across countries. However, the stochastic dominance in Indonesia and Malaysia switches. Sub-sample tests show that the stochastic dominance is insignificant in Indonesia and that the stochastic dominance between ASEAN40 and Malaysia is closely tied to Malaysia's economy. The overall results imply that international large-cap stocks add value to the portfolio and are attractive investments during normal time and especially during domestic economic recession. Therefore, the ASEAN link equity exchange is worth investing in and shows potential for ASEAN countries to benefit their local investors.","[Aumeboonsuke, Vesarach] Assumption Univ, Bangkok, Thailand",,,vesarach@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-07-0625-8,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,22.0,,,,,,31,36,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000318459600007,0

Using data from a unique longitudinal study, we show how different methods lead to very different assessments of socio-economic mobility. We suggest five ways of reconciling these differences: considering assets in addition to expenditures, proximity to the poverty line, other aspects of well-being, household division, and qualitative recall errors. Considering assets and proximity to the poverty line along with expenditures resolves three-fifths of the qualitative and quantitative differences. Use of such integrated mixed-methods can therefore improve the reliability of poverty dynamics research.","[Davis, Peter] Social Dev Res Initiat, Bath BA2 5EY, Avon, England; [Baulch, Bob] Prosper Initiat CIC, Chron Poverty Res Ctr, Hanoi, Vietnam",,"Davis, P (通讯作者)，Social Dev Res Initiat, 4 Victoria Pl, Bath BA2 5EY, Avon, England.",ecsprd@gmail.com,,"Baulch, Bob/0000-0003-1977-5802",,,,,45,42,49,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,,,J DEV STUD,J.

We find that such externalities can generate complementarities in information acquisition within the standard rational expectations paradigm. When agents are sensitive to the wealth of others, they herd on the same information, trying to mimic each other's trading strategies. We show that there can be multiple herding equilibria in which different communities pursue different information acquisition strategies. This multiplicity of equilibria generates price discontinuities: An infinitesimal shift in fundamentals can lead to a discrete price movement.","[Garcia, Diego; Strobl, Gunter] Univ N Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"García, D (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, McColl Bldg,CB 3490, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",diego_garcia@unc.edu; strobl@unc.edu,,"Strobl, Gunter/0000-0002-9067-9680",,,,,60,33,41,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

While supporters of EAS tout the economic benefits of connecting rural and isolated communities, critics cite high costs, low use and antiquated eligibility requirements as factors which compromise the value of the program. In this paper, a comprehensive database of US airports is combined with network analysis techniques and a geographic information system to evaluate population access (at the census tract level) to EAS airports for 2006. Results suggest that redundant coverage of EAS market areas by alternative Federal Aviation Administration designated hub airports can contribute to EAS airport market leakage and that alternative definitions of EAS community eligibility have the potential to dramatically increase programmatic efficiency and reduce federal monies spent on EAS subsidies.

While the new institutional and development economics have substantially improved economic models, they still rely on the neoclassical assumptions of methodological individualism and utilitarism. Therefore, they cannot fully grasp the gender and cultural aspects of the societies living in developing countries, the dynamic character of their economies and their embedment in the natural, social and institutional environment. These scientific biases are analysed from the standpoint of four heterodox economic schools: those of feminist economics, evolutionary economics, ecological economics, and economic anthropology. The subsequent failure of the economic policies is documented by the cross-cutting example of the Structural Adjustment Programmes of the Bretton Woods institutions. The article concludes by emphasizing the common points of the heterodox schools and advocating for a methodological plurality in the Czech economic research and education.","Inst Int Relat, CZ-11850 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Institute of International Relations - Czech Republic,"Horky, O (通讯作者)，Inst Int Relat, Nerudova 3, CZ-11850 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",horky@iir.cz,"Horký-Hlucháň, Ondřej/AAM-4406-2020","Horký-Hlucháň, Ondřej/0000-0001-6966-1948",,,,,74,2,2,1,21,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Sustainable development has been created to describe the development that satisfies the needs of today without risking the capacity of the future generations to satisfy their own needs. The role of innovation in this procedure is central. The existing bibliography has introduced the term 'sustainable innovation', as innovation that aims at addressing the problems of both climate change and environment. In this context, 'sustainable' innovation is innovation that optimize the use and exploitation of natural resources, save energy, promote the ecological building, contribute to sustainable agriculture, etc.. Our analysis is a first research effort to describe and measure 'sustainable innovation' in Greece. We rely on patent data and more precisely on the total of patents that have been granted by the Greek patent office. The existing pattern shows that Greek innovation is characterized by a traditional technology orientation, where a large part of technologies is related to the construction industry and the agricultural sector. Almost the 11% of patents could be directly linked to sustainable development, focusing on the optimization of the exploitation of natural resources. On the contrary we have no patents in 'sustainable' agriculture. Deepening our analysis it can be shown that Greek inventors develop patents aiming at the saving of energy in buildings.

Academic and policy debate has primarily focused on discrimination against rural migrants on arrival in urban areas. Meanwhile, barriers to migration out of rural areas have received less attention. This paper examines the role of incomplete rural property rights in the migration decisions of rural households. We examine the relationship between tenure insecurity and restrictions on land rentals, and participation in outside labor markets. The results indicate that tenure insecurity reduces migration. This relationship is particularly pronounced on forest land, which has implications for the conservation of recently replanted forest areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The article considers the following essential factors that need to be taken into account for optimizing capital: tax legislation, systematic environment risk, possible conflicts of interest, quality of assets and the availability of financing. The influence of each factor on optimizing decisions is shown. Finally, it is noted that decisions on capital structure optimization cannot be taken in isolation from other pertinent factors.","[Saksonova, Svetlana; Cikste, Kaspars] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,Svetlana.Saksonova@lu.lv; Kaspars.Cikste@lu.lv,"Saksonova, Svetlana/ABE-3576-2020","Saksonova, Svetlana/0000-0003-3635-9122",,,,,8,1,1,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Although this residue can be supplied without any production costs, the biogas production made in Germany increased especially based on cultivated energy crops. The predominant part of the accruing manure is not used yet. In this paper, therefore, the need for additional promotion of energetic use of manure is discussed. The results based on literature values and investment calculations show that the avoidance of greenhouse gases (GHG) with biogas from manure causes a high potential and low external cost compared to biogas of corn silage. Manure transports influence the costs of GHG mitigation strongly; nevertheless low transport distances may be accepted. However, individual economic barriers exist for the use of manure instead of energy crops. An increase of manure proportion often increases the electricity production costs especially if manure has to be transported. In conclusion, it seems to be appropriate to promote the energy use of manure with the aim of a high utilization of the existing potential and an avoidance of unwanted effects to the land markets.","[Thiering, Jochen; Bahrs, Enno] Univ Hohenheim, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Thiering, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landwirtschaft Betriebslehre Schloss, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",i410B@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,54,6,6,0,14,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Regional trends are measured mainly using a variety of approaches the coefficient of variation, the Herfindahl index or the Geographic concentration index. The second part of the paper is based on empirical data and calculations of the indexes or the coefficients. Unemployment rates and number of unemployed paper are used for calculations. From the analysis we can see remarkable differences between regions. Moreover, regional unemployment disparities across Visegrad group countries appear to be characterized by a high degree of persistence.

To visualize the geographical position of the individual elements, Google Maps API was implemented as it provides constant updating and makes other related Google Inc. functions available. The SW solution itself was developed in JavaScript and map data loading was realized by means of JSON technology using PHP Nette Framework and Dibi database layer. The MPRR 1.0 solution represents qualitatively a brand new perspective of map data creation and it entails many original elements and functionalities (cluster analysis, object aggregation and disaggregation, viewing basic information and optional detailed information, customized preview etc.). MPRR 1.0 was verified by implementation over two kinds of data: a relatively wide and detailed database of organic farms and biogas stations database - in the pilot stage, the region of South Bohemia has been chosen for both cases.

Since 1990, foreign capital flows have become a part of the increasingly important and dynamic in more countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Romania, allowing a gradual reintegration into the world economy. For this reason, we proposed to establish in this paper an analysis of the evolution of FDI in Romania, based on the relationship between FDI flows as a percentage of GDP, continuing with the analysis of measures and strategies to attract FDI, the attractiveness of Romania to foreign investors, ultimately making a SWOT analysis of investment environment from Romania.","[Virlanuta, Florina Oana; Nistor, Costel; Muntean, Mihaela-Carmen] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,,florinaoana27@yahoo.com; cos_nis@yahoo.com; mihaela_c_muntean@yahoo.com,"Virlanuta, Florina Oana/V-2926-2019; Muntean, Mihaela C/A-2474-2014",,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,2197,2203,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001109,0

The theoretical part of the paper consists of a brief overview of methods that are employed for analyses of the process of price convergence. Both main concepts sigma and beta convergence are covered including various tests that are described in greater detail. The empirical part of the paper is focused on testing hypotheses of sigma and beta convergence Using macroeconomic data (comparative price levels for GDP) for twelve new EU Member States in the period 1995-2008. Various econometrical methods (OLS, 2SLS, and two dynamic methods) are utilised in order to deal with problems associated with this particular type of analyses. Our results show that both hypotheses (sigma and beta price convergence) do hold for the new EU Member States. The estimated time to close a half of the remaining gap of comparative price levels towards the Euro area average for the group consisting of all new EU Member States (NMS12) is estimated to be approximately 9.6 years, for the group of more advanced countries (NMS5) is approximately 7.1 years.","[Zd'arek, Vaclav] Univ Econ & Management, Ctr Econ Studies, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic; [Zd'arek, Vaclav] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prahue 3, Czech Republic",,"Zd'árek, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Ctr Econ Studies, Narozni 2600-9A, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic.",vaclav.zdarek@vsem.cz,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Empirically, the paper shows that international trade declined more drastically than trade-weighted production or absorption and there was a sizable inventory adjustment. This is most clearly evident for automobile, the industry with the largest drop in trade. However, relative to the magnitude of the U.S. downturn, these movements in trade are quite typical. The paper develops a two-country general equilibrium model with endogenous inventory holdings in response to frictions in domestic and foreign transactions costs. With more severe frictions on international transactions, in a downturn, the calibrated model shows a larger decline in output and an even larger decline in international trade, relative to a more standard model without inventories. The magnitudes of production, trade, and inventory responses are quantitatively similar to those observed in the current and previous U.S. recessions.

Frequent contact among twins results in similar investment behavior beyond a genetic factor. Twins who grew up in different environments still display similar investment behavior.

Yet there has been little economic analysis of renewable energy. This article surveys the literature on the economics of renewable energy and adds to it. The conclusion is that the main renewables face a major problem because of their intermittency (the wind doesn't always blow nor does the sun always shine) and that this has not been adequately factored into discussions of their potential. Without new storage technologies that can overcome this intermittency problem, much of the decarbonization of the economy will have to come from nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and energy efficiency, with geothermal and biofuels making small contributions. Nuclear and CCS are not without their problems. New energy storage technologies could greatly increase the role of renewables, but none are currently in sight.","Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",Columbia University,"Heal, G (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA.",gmh1@columbia.edu,,,,,,,34,46,52,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Specifically, we hypothesize that domestic and foreign investors evaluate domestic stocks via different models and thus arrive at different valuations for them; consequently, the two investor groups are attracted to different sets of domestic stocks. Using panel data from Korea, we find strong support for our hypothesis. More precisely, we find that the foreign ownership of a stock increases with foreigners' valuation for the stock in excess of that of domestic investors. As we control for various firm characteristics known to be correlated with foreign ownership, our results indicate that the valuation difference between domestic and foreign investors can help explain the allocation of domestic stocks between the two groups over and above the existing explanations.

Four strategic decisions are investigated: to start, increase, decrease or stop outsourcing. It is found that internal R&D employment intensity decreases when firms decide to start, to increase, or to stop R&D outsourcing. However, this finding hides important differences according to the type and the location of the contractor. In general, firms prefer a mix of different types of contractors at different locations. Started outsourcing of R&D to research centers within the nation and increased R&D outsourcing to research centers within the region appear to decrease the internal R&D employment intensity. Decreasing outsourcing to national universities in another region also has a negative impact on internal R&D employment intensity. A corporate decision to stop R&D outsourcing to other firms within the nation but outside the region has a positive impact on the internal R&D employment intensity.

Most macroeconomic data are sampled monthly (e.g., employment) or quarterly (e.g., GDP). Most financial variables (e.g., interest rates and asset prices), on the other hand, are sampled daily or even more frequently. The challenge is how to best use available data. To that end, the authors survey some common methods for dealing with mixed-frequency data. They show that, in some cases, simply averaging the higher-frequency data produces no discernible disadvantage. In other cases, however, explicitly modeling the flow of data (e.g., using mixed data sampling as in Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov, 2004) may be more beneficial to the forecaster, especially if the forecaster is interested in constructing intra-period forecasts.

First, we focus on the interactions between family status and unemployment risks. Being in a couple rather than single, as the number of children influence unemployment duration. In turn, unemployment impacts couple formation and dissolution, as the decision to have children and the timing of births. We then investigate the mutual insurance role against labour income risks played by the spouses. We insist on the limited insurance provided by the spouses due to limited commitment, and the particularly high default risk in bad times for the couple. The latter risk is all the more important than unemployment alters bargaining powers inside the couple. Finally, this leads us to investigate the institutional framework aimed at protecting individuals/families against labour market hazards (Unemployment Insurance and Employment Protection Legislation) and its interactions with the family. It turns out that many countries provide more Employment Protection to those having a family. However, Unemployment Insurance depends very little on family status, once taxes and transfers are taken into account.","[Charlot, Olivier] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95000 Cergy, France; [Decreuse, Bruno] Univ Mediterranee, GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Decreuse, Bruno] Univ Mediterranee, IDEP GREQAM, F-13236 Marseille 02, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Charlot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95000 Cergy, France.",ocharlot@u-cergy.fr; bruno.decreuse@univmed.fr,"CHARLOT, OLIVIER/HTM-7929-2023","Charlot, Olivier/0000-0003-2245-2369",,,,,85,1,1,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

By introducing the product market into the stochastic framework of Weitzman (Rev Econ Stud 41:477-491, 1974), this paper shows for the case of a polluting symmetric Cournot oligopoly that Weitzman's policy rule for choosing emission standards versus taxes with uncertain abatement costs is biased in the presence of market power. Since the oligopolists take into account their influence on the market price, their total abatement effort, including the restriction of output, is less vulnerable to miscalculations of the tax rate compared to price-taking firms. Consequently, the comparative advantage of instruments is shifted in favour of taxes. In a further step, the provided policy recommendations are generalised by abolishing the assumption that firms are symmetric.","Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Heuson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",clemens.heuson@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,21,17,17,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The interdependencies between the monthly changes of envisaged risk factors and the subsequent hedge fund returns remain remarkably stable in terms of the observed direction of impact.

Venture capital investment opportunities are modeled as real options with multiple volatilities, and the entrepreneur's incentive is assumed to maximize the probability of getting funded in the next financing round. Two celebrated formulae in the option pricing literature are generalized to evaluate these real options. We find that staging not only gives the VC a waiting option but also mitigates the agency problem of the entrepreneur undertaking too conservative activities. Moreover, we find that the VC tends to stage her investment when the expected growth rate of the venture's market value is lower. However, the risk-free interest rate is not an important factor in the staging decision. Our model also provides a good explanation for existing empirical evidence on the staging of venture capital investment.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Asset Pricing & Infrastruct Econ Res Grp APIER, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Hsu, YW (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Asset Pricing & Infrastruct Econ Res Grp APIER, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",yhsu@management.ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,22,27,2,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

With the ASPK in hand, preference free call option formulas are obtained for rescaled and shifted beta distribution of the first kind (RSB1) and for the second kind (RSB2). These distributions include many well known important distributions as special cases. If the preference free formula does not exist under the GB distribution class, then the call price is shown to be numerically calculated without information of preference parameters once the spot price of the underlying is given.","Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Finance Accounting & Law, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1030027, Japan",Waseda University,"Ikeda, M (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Finance Accounting & Law, Chuo Ku, 1-4-1 Nihombashi, Tokyo 1030027, Japan.",mikeda@waseda.jp,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We operationalize exploitation and exploration in terms of innovation streams; incremental innovation in existing products as well as architectural and/or discontinuous innovation. Based on in-depth, longitudinal data on 13 business units and 22 innovations, we describe the consequences of organization design choices on innovation outcomes as well as the ongoing performance of existing products. We find that ambidextrous organization designs are relatively more effective in executing innovation streams than functional, cross-functional, and spinout designs. Further, transitions to ambidextrous designs are associated with increased innovation outcomes, while shifts away from ambidextrous designs are associated with decreased innovation outcomes. We describe the nature of ambidextrous organizational designs-their characteristics, underlying processes, and boundary conditions. More broadly, we suggest that the locus of integration and degree of structural differentiation together affect a firm's ability to explore and exploit. We suggest that the senior team's ability to attend to and deal with contradictory internal architectures is a crucial determinant of a firm's ability to exploit in the short term and explore over time.","[Tushman, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Smith, Wendy K.] Univ Delaware, Alfred Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Wood, Robert Chapman] San Jose State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Management & Org, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Westerman, George] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [O'Reilly, Charles] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Harvard University; University of Delaware; California State University System; San Jose State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Stanford University,"Tushman, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Morgan Hall 313, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",mtushman@hbs.edu; smithw@udel.edu; Robert.Wood@sjsu.edu; georgew@mit.edu; oreilly_charles@gsb.stanford.edu,"Smith, Wendy K/H-9575-2013",,,,,,100,154,177,4,154,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Using long-term annual data from the US and three European countries, we revisit this stylized fact, and we also report results on return predictability. We make two main contributions. First, we document that for the US, results for long-horizon predictability are crucially dependent on whether returns and dividend growth are measured in nominal or real terms, and this difference is due to long-term inflation being strongly negatively predictable by the dividend-price ratio. The impact of inflation is to reinforce real return predictability and to reduce - or change direction of - real dividend growth predictability. This provides an explanation for the strong predictability of long-horizon real returns in the 'right' direction, and the strong predictability of long-horizon real dividend growth in the 'wrong' direction, that we see in US post war data. Second, we find that predictability patterns in three European stock markets are in many ways different from what characterize the US stock market. In particular, in Sweden and Denmark dividend growth is strongly predictable by the dividend-price ratio in the 'right' direction while returns are not predictable. The results for the UK are mixed. Our results are robust to a number of changes in the modeling framework. We discuss the results for dividend growth predictability in terms of the 'dividend smoothing hypothesis'.

We conduct an in and out-of-sample comparative study and apply the Goyal and Welch (2003) graphical method to equity premia derived from the UK FTSE All-Share and the S&P 500 indices. Preliminary in-sample univariate regressions reveal that in both markets the equity premium contains an element of predictability. However, the considered out-of-sample models outperform the historical moving average only in the UK context. This is confirmed by the graphical diagnostic which further indicates that dividend ratios are useful predictors of UK excess returns. Our paper provides a possible explanation of why dividend ratios might be more informative in the UK market by linking these findings to the disappearing dividend phenomenon. Finally, Campbell and Shiller (1988) identities are employed to account for the time-varying properties of the dividend ratio and dividend growth processes. It is shown that by instrumenting the models with the identities, forecasting ability can be further improved. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Chaebol-affiliated firms in Korea have experienced dramatic changes in their costs and benefits along three time periods (19841988, 1990-1995, and 2001-2005). They did not suffer a value loss relative to non-affiliated firms in the 1980s, but did so in the 1990s In the post-crisis period, however, they began to show value gains To identify the causes of these changes, we examine if chaebol firms prioritize profit stability over profit maximization. overinvest in low-return businesses, cross-subsidize the low-performing affiliates of their group, and possess greater debt capacity, consequently enjoying lower tax burdens We discover that in the 1980s. chaebol firms generally enjoyed various perks, such as tax breaks, but shied away from excessive investment activities In the 1990s, their performance worsened because of substantial over-investment, despite several advantages. However, after massive restructuring and sorting out following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, chaebols emerged as very profitable firms correcting over-investment despite the absence of tax perks and debt- carrying advantages.

In recent years, however, the rapid development and availability of small, inexpensive, and reliable tracking devices has led to a growing volume of research that uses this technology as a tool for data collection in various disciplines. This paper presents new insights that are now available regarding the outdoor mobility of the elderly due to the analysis of GPS data with automatic scripts and GIS platforms. The data presented are based on the activity of 49 elderly people from the Tel-Aviv Metropolitan area (Israel), who took part in an interdisciplinary project, involving researchers in geography, social work, gerontology, psychology and medicine, that studies the outdoor activities of elderly people in time and space using advanced tracking technologies. Participants were tracked for an average of 28 consecutive days using a location kit that combined GPS with RFID technology. Differences were found in various walking and driving parameters, such as speed, length, timing, and frequency of participants with different levels of cognitive function. The trends present a general decline in out-of-home mobility of elderly people with cognitive impairment and illuminates as well the important role that additional factors as age, gender, and the accessibility to a private car play in determining levels of out-of-home mobility.

Yet many cost benefit evaluations suggest that landmine clearance is socially wasteful because costs appear to far outweigh social benefits. This paper presents new estimates of the benefits of clearing landmines based on a contingent valuation survey in two provinces in rural Cambodia where we asked respondents questions that elicit their trade-offs between money and the risk of death from landmine accidents. The estimated Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) is US$ 0.4 million. In contrast, most previous studies of landmine clearance use foregone income or average GDP per capita, which has a lifetime value of only US$ 2,000 in Cambodia. Humanitarian landmine clearance emerges as a more attractive rural development policy when appropriate estimates of the VSL are used.","[Cameron, Michael; Gibson, John; Lim, Steven; Tressler, John] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Vaddanak, Kien] Cambodian Red Cross, Disaster Management Dept, Phnom Penh, Cambodia",University of Waikato,"Cameron, M (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",mcam@waikato.ac.nz; jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz; kenthelmers@yahoo.com; slim1@waikato.ac.nz; tressler@waikato.ac.nz; dmd.crc@bigpond.com.kh,"Gibson, John/AAM-6159-2020","Gibson, John/0000-0003-3886-6873; Tressler, John/0000-0002-1954-955X; Cameron, Michael/0000-0002-4296-3775",,,,,29,9,9,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

In addition to this well-known ex-post decision to exit, entrepreneurs select ex-ante whether they are willing to pursue an entrepreneurial career at all, or to give up their entrepreneurial intentions. Hardly anything is known about the latter selection process in imagined markets that precedes the creation of variation and selection process in real markets. This article explores these two selection processes using survey data on 20,000 individuals in 27 European countries and the United States in 2007. We distinguish business failure from exit by sell-off. Individuals in the United States are less likely to exit imagined markets and are more likely to exit the real market than are Europeans. Individuals in a corporatist welfare state regime have relatively high chances to exit imagined markets but low chances to exit real markets (due to failure). Business owners in metropolitan and urban environments are more likely to fail than their rural counterparts, while individuals with a high risk tolerance and individuals with a self-employed parent are less likely to exit imagined or real markets (via business failure). In short, this study shows that exit in real and in imagined markets is differently affected by individual characteristics as well as by the competitive and institutional environment.","[Stam, Erik] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Tjalling Koopmans Inst, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stam, Erik] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Technol Management, Cambridge, England; [Thurik, Roy; van der Zwan, Peter] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Ctr Adv Small Business Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Thurik, Roy] EIM Business & Policy Res, Zoetermeer, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Cambridge; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Stam, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Tjalling Koopmans Inst, Janskerkhof 12, NL-3512 BL Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.stam@uu.nl; thurik@ese.eur.nl; vanderzwan@ese.eur.nl,"Thurik, Roy/A-9386-2012; Stam, Erik/E-6605-2017","Thurik, Roy/0000-0002-0242-6908;",,,,,108,48,52,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Analyzing loan rates and firms' decision to switch lenders provides further evidence for banks' strategic use of private information.

While some claim that fish trade has a pro-poor effect, others denounce the negative effect of fish export on local populations food security and doubt its contributions to the macro-economy. In this paper, we explore this debate in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis did not find any evidence of direct negative impact of fish trade on food security; neither did it find evidence that international fish trade generates positive, pro-poor outcomes. This paper discusses the possible reasons for this apparent lack of development impact and highlights the unsupported assumptions underlying the current discourse about international fish trade. We suggest that, given lack of evidence for the development benefits of fish trade between Africa and developed countries, fisheries policy could consider support for regional (Africa-to-Africa) trade that meets the growing African demand for lower-value fish. Means of overcoming barriers to intra-African trade in fish are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As presented in the recent study by Eberlein and Madan (Quantitative Finance 9(1):27-42, 2009), the pricing of such exotic products (which consist primarily of different variations of locally/globally, capped/floored, arithmetic/geometric etc. cliquets) depends critically on the modeling of the forward-return distributions. Therefore, in our approach, we directly take up the modeling of forward variances corresponding to the tenor structure of the product to be priced. We propose a two factor forward variance market model with jumps in returns and volatility. It allows the model user to directly control the behavior of future smiles and hence properly price forward smile risk of cliquet-style exotic products. The key idea, in order to achieve consistency between the dynamics of forward variance swaps and the underlying stock, is to adopt a forward starting model for the stock dynamics over each reset period of the tenor structure. We also present in detail the calibration steps for our proposed model.","Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Drimus, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Univ Pk 2, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",gdrimus@math.ku.dk,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

To explain why many issuing firms choose a higher cost fully marketed offer, we posit that the marketing effort flattens the issuer's short-run demand curve. Alternatively stated, with a fully marketed offer, the issuer is paying investment bankers to create demand, making the elasticity of demand at the time of issuance an endogenous choice variable. Empirical analysis shows that both the pre-issue elasticity of the issuing firm's demand curve and the offer size are important determinants of the offer method choice.

We study bids and expenditures in different experimental frames and matching procedures and tie in with the literature on stepwise linear bidding functions.","[Kirchkamp, Oliver] Univ Jena, Sch Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hoerisch, Hannah] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Bonn,"Kirchkamp, O (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",oliver@kirchkamp.de,"Kirchkamp, Oliver/C-3131-2011",,,,,,44,26,29,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2010,144.0,1-2,,,,,347,367,,10.1007/s11127-009-9523-y,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,595WU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277645200018,0

However, since individual stock returns share a common sensitivity to true market return shocks, higher aggregate risk can be revealed by higher correlation between stocks. In addition, a change in stock market variance that leaves aggregate risk unchanged can have a zero or even negative effect on the stock market risk premium. We show that the average correlation between daily stock returns predicts subsequent quarterly stock market excess returns. We also show that changes in stock market risk holding average correlation constant can be interpreted as changes in the average variance of individual stocks. Such changes have a negative relation with future stock market excess returns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Lower cross-divisional correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between investment opportunity and cash flow correspond to lower cash holdings, even after controlling for cash flow volatility. The effects are strongest in financially constrained firms and in well-governed firms, and correspond to efficient fund transfers from low- to high-productivity divisions.

The paper employs a quantitative two-sector model of a small open economy with financial frictions calibrated to Mexican and Turkish economies, two major recipients, whose remittance receipts feature opposite cyclical characteristics. We find that remittances dampen business cycles in Mexico, whereas they amplify the cycles in Turkey. Their quantitative effects in the long run, approximated by the stochastic steady state, are mild. In the short run, however, remittances have quantitatively large impacts on the economy, when the economy is borrowing-constrained. This is because agents in the economy cannot adjust their precautionary wealth to sudden tightening in credit, and hence, fluctuations in remittances get magnified through an endogenous debt-deflation mechanism. The findings suggest that procyclical (or countercyclical) remittances can play a significant deepening (or mitigating) role for sudden stops.

As highlighted by Roth (2007), effective market design must ensure three basic principles: market thickness, lack of congestion, and market safety. Roth also highlights the importance of dealing with repugnance. Our analysis identifies the factors that are, in most circumstances, likely to inhibit the allocative efficiency of MfT. We show that key institutional developments such as the development of formalized IP exchanges suggest that effective market design may be possible for some innovation markets. Finally, our analysis suggests that markets for ideas are beset by the repugnance problem: from the perspective of market design, Open Science is an institution that places normative value on free disclosure and so undermines the ability of ideas producers to earn market-based returns for producing even very valuable pure knowledge.","[Gans, Joshua S.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Stern, Scott] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Melbourne; Northwestern University,"Gans, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",j.gans@unimelb.edu.au; s-stern2@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,"Gans, Joshua/0000-0001-6567-5859",,,,,82,106,123,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

From the perspective of consumers' protection, we consider that education for a healthy consumption is an appropriate answer that can generate a durable change of the present pattern towards a more generous consumption from an intergenerational point of view that can also sustain a high quality of life for the generations that coexists and succeed themselves.","[Popescu, Silvia-Florina; Stroe, Cristina] Natl Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Constantin] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, SF (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",silvia_florina2004@yahoo.com,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,27,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,530,545,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000020,0

In particular, we were interested in whether responses to 'contextual' questions - where the specific context in which the deaths occur is known - differ from 'generic' questions - where the context is unknown. Further, we set out to test whether sensitivity to the numbers of deaths differed across the 'generic' and 'contextual' versions of the questions. We uncovered evidence to suggest that both the perceived 'badness' of different types of deaths and sensitivity to the numbers of deaths may differ according to whether 'generic' or 'contextual' descriptions are used. Qualitative data suggests two reasons why responses to 'generic' and 'contextual' questions differed: firstly, some influential variable(s) were omitted from the 'generic' descriptions and secondly, certain variables were interpreted somewhat differently once the context had been identified. The implications of our findings for 'generic' questions, such as those commonly used in health and safety and environmental studies are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We model strategic interactions between debtholders and equityholders in a game-theoretic setting that can accommodate the varying bargaining powers of the two claimants. Two reorganization strategies are considered: Chapter 11 (debt-equity swap) and private workout (strategic debt service). Using Chapter 11 as a costly state verification device, we characterize in equilibrium which firms choose Chapter 11 and which choose private workout. In particular, we show how the bank's belief about the type of firm evolves by observation of reorganization strategies. We also derive closed-form solutions to both the equity and debt valuation problems under asymmetric information and show that credit spreads increase with the degrees of asymmetric information.

We show that a firm may reach the first best solution while issuing debt or equity to outsiders provided that either the insiders receive a senior claim or that the firm hedges.

In those years, the state offered a competitively allocated $20,000 incentive called the Governor's Teaching Fellowship (GTF) aimed at attracting academically talented, novice teachers to low-performing schools and retaining them. in those schools for at least four years. Taking advantage of data on the career histories of 27,106 individuals who pursued California teaching licenses between 1998 and 2003, we use an instrumental variable strategy to estimate the unbiased impact of the GTF on the decisions of recipients to begin working in low-performing schools within 2 years after licensure program enrollment. We estimate that GTF recipients would have been less likely to teach in low-performing schools than observably similar counterparts had the GTF not existed, but that acquiring a GTF increased their probability of doing so by 28 percentage points. Examining retention patterns, we find that 75 percent of both GTF recipients and nonrecipients who began working in low-performing schools remained in such schools for at least four years.

A case study is presented whereby the proposed framework is applied, to show the success of applying the framework given the current turmoil experienced in the general economy as well as in agricultural commodity markets.

Our results provide strong support for the importance of information and liquidity considerations in being a public firm. These factors are evident at the IPO, on average thirteen years before the going-private decision.

It further argues that while the maximin criterion of sustainability may be appealing to the rich advanced industrial countries, for the poor developing countries it implies equalization of poverty across generations, and as such is too costly a moral obligation to be acceptable. The paper suggests that a compromise development policy that follows the optimal growth approach but adopts certain measures to mitigate both the intergenerational and intragenerational welfare inequalities may be more appropriate for these countries.

This decline and timing are consistent with other macro and micro observations about growth variability that are collectively referred to as the Great Moderation. The variability of earnings growth is negatively correlated with age at any point in time, and the U.S. working age population got older during this period because the Baby Boom was aging. However, the decrease in variability was roughly uniform across all age groups, so population aging is not the source of the overall decline. The variance of log changes also declined at multi-year frequencies in such a way as to suggest that both permanent and transitory components of earnings shocks became more moderate. A simple identification strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a shift over time in the stochastic process occurred even after controlling for age effects.

I find that banks' holding loans have a negative effect on price discounts and no effect on underwriting fees. However, banks' equity holdings have no effect on discount rates and a positive effect on underwriting fees.

Specifically, we first compute the risk-return distance among international stock markets based on the Euclidean distance and find that the distance thus computed has been decreasing significantly over time, implying a mean-variance convergence. In particular, the average risk-return distance has decreased by about 50% over our sample period. We also document that the risk-return characteristics of our sample of 14 emerging markets have been converging rapidly toward those of developed markets in recent years. This development notwithstanding, emerging markets still remain as a distinct asset class.

Historically, this theory enjoyed little empirical support. We provide direct evidence by examining the exchange rate effect of a major redefinition of the MSCI Global Equity Index in 2001 and 2002. The index redefinition implied large changes in the representation of different countries in the MSCI Global Equity Index and therefore produced strong exogenous equity flows by index funds. Our event study reveals that countries with a relatively increasing equity representation experienced a relative currency appreciation upon announcement of the index change. Moreover, stock markets that are upweighted (downweighted) feature a higher (lower) permanent comovement of their currency with the basket of other MSCI currencies.

Overall it is found that the participants' travel behaviour intentions are dominated by a desire to drive and that their values relating to identity. self-image, and social recognition (at the expense of their environmental values), as well as their affective attitudes towards transport modes, are key influences on this. Although they are aware of climate change, the participants' understanding of the link between transport and climate change was weak. At the same time, they illustrated an apathy towards climate change - in part due to the timing and intangibility of its associated impacts and their lack of self-efficacy with respect to tackling this issue. However, despite claiming that their current environmentally friendly travel behaviours (such as walking or cycling to school) are not influenced by the issue of climate change, a number are accepting of the idea of enforced travel behaviour change - away from use of the car, towards more 'environmentally friendly' modes. This acceptance was in part due to their belief that such action would remove the influence of the 'social dilemma', where their own efforts to tackle climate change may be rendered worthless by the inaction of others.

Before being levered when the disciplining role of debt is missing, firms retain excessive amounts of cash. The introduction of debt leads to a dramatic decline in cash ratios and the relation is stronger for firms classified as having poor investment opportunities. For the sub-sample of firms that overinvest in real assets, issuing debt leads to a reduction in abnormal capital expenditures. The decline in overinvestments is explained by debt service obligations that reduce discretionary funds under managerial control. Further, the reduction in overinvestments has a positive impact on equity value. These conclusions hold in other settings where there is a dramatic change in firms' capital structures providing strong support for the hypothesis that debt reduces overinvestments.

Under our calibration, the static distortion costs the U.S. around 1.6% of GDP per year. In addition, the dynamic distortion, reflected in inefficient fluctuations of the oil price markup, generates a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and aligning output with its efficient level.

Two conventional explanations for the inverse relationship have emerged in the literature: (i) factor market imperfections that cause cross-sectional variation in household-specific shadow prices and (ii) the omission of soil quality measurements. This study employs precise soil quality measurements at the plot level with multiple plots per household so as to test both conventional explanations simultaneously. Empirical results show that only a small portion of the inverse productivity-size relationship is explained by market imperfections and none of it seems attributable to the omission of soil quality measurements.

Casino gambling is a relatively new industry in the United States, outside Nevada and New Jersey. As of 2007, 11 states had established commercial casinos; several more states are considering legalization. We analyze the factors that determine a state's decision to legalize commercial casinos, using data from 1985 to 2000, a period which covers the majority of states that have adopted commercial casinos. We use a tobit model to examine states' fiscal conditions, political alignments, intrastate and interstate competitive environments, and demographic characteristics, which yields information on the probability and timing of adoptions. The results suggest a public choice explanation that casino legalization is due to state fiscal stress, to efforts to keep gambling revenues (and the concomitant gambling taxes) within the state, and to attract tourism or export taxes..","[Calcagno, Peter T.; Walker, Douglas M.] Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Jackson, John D.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",College of Charleston; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Calcagno, PT (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",calcagnop@cofc.edu,,"Calcagno, Peter/0000-0002-8440-0188; Walker, Douglas/0000-0003-2298-3485",,,,,33,39,44,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2010,142.0,1-2,,,,,69,90,,10.1007/s11127-009-9475-2,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,523BS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272046800006,0

For years, this complex activity has been operated by agricultural higher education institutions, research institutes, state-owned farms and professional supervisor organisms. Changes in recent years in agriculture caused the transformation or abolishment of information and communication systems in Hungary. At the same time, small-scale enterprises formed (family farms, small-scale producers, native producers), whose need for information highly increased. Adequate communication systems have not been established and the conditions required for their operation do not exist, even though daily farm management requires a considerable amount of information. This raises the question of how to make the professional communication system more efficient and effective in transition. We aimed to identify, considering practical experiences, the most important tasks that interviewees had to perform day-to-day, the information producers' needs and their most effective forms of communication. This article represents the results of a survey of agricultural extension agents in three counties in eastern Hungary. Results emphasized the increased role of daily connection and technical support. Farmers have a high demand for information concerning administration and applications. The most effective manner of transferring information is during organized consultancy hours and local consultancy possibilities. Implications of the findings may contribute to the better reconstruction of the current extension system.","[Dajnoki, Krisztina; Baba, Eva Bacsne] Univ Debrecen, Ctr Agr & Appl Econ Sci, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Inst Management & Org, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Petoe, Karoly] Inst Rural Dev & Funct Econ, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Dajnoki, K (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Ctr Agr & Appl Econ Sci, Fac Appl Econ & Rural Dev, Inst Management & Org, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",dajnoki@agr.unideb.hu,"Bácsné Bába, Éva/AAV-1413-2021; Dajnoki, Krisztina/HPE-4862-2023","Bácsné Bába, Éva/0000-0002-0733-6637;",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,43,48,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600006,0

Focusing on the second transition, this paper reaches three conclusions. First, by several metrics, East European and East Asian growth performances have been about on par since the mid-1990s; both regions have far surpassed Latin American growth. Second, the mechanisms of growth in East Europe and East Asia have been very different. East Europe has relied on a distinctive - often discredited - model, embracing financial integration, with structural change to compensate for appreciating real exchange rates. In contrast, East Asia has contained further financial integration and maintained steady or depreciating real exchange rates. Third, the ongoing financial turbulence has dulled the sheen on East European performance but, thus far, has not obviously differentiated emerging market regions: rather, the hot spots in each region reflect individual country vulnerabilities. The paper, in closing, speculates on whether the East European growth model is sustainable and replicable.","[Fabrizio, Stefania] IMF, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Leigh, Daniel] IMF, Dept Res, Washington, DC USA; [Mody, Ashoka] IMF, European Dept, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,,SFABRIZIO@imf.org,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,191,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_11,0.0,,,3,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000011,0

Imcopa was Brazil's first soybean crusher to implement a non-GM soybean traceability and certification system, in 1998. It is now held to be the world's largest non-GM lecithin exporter. The analysis adopted here is based on a microeconomic perspective of productive opportunities identified by the firm, which goes beyond a simple balance-sheet approach. Four fundamental elements were used to guide the analysis: benefit-cost ratio; information asymmetry; bounded rationality; and company's growth. The possibility of selling non-GM soy and soybean products on the international market has provided Imcopa with access to an even broader commercial network of feed and food products. This has given the company a better outlook on why it should diversify its activities and intensify its pace of growth.","[Pelaez, Victor; Aquino, Dayani; Hofmann, Ruth] Univ Fed Parana, Jardim Bot, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Melo, Marcelo] Inst Tecnol Parana Tecpar, BR-81350010 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana,"Hofmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, Jardim Bot, Av Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",victor@ufpr.br; dayani.aquino@gmail.com; ruthofmann@gmail.com; marcelofmelo@gmail.com,"Pelaez, Victor/JVP-3333-2024",,,,,,26,6,6,0,10,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Therefore, a considerable part of the budget of the European Union is allocated to the development in this area. Within the frame of the policy of economic and social coherence, the individual states of the union receive financial resources for the development of their own business environments, which is important for the overall competitiveness of the European Union. Are the allocated funds utilised efficiently? That depends on the capabilities of the applicable state administrations and entrepreneurs, and on their mutual cooperation. The SME sector features many specifics, which are to a large degree subsequently modified by theoretical definitions concerning the possibilities of financing. An important factor is the actual sensitivity to the changes in external environment. In the times of growing turbulences and accelerated pace of changes, this aspect appears to be the key element. Together with a very few options of the state administrations in actively influencing the business environments and with a growing aversion towards the risks in the financial sector, the financial subsidies of the entrepreneurial development via the European Union funds seem to be an important helping hand in bringing the stability into the business environment, with emphasis on the key elements being identified as competitive improvements. On the other hand, funding via the European Union funds is neither the sole nor the keynote option for SME financing. The small and medium businesses locate the most vital parts of financial support from their own resources. Moreover, a major role has still been played by financial products like investment loans, operating capital loans, leasing, factoring, forfeiting, etc. In addition to these traditional financial resources, a wide variety of risky types of capital has been around, mostly in the form of Business Angel or Venture Capital. Locating the suitable funds for financing the small and medium businesses represents a quintessential problem, and such is being solved continuously by the top managements of the individual entities. Effective management of these flows is a fundamental cause for ensuring the successful operation and growth of an enterprise.","[Richter, P.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,prichter@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2141-0,,,,2010,,,,,,,51,58,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG8RL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000392678700005,0

Economic describe recession as reduction of country's GDP (Gross Domestic Production) for two consecutive quarters i.e. an increase in unemployment (1.5% in a period of 12 months). How long will this recession last, is the question every one asks. The IMF (International Monitoring Fund) Chief Economist says that the worst is yet to come. India is one of the country relatively less effected by global economic crisis, but millions of families affected. However the agri sector is very less affected. Today, various countries central banks are adopting preventive measures to stop the recession and rebuild the economy. The National Bureau of economic research in USA defines a recession more broadly as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP growth, real personal, income employment, industrial production and whole sale retail sales. Some economists suggest that a recession occurs when the natural growth rate in GDP is less than the average of 2%. A recession may be defined as a contraction phase of the business cycle or a period of reduced economic activity.","[Sarwade, W.

With Soeharto's demise, activists began to publicise their concerns more openly - at first speaking in general terms, but later making increasingly specific allegations. The sporadic activism of the Soeharto years was consolidated, first through cooperative action among similarly motivated informal groups, and later through establishment of formal civil society organisations (CSOs) intent on rolling back corruption. The CSOs have played a key role in pushing for new laws and institutions to help eradicate corruption, and many corrupt officials have been imprisoned. This paper finds little evidence, however, that corruption has declined significantly. It argues that further progress depends on CSOs gaining a better understanding of the underlying causes of corruption, and that these are to be found in public sector personnel management practices.","[Setiyono, Budi] Diponegoro Univ, Semarang, Indonesia; [McLeod, Ross H.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Diponegoro University; Australian National University,"Setiyono, B (通讯作者)，Diponegoro Univ, Semarang, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,19,21,24,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

This is done by optimizing feedstock demand subject to transportation distances of the different crops. For this a von Thuenen type model is applied to the feedstock demand of biogas plants. In addition to yields in terms of quantity and energy concerning the different crops and the costs of having them available, the profitability of the fermentation plant must be considered. It is shown that silage maize is the most profitable crop for medium distances, but gives way to winter wheat as distances increase. Our analysis suggests that even bigger plants than today can be sustained exclusively with silage maize.","[Holm-Mueller, Karin] Univ Bonn, ILR, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Holm-Müller, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, ILR, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",umwelt@uni-bonn.de,"Holm-Mueller, Karin/H-1807-2012",,,,,,17,10,10,0,4,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In particular, core financial institutions have invested their funds in asset-backed securities rather than committed to long-term projects: in distress, these can potentially be sold to a large pool of outside investors at steep discounts. I consider two different motives for outside investors and their interaction with banks trading asset-backed securities: uncertainty aversion versus adverse selection. I shall argue that the version with uncertainty averse investors is more consistent with the stylized facts than the adverse selection perspective: in the former, the crisis deepens, the larger the market share of distressed core banks, while a run becomes less likely instead as a result in the adverse selection version. Therefore, the outright purchase of troubled assets by the government at prices above current market prices may both alleviate the financial crises as well as provide tax payers with returns above those for safe securities.

Mainly with the increased levels of carbon tax, the change of tax burden in eastern of China is not conspicuous, while the more underdeveloped regions such as the western of China the greater changing amplitude of tax burden, and then will lead to further imbalance in regional economic development. To this end, a reasonable choice of carbon tax level is necessary to promote coordinated development of regional economies in China.","[Wu, Yang] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,,wuyang929@163.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-07-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,343,347,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BUS85,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290245000077,0

When external capital becomes more costly at the aggregate level, investment declines in focused firms but remains unchanged in diversified firms. This investment advantage enjoyed by diversified firms could attribute to both their easy access to external capital and their ability to substitute internal capital markets for costly external markets. Consistent with the internal capital market argument, our findings show that the investment advantage exists for diversified firms even after we control for their easy access to external markets. We also find that the role of internal markets in financing investment is more important for diversified firms that are more financially constrained in external markets. Finally, we find that the segment-level investment becomes more efficient in conglomerates' internal capital markets under depressed external capital market conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that internal capital allocation functions as a valuable and efficient substitute for diversified firms in a tightened external capital market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using a dataset that includes the component makeup of individual REIT distributions, we provide evidence that abnormal returns and trading volume around ex-dividend days are driven by the component of the distributions that is most tax-penalized.

However, applied projects show higher degrees of partner interdependence and therefore enable exploratory learning by academics, leading to new ideas and projects. This result holds especially for research-oriented academics working in the sciences of the artificial and engaging in multiple relationships with industry. Our learning-centred interpretation qualifies the notion of entrepreneurial science as a driver of applied university-industry collaboration.

Due to the public bad nature of the catastrophic risk, the second effect is ignored in a competitive allocation and unregulated economic growth will give rise to excessive emissions.

J,"Frank, N; Ley, E",,,,"Frank, Nathaniel; Ley, Eduardo",,,On the Probabilistic Approach to Fiscal Sustainability: Structural Breaks and Non-Normality,IMF STAFF PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TURKEY,"This paper modifies several assumptions in the probabilistic approach to fiscal sustainability proposed by Celasun, Debrun, and Ostry (2007). First, we allow for structural breaks in the vector autoregression model for the macroeconomic variables. Second, in the Monte-Carlo simulations, we draw directly from the empirical distribution of the shocks instead of drawing from a normal distribution, thus allowing for asymmetries and thick tails.

We provide robust evidence of a contagion discount by simultaneously estimating the local price trend and the incremental price impact of nearby foreclosures. At its peak, the discount is roughly 1% per nearby foreclosed property. The discount diminishes rapidly as the distance to the distressed property increases. The contagion discount grows from the onset of distress through the foreclosure sale and then stabilizes. This pattern is consistent with the contagion effect being the visual externality associated with deferred maintenance and neglect. (C)2009 Elsevier Inc.

Since there are only two employers, equally productive women and men have to commute and face travel cost to do so. We assume that some women have higher travel cost, e.g., due to more domestic responsibilities. Employers exploit that women on average are less inclined to commute and offer lower wages to all women. Since women's firm-level labour supply is for this reason less wage-elastic, this model is in line with Robinson's explanation of wage discrimination.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-8520 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Hirsch, B (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-8520 Erlangen, Germany.",,,,,,,,28,7,10,1,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Cheap talk and certainty scales have received considerable attention in the literature, but dissonance minimization has not previously been experimentally tested. Using a four-way split sample design involving over 600 subjects, results from an actual referendum on provision of a quasi-public good were compared with three similar but contingent referenda employing the three bias-reducing techniques. Hypothetical bias was again present.

The relationship between Wal-Mart penetration and activities that do not involve inputs that can be bought at Wal-Mart is negative in most cases but may be positive or zero for cultural activities such as attending classical music concerts and visiting art galleries.

Most of the predictable nonconvertible bonds are issued by companies in financial distress, while the predictable convertible bonds are those with conversion options more deeply in-the-money.

Empirical evidence shows that uncertainty over labour income is particularly significant in developing, while not negligible in developed countries. Under uncertainty, and assuming incomplete capital markets, the tax system plays a role in providing social insurance, and a green tax reform influences its effectiveness. We show that the increase in environmental tax reduces consumption risk, while the balanced budget decrease in labour income tax increases income risk. We find that the total welfare effect of a green tax reform differs substantially from the case of certainty The critical parameters determining the existence of a second dividend are the lump-sum transfers, the relative substitutability of the two goods for leisure, and the initial tax rates relative to their optimal that determine also the response of labour supply to a change in the tax mix.","[Sartzetakis, Eftichios S.] Univ Macedonia, Dept Accounting & Finance, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Tsigaris, Panagiotis D.] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada",University of Macedonia,"Sartzetakis, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Accounting & Finance, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",esartz@uom.gr,"Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sofokles/J-1938-2016; Sartzetakis, Eftichios/A-5068-2012","Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sofokles/0000-0001-7997-7575; Tsigaris, Panagiotis/0000-0002-7965-4554",,,,,52,2,3,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This article investigates the optimal risk management strategy of an insurance company subject to regulatory constraints. We provide optimal reinsurance contracts under different tail risk measures and analyze the impact of regulators' requirements on risk sharing in the reinsurance market.

From January 2008, Kadaster, the Dutch land registry office, and Statistics Netherlands began jointly publishing house price index numbers for the whole country and for some specific dwelling types and regions. A number of special institutional features of the situation in the Netherlands contributed to the choice of index construction method. The indexes are computed using the Sale Price Appraisal Ratio (SPAR) method, which utilizes the ratios of transaction prices and previous appraisal values. We describe the SPAR method, compare it with repeat sales methods and assess the reliability of the official Dutch appraisal values. Empirical results for January 1995-March 2009 are presented. The SPAR method performs well compared to repeat sales, and the results reported will be of interest to other countries that have, or could instigate, institutional arrangements similar to those in the Netherlands.

The costs of owner occupied as well as rental housing have important roles to play in both the consumer price index (011) and the System of National Accounts (SNA). The 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA93) specifies that a rental Value of the housing stock Should be included as part of the aggregates for personal consumption, personal income, income of proprietors and Value added for the real estate industry, Yet. little attention has been devoted to all underlying commonality of practice: the implicit assumption that housing cost information for either renters or owner Occupiers call be used for assessing movements over time and spatial differences in the cost of housing for both renters and owners, after allowing for differences regarding payment for taxes and certain ongoing expenses such as insurance and utilities. But in the real world, are the services that renters and owner occupiers get from their dwellings comparable?

In this paper, I offer some speculations about the lessons for tax policy, and the analysis of tax policy, from the Great Recession. What did we get wrong? What did we underestimate the importance of? What do we need to think more about? One conclusion is that public finance economists need to better integrate the economic analysis of taxation with the concerns and expertise of macroeconomists, finance economists, and accountants. This is especially important for obtaining a better understanding of financial institutions, whose behavior is affected by the tax, accounting, and regulatory rules they face, rules that are inter-related but not coordinated.","Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Slemrod, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Slemrod, Joel/AAJ-5709-2020",,,,,,19,19,21,0,9,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

This paper investigates this topic by simulating the effects of reductions in firing costs and unemployment benefits on inflation volatility in the Euro Area, using an estimated New Keynesian model with search and matching frictions. Qualitatively, changes in labor market policies alter the volatility of inflation in response to shocks, by affecting the volatility of the three components of real marginal costs (hiring costs, firing costs and wage costs). Quantitatively, we find, however, that neither policy is likely to have an important effect on inflation volatility, due to the small contribution of hiring and firing costs to inflation dynamics.

Our index relies exclusively on measures of the market's assessment of adverse selection risk rather than on ex ante firm characteristics. We find that information asymmetry does affect the capital structure decisions of U.S. firms over the sample period 1973-2002. Our findings are robust to controlling for conventional leverage factors (size, tangibility, Q ratio, profitability), the sources of firms' financing needs, and such firm attributes as stock return volatility, stock turnover, and intensity of insider trading. For example, we estimate that on average, for every dollar of financing deficit to cover, firms in the highest adverse selection decile issue 30 cents of debt more than firms in the lowest decile. Overall, this evidence explains why the pecking order theory is only partially successful in explaining all of firms' capital structure decisions. It also suggests that the theory finds support when its basic assumptions hold in the data, as should reasonably be expected of any theory.","[Bharath, Sreedhar T.; Pasquariello, Paolo] Univ Michigan, Dept Finance, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wu, Guojun] Univ Houston, Dept Finance, CT Bauer Sch Business, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Bharath, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Finance, Ross Sch Business, Suite E7606, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sbharath@umich.edu; ppasquar@bus.umich.edu; gwu2@uh.edu,"Pasquariello, Paolo/A-1143-2007; Wu, Guuojun/AHB-4249-2022","Wu, Guuojun/0000-0002-7910-2813",,,,,70,311,428,8,132,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Using 10 waves of the British Household Panel Survey, it utilizes a panel-based GMM methodology to estimate a dynamic model of life satisfaction. The use of the GMM-system estimator corrects for correlated effects of partner's life satisfaction and solves the problem of measurement error bias. The results show that, for both genders, there is a positive and statistically significant spillover effect of life satisfaction that runs from one partner to the other partner in a couple. The positive bias on the estimated spillover effect coming from assortative mating and shared social environment at cross-section is almost offset by the negative bias coming from systematic measurement errors in the way people report their life satisfaction. Moreover, consistent with the spillover effect model, couple dissolution at t + 1 is negatively correlated with partners' life satisfaction at t. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents an econometric model for estimating mark-ups that controls for unobserved prices. The model shows that ignoring price heterogeneity results in mark-up estimates that converge to one, whatever the value of the true price-cost ratio. Estimates obtained using real data are consistent with this result, as they reveal that ignoring price heterogeneity leads to spurious evidence of firms with little or no market power.","[DeSouza, Sergio A.] Univ Fed Ceara, CAEN, Grad Sch Econ, BR-60020181 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [DeSouza, Sergio A.] Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Econ Theory, BR-60020181 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Ceara; Universidade Federal do Ceara,"DeSouza, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Ceara, CAEN, Grad Sch Econ, Av Univ,2700 Segundo Andar, BR-60020181 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",sergiodesouza@ufc.br,,,,,,,10,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

We analyze decisions based on such a premise and demonstrate the theory's incompatibility with popular models of choice under uncertainty. In particular, we show how support theory's subjective probabilities are at odds with multi-prior beliefs in addition to additive and nonadditive probabilities. We propose a behavioral relaxation of a well-known consistency argument-the book-making principle, in order to accommodate such description-dependent subjective probabilities. As a consequence, we provide a characterization of a set of decisions where the underlying probability judgments follow from support theory.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the interaction between differential bargaining power and the efficiency of insurance contracts. The analysis is undertaken in a framework of state-contingent production, which allows us to consider, as separate choices, the level of effort committed by the client and the riskiness of the equilibrium state-contingent production vector. Our central result is that, in the presence of hold-up problems, the exercise of monopoly power by insurers leads clients to undertake socially costly self-protection, leading to suboptimal levels of insurance. Clients can exploit information asymmetries to offset the bargaining power of the insurer, but this process is also socially costly. Hence, competitive markets for insurance will yield a Pareto-superior outcome to the constrained Pareto-optimum reached in markets where insurers have monopoly power. More generally, in a bargaining situation, an increase in the bargaining power of clients will increase social welfare.

Small firms could nurture entrepreneurship and facilitate the creation and application of new ideas. In spite of their potential in generating innovations, it is also observed that SMEs shy away from formal R&D activities, and the firm size itself seems to be a barrier for R&D activities. SMEs operating in developing countries face extra hurdles to investing in R&D. Given the massive share of SMEs, it becomes crucial to realize their developmental potential in developing countries. In this paper, we study the drivers of R&D activities in SMEs in Turkish manufacturing industries by using panel data at the establishment level for the 1993-2001 period. Our findings suggest that SMEs are less likely to conduct R&D, but if they overcome the first obstacle of conducting R&D, they spend proportionally more on R&D than the LSEs do. R&D intensity is higher in small than in large firms. Moreover, public R&D encourages firms to intensify their R&D efforts. The impact of R&D support is stronger for small firms.","[Taymaz, Erol] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Ucdogruk, Yesim] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econ, TR-35210 Izmir, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Dokuz Eylul University,"Taymaz, E (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",etaymaz@metu.edu.tr,"Gürel, Yeşim/T-1247-2019; Taymaz, Erol/B-1269-2008","Taymaz, Erol/0000-0001-7525-6674",,,,,22,17,21,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

On the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, we find such evidence in natural rubber (NR), palladium (PA) and gasoline (GA) futures markets. The automobile industry is responsible for more than 50% of global demand for each of these commodities. VAR estimation reveals short-run cross-market interaction between NR and GA, and from NR to PA. Cross-market influence exerted by PA is felt in longer dynamics, with PA volatility (volume) affecting NR (GA) volume (volatility). Our findings are robust to lag-specification, volatility measure, and consistent with full BEKK-GARCH estimation results. Further analysis, which benchmarks against silver futures market, TOCOM index and TOPIX transportation index, confirms that our results are driven by a common industry exposure, and not a commodity market factor. A simple trading rule that incorporates short-run GA and long-run PA dynamics to predict NR return yields positive economic profit. Our study offers new insights into how commodity and equity markets relate at an industry level, and implications for multi-commodity hedging. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is more surprising, as each season association and league officials continue to spend millions on enhancing this uncertainty. We also control for season ticket holders, who are unlikely to be influenced by match specificities.

As in other markets dominated by brokers, agents' incentives are often poorly aligned with those with whom they do business, in this case both the lenders who bear the risks once the loan is originated and the consumer who assumes liability for the debt and contract terms. This paper describes the institutional arrangements under which mortgage brokers operate and empirically test whether loans originated by mortgage brokers are lower in cost than those that would be available directly from retail lenders. The results suggest that loans originated by brokers cost borrowers about 20 basis points more, on average, than retail loans and that this premium is higher for lower income and lower credit score borrowers.","Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"LaCour-Little, M (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA.",mlacour-little@fullerton.edu,"Haddaji, Salma El/ABH-6973-2020",,,,,,30,16,24,0,7,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

The introduction of bank loan ratings leads to an increase in the use of debt by firms that obtain a rating, and also increases in firms' asset growth, cash acquisitions, and investment in working capital. Consistent with a causal effect of the ratings, the increase in debt usage and investment is concentrated in the set of borrowers who are of lower credit quality and do not have an issuer credit rating before 1995. A loan-level analysis demonstrates that previously unrated borrowers who obtain a loan rating gain increased access to the capital of less-informed investors.

We derive analytical results for the approximate bias and variance of the sample Sharpe ratio in terms of the underlying distribution parameters. The results clarify several misinterpretations existing in the literature.

This paper demonstrates that, even when wages are allocative, downward wage rigidity can be consistent with weak macroeconomic effects. Firms have an incentive to compress wage increases as well as wage cuts when downward wage rigidity binds. By neglecting compression of wage increases, previous literature may have overstated the costs of downward wage rigidity to firms. Using micro-data from the US and Great Britain, I find that the evidence for the compression of wage increases when downward wage rigidity binds. Accounting for this reduces the estimated increase in aggregate wage growth due to wage rigidity to be much closer to zero. These results suggest that downward wage rigidity may not provide a strong argument against the targeting of low inflation rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Elsby, Michael W.

This paper focuses on Italy's troubled politics over the past 35 years and asks whether the adoption of the euro in 1999 has helped insulate Italy's financial markets from the adverse consequences of its traditionally unstable political system. We find that important political events have exerted a statistically and economically significant effect on Italy's financial markets throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The introduction of the euro appears to have indeed played a major role in insulating financial markets from such adverse shocks. The findings of the paper therefore suggest another important economic dimension and channel through which Italy may have been affected by EMU. Our analysis could also be potentially interesting for other countries with weak institutions considering adopting a currency based on stronger institutions.","[Fratzscher, Marcel; Stracca, Livio] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Fratzscher, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",marcel.fratzscher@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,40,2,3,1,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

Financial economic theory suggests that the consumption-to-wealth ratio reflects consumption smoothing and reveals expectations about future wealth. For individuals contemplating submitting an LTD claim, the expected payoff to exercising this insurance option is a function of their expectations about their future wealth. The lower (higher) their expectations about future wealth, the higher (lower) the expected payoff, and the higher (lower) claims rates are likely to be. Using cointegration analysis, we find that LTD claims rates and the consumption-to-wealth ratio are linked in a long-run equilibrium.

The results confirm the crucial role of exports and investment in the Asian growth dynamics. In a second stage, the structural shocks are identified by short- and long-run restrictions. These shocks, as well as the corresponding dynamic responses, are then correlated across all sample countries to provide insight into the depth of regional coherence.

We exploit this unusual electoral feature by looking at the effect that candidates' beauty and skin color has on voting patterns. Our results for beauty are mixed, but we find strong evidence that skin color matters.

The relationship between skin color and electoral performance is stronger for challengers than incumbents.

It also finds that the level of poverty in a labor-sending country does not have a positive impact on the level of remittances received. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that sector upgrades result in a positive and significant sector share price response, while sector downgrades result in a negative and significant sector share price response. The favorable valuation effects associated with sector upgrades are more favorable when there is a high level of trading activity of the stocks in the sector, the sector share price runup is relatively weak, and the prevailing price-to-fundamental ratios in the sector are relatively low. In addition, the negative valuation effects associated with sector downgrades are more favorable when there is a high level of trading activity of the stocks in the sector and the share price runup is relatively strong.

Recently this, has changed. Supply effects of equity and credit markets can arise from a combination of three ingredients: investor tastes limited, intermediation, and corporate opportunism. Investor tastes when combined with imperfectly competitive intermediaries lead prices and interest rates to deviate from fundamental values. Opportunistic firms respond by issuing securities with high prices and investing the proceeds. A link between capital market prices and corporate finance can in principle come from either supply or demand. This framework helps to organize empirical approaches that more precisely identify and quantify supply effects through variation in one of these three ingredients. Taken as a whole, the evidence shows that shifting equity and credit market conditions play an important role in dictating corporate finance and investment.","[Baker, Malcolm] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Baker, Malcolm] NBER, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Baker, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",mbaker@hbs.edu,,,,,,,146,47,59,3,50,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1367,,,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

It is obvious that exchange rate policy is not a passive factor, at least in the medium term. Our analysis indicates that the fixed foreign exchange rate arrangements policy does not necessarily mean stability of the foreign exchange rates. Neither percentage exchange rate changes of fixed rates, nor their volatility measured by the standard deviation are lower than the average change is over the examined period. Our analysis indicates also that the inflation rate is growing in accordance with the growth of depreciation of the foreign exchange rate and the growth of its volatility measured by the standard deviation.

Based on joint estimation of the performance equations and a dynamic export probit decision, the empirical results lend strong support to the self-selection hypothesis. Exporting appears to help quality upgrading that encourages more efficient use of resources.","Univ Econ & Management Nabeul, Mrezga 8000, Nabeul, Tunisia",,"Hassine-Belghith, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management Nabeul, Route Hammamet, Mrezga 8000, Nabeul, Tunisia.",nadia@hbhgts.com,,,,,,,51,1,1,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

J,"Hull, TH; Hartanto, W",,,,"Hull, Terence H.; Hartanto, Wendy",,,Resolving contradictions in Indonesian fertility estimates,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,Over the last half-century Indonesia has been concerned about excessive population growth. To reduce the levels of fertility the government in 1968 established a national family planning program. In the following three decades fertility levels fell from over five to under three children per woman. In the past decade questions have arisen about the validity and reliability of fertility estimates. Increasingly Indonesia's Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have reported higher fertility than is recorded in the censuses and other large social sample surveys. In 2007 the discrepancy reached more than half a child on average. This paper reveals one of the major causes of the discrepancy and shows ways to adjust the DHS results to gain more reliable measures. At present Indonesian national fertility is very close to the policy target of replacement levels by the year 2010.,"[Hull, Terence H.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hartanto, Wendy] BPS Stat Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia",Australian National University; Statistics Indonesia,"Hull, TH (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Hull, Terence H/A-5952-2008",,,,,,8,19,20,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The most significant parameter was the influence of the real exchange rate of zloty on the import. Strengthening of zloty in the period of 2004-2007 was accompanied by a significant increase in import. The applied power function allows concluding that the quarterly volumes of import were explained by the average quarterly exchange rates of zloty in 56%; whereas zloty's appreciation had small influence on the level of export. Other factors stimulating the Polish market, like increasing demand for the Polish food in the EU, cancelling of administrative barriers or rise of efficiency in Polish firms were the most important factors in this field.","Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Jedruehniewicz, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Warsaw, Poland.",,,"Jedruchniewicz, Andrzej/0000-0002-3133-6880",,,,,8,0,0,1,1,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-1-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,18,,,,,105,110,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288345600014,0

The aim of the paper is to identify model types of household which are potentially at risk of being unable to afford adequate housing in case of no regulation. We examine the development of regional differences in housing unaffordability in the period 2000-2007. The share of households at risk of being unable to afford housing is analysed. Due to the lack of relevant data on household incomes and housing expenditures, a new method of housing affordability indicators calculation was developed. This method enables to describe the trend of regional inequalities in housing affordability of model types of household using the official regional wage statistics (gross wages) as well as market rent statistics. For measuring housing affordability is used residual income. Residual income indicates the sum of resources a household is left with after they have paid their rent and minimum living costs. On the one hand, the findings show that the share of households at risk of housing unaffordability decreased and the regional differences are not growing. On the other hand, there is a relatively numerous group of households in each region which can not afford to pay market rent even if they receive social benefits in accordance with the current legislation. The paper shows a potential barrier of migration between regions and potential risk of social exclusion. For example, the families of people working in lower paid occupation categories could find it difficult to live in the more advanced, more expensive regions, even though there is a big demand for labour to fill these occupations.","[Mikeszova, Martina] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Sociol Ustav, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,martina.mikeszova@soc.cas.cz,"Mikeszová, Martina/E-7369-2014","Mikeszová, Martina/0000-0002-0996-5867",,,,,27,0,0,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,219,233,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000025,0

Why it is important to focus on asset allocation and related portfolio management techniques and intelligence? Because asset allocation is the primary driver of investment results. If we analyse the last more than 50 years of portfolio theory and the real world situations we are offered a surprising amount of insight into what works and what doesn't when it comes to investing. Anyway, there are not secret formulas in asset allocation and investment, but there is a framework to consider, which is inspired by the modern portfolio theory, that was introduced by Harry Markowitz with his paper Portfolio Selection, which appeared in the 1952 Journal of Finance. The issue of how investors can use diversification to optimize their portfolios is a central concern of portfolio theory. Diversification is about investors, which focus on selecting portfolios based on their overall risk-reward characteristics instead of merely compiling portfolios from securities that each individually have attractive risk-reward characteristics. Briefly, inventors should select portfolios, not individual securities.","[Oprean, Camelia; Bratian, Vasile] Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,camelia.oprean@ulbsibiu.ro; vasile.bratian@ulbsibiu.ro,"Oprean-Stan, Camelia/AAL-5673-2020",,,,,,4,0,0,1,7,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,476,480,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000073,0

As practice shows, implementation of an enterprise resource planning system frequently does not justify the expectations of an enterprise, costs much more than expected, and its implementation lasts for a considerably longer period of time than planned. Variety of results of implementation makes it necessary to analyse the process of implementation of ERP and to look in it what should be done for successful implementation. The aim of this article is to investigate the process of implementation of ERP systems and to establish the factors of success. Implementation of enterprise resource planning systems is a highly complex process which is influenced not only by technical, but also by other factors. The sources describe approximately thirty factors determining the peculiarities of the process of implementation of ERP and its result. The analysis and generalisation all of these factors makes it possible to identify the most important factors determining the success of implementation of ERP.

The implications for consumption and welfare depend crucially on the answer to this question. We use Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) repeated cross-section data on consumption and income to decompose idiosyncratic changes in income into predictable life-cycle changes, transitory and permanent shocks and estimate the contribution of each to total inequality. Our model fits the joint evolution of consumption and income inequality well and delivers two main results. First, we find that permanent changes in income explain all of the increase in inequality in the 1980s and 1990s. Second, we reconcile this finding with the fact that consumption inequality did not increase much over this period. Our results support the view that many permanent changes in income are predictable for consumers, even if they look unpredictable to the econometrician, consistent with models of heterogeneous income profiles.

Turning the vision into the strategy under the consideration of the external environment conditions is an approach to increase the company's performance and competitive edge. The next step is the execution of the strategy by meeting concrete objectives embodied into the company's strategic plan. One of the possible tools to create the company's strategic map is the SWOT analysis. In order to maximize the value of the company the strategic objectives and measures are defined by means of the Balanced Scorecard. Cascading of the objectives and measures supports the alignment within the organisation. Strategy execution, i.e. meeting the company's strategic objectives and goals in practice, is the key success factor in achieving the maximum value of the company. The importance of execution of strategic objectives remains the leading concern world-wide, as it represents the interests of all parties involved, i.e. stock-holders, customers and employees. The paper presents practical results of the strategy execution and draws Hartmann - Rico, a. s. as an example.

Over the last 20 years, the institutional turn in ports drove the overseas expansion of pure stevedoring companies. For quite a long time carriers and stevedores fiercely battled each other both for bargaining contractual arrangements and for securing new concessions in the key port areas. Currently this scenario is slowly changing and some early-forms of partnership are coming out. This paper analyses the different pathways through which carriers satisfy their needs of handling services. Based on 2006 data it empirically demonstrates the growing resort to such forms of cooperation both contractually and via equity ventures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The rapid shift from centralised-authoritarian to decentralised-democratic rule in Indonesia has been accompanied by a large variation in sub-national government policies across districts. Based on eight district case studies comprising 1,000 business surveys and 120 in-depth interviews, this paper argues that demand-side pressures from local firms, associations and district councils are less significant than supply-side pressures from local government leaders in explaining variations in taxation, licensing and corruption practices. In Indonesia's early transition to democratic decentralisation, societal pressures have been constrained by collective action problems and perverse political incentives. Local government leaders, on the other hand, have strong powers and new incentives for policy reform. In response to the good governance debate, this study's findings suggest that government leadership is an important, often under-estimated, policy determinant that can compensate for (or aggravate) weak societal checks in transitioning economies.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"von Luebke, C (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,"von Lubke, Christian/0000-0002-8826-4064",,,,,52,41,49,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Group affiliation may in this respect provide a successful alternative to large-scale privatisation.,"[Yu, Huanjun] Univ Groningen, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Lensink, Robert] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Lensink, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Nottingham; Wageningen University & Research,"Lensink, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",B.W.Lensink@rug.nl,"Lensink, Robert/ABA-3076-2020","Lensink, Robert/0000-0001-6448-5164; van Ees, Hans/0000-0002-5868-4682",,,,,38,12,13,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, there is scarce evidence on the effectiveness of these programs. This paper is addressing two topics which could have important managerial and public policy implications: (i) it estimates the impact of rewards on the use of cards and (ii) it quantifies their economic effects in terms of the cash substitution. We find that rewards may significantly modify choice for card payments. Their economic impact also varies significantly across types of rewards and merchant activities. Additionally, rewards seem to be more effective for debit cards. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is clear evidence that stock prices drift in the direction of earnings surprise for several months following an earnings announcement. Specifically, we find that standardized unexpected earnings based on analyst forecasts (SUEAF), our main definition of earnings surprise, indicates that a hedge strategy of going long on firms in the highest SUEAF decile and going short on firms in the lowest SUEAF decile generates a greater than 6% excess return in the 60 days following the earnings announcement. We also show that that while both the SUEAF and standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) capture earnings surprise, each contains information that is not entirely subsumed by the other. In summary, we advance that the post-earnings announcement drift is caused by the market's delay in responding to earnings information. Our findings have major investment implications, since investors in general and Canadian investors in particular can exploit this anomaly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

This paper attempts to monitor the best and worst of aid practices among bilateral, multilateral, and UN agencies. We create aid practice measures based on aid transparency, specialization, selectivity, ineffective aid channels, and overhead costs. We rate donor agencies from best to worst on aid practices. We find that the UK does well among bilateral agencies, the US is below average, and Scandinavian donors do surprisingly poorly. The biggest difference is between the UN agencies, who mostly rank in the bottom half of donors, and everyone else. Average performance of all agencies on transparency, fragmentation, and selectivity is still very poor. The paper also assesses trends in best practices over time-we find modest improvement in transparency and more in moving away from ineffective channels. However, we find no evidence of improvements (and partial evidence of worsening) in specialization, fragmentation, and selectivity, despite escalating rhetoric to the contrary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We find interesting differences when looking at both interest rates (the Taylor rule) and monetary base (the McCallum rule) as monetary policy rules. Monetary aggregate is more likely to react to the deviation of inflation from its target, while short-term interest rates are highly sensitive to the deviation of exchange rates in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. For Hungary and Romania, both interest rates and money are responsive to inflation. In empirical literature, much attention is paid to the use of the Taylor-type rule for developed economies. However, our empirical results raise questions on the reliance of this rule for these transition economies.","[Moore, Tomoe] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Ghatak, Subrata] Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Brunel University; Kingston University,"Moore, T (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",S.Ghatak@kingston.ac.uk; tomoe.moore@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,6,7,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The freight transport quality attributes considered in this survey were flexibility, frequency, loss and damage, reliability, and transit time. The monetary values of these attributes have been computed as willingness to pay for their improvement as well as willingness to accept compensation for a decrease in their quality.

However, a portfolio of several different lottery games is now usually offered to players and judging the effectiveness of agencies in generating revenue requires estimation of both cross-price and own-price elasticities. Here we employ data from Spain to derive elasticities. Results imply that games are under-priced if net revenue maximization is the goal. But the cross-price estimates suggest that the operator is successful in limiting the extent to which a large jackpot on one game cannibalizes same-week sales of other games. The paper also analyzes the impacts from two increases in the level of entry fees introduced during the data period. These appear to have affected net revenue favorably.

Based on recent fieldwork, the paper argues that the local agricultural economy is a hybrid economy, where production for market, quasi-market and subsistence merge into and co-constitute one another. In order to keep the system going, and to make up for the uncertainties in the formal context of production, the relation between new private fermer and the peasant (dehkan) households is of particular importance. This relation resembles neo-patrimonial patron-client relations, which are both personal and informal while also being based on formal, contractual relations. The relations are asymmetric and based on the limited and unevenly distributed resources. The division of power is unequal but not fixed, due to the ongoing transition of the economic system.","[Veldwisch, Gert Jan A.] Wageningen Univ, Irrigat & Water Engn Grp, Dept Environm Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bock, Bettina B.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Rural Sociol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Veldwisch, GJA (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Irrigat & Water Engn Grp, Dept Environm Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands.",gertjan.veldwisch@wur.nl; Bettina.bock@wur.nl,"Bock, Bettina/G-6846-2012; Veldwisch, Gert Jan/H-3473-2011","Veldwisch, Gert Jan/0000-0002-8123-281X; Bock, Bettina/0000-0001-8108-7766",,,,,44,17,17,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We use an instrumental variables approach that helps isolate the fiscal consequences of house price appreciation by taking advantage of the influence of local topological constraints on the elasticity of house prices with respect to interest rates. Our analysis generates three main findings. First, despite Prop 13 fiscal constraints, rapid house price appreciation has a strong effect on property tax revenue. Second, the resulting increase in property tax revenue was largely offset by a reduction in other local tax revenue. This offsetting response leaves total city expenditure unrelated to local house prices. In that sense the housing bubble did not produce local fiscal bubbles. Third, we find that fiscal adjustments to house price appreciation depend on local political institutions.","[Whalley, Alexander] Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95340 USA; [Vlaicu, Razvan] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Vlaicu, Razvan] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Whalley, Alexander] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Whalley, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Merced, CA 95340 USA.",vlaicu@econ.umd.edu; awhalley@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,21,12,18,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2011,149.0,1-2,,,SI,,89,108,,10.1007/s11127-011-9830-y,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,817QJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000294688600007,0

All but Muslim immigrants respond positively to the participation culture at destination; while for Muslim immigrants, origin culture is a relatively persistent determinant of participation. Civic participation is affected by conflicts at the time of migration, through immigrants' self-selection and migration irreversibility. However, civic participation is not related to current upheavals in origin countries.

Motivated by the large cross-sectional variation in the extent to which banned stocks suffer an illiquidity shock, we hypothesize that stocks with larger liquidity declines are associated with poorer contemporaneous stock returns. The evidence supports this hypothesis and suggests that this effect is stronger for more liquid stocks, as predicted by Amihud and Mendelson (1986). Moreover, consistent with Miller's (1977) model, we report a valuation reversal whereby stocks with higher abnormal returns at the onset of the ban have lower abnormal returns at its removal. Our findings are robust when we control for firms most affected by TARP, include non-banned matched firms, and compare banned firms' stock returns with their bond returns. From a policy standpoint, the ban reduced valuations, ceteris paribus, of the stocks that were hardest hit by illiquidity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we empirically quantify the effect of vehicle recalls on safety using repeated cross-sections on accidents of individual drivers and aggregate vehicle recall data to construct synthetic panel data on individual drivers of a particular vehicle model. We estimate the effect of recalls on the number of accidents and find that a 10 percent increase in the recall rate of a particular model reduces the accidents of that model by between 0.78 percent and 1.6 percent when using the full sample of accidents in our data. We also find that recalls classified as hazardous are more effective in reducing accidents, and the recall effect is especially strong when we restrict attention to accidents that lead to personal injuries and only include vehicles more likely to be at fault for the accident, but much less so for accidents that only lead to property damage. We also find that vehicle models with recalls with higher correction rates have on average fewer accidents in the years following a recall, which indicates the importance of the role of drivers' behavior regarding recalls on safety. Our findings suggest that policymakers should consider, for example, policies to allow insurance companies to take into account recall correction behavior when pricing auto insurance, which could be made possible through regulatory changes by the U.S. government, and should revisit the complex trade-offs between pre- and post-market regulation in this important industry.

The level of research interest may stem from the fact that in the US, only about half of all new small businesses survive after 4 years (Headd 2003). However, research attempting to understand the phenomenon that employs data using only information from and about surviving firms may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the factors that influence firm survival and failure. In this paper, we provide evidence that omitted information about the firms that disappear from the research data over time leads to biased coefficient estimates. Comparing the Heckman two-step estimation approach of switching regression models to a semi-parametric Cox hazard model, the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model, we conclude that the Cox ATF approach is the most appropriate model for firm survival analysis.","[Cader, Hanas A.] Amer Univ Kuwait, Safat, Kuwait; [Leatherman, John C.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",American University of Kuwait; Kansas State University,"Cader, HA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Kuwait, Safat, Kuwait.",mcader@auk.edu.kw,,,,,,,66,52,82,1,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The ratio of alpha to its tracking error appraises a fund's performance. This paper derives the performance-maximizing strategy, which turns out to be a variant of a buy-write strategy, and the least upper bound on such performance enhancement. If common equity indices are used as benchmarks, the potential alpha generated from trading frequently can be substantial in magnitude, but it carries considerable risk. The statistical significance in estimated alpha is low, and the probability of a negative alpha is high. The performance enhancement from holding options can be significant - both economically and statistically - if the options' implied volatilities are higher than the volatilities of the benchmark returns. The performance-maximizing strategy derived in this paper is different from the strategies that switch portfolio exposure to the benchmarks. The exposure-switching strategies are not promising unless the switching is based on superior information. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

More importantly, this force can be strong enough to compensate for the loss that arises from more intense market competition: the low-cost firms' profits may indeed increase with the number of high-cost firms. An implication of this result is far-reaching, as it gives low-cost firms an incentive to help, rather than harm, high-cost competitors.

Regarding the alternatives of moving to a consumption-based tax system, the commentary discusses the relative merits of choosing an ACE system (allowance for corporate equity) rather than a cash-flow tax at the company level. It reviews the arguments in favour of full elimination of tax on the normal return to savings at the personal level, which contrasts with alternative tax reform proposals recommending a positive but low and flat tax rate on personal capital income.

Though this trend slipped back thereafter, owing to the global economic crisis, oil prices seem to be gradually regaining upward movement. Through an analysis of counterfactual simulations based on a dynamic computable general equilibrium model, this paper shows that the negative impact on GDP of the most recent oil price boom has been substantial in six oil-importing developing countries, as high as 2% to 3% of GDP per year in some cases, producing unemployment and higher consumer prices and, as a consequence, reduced welfare. Importantly, welfare losses have been much less for countries that have witnessed gains from higher export-commodity prices. Even for these countries, however, policy action is called for to soften the impact of potential future oil price booms.","UN, Dept Econ & Social Affairs, New York, NY 10017 USA",,"Sánchez, MV (通讯作者)，UN, Dept Econ & Social Affairs, New York, NY 10017 USA.",,,"Sanchez, Marco V/0000-0001-7244-2164",,,,,26,16,17,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,,,DEV ECON,Dev.

The main markers of this success are a high fertility rate combined with an above-average female employment rate and a relatively low proportion of children in poverty. This situation is due, in part, to France's generous system of cash benefits, tax breaks and preschool childcare provision. But, childcare capacity in France is not sufficient to absorb increased demand resulting from the rising birth numbers in recent years and the falling nursery school enrolment rates of the under-threes. In addition, the three-year benefit entitlement granted to mothers of two or more children who leave the labour force is one of the reasons why the employment rate of mothers of three children in France is below the OECD average. This article discusses the potential advantages of expanding preschool childcare provision and combining it with a system of parental leave that is shorter but more generous in financial terms than at present, the aim being to enhance the work-life balance, improve gender equality and keep families out of poverty. We estimate that the cost of expanding childcare provision to cover all the children concerned represents around 0.5% of GDP, an amount which is of the same order of magnitude as the additional wealth created by an increase in female labour force participation.","[Thevenon, Olivier] INED, F-75016 Paris, France; [Thevenon, Olivier] OCDE, F-75016 Paris, France",,"Thévenon, O (通讯作者)，INED, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75016 Paris, France.",olivier.thevenon@oecd.org,,,,,,,74,2,2,2,30,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using a set of panel land use data based on Landsat TM/ETM digital images, we show that during the late 1980s and 1990s, Sichuan's forest cover initially decreased and then rose. We also note that the rising and falling trends occurred at the same time that Sichuan's economy was going through a period of rapid and sustained growth. We use multivariate analysis to identify the determinants of forest cover change. In addition to using a first-differenced estimator, we also utilize spatial error and spatial lag models to obtain consistent and efficient estimates of the determinants of forest cover. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of economic growth on the forest cover change; the results show that there is a U-shaped relationship between forest cover and GDP per capita. However, despite the nature of the empirical relationship between forest cover and income, the high turning point of the U-shaped relationship suggests that there is no evidence for the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for forests in Sichuan Province. Hence, policy interventions may be necessary to stop the decrease of forests.","[Zhao, Huixia; Uchida, Emi] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Deng, Xiangzheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","University of Rhode Island; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Uchida, E (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",emi@uri.edu,"Deng, Xiangzheng/N-1335-2018; zhang, xiang/JJD-7003-2023",,,,,,49,11,12,3,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that firms, especially those with weak balance sheets, tend to respond to such risks by acquiring large, unrelated businesses with relatively high operating cash flows. The diversifying growth appears to be primarily motivated by managers' personal exposure to their firms' risk in that the growth has negative announcement returns and is related to firms' external governance, managerial stockholdings, and institutional ownership. The results suggest that corporate governance is particularly important when firms are exposed to the risk of large, adverse shocks.","[Matsa, David A.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Gormley, Todd A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Northwestern University; University of Pennsylvania,"Matsa, DA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",dmatsa@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,70,143,187,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

These zones initially focused on labour and resource-intensive manufacturing goods. In time, sectoral diversification took place accompanying the deepening industrialization in the country This paper examines the sectoral restructuring of Turkish FZs. The analysis shows that Turkish zones have supported domestic accumulation via mainly the provision of cheaper foreign inputs to Turkey Besides, the zones have served to global opening-up of Turkish capital by containing export-oriented production. In terms of sectoral transformation, the analysis finds that medium-tech industries dominate Turkish FZs rather than low-tech industries. Moreover high-tech industries have a rising importance in the FZ exports. These findings indicate that the zones have been integrated to Turkey's new industry policies which aim a higher share of medium- and high-tech industries in Turkish manufacturing production and export.","[Gultekin-Karakas, Derya] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey; [Acar, Sevil] Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University; Marmara University,"Gültekin-Karakas, D (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey.",dkaraka@itu.edu.tr; sevil.acar@econ.umu.se,"Acar, Sevil/AAM-4824-2021; Gultekin, Derya/E-1163-2017; Acar, Sevil/N-7478-2017","Acar, Sevil/0000-0001-5535-8673; Gultekin, Derya/0000-0003-1391-2431; Acar, Sevil/0000-0001-5535-8673",,,,,37,0,0,0,4,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Using the Self-Report Habit Index developed by Verplanken and Orbell (2003), we collected and analyzed survey data to (1) validate the role of habit in regular saving; (2) test whether participation in a savings program, the Individual Development Account program, facilitates habit formation; and (3) examine the role of habit in individual's perception of financial strain. The results showed that habit mattered for regular saving. It influenced savings amounts above and beyond Theory of Planned Behavior and deposit frequency measures. Habit strength increased over time during program participation and savings habits reduced the stress of financially difficult situations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, research using the value chain approach shows that upgrading for developing country firms is often limited to the lowest value-added activities. Based on comparative research carried out in two Brazilian clusters (furniture and footwear industries), this paper shows that domestic and regional value chains can offer greater upgrading opportunities, providing space for activities of higher value-added, better remunerated and difficult to replicate, notably design, marketing, and branding. Moreover, this study highlights that many firms simultaneously serve multiple value chains (multichain) and that multichain firms have better upgrading prospects than those primarily exporting via Global Value Chains.

The risk of joint liquidation creates an incentive for investors to choose heterogeneous portfolios and to rationally forgo diversification benefits. Joint liquidation risk is also reflected in asset prices, resulting in (1) assets with high idiosyncratic risk having low expected returns, and (2) assets that display high correlation with the portfolios of (liquidation-prone) investors having high expected returns.","[Wagner, Wolf] TILEC, European Banking Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Wagner, Wolf] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Wagner, W (通讯作者)，TILEC, European Banking Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands.",,,"Wagner, Wolf/0000-0002-0355-3263",,,,,42,78,89,0,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

We use Innovest's Intangible Value Assessment (IVA) ratings as a measure of firms' ability to cope with social and environmental risks. The IVA ratings allow us to uncover a positive relation between acquirer gains and the level of the target's social and environmental risk management practices. Our findings suggest that the stock market rewards the acquirer for making socially and environmentally responsible investments. We also document that the environmental and social performance of the acquirer increases following the acquisition of a SRI aware target. These results are consistent with acquirer learning from the target's SRI practices and experiences. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, evidence of the impacts of the High Speed Rail line between Rome and Naples in Italy will be provided on the basis of a survey which was carried out in March 2008. A Revealed Preference (RP) survey was undertaken by Trenitalia (the Commercial Division of Italian railways) and three different questionnaires were prepared to be submitted to car users, Intercity train users and High Speed train users. They all have in common questions concerning the socioeconomic characteristics of the users, questions related to the existence of possible time constraints for the trip undertaken and questions concerning previous travel choices. Data from Trenitalia highlighted that the use of car and of Intercity trains had almost remained unchanged during the few years of operation of the High Speed service. However, a generated demand was derived from the use of this High Speed Rail link and this means that the introduction of the High Speed service between Rome and Naples probably had impacts, as excepted, on mobility choices (i.e. increase in trip frequency, new trips never done before, etc.). Data gathered were used first of all to understand this phenomenon and then to estimate a mode choice model to reproduce/forecast modal share. Specifically the choice between car and rail was modelled through a schedule based approach and with a Nested Logit model with the train utility function including late and early penalties.

This research attempts to fill in this gap with empirical evidence by studying the inter-regional impacts of upgraded British InterCity 125/225 on British economic geography over 30 years. The six study routes of London-outbound trains serving major railways stations in 26 local authorities were selected as units of analysis, with the observation of differential effects both between HSTs and non-HSTs towns and among each group of towns, to understand time-space effects of InterCity 125/225 whose potential impacts on local economic strength and knowledge intensive development. The key findings suggest that the differential HST effects on British economic geography could be classified into three influential zones, namely 1-h, 2-h, and over-2-h towns. HST has had substantial and demonstrable effects in aiding this transition within a 2-h travel limit of London, thus helping to generate renewed economic growth, but that the effects have not been automatic or universal. Regarding future British HST policy, the implications arising from this study is that cities connected to a new HST could seize opportunities which non-HST cities will not be able to do so, but this is not a zero-sum situation. Instead, it involves a national strategy to develop a hierarchical network with HST between London and key regional hubs, well integrated at these hubs with intra-regional transport systems. This indicates a strong case for a finer-grained and deeper probing analysis at an intra-regional level of the potential for rail improvement as an agent of change in city-region development. We hope to report further on this in a subsequent paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that coffee growers benefit little from positive changes in the world price compared with participants in the auction markets. This is attributed to the presence of information asymmetry in the coffee value chain, created by an increased concentration of markets. In addition, domestic markets could play a role in this, as they are major outlets for the majority of the coffee produced.","[Alemu, Z. G.] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Worako, T.

The validity of portfolio approach was analysed by Markov Regime Switching Model. The study identifies a process with double regimes. Regime 1 represents a process in which the exchange rate is unstable, Regime 2 represents it stable. According to the results of analyses of the model, in regime 1, the portfolio preferences of decision mechanisms have no effect on the change on equilibrium exchange rate. Contrary to this result, regime 2 has a higher probability to explain the changes on equilibrium exchange rate. In this period, the crisis processes of regime periods were identified. The variables such as debt of private sector in foreign currency units, current account deficits and interest rates are determinants in the formation of equilibrium exchange rate.","[Atis, Aydanur Gacener] Ege Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, Bornova, Turkey; [Utkulu, Utku] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Buca Izmir, Turkey",Ege University; Dokuz Eylul University,"Atis, AG (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Iktisadi & Idari Bilimler Fak, Iktisat Bolumu, Bornova, Turkey.",aydanur.gacener@ege.edu.tr; utku.utkulu@deu.edu.tr,"Atış, Aydanur Gacener/ABI-5124-2020; Utkulu, Utku/P-9547-2019","Atış, Aydanur Gacener/0000-0002-4165-9683; Utkulu, Utku/0000-0002-8419-0598",,,,,53,1,1,0,7,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

World inconsistency can arise for two reasons. First, real effective misalignments of currencies out of the considered sample are implicitly assumed to be the mirror image of those of the currencies under review. Second, only N - 1 independent bilateral equilibrium exchange rates can be derived from a set of N effective rates. Here we measure the extent of these two problems by estimating equilibrium exchange rates for 15 countries of the G20 in effective as well as bilateral terms and by varying the assumptions concerning the rest of the world (RoW) and the numeraire currency. Our results show that the way the rest of the world is tackled has a major impact on the calculation of effective misalignments and especially bilateral misalignments. J. Japanese Int.

Using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data merged with data on subprime loan delinquency by ZIP code, this paper examines sale of high cost mortgages by depository institutions during the subprime lending boom of 2005 and 2006. We find that the likelihood of sale increases with risk along dimensions viewed as indicative of cherry picking: for instance, it is positively associated with future, subprime delinquency rates across neighborhoods. In contrast, along the dimension of mutually observed and priced risk as represented by APR spread, likelihood of sale decreases with risk. Thus, the paper reinforces the view, increasingly prevalent in the literature, that inattention to or misperception of risk by the securitization market played a significant role in the subprime lending boom and subsequent market collapse.

We applied this framework to census data and the microregions in Brazil were empirically classified in one or other of these possibilities with the multivariate technique of cluster analysis.

I test the idea in 3 ways. First, there is a positive relation between IPOFDR and future market returns. Second, changes in IPOFDR help explain the cross section of stock returns. Third, the predictive power of IPOFDR for stock returns reflects mainly its close relation with market variance and average idiosyncratic variance-arguably measures of systematic risk.

Prior to the early 1980s, taxpayers were permitted to defer tax obligations on profits earned from long-term contracts. Legislation passed in 1982, 1986 and 1987 required that at least 70 percent of the profits earned on long-term contracts be taxed as accrued, thereby significantly reducing the tax benefits associated with long term contracting. Comparing contracts that were ineligible for these tax benefits with those that were eligible, it appears that between 1981-1989 the duration of US. Department of Defense contracts shortened by an average of between one and two months, or somewhere between 10 and 23 percent of average contract length. This pattern implies that the tax benefits associated with long term contracts promoted artificial contract lengthening in the 1980s, and suggests that the Department of Defense ignores the federal income tax consequences of its procurement actions, thereby indirectly rewarding contractors who benefit from tax expenditures.","[Hines, James R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,,sguthrie@comcast.net; jrhines@umich.edu,,,,,,,24,1,2,0,7,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The study uses the thematic content analysis of data published on websites and official documents of business schools, in the Company Relations' sections. The analysis revealed many types of interactions that were clustered under three thematic areas of interaction: education, research and recruiting/talent management.

I compute transition probabilities from non-employment to employment by jointly estimating the probability of searching and the probability of finding a job conditional on having searched. I then test whether these are affected by market size, industrial variety and/or industry specialization. The main results indicate that market size and industry-specialization raise job seekers' chances of finding employment (conditional on having searched), while industrial variety is not significantly different from zero.

As lenders, institutional investors routinely receive private information about borrowers. However, most of these investors also trade in public securities. This leads to a controversial question: Do institutional investors use private information acquired in the loan market to trade in public securities? This paper examines the stock trading of institutional investors whose portfolios also hold loans. Using the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of loan amendments, we identify institutional investors with access to private information disclosed during loan amendments. We then look at abnormal returns on subsequent stock trades. We find that institutional participants in loan renegotiations subsequently trade in the stock of the same company and outperform trades by other managers and trades in other stocks by approximately 5.4% in annualized terms.

Analysis of a panel of firms matched with the tax characteristics of the clients of their institutional shareholders indicates that dividend-averse institutions are significantly less likely to hold shares in firms with larger dividend payouts. This relation between the tax preferences of institutional shareholders and firm payout policy may reflect dividend-averse institutions gravitating towards low dividend paying firms or managers adapting their payout policies to the interests of their institutional shareholders.

Without explicit rare event insurance, investors insure themselves indirectly through the stock and money markets, the risk premium is countercyclical, and flight to quality effects arise. Upon market completion, the risk premium increases as investors increase their exposure to rare event risk. While market completion leads to a more efficient allocation based on investors' anticipatory utilities, its effect on ex post efficiency is ambiguous.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Dieckmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sdieckma@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,38,12,12,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We estimate the model by applying the Duan (1994) maximum-likelihood approach. A strongly increasing total crisis risk estimated from early July 2007 onwards is driven mainly by short-term crisis risk.

If so, electricity producers should include the price of carbon in their cost functions. After identifying different sub-periods of the EU ETS during its pilot phase (2005-2007), we model day-ahead electricity prices in France and Germany and look at their volatility around the fundamentals white evaluating the correlation between electricity prices in the two countries. We find that electricity producers in both countries were constrained to include the carbon price in their cost functions during the first two years of the EU ETS. We also find evidence of fuel switching in electricity-generation in Germany after the collapse of the carbon market. Furthermore, the EU ETS has greatly contributed to the partial alignment of the wholesale price of electricity in France to that in Germany.","[Ahamada, Ibrahim; Kirat, Djamel] Univ Paris 01, Ecole Econ Paris, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Ahamada, Ibrahim; Kirat, Djamel] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Ahamada, I (通讯作者)，106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",ahamada@univ-paris1.fr; djamel.kirat@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,20,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Moreover, this technique can incorporate the important social function that microinsurers fulfill and provide powerful managerial implications.

There are many possible explanations for this paradox; the author focuses on the role of adaptation. Adaptation is the subject of much work in economics, but its definition is a psychological one. Adaptations are defense mechanisms; there are bad ones like paranoia, and healthy ones like humor, anticipation, and sublimation. Set point theory-which is the subject of much debate in psychology-posits that people can adapt to anything, such as bad health, divorce, and extreme poverty, and return to a natural level of cheerfulness. The author's research from around the world suggests that people are remarkably adaptable. Respondents in Afghanistan are as happy as Latin Americans and 20 percent more likely to smile in a day than Cubans. The findings suggest that while this may be a good thing from an individual psychological perspective, it may also shed insights into different development outcomes, including collective tolerance for bad equilibrium.

I present a tractable model of a firm that optimally chooses capital structure, cash holdings, dividends, and default while facing cash flows with long-term uncertainty and short-term liquidity shocks. The model explains how changes in solvency affect liquidity and also how liquidity concerns affect solvency via capital structure choice. These interactions result in a dynamic cash policy in which cash reserves increase in profitability and are positively correlated with cash flows.

Specifically, it investigates the relationship between the importance individuals attach to labour-market activities - which is influenced by the identity to which they adhere - and their preferences for job attributes. The analysis shows that individuals who consider labour-market success as instrumental for achieving their life goals tend to attach importance to job characteristics such as pay level and career and training opportunities. Individuals for whom non-labour-market activities are important and in conflict with labour-market activities are found to attach importance to the possibility of working on a convenient time schedule. Moreover, consistently with the identity approach to labour-market behaviour, men appear to resolve the conflict between career and non-work activities in favor of the former. Finally, unobserved factors that increase the desire to work part-time have a negative impact on the likelihood of attaching importance to the training and career opportunities offered by the job.

Due to this fact it is obvious that gathering as many information as possible, regarding all surrounding environment (partners, competitors, clients) is of great importance for each university. In these conditions market research becomes an extremely useful and powerful instrument. Conducting a market research based on probabilistic sampling methods is very difficult and expensive in this domain also and this is why non probabilistic, online sampling methods appear as very tempting and probably efficient solutions. The main topic of this paper consists of proposing a set of methods that will definitely diminish the disadvantages of non probabilistic online sampling methods (in domain of higher education). Applying such methods will increase results' (of a study based on an online sample) reliability by reducing their bias from ones obtained with a pure probabilistic method.","[Alecsandru, Strat Vasile; Raluca, Danciu Aniela] Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,strat_vasile@yahoo.com; anielaco@hotmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1139,1148,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000112,0

We argue that this is partly due to severe methodological problems involved. In this study we analyze the effect of German bank mergers from the period 1995-2000 on the banks' profitability and cost efficiency. We suggest a new matching strategy to control for the selection effects arising from the fact that pre-dominantly under-performing banks engage in mergers. Our results indicate a neutral effect of mergers on profitability and cost efficiency. Comparing our results with those obtained from a naive performance comparison of merging and non-merging banks indicates a severe negative selection bias with regard to the latter.

The crisis has encouraged a sharper focus on systemic risk, the inclusion of a financial sector in macroeconomic models, a shift from a microprudential to a macroprudential orientation in regulation and supervision, and questions about whether price stability is a sufficient criterion to guide monetary policy. In the process, it has led to a rediscovery of the macroeconomic roots of financial instability. This paper argues that this development is welcome but has not gone far enough.

The empirical results indicate that the forecasted Value-at-Risk (VaR) obtained using the SGT distribution provides the most accurate out-of-sample forecasts for both the petroleum and metal markets. With regard to the unconditional and conditional coverage tests, the SGT distribution produces the most appropriate VaR estimates in terms of the total number of rejections; this is followed by the nonparametric distribution, generalized error distribution (GED), and finally the normal distribution. Similarly, in the dynamic quantile test, the VaR estimates generated by the SGT and nonparametric distributions perform better than that generated by other distributions. Finally, in the superior predictive test, the SGT distribution has significantly lower capital requirements than the nonparametric distribution for most commodities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show a convex (U-shape) relationship between fund size and firm valuations. We further document that firm valuations are positively correlated to measures of limited attention. In addition, we show a concave (inverse U-shape) relationship between fund size and venture's performance measured as the probability of successful exits. Further, this relation is particularly strong when the pre-money valuation of the investment is high. Our findings hold across a wide range of robustness checks, including but not limited to sample selection and correction for unobserved company-level value drivers. Our findings support the notion that there is diseconomy of scale in the venture capital industry, which is partially due to the constraints from the quality and quantity of human capital when fund size grows.

Heterogeneous preferences exist among consumers and both demographic and behavioral variables have significant impacts on preferences.

We begin by documenting three dimensions of capital structure variation: cross firm, cross industry, and within firm through time. We summarize how well the traditional trade-off and pecking order approaches explain these sources of variation and highlight their empirical shortcomings. We review recent research that attempts to address these shortcomings, much of which follows seven broad themes: (a) Important variables have been mismeasured in empirical tests, (b) the impact of leverage on non-financial stakeholders is important, (c) the supply side of capital affects corporate capital structure, (d) richer features of financial contracts have been underresearched, (e) value effects due to capital structure appear to be modest over wide ranges of leverage, (f) estimates of leverage adjustment speeds are biased, and (g) capital structure dynamics have not been adequately considered. Much progress has been made in addressing these issues, some of which has led to the study of an expanded range of capital structure topics, including debt maturity, loan and covenant characteristics, collateral effects, and alternative financing sources such as leasing and credit lines. We conclude by summarizing unanswered questions and areas for future research.","[Graham, John R.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Graham, John R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leary, Mark T.] Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Washington University (WUSTL),"Graham, JR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",john.graham@duke.edu; leary@wustl.edu,"Graham, John R/A-6272-2014",,,,,,159,202,236,1,174,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4803-8,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Higher education institutions are stable, with the long-term thinking, obtain research and have educative goals which are enable them to educate about sustainability. Higher education institutions successfully combined local and global knowledge with the merging of the faculty, students and staffs talents to create synergies to develop new solutions. On the other hand, working within higher education institutions also has limitations. The time constrain often limit the students to be involved in short-term projects. Furthermore, the nature of hierarchical and bureaucratic structure of university's administration and management creates difficulty in instituting comprehensive approaches addressing campus sustainability. As the interest of green business sustainability is generating a lot of interests in the higher education institution, this paper evaluates the implementation of Green Campus Initiative (GCI) at the UCSI University Malaysia by evaluating their carbon footprint emission. The carbon footprint calculation and proposed framework presented in this paper aims to encourage other higher Education Institutions in Malaysia to implement the GCI. In order to reduce the environmental impact at UCSI University, the measurement of the CO2 emission was a very important starting point. These primary data were processed with the formulas had been developed earlier and resulted the total carbon footprint produced by UCSI University in one year. Supported by the secondary data (i.e. literature review), a proposed framework of GCI implementation was proposed to be tested and empirically validated in future studies.

Empirical results obtained from a panel of electoral districts in Quebec provide robust evidence that districts which display loyalty to the incumbent government receive disproportionately more spending, especially close to an election, at odds with the standard 'swing voter' view.","[Joanis, Marcelin] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Joanis, Marcelin] Univ Sherbrooke, GREDI, Fac Adm, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Joanis, Marcelin] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Sherbrooke; University of Sherbrooke; Universite de Montreal,"Joanis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, 2500 Boul Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",marcelin.joanis@usherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,36,22,33,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2011,146.0,1-2,,,,,117,143,,10.1007/s11127-009-9586-9,0.0,,,27,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,691TK,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285103500007,0

Corporate Governance is a worldwide problem. The commercial companies in the Czech Republic unwillingly accept good governance models and it often means their reduced performance and competitiveness on the market compared to foreign companies. Corporate Governance is understood as a key element for achieving performance, growth and allowing increase of investor's confidence. The financial crisis also revealed shortcomings of the CG, and on its basis the OCED has issued a number of recommendations, one of these recommendations is to improve monitoring and enforcement of existing national codes in the field of management and control of companies, i.e. reporting. The target of this report was to examine how the CG really approaches the voluntary reporting and what information interest the involved parties. Empirical research was conducted in 86 commercial companies which characterized the essence of the management and control of companies and it further closer investigated the importance of CO for the voluntary reporting, assessment of the types and forms of voluntary reports, and also transparent disclosure of information about the company. As a conclusion of the research it can be stated that most of small and medium-sized commercial companies in the Czech Republic took the path of smallest resistance and put into practice only minimal CG requirements demanded by the law, voluntary reporting is supported by CO only in minimal extent. The level of CG and transparency in each commercial company will to certain level depend on how the company will monitor and communicate with interested groups and how transparent will be its reporting system.","[Kocmanova, Alena; Hornungova, Jana; Docekalova, Marie] Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,kocmanova@fbm.vutbr.cz; hornungova@fbm.vutbr.cz; docekalova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Pavlakova Docekalova, Marie/O-8845-2017","Pavlakova Docekalova, Marie/0000-0003-4628-5075",,,,,23,0,0,1,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,1557,1571,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001043,0

In the literature, the effectiveness of such labels concerning the purchase behaviour of consumers has been doubted. In this context, our paper compares the guaranteed quality of three labels - QS, CMA and BIO - with their expected quality by the consumer. The QS label and particularly the BIO label are process-orientated and characterized by a high level of control and sanctions. The CMA label assured, till its termination in 2009, a specific sensory quality accompanied with less rigorous mechanisms of control and sanctions. The results of a representative online survey indicate that consumers expect the same quality level from the CMA label and the QS label, although, in fact, QS guarantees a higher process quality. The CMA label can differentiate from the others in consumers' perception as a regional origin label, whereas the BIO label stands out for the material dimension of quality including safety and quality items. To conclude, the perception of the material quality of labels (e.g. CMA label) can be biased by positively valued ideational product attributes. Thus, it is supposable that the consumer assesses the quality better than it actually is.","[Kubitzki, Sabine] Univ Giessen, Inst Agrarpolit & Marktforsch, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Kubitzki, S (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agrarpolit & Marktforsch, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Sabine.Kubitzki@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,9,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN 1,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251 POSTFACH 10 06 06, W-6000 FRANKFURT MAIN 1, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

An awareness of causes and consequences of turnover is necessary in order to ensure a competitive advantage in today's knowledge economy. On the basis of an analysis, the article deduces the main factors causing employee turnover that in turn lead to the loss of knowledge. Using the outcomes of primary surveys, the article deals with the impact of employees' leaving on their organisations. The article describes the differences in effects between small and large organisations in terms of turnover and the subsequent interruption of knowledge transfer. The article also presents an analysis of inadequate behaviour within organisations and highlights problematic organisational practices that most frequently lead to an employee's decision to leave the job, thus causing an outflow of knowledge. The objective is to compare statistically provable causes of employees' leaving organisations and to ensure knowledge continuity in small and large organisations. A partial objective is to check the dependence between selected qualitative variables in the area of knowledge continuity ensuring related to employee turnover, and to confirm or reject its relevance at the selected level of significance. The verifiability of factors characterising the reasons for employees' decisions to leave, or rather of the determined hypotheses testing how organisations are threatened by the loss of knowledge, has been statistically tested to validate the outcomes and their further utilization. For modern-knowledge organisations, it is essential to know the causes and consequences of turnover in order to maintain their competitiveness. One of the conclusions of the article is that factors determining employee turnover also have a positive impact at the individual level (internal motivation, previous experience in knowledge sharing and trust) that subsequently support knowledge continuity ensuring. It is also possible to say that factors determining employee turnover have a positive impact at the organisational level (organisational climate, stimulation /remuneration system/, communication process, willingness to invest into employee education) consequently leading to knowledge continuity ensuring.","[Linhartova, Lucie; Urbancova, Hana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Linhartová, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",linhartoval@pef.czu.cz; urbancova@pef.czu.cz,"Depoo, Lucie/ABE-4039-2020; Urbancova, Hana/K-5663-2015","Depoo, Lucie/0000-0003-4296-875X; Urbancova, Hana/0000-0001-6603-8691",,,,,19,1,1,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2196-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,223,231,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000338036100023,0

It employs geo-coded and GPS-validated data from the STAR survey conducted in the county-sized regional municipality of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Many significant inter-zonal differences are identified, and most travel variables are characterized by progressive urban-to-rural gradients, with large differences between inner-city and outer-commuter values. A clear break between city and country is seldom evident, however. Inner-city residents make most trips, but have trips of shortest duration, and spend least time in travel. Residents of the commuter belts spend most time in travel, and have trips of longest duration. While long trips and much driving were expected in commuter zones, there are significantly fewer trips in the OCB, which we attribute to lack of need, lack of opportunities, and adjustments in discretionary behavior.

We focus on adults who have not finished high school and on teenagers, groups likely to earn low wages. Conventional economic theory predicts that higher minimum wages lead to higher hourly earnings among people who are employed but lower employment rates. Data from the Current Population Survey during the period 1994-2007 indicate that there is a significant disemployment effect of higher minimum wages on Latino teenagers, although it is smaller for foreign- than native-born Latinos. Adult Latino immigrants' earnings are less affected by minimum wage laws than other low-education natives, and their employment rates appear to increase when the minimum wage rises.

The empirical study takes as a reference the horticultural sector in southeast Spain, since this area constitutes the highest concentration of small-scale farm production in Europe, where the climatic conditions allow the possibility of several harvests in year-round production, as well as several alternative crops. Firstly, we study the production programming for an individual farmer, under the assumption that their decisions do not affect the balance of market prices. In this case a modified Markowitz model is used for the scheduling of crop marketing. Secondly, we study the sales arrangements for a farming-marketing cooperative, under the assumption that their sales volume is such that the entity is capable of altering the market balance. A model of monthly revenues and margins is proposed, and the results show a clear improvement in both margins and revenues if the harvest is programmed in this way.","[Perez-Mesa, Juan C.] Univ Almeria, Dept Business Adm & Management, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Galdeano-Gomez, Emilio] Univ Almeria, Dept Appl Econ, La Canada De San Urban 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Aznar-Sanchez, Jose A.] Univ Almeria, Dept Appl Econ, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Pérez-Mesa, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Dept Business Adm & Management, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario CeiA3, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.",juancarl@ual.es; galdeano@ual.es; jaznar@ual.es,"Gomez, Emilio/KBQ-1973-2024; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014; Sánchez, José Ángel Aznar/AAI-6038-2021; Galdeano-Gómez, Emilio/J-9979-2014","Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475; Sánchez, José Ángel Aznar/0000-0001-5443-1269; Galdeano Gomez, Emilio/0000-0001-5414-4331","Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid [ECO2008-02258, ECO2008-03445, ECO2011-24930]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-5827]",Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"This research was partially funded by Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid (project ECO2008-02258, ECO2008-03445 and ECO2011-24930) and from Junta de Andalucia (project SEJ-5827, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia).

Standard rules of supply and demand are difficult to apply to the market of health services. The main reason is that supply is determined by the number of medical facilities in given area, specific structure of these facilities, number of physicians, the options of medical treatment which are dependent on the equipment available, possibilities to perform certain medical interventions, but also by the general approach of the state, health insurance companies and the citizens towards health care.

In a globalized economy, companies and countries with weak corporate governance systems are likely to suffer serious consequences above and beyond financial crises. In the case of emerging economies the need for corporate governance extends over resolving problems resulting from the separation of ownership and control and deal with issues such as the lack of property rights, the abuse of minority shareholders or contract violations. In order that corporate governance measures have a strong impact in the economy, a set of democratic, market institutions and legal system should be settled up and a proper framework to apply the principles and codes should be ensured.","[Vasilescu, Laura; Pirvu, Cerasela; Mehedintu, Anca] Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,,laura_giurca_vasilescu@yahoo.com; cerasela.pirvu@yahoo.com; ancamehedintu@yahoo.com,"Vasilescu, Laura/GYU-1206-2022; Mehedintu, Anca/JNR-2595-2023; Pirvu, Cerasela/R-9754-2019","Vasilescu, Laura/0000-0002-1725-7246",,,,,28,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,195,206,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550000018,0

We use a simulation study to evaluate the designs generated using the WTP-optimality criterion and discuss the design of a real-life conjoint experiment from the literature. The results show that the new criterion leads to designs that yield more precise estimates of the WTP than Bayesian D-optimal conjoint choice designs, which are increasingly being seen as the state-of-the-art designs for conjoint choice studies, and to a substantial reduction in the occurrence of unrealistically high WTP estimates.","[Vermeulen, Bart; Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, StatUA Ctr Stat, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Vandebroek, Martina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Stat Res Ctr, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Goos, Peter] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",KU Leuven; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Waikato; University of Western Australia; KU Leuven; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Vermeulen, B (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",bart.vermeulen@econ.kuleuven.be; peter.goos@ua.ac.be; rscarpa@waikato.ac.nz; martina.vandebroek@econ.kuleuven.be,"Goos, Peter/AAP-7890-2020; Scarpa, Riccardo/AAF-8435-2019; Vandebroek, Martina L./J-9103-2015","Scarpa, Riccardo/0000-0001-6449-5389; Vandebroek, Martina L./0000-0002-0317-1986; Goos, Peter/0000-0002-3854-6506",,,,,46,36,37,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Second, the Cadillac tax on high-cost insurance is intended to improve incentives for efficiency in the health system, but it is only a half step that also creates new inequities. Third, new taxes imposed on insurers and health suppliers will ultimately be paid by consumers, contrary to some claims.

Ultimately, the view that income growth by itself eventually will be good for the environment also appears to be wrong because a causal relationship between income and environmental quality cannot be demonstrated. The original empirical estimates appear fragile at best compared to estimates using more representative datasets, higher-quality data, and more appropriate econometric techniques. More plausible explanations for the observed data revolve around good government, effective regulation, and diffusion of technological change. These factors tend to be related in a diffuse manner with higher income and suggest it is likely, but not inevitable, that a society will choose to reduce pollution levels as it becomes wealthier.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Carson, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",rcarson@ucsd.edu,,"Carson, Richard/0000-0002-3273-8224",,,,,85,263,279,0,81,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Around SEO announcements, we find no evidence of informed short selling. Around issue dates, higher levels of pre-issue short selling are significantly related to larger issue discounts for non-shelf-registered offerings. This evidence is consistent with manipulative trading. We show that SEC Rule 105 constrains some but not all manipulative trading. Our results reverse previous research that uses monthly short-interest data, because daily data allow more powerful tests. Our evidence helps explain the increased popularity of shelf registrations.

We study whether firms with diversification discounts have higher expected returns in order to compensate investors for offering less upside potential (or skewness exposure) than focused firms. Our empirical tests support this hypothesis. First, we find that focused firms offer greater skewness exposure than diversified firms. Second, we find that diversified firms have significantly larger discounts when the diversified firm offers less skewness than matched single-segment firms. Finally, we find that up to 53% of the excess returns received on diversification-discount firms relative to diversification-premium firms can be explained by differences in exposure to skewness.","[Mitton, Todd; Vorkink, Keith] Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Mitton, T (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",todd.mitton@byu.edu; keith_vorkink@byu.edu,,,,,,,43,22,24,1,18,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

For this purpose it uses aggregate data on all main components of the profit and loss account and on the interest rate applied on loans and on deposits for the banking sector of the main industrialized countries during the period 1981-2003. With such information we are able to disentangle the extent to which a bank is able to shift its tax-burden forward to its borrowers, depositors, and purchasers of fee-generating services. The main result is that the taxation of banks' profit is equivalent to a taxation on loans and as such it exerts a substantial impact on the composition of banking sector revenues. However credit intermediaries have the ability to shift a substantial part of their corporate income tax burden and therefore differences in the level of taxation cannot explain the dispersion observed in banks' net profitability across industrialized countries.

In order to make their purchases with confidence, both in their country and abroad, consumers need easy access to precise information and to professional advice. Taking into account the fact that education and training are a strategic factor for a sustainable development through contribution to human capital development, within the Romania-Bulgaria Cross-Border Cooperation Program 2007-2013, the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Romania and the D. Tsenov Academy of Economics in Svisthov, Bulgaria decided to collaborate in the field Cooperation on human resources development - joint development of skills and knowledge, through the development of cross-border liaisons and exchanges between the two universities. Our objective is to bring up new methods of training in the field of consumer protection in order to train and to supply the labour market with specialized experts in this field in charge with various issues regarding consumers in enterprises, in organizations in charge with elaborating consumer protection policies and in organizations in charge with market supervision and control and also in consumers' associations. We consider that in this way we meet both consumers' and employers' needs because economic agents need professionals in the field as well, in order to advise them in their quest to protect the rights and interests of consumers. Also, Meglena Kuneva, the European Commissioner for Consumer Protection, noted that studies conducted at European level revealed that there is a high level of interest for recruiting qualified experts in the field of consumer protection shown by large companies, national governments, small and medium enterprises and consumers' associations. In order to evaluate the requirement for education and training in the field of consumer protection in the Lower Danube Region, we decided to collect and study the necessary information, both at EU level as well as those specific to the counties bordering the Danube, information which sustain the need for the establishment of a new form of expert training in this field. As a result, the paper brings up aspects regarding the need for training experts in the field of consumer protection, referring to the Romanian counties bordering the Danube and neighbouring Bulgaria. Also, this report presents the findings of a research project whose aim is to evaluate the availability of prerequisites for seeking educational products in the field of consumer protection in Bulgaria. The institutional framework of the process in Bulgaria has been analyzed and the results of a survey among the representatives of the four parties involved in it - government authorities, NGOs, consumers and suppliers - have been presented. The research presents their point of view regarding the extent to which the process of consumer protection in Bulgaria is developed, what are the major obstacles it faces, what means of improvement are there, to what extent the more active offer of educational products would facilitate the process and based on this, what would the role played by the institutions of higher education be, what types of educational products would best be realized on the market in a short-term and medium term aspect. The motivation for such research is related both to the strive to improve the status of the consumer rights protection in Bulgaria and the intention of Tsenov Academy of Economics in Svishtov, Bulgaria and the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest to collaborate towards intensifying the cross-border co-operation and facilitate the human resource development in the region by jointly offering educational products.","[Dinu, Vasile; Petrescu, Raluca Mariana] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Marchevski, Ivan] Tsenov Acad Econ, Svishtov, Bulgaria",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Tsenov Academy of Economics,"Dinu, V (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Marchevski, Ivan/G-6501-2017; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548; MARCHEVSKI/MARCEVSKI, IVAN/IVAN/0000-0002-1056-2811",,,,,18,20,21,0,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2010,12.0,,,,4,,709,734,,,,,,26,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,699CQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285641900002,0

Perhaps the most cited recent work in this area, Cullen and Levitt (1999), does not extend through 1990s, a decade during which crime rates declined almost continuously, to levels that were lower than experienced in decades. This paper examines whether such declines contributed to city population growth and retention (abated flight). Through a series of population growth models that attempt to identify causality through several strategies (including instrumental variables) we find at best weak evidence that overall city growth is affected by changes in crime. We find no evidence that growth is differentially sensitive to reductions in crime, as compared to increases. Focusing more narrowly on within MSA migration, residential decisions that are more likely to be sensitive to local conditions, we do find evidence supporting abatement of 'flight' - that is, lower levels of crime in central cities in the 1990s are associated with lower levels of migration to the suburbs. This greater ability to retain residents already in the city does not appear to be accompanied by a greater ability to attract new households from the suburbs, or from outside of the metropolitan area.

We find strong evidence that the value investors attach to excess cash reserves is substantially larger for foreign firms listed on US exchanges and over-the-counter than for their domestic peers. Further, we show that this excess-cash premium stems not only from the strength of US legal rules and disclosure requirements, but also from the greater informal monitoring pressure that accompanies a US listing. Overall, because investors' valuation of excess cash mirrors how they expect the cash to be used, our analysis shows that a US listing constrains insiders' inefficient allocation of corporate cash reserves significantly.

In particular, we show that in the absence of cross-sectional heterogeneity in firms' cash-flow risk, these models produce a growth premium, that is, stocks with high price-to-fundamental ratios command a higher premium than stocks with low price-to-fundamental ratios. This implication is at odds with the well-established empirical observation of a value premium in the cross-section of stock returns. Substantial heterogeneity in firms' cash-flow risk yields both a value premium as well as most of the stylized facts about the cross-section of stock returns, but it generates a cash-flow risk puzzle: Quantitatively, value stocks have to have too much cash-flow risk compared to the data to generate empirically plausible value premiums.

From the 1970s through the 1990s, most states removed restrictions on intrastate branching, which intensified bank competition and improved bank performance. Exploiting the cross-state, cross-time variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we find that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median. Bank deregulation tightened the distribution of income by increasing the relative wage rates and working hours of unskilled workers.","[Beck, Thorsten] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Beck, Thorsten] Tilburg Univ, EBC, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Levine, Ross] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Levine, Ross] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Levkov, Alexey] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA USA",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Beck, T (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands.",,"Beck, Thorsten/GRX-3987-2022",,,,,,38,1113,1280,137,820,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

The presence of dual holders offers a unique opportunity to assess the existence and magnitude of shareholder-creditor conflicts. We find that syndicated loans with dual holder participation have loan yield spreads that are 18-32 bps lower than those without. The difference remains economically significant after controlling for the selection effect. Further investigation of dual holders' investment horizons and changes in borrowers' credit quality lends support to the hypothesis that incentive alignment between shareholders and creditors plays an important role in lowering loan yield spreads.,"[Jiang, Wei] Columbia Univ, Columbia Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Li, Kai] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Shao, Pei] Univ No British Columbia, Sch Business, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada",Columbia University; University of British Columbia; University of Northern British Columbia,"Jiang, W (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Sch Business, 3022 Broadway,Uris Hall 803, New York, NY 10027 USA.",wj2006@columbia.edu; kai.li@sauder.ubc.ca; shao@unbc.ca,"Li, Kai/AAJ-8376-2021; Jiang, Wei/KCX-8643-2024","Li, Kai/0000-0002-3845-3895; Jiang, Wei/0000-0003-3256-4938",,,,,48,91,118,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We find that these two liquidity sources are employed to hedge against different risks. Nonoperational cash guards against future cash flow shocks in bad times, while credit lines give firms the option to exploit future business opportunities available in good times. Lines of credit are the dominant source of liquidity for companies around the world, comprising about 15% of assets, while less than half of the cash held by companies is held for non-operational purposes, comprising about 2% of assets.

On aggregate, energy intensity decreased, but this does not seem to have been very important for reducing emissions. Rather, fuel substitution seems to have been more important, which is in line with findings from the decomposition literature on Sweden. However, at the sectoral level, we find no clear pattern of the effect of fuel substitution and energy intensity on emissions. We also draw some methodological conclusions: decomposition analysis should be undertaken at the most disaggregate level possible; assessing decomposition results by summing results over several time periods leads to biased results; and decomposition analysis should not be based only on some initial and final years of a long time period. Furthermore, we address the problem of double counting energy flows in decomposition analysis of aggregate effects when the energy sector is included, and point out potential problems related to output measured in monetary terms.","[Lofgren, Asa] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Muller, Adrian] Univ Zurich, Socioecon Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Gothenburg; University of Zurich,"Löfgren, Å (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",asa.lofgren@economics.gu.se; adrian.mueller@soi.uzh.ch,,"Muller, Adrian/0000-0001-7232-9399",,,,,37,22,25,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Recent focus on food security due to rising food prices at a national and global level has placed the food security agenda back in the spotlight. In this paper it is argued that there is a disjuncture between the institutional response mechanism defined in South Africa's strategy and the complexity of food insecurity nationally. It outlines why, as a response seated uncomfortably under the leadership of the National Department of Agriculture, the IFSS remains frustrated by a range of structural and organisational challenges. The IFSS provides a useful case study to demonstrate the importance of institutional arrangements to achieve food security that by its nature, requires integrated responses from diverse stakeholders.","[Drimie, Scott] Int Policy Res Inst IFPRI, Hunger & Nutr Div, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ruysenaar, Shaun] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm, ReVAMP Res Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Witwatersrand,"Drimie, S (通讯作者)，Int Policy Res Inst IFPRI, Hunger & Nutr Div, Johannesburg, South Africa.",s.drimie@cgiar.org; sruysenaar@gmail.com,"DRIMIE, SCOTT/T-5109-2017","DRIMIE, SCOTT/0000-0003-3827-8051",,,,,80,42,52,0,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,SEP,2010,49.0,3,,,,,316,337,,10.1080/03031853.2010.503377,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,675DV,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283807200003,0

Analyzing a large international sample, we test two opposing hypotheses. According to the pecking order theory, adverse selection problems make external financing costly and imply a higher market value of a marginal dollar of cash in states with higher information asymmetry. In contrast, the free cash flow theory predicts that excessive cash holdings bundled with higher information asymmetry generate moral hazard problems and lead to a lower market value of a marginal dollar of cash. We use the dispersion of analysts' earnings per share forecasts as our main measure of firm-specific and time-varying information asymmetry. Extending the valuation regressions of Fama and French [Fama, E.F., French, KR., 1998. Taxes, financing decisions, and firm value.

First, we show that the paper is the first application of income and substitution effects to this branch of economic research. Next, we analyse Robbins' economic terminology, especially his definition of work. We find that the concept of work he uses could seem vague as he may be considering both the length and intensity dimensions of this activity. To verify this possibility, we formally reassess Robbins' original proposal by introducing this wider definition of work into the mathematical framework he proposes. The resulting model shows that this reading (i) is compatible with his diagrammatic analysis; (ii) clarifies the meaning of the other vague economic concepts the author uses; and (iii) illuminates his verbal explanations. Additionally, we derive all the relevant results of both the income-leisure and the more recent effort-extraction models from this Robbinsian model of work supply.

This paper documents changes in noncustodial fathers' earnings over a five-year period and examines the relationship between the changes in earnings and modifications in child support orders. Using detailed longitudinal administrative data from Wisconsin, the authors examine the history of orders and earnings for fathers in couples who had their first child support ordered in 2000. A substantial proportion of fathers experience large changes in earnings, but relatively few of the associated child support orders are modified. Using discrete-time multinomial event history models that consider time-varying variables and control for censored observations, we find some evidence of changes in earnings being associated with changes in orders, all else equal, but the relationship is relatively weak and order changes are not proportional to earnings changes. The findings highlight the challenges and importance of developing policies that result in child support orders being more responsive to changes in fathers' incomes.

The existing literature has generally failed to provide a comprehensive study on the effects of the BOys interventions, and particularly, the efficacy of public and secret operations. By dividing a 24-h trading clay into three horizons, we show that the intraday evidence on the effects of official interventions documented in prior studies primarily came from publicly known interventions In the case of secret interventions, although there were no clear impacts on the first moment of exchange rate returns, we found significant second moment responses. Specifically, covert operations were able to reduce the Yen/USD return volatility during both Tokyo and subsequent overnight market hours Furthermore, our extended model on secret interventions reveals that when the BOJ completely concealed its transactions, undetected interventions were shown to be most effective in both reversing undesired trends and reducing excess return volatilities On the other hand, those interventions that were rumoured were not as effective Finally, the interventions conducted during the periods of 'oral interventions' were in general more effective in moving the exchange rate in the desired direction.

We argue that outsourced upstream production contributes to the emergence of innovation networks by creating a demand for upstream R&D. The bargaining weight of the two parties determines whether outsourcing decisions that lead to static specialization gains also generate dynamic gains when compared with vertically integrated production that relies on integrated R&D. In particular, growth is maximized when the bargaining power is split in a way that search and hold-up frictions are minimized. Putting this result next to the decision of firms to outsource, we conclude that complementary innovations are more likely to foster growth in Schumpeterian Mark I sectors, while vertical integration does so in Schumpeterian Mark II sectors.","[Naghavi, Alireza] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Ottaviano, Gianmarco I.

The default rates and interest rate payment on the mortgage correlate positively with the market interest rate. Gains from using the optimal contract relative to simpler mortgages are the biggest for those who face more income variability, buy pricey houses given their income level, or make little or no down payment.

We test our model's predictions using data for all referendums held in current European Union countries from 1970 until 2007, and show that the existence of a participation quorums increases abstention by more than ten percentage points.","[Aguiar-Conraria, Luis] NIPE, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Aguiar-Conraria, Luis] Univ Minho, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Magalhaes, Pedro C.] Univ Lisbon, Social Sci Inst, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade de Lisboa,"Aguiar-Conraria, L (通讯作者)，NIPE, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",lfaguiar@eeg.uminho.pt; pedro.magalhaes@ics.ul.pt,"Aguiar-Conraria, Luis/M-2936-2019; Magalhães, Pedro C./B-3197-2010","Aguiar-Conraria, Luis/0000-0001-6822-7103; Magalhães, Pedro C./0000-0001-8934-4552",,,,,53,38,41,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2010,144.0,1-2,,,,,63,81,,10.1007/s11127-009-9504-1,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,595WU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277645200004,0

A cost function approach is employed, and North Carolina municipal data for three years (1997, 2001, and 2003) are used for the analysis. Empirical findings indicate that there is no significant difference in cost savings between public delivery and private contractor delivery of solid waste services, a finding similar to those of other recent studies. There are three possible reasons for this. First, the threat of competition and contracting out might have led to cost savings in the cases of public delivery. Second, there might be a lack of competition because a few large private contractors have been able to win follow-on contracts over the years. Third, there might be substantial transaction costs arising as the result of private contracting.

We test the conglomeration hypothesis, which holds that firms can optimize by diversifying across businesses, versus the strategic focus hypothesis, which holds that firms optimize by focusing on core businesses. We analyze whether it is advantageous for insurers to offer both life-health and property-liability insurance or to specialize in one major industry segment. We estimate cost, revenue, and profit efficiency utilizing data envelopment analysis (DEA) and test for scope economies by regressing efficiency scores on control variables and an indicator for strategic focus. Property-liability insurers realize cost scope economies, but they are more than offset by revenue scope diseconomies. Life-health insurers realize both cost and revenue scope diseconomies. Hence, strategic focus is superior to conglomeration in the insurance industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Cummins, J.

Furthermore, wage compression and learning may give rise to a class of switchers who start in wage employment and later switch to self-employment.

Testing the impact of an increase in the federal tax on horizontal tax competition with Canada-US data for 1984-1994, it finds evidence that an increase in federal tax makes horizontal tax reactions weaker. This is because an increase in federal tax raises the cost, in terms of utility of income, of a unit increase in the province's tax rate. On the methodological side, it is possible to estimate the impact of the federal tax on the fiscal policy of the province without neglecting control for year effects, which cannot be used in the empirical literature because they are perfectly collinear with the federal tax.","[Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Ferrara, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Rizzo, Leonzio] IEB, Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Rizzo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",leonzio.rizzo@unife.it,,"Rizzo, Leonzio/0000-0001-8099-8699",,,,,27,13,14,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2010,144.0,1-2,,,,,369,387,,10.1007/s11127-009-9524-x,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,595WU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277645200019,0

I build a benchmark model where national lobbies can coordinate (i.e. form a trans-national lobby) at no cost and show that lobbying does not affect the fiscal regime. On the other hand, when interest groups cannot coordinate, decentralization emerges as a political equilibrium with lobbying. Policy centralization hurts national lobbies by increasing competition for influence. At a constitutional stage, interest groups induce politically motivated governments to reject centralization. Three extensions show that this result depends on the level of cross-border externalities; the voting rule at the constitutional stage; and the details of the institutional decision mechanism under centralization.","World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Ruta, M (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Rue Lausanne 154, Geneva, Switzerland.",michele.ruta@wto.org,"Yoon, DongJoon/E-9146-2014",,,,,,23,3,3,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2010,144.0,1-2,,,,,275,291,,10.1007/s11127-009-9519-7,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,595WU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277645200015,0

By estimating the determinants of lottery sales using variables that capture the distribution of income rather than simply its level, our analysis provides a more complete description of the incidence of lottery sales.

In particular, we find that hot money ranks as the second largest contributor in the fluctuations of China's real estate prices. In the risky regime, which corresponds to more inflows and higher volatility of hot money, the effects are even more prominent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Little attention has been given to the possibility that under some circumstances incremental technological change can be quite risky. This article argues that there may be tradeoffs to high rates of incremental technological change. The costs are of two kinds: the organizational disruptions associated with frequent technological change and overestimating the advantages and receptiveness of the technological improvement. We argue that larger firms are better equipped than smaller firms to cope with these costs and will reap greater benefits from incremental changes. Using data on the population of worldwide floppy disk drive manufacturers, we find that frequent incremental technical changes decrease organizational mortality for large firms but increase it for smaller firms. We also find that large firms that frequently introduce incremental technological improvements are more potent competitors. This study helps us understand how frequent incremental change affects mortality as organizations grow. Advice to managers to engage in continuous incremental innovation can therefore be misguided because unless firms are large, they may incur costs that are so great that the firm actually fails by innovating frequently.","[McKendrick, David G.] Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"McKendrick, DG (通讯作者)，Durham Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",dave.mckendrick@durham.ac.uk,"Wade, James/C-1921-2008",,,,,,73,21,28,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The first differences of the variables are used, but the long-run relationship between the levels of the variables is also taken into account. In this paper the strength of output responses to fiscal policy shocks, their persistence and timing were investigated. Following Blanchard and Perotti (2002), the identification of fiscal policy shocks is achieved by exploiting decision lags in fiscal policy and imposing reasonable restrictions on the revenue and spending elasticity to output. Consistent with the standard macroeconomic theories, it is found that while a positive spending shock increases output, a positive revenue shock decreases it.","Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Çebi, C (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",cem.cebi@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,14,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We distinguish between the hypersensitivity of a domestic market in crisis to news from foreign non-crisis markets, and the contagion imported to a tranquil domestic market from foreign crises. The model also enables us to connect unobserved structural shocks with their source markets using variance decompositions and to compare the size and dynamics of impulses during crises periods with tranquil period impulses. To illustrate, we apply the method to data from the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis which consists of a complicated set of interacting crises. We find significant hypersensitivity and contagion between these markets but also show that links may strengthen or weaken. Impulse response functions for an equally-weighted equity portfolio show the increasing dominance of Korean and Hong Kong shocks during the crises and covariance responses demonstrate multiple layers of contagion effects.

Our findings show that the probability of closure is (cet. par.) significantly lower for exporters, particularly those experiencing export-market entry and exit. Having controlled for other attributes associated with productivity (such as size and export status), the following factors are found to increase the firm's survival prospects: higher capital intensity and TFP, foreign ownership, young age, displacement effects (through relatively high rates of entry of firms in each industry), and belonging to certain industries. Interestingly, increased import penetration (a proxy for lower trade costs) leads to a lower hazard rate for exporting entrants and continuous exporters, while inducing a higher hazard rate for domestic producers or those that quit exporting.","[Harris, Richard I.

Our approach to computing equilibria is based on Rosen's (1974) bid function. it has four desirable features: (i) convergence implies a hedonic equilibrium; (ii) convergence is guaranteed if a hedonic equilibrium exists; (iii) it can solve for a new equilibrium following a shock to the market; and (iv) if multiple equilibria exist, it can identify them. The algorithm is applied to micro data from San Joaquin County, California, where the choice of a home provides access to public schools in particular school districts. First we calibrate the algorithm to approximately reproduce actual housing prices in San Joaquin County as a hedonic equilibrium. Then we introduce a policy that improves school quality in selected school districts. We find that there are several possibilities for the new equilibrium. For each of these potential equilibria, we compare the marginal willingness to pay for school quality with the rate at which the improvement is capitalized into property values. The resulting capitalization rates differ substantially from marginal willingness to pay. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We identify two new determinants of a firm's capital structure policy: the liquidity (adverse selection) premium due to investors' anticipated losses to informed trading, and operating efficiency improvement due to information revelation from the firm's security prices. We show that the capital structure decision affects traders' incentives to acquire information and subsequently, the distribution of informed traders across debt and equity claims. When information is less imperative for improving its operating decisions, a firm issues zero or negative debt (i.e., holding excess cash reserves) in order to reduce socially wasteful information acquisition and the liquidity premium associated with it. When information is crucial for a firm's operating decisions, the optimal debt level is one that achieves maximum information revelation at the lowest possible liquidity cost. Our model can explain why many firms consistently hold no debt. It also provides new implications for financial system design and for the relationship among leverage, liquidity premium, profitability, and the cost of information acquisition.","[Chang, Chun] China Europe Int Business Sch, Shanghai 201206, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaoyun] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",China Europe International Business School; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Chang, C (通讯作者)，China Europe Int Business Sch, 699 Hongfeng Rd, Shanghai 201206, Peoples R China.",cchun@ceibs.edu; xiyu@indiana.edu,"Yu, Xiaoyun/GYD-9060-2022",,,,,,44,14,20,3,39,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

However, research on the suitability of a mandatory subordinated debt policy (MSNDP) has focused primarily on the United States. The primary aims of this article, therefore, are to examine the market for subordinated debt (SND) issued by UK credit institutions and to assess the suitability of introducing an MSNDP into UK banking regulation. A further contribution of this article is that it explores SND issuance and its characteristics at a bank level and, uniquely, considers them in relation to regulatory, structural, and economic events that either are specific to the UK or otherwise affect international banks. The article compares the UK findings with research on SND markets in the United States and Europe and, in so doing, raises concerns over whether an MSNDP for the largest global credit institutions would be feasible. Although the focus of this study is the UK banking industry, the country-focused bank-level approach provides conclusions that might be relevant to other countries considering the implementation of an MSNDP.(JEL G18, G28).","[Hamalainen, Paul] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Howcroft, Barry] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Hall, Maximilian] Univ Loughborough, Dept Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Essex; Loughborough University; Loughborough University,"Hamalainen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",pkhamal@essex.ac.uk; j.b.howcroft@lboro.ac.uk; m.j.hall1@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,6,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1074-3529,,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

The psychological effect has recently been introduced in behavioral models of situations where agents are uncertain about their own willingness-to-pay, while the mechanical effect is well captured by standard auction theory.

We quantify lobbying through the ministerial representation in the council of ministers. We also use several time and state dummies to account for the constituent states' political alignment with the center as well as the coalition and the reform period breaks in the Indian system. Taking panel data that cover 29 years and 14 major states we show that our constructed variables do explain disparity in central fiscal disbursements under the non-formulaic discretionary head in a robust way. Our findings remain true even after we take into account the impact of endogeneity of net state income on the transfers.

The theoretical literature emphasises the existence of a principle of separation between the first policy, which seeks to ensure monetary stability and the other two policies, which are intended to ensure financial stability through the smooth functioning of the interbank money market. This paper shows in particular that a central bank not only has the capacity but indeed must strive to separate the conduct of its monetary policy, which must seek to ensure medium and long-term price stability, from that of its credit policy, which is driven by short-term imperatives and consists in supplying the banking system with liquidity in the event of temporary money demand shocks. During the first part of the crisis, the ECB acted in accordance with the principle of separation. However, it became increasingly difficult to apply as interest rates approached the zero-lower-bound. In effect, the unconventional measures adopted by the ECB created interference between its monetary policy, its credit policy and its interest rate policy.","[Bordes, Christian] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Clerc, Laurent] Banque France, Direct Etud Monetaires & Financieres 41 1403, F-75049 Paris 01, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Bordes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",Christian.Bordes@univ-paris1.fr; laurent.clerc2@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,102,2,2,1,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Job mobility remains considerably lower in Japan than in other advanced economies (particularly the US). Evidence regarding changes in lifetime employment is mixed. The share of workers in the core is declining, but the probability of job separations has remained stable for those who are already in the system.

We also explore channels through which the degree of financial liberalization impacts aggregated total volatility. We document a negative relation to the degree of financial liberalization after controlling for size, liquidity, country. and crisis effects, especially for small and medium-sized markets. Moreover, the degree of financial liberalization transmits its negative impact on aggregated total volatility through aggregated idiosyncratic and local volatilities. Overall, our results provide evidence in favor of the view that the broadening of the investor base due to the increasing degree of financial liberalization causes a reduction in the total volatility of stock returns.

Solid wastes arise from human activities that are normally discarded as useless or unwanted. As the result of rapid increase in production and consumption, urban society rejects and generates solid material regularly which leads to considerable increase in the volume of waste generated from several sources. Solid wastes have the potential to pollute all the vital components of living environment at local and at global levels. In these conditions, proper management of solid waste is a central pillar of far-sighte ]d, sustainable environmental policies. The priority was given to waste minimization, recycle, and reuse followed by the safe disposal of waste to minimize pollution. Inadequate management of municipal waste results in considerable public health hazards and additional costs in both the short and the long term. Therefore the society appeals to solid waste management which brings aspects respecting the optimisation of material flows regarding economic, technical and environmental parameters. The authors aim to highlight some aspects concerning solid waste typology and management, European Union's present policy based on waste hierarchy, Romania's place regarding other member states with respect to waste disposal, recycling, recovery and reuse as well as a good practice set, which may contribute to increasing solid waste recycling rate.","[Plesea, Doru Alexandru; Visan, Smaranda] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Plesea, DA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",plesea_doru@hotmail.com,"PLESEA, DORU ALEXANDRU/AAH-7798-2021","PLESEA, DORU ALEXANDRU/0000-0002-0678-0170",,,,,14,5,6,1,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2010,12.0,27,,,,,228,241,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,558MP,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274747700017,0

Our empirical investigation shows, first, that the proposed risk measure consistently exceeds the benchmark value-at-risk (VaR). Second, jump risk tends to amplify intra-horizon risk. Third, we find large variation in our risk measure across jump models, indicative of model risk. Fourth, among the jump models we consider, the finite-moment log-stable model provides the most conservative risk estimates. Fifth, imposing more stringent VaR levels accentuates the impact of intra-horizon risk in jump models. Finally, using an alternative benchmark VaR does not dilute the role of intra-horizon risk. Overall, we contribute by showing that ignoring intra-horizon risk can lead to underestimation of risk exposures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the model, while all countries suffer from the same environmental damage as a result of total global emissions, non-signatory countries decide on their emission levels by maximizing their own welfare, whereas signatory countries decide on their emission levels by maximizing the aggregate welfare of all signatory countries. It is assumed that signatory countries will be able to punish non-signatories, at some cost to themselves. When countries decide on their pollution emissions, they account for the evolution of the stock of pollution over time. Moreover, we propose amechanism to describe how countries reach a stable IEA.

It also captures situations where all countries participate in a stable agreement, and situations where no stable agreement is feasible.

Moreover, the Schengen area has also been expanded to include 25 European countries (22 EU Member States). A first evaluation shows that the new member countries have already been able to benefit noticeably from their participation in the single market (SM), despite being not yet fully integrated labour markets. However, the international financial crisis also shadows onto the economies of the new Member States. After an ex post evaluation, the possible future integration effects of EU's 2007 enlargement by Bulgaria and Romania are simulated with a simple macro-economic integration model able to encompass as many of the theoretically predicted integration effects as possible. The direct integration effects of Bulgaria and Romania spill-over to the old Member States, including Austria and the ten new Member States of the 2004 EU enlargement. The pattern of the integration effects is qualitatively similar to those of EU's 2004 enlargement by ten new Member States. Bulgaria and Romania gain much more from EU accession than the incumbents, in the proportion of 20:1. In the medium-run up to 2020, Bulgaria and Romania can expect a sizable overall integration gain, amounting to an additional 1/2% point real GDP growth per annum. Among the incumbent EU Member States, Austria will gain somewhat more (+0.05%) than the average of EU-15 (+0.02%) and the ten new EU Member States (+0.01%), which joined the EU in 2004.","[Breuss, Fritz] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,,,,,,,,,44,3,3,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,221,248,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_12,0.0,,,28,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000012,0

Housing is considered as a 'wobbly pillar under the welfare state' (Togersen,1987). The importance of housing compared to other pillars led to a concept of 'sector regime' that composes the Welfare Regime (Kemeny,2006). However, the role of housing does not fit into the frame of welfare regime in 'Developmental States' ( Woo-Cummings, 1999; Johnson, 1982) of East Asia,. The different role of housing in their context shows the relative independency of housing system from either welfare regime or developmental state theories. The mode of social production and distribution of housing is decided in between various levels of state apparatus and numerous actors in different spatial and social positions. This indicates that housing can be dealt with in Production Regime and Urban (Politics) Regime theories. I therefore take these regime theories into account to analyze the independent role of housing. This paper aims to develop a concept of a Housing Regime, that can be applicable not only to welfare state but to other cases as well. I start from the merits of 'welfare regime' and supplement other features of the two regime theories mentioned above. I suggest the definition, components and mechanism of the Housing Regime which distinguishes itself from other regime theories. I demonstrate the criteria of Housing Regime for characterizing the cases in comparative housing research, which I start from the case in South Korean Housing Regime.","[Choe, KyungHo] Delft Univ Technol, OTB Res Inst Built Environm, NL-2600 AA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,,,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,0,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,61,84,,,,,,24,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400005,0

Neo-Austrian economists claim that economic development is caused by entrepreneurial discovery. New institutional economists argue that structure of incentives determined by the institutional environment provides a guideline for entrepreneurial decision-making. Hence, an institutional environment that rewards rent-seeking does not provide opportunities for economic development. In this paper we offer a comparison of these approaches to show that both entrepreneurial discovery and institutional environment are closely related. Moreover, with the comparison we demonstrate that entrepreneurial decision-making plays more important role in economic development when an institutional change is taken into account.","[Grochova, Ladislava] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, CZ-61300 Brno, Czech Republic; [Otahal, Tomas] NEWTON Coll, AS, Dept Econ, CZ-61300 Brno, Czech Republic; [Otahal, Tomas] Mendel Univ Brno, CZ-61300 Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Grochová, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, CZ-61300 Brno, Czech Republic.",ladislava.grochova@mendelu.cz; tomas.otahal@newtoncollege.cz,"Issever Grochova, Ladislava/E-6841-2013; Otáhal, Tomáš/AAJ-4174-2020","Issever Grochova, Ladislava/0000-0002-9983-4077",,,,,39,7,8,1,19,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Re-opened in 1977 after two decades of inactivity, the stock exchange made little contribution to Indonesia's development until a series of reform and deregulation measures were implemented from December 1987. This study examines the evolving role of the stock market in the financial system, and analyses changes in its efficiency over time. We find that stock market activity grew markedly in importance relative to banking after the reforms began to take effect, gaining the ascendancy in 2004 and moving well ahead subsequently. One contributor to this success is improvement in efficiency. Using two simple technical trading rules, we demonstrate that the stock exchange secondary market has indeed become significantly more efficient over time.","[Kung, James J.] Ming Chuan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Carverhill, Andrew P.] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [McLeod, Ross H.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Ming Chuan University; University of Hong Kong; Australian National University,"Kung, JJ (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,22,5,5,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In this paper, we reanalyze the same data on firearm deaths used in previous research, using tests for unknown structural breaks as a means to identifying impacts of the NFA.

The authors provide the time series of such indicators for selected OECD countries, critically examine the past research studies evaluating pre-crisis house price development and argue that house price falls present in many developed countries are more the causes than the consequences of mortgage crisis. The change in house price trends in 2007 in many developed countries could be thus interpreted as the result of the previous record house price growth, often labeled as a price bubble. In view of this hypothesis the authors try to assess the sustainability of house price development in the Czech Republic, using several indicators, error correction models and different data sources. The Methods for construction of reliable house price indices are also discussed here. The results show that house prices in the Czech Republic could be above their equilibrium levels at the end of 2007 but this deviation was far lower than in countries like UK, Spain, Netherlands or Ireland.","[Lux, Martin; Sunega, Petr] Sociol Ustav AV CR, Vvi, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Lux, M (通讯作者)，Sociol Ustav AV CR, Vvi, Jilska 1, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",martin.lux@soc.cas.cz; petr.sunega@soc.cas.cz,"Sunega, Petr/B-9288-2014; Lux, Martin/B-8177-2014","Sunega, Petr/0000-0001-9918-0731; Lux, Martin/0000-0003-4703-3443",,,,,26,5,5,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We analyzed 662 agricultural companies during period 2000 - 2008. We divided the companies according to the regions on the companies operate in the less favoured areas (LFA) and productive areas (PROD). For the debt evaluation we used the indicators of financial analysis ex post - debt indicators. The data were gained from the Information Sheets of Ministry of Agriculture SR which were prepared by The Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics. The followed companies make accounting account in the system of the double entry bookkeeping. The information from the financial reports (balance sheet and income sheet) is not enough to show us the frame of financial health of the enterprise. It is needed to elaborate and quantify the indicators of financial analysis which are specialized on the evaluation of present and past aspect and for the prediction of financial health to the future. The structure of own and foreign sources influences the financial stability of the company. The higher share of the equity indicates higher financial independence and stability of the company. It is desirable that enterprises should be into debt, because the foreign capital is cheaper than equity. The agricultural companies in the Slovak Republic had problems with utilizing of the credits because they were not solvent clients for banks. After the entrance of the Slovak Republic to the European Union the situation got better because of assert Common Agricultural Policy. In the presence the agricultural companies are supported by subsidies and subventions particularly from the EU. In the LFAs there is generally lower production costs and returns than in the PROD areas because of the more extensive production. The adverse economic results in the LFAs have been compensated through the system of LFA subsidies.","[Miklovicova, Silvia; Miklovicova, Jana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Magement, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Miklovicová, S (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Magement, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",silvia.miklovicova@fem.uniag.sk; jana.miklovicova@fem.uniag.sk,/E-5522-2019,/0000-0003-1065-4721,,,,,8,1,2,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,117,123,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600014,0

By applying the method Strategic Management of Agro-Systems (GESIS), developed by the first author, Professor Marcos Fava Neves, coordinator of the Marketing & Strategic Projects and Research Center, USP (MARKESTRAT), it was found that the sugarcane sector GDP is around $28.1 billion USD, equivalent to almost 2% of the Brazilian GDP-or almost all of the income generated in a year in a country like Uruguay. The majority of the industry's inputs are local, explaining its favorable trade balance situation.

A possible explanation for the tendency of commercial banks to overstate their VaR is that they incompletely account for the diversification effect among broad risk categories (e.g., equity, interest rate, commodity, credit spread, and foreign exchange). By underestimating the diversification effect, bank's proprietary VaR models produce overly prudent market risk assessments. In this paper, we examine empirically the validity of this hypothesis using actual VaR data from major US commercial banks. In contrast to the VaR diversification hypothesis, we find that US banks show no sign of systematic underestimation of the diversification effect. In particular, diversification effects used by banks is very close to (and quite often larger than) our empirical diversification estimates. A direct implication of this finding is that individual VaRs for each broad risk category, just like aggregate VaRs, are biased risk assessments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Outside assistance can change a besieged government's posture, thereby removing the GTO's delegation advantage.

The estimates show that an economy with a robust system to control corruption, an effective government, and a stable political system will create the conditions to promote economic growth, minimise income distribution conflicts, and reduce poverty. Corruption, ineffective governments, and political instability will not only hurt income levels through market inefficiencies, but also escalate poverty incidence via increased income inequality. The results also imply that the quality of the regulatory system, rule of law, voice and accountability, and expropriation risk are inversely related to poverty but their effect on poverty is via average income rather than income distribution.","[Tebaldi, Edinaldo; Mohan, Ramesh] Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA",Bryant University,"Tebaldi, E (通讯作者)，Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, 1150 Douglas Pike, Smithfield, RI 02917 USA.",etebaldi@bryant.edu,"Tebaldi, Edinaldo/D-6065-2019","Tebaldi, Edinaldo/0000-0003-3670-3245",,,,,56,82,88,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The lack of empirical support for the liquidity effect using monthly and quarterly monetary and reserve aggregates data led Hamilton (1997) to suggest that more convincing evidence of the liquidity effect could be obtained with daily data-the daily liquidity effect. This paper investigates the implications of the daily liquidity effect for Friedman's liquidity effect using a more comprehensive model of the Federal Reserve's daily operating procedure than has been previously used in the literature. The evidence indicates that it is no easier to find convincing evidence of a Friedman liquidity effect using daily data than it has been with lower-frequency monthly and quarterly data.,"Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Thornton, DL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA.",,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,4,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Certain empirical studies consider car ownership as the dependent variable explained by the built environment, whereas other Studies deem it to be one of the independent variables explaining car travel behaviour. This paper takes note of the dual influence car ownership has in explaining car travel behaviour by assuming that car ownership mediates the relationship between the built environment and Car use.

Many studies directly estimate the DR news but back out the CF news as the residual. We argue that this approach has a serious limitation because the DR news cannot be accurately measured due to the small predictive power, and the CF news, as the residual, inherits the large misspecification error of the DR news. We apply this residual-based decomposition approach to Treasury bonds and equities and find results that are either counterintuitive or unrobust.

Migrants may face binding asymmetric information constraints as they often lack collateral. Social networks can help mitigate these constraints. Conversely, migrants might face higher liquidity constraints and might, therefore, demand more credit than nonmigrants. The effect of migration on participation in the credit market is thus ambiguous. Compounding this, migration and credit may be jointly determined. We utilize rich data from Peru to establish the net effect of migration on credit and the role that social networks play in this relationship.","[Laszlo, Sonia] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Santor, Eric] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",McGill University; Bank of Canada,"Laszlo, S (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,24,9,10,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

In particular, we use threshold regression techniques to determine whether the impact of IPR protection on trade depends upon the level of development, imitative ability and market size of the importing country. We confirm the importance of the importers' imitative ability, and also find some evidence of a role for market size in this relationship.

Despite its attractive design, that model has not been adopted widely in the literature, most likely due to the difficulty encountered in its implementation. The main contribution of this paper is to illustrate that this factor MSV model can be implemented easily and with only a few modifications. Specifically, I develop a sequential testing procedure that can account simultaneously for a series of nested hypotheses and structure properly the moment conditions used for estimation. A simulation study suggests that the factor MSV model and estimation strategy presented here is able to recover accurately the number of, and dynamics for, the latent factors that drive the conditional volatility of returns.","Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Aguilar, M (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, 06A Gardner Hall,CB 3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",maguilar@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,26,1,1,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Between 1985 and 1991,30 states in the U.S. enacted business combination (BC) laws, raising the cost of corporate takeovers. Relying on these exogenous events, we estimate the influence of the market for corporate control on the cost of debt. We identify different channels through which an open market for corporate control can benefit or harm bondholders: a reduction in managerial slack or the quiet life, resulting in higher profitability and firm value; a coinsurance effect, in which firms become less risky after being acquired; and an increasing leverage effect, in which bond holder wealth is expropriated through leverage-increasing takeovers. Consistent with the first two mechanisms, we find that the cost of debt rose after the passage of the BC laws; moreover, it rose sharply for firms in non-competitive industries, and for firms rated speculative-grade. In contrast, there is virtually no effect for firms in competitive industries, or firms rated investment-grade. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper models a manager's portfolio choice for compensation rules that can be either a concave, linear, or convex function of the fund's performance relative to that of a benchmark. For particular compensation Structures, a manager increases the fund's tracking error volatility as its relative performance declines. However, declining performance does not necessarily lead the manager to raise the volatility of the fund's return. The paper presents nonparametric and parametric tests of the relation between mutual fund performance and risk taking for more than 6,000 equity mutual funds over the 1962 to 2006 period. There is a tendency for mutual funds to increase the standard deviation of tracking errors, but not the standard deviation of returns, as their performance declines. This risk-shifting behavior appears more common for funds whose managers have longer tenures.","[Chen, Hsiu-lang] Univ Illinois, Coll Business Adm, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Pennacchi, George G.] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Chen, HL (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Business Adm, 601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",hsiulang@uic.edu; gpennacc@illinois.edu,,,,,,,30,57,78,2,34,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

In this paper we argue that, although it may be rational for a family to let the mother take the main part of the parental leave, the division is too skewed towards the mother even from the family's own perspective. The reason for this inefficiency is that parents have present-biased preferences, which make them place too much weight on the immediate utility effects of childcare. Time-consistent welfare can therefore be improved by increasing fathers' share of the family's parental leave time. In the light of recent regulations in the parental leave system in many countries, we argue that provision of commitment devices is more preferable than regulation when preferences are heterogeneous or uncertain.

According to recent academic work, private enforcement of investor protection via both disclosure and private liability rules goes hand in hand with financial market development, but public enforcement fails to correlate with financial development and, hence, is unlikely to facilitate it. Our results confirm the disclosure result but reverse the results on both liability standards and public enforcement. We use securities regulators' resources to proxy for regulatory intensity of the securities regulator. When we do, financial depth regularly, significantly, and robustly correlates with stronger public enforcement. In horse races between these resource-based measures of public enforcement intensity and the most common measures of private enforcement, public enforcement is overall as important as disclosure in explaining financial market outcomes around the world and more important than private liability rules. Hence, policymakers who reject public enforcement as useful for financial market development are ignoring the best currently available evidence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To recover this fishing stock, pressure needs to be reduced. This implies that catch compositions with small amounts of cod are preferred by public policy makers.

A conservative non-parametric frontier technology approach imposing minimal assumptions and based on directional distance functions is applied to explore alternative fishing activities for Danish gill netters operating in the North Sea with the goal of reducing cod catches. Since performance on different fishing trips may be influenced by the operating environment, a four-stage approach is applied to correct for exogenous factors (Fried et al., J Product Anal 12(3):249-267, 1999).

Structuring induces the firm's owner to optimally choose the first best operating strategy even though the owner's value function might be locally convex (concave), which would ordinarily lead to overinvestment (underinvestment) in risky projects. This result is demonstrated in two different continuous time settings-one that is based on the risk-shifting framework of Leland (1998) and one that generalizes the scaled return model of Green (1984). It is shown that the contractual nature of the structuring is a key determinant of the issuing firm's dynamic asset volatility. Furthermore, unlike nonstructured financing, the default (conversion) probability of a structured debt security may be increasing (decreasing) in the firm's total assets. Structured securities are therefore hedge assets, which potentially explains the popularity of structured securities among investors and third-party issuers.","Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Vanden, JM (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, 341 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jmv13@psu.edu,,,,,,,54,5,5,1,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Using a broad sample of almost 70,000 US public and private firms, I test the arguments by estimating conditional logistic regressions using as dependent variables two dimensions of organizational structural differentiation: the number of formal subunits and hierarchical levels. The findings show that public firms are more likely to elaborate structurally, but less likely to simplify their structural differentiation. As organizations grow/decline in size, they apparently tend to increase/decrease their degree of structural differentiation. However, for a given change in size, the level of structural differentiation is less likely to increase during growth than it is to decrease during decline, indicating an asymmetric pattern. I also find that organizational size can serve as a facilitator or inhibitor for structural change, depending on the direction of change. Finally, I find that the asymmetric pattern of growth and decline works differently for large and small firms. The same proportional increase in size is more likely to generate structural differentiation for larger firms than for smaller firms. But the same proportional decrease in size has a smaller likelihood of causing structural de-differentiation for larger firms than for smaller firms.","San Francisco State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Int Business, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Wang, LH (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Int Business, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",lihua@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,85,7,11,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

A household's currently observed poverty status might therefore not be a good indicator of the household's general vulnerability to poverty. In the recent years, there has been an emerging literature on the concept and empirical analysis of vulnerability. But because of strong data requirements for vulnerability analysis and limited availability of panel and shock data for developing countries, static poverty analysis still dominates empirical vulnerability studies. In this paper, we propose a simple method to empirically assess the impact of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks on households' vulnerability, which can be applied in a wide context as it relies on more commonly available cross-sectional or short panel data. We empirically illustrate our approach for Madagascar. We show that covariate shocks have a relatively higher impact on rural households, whereas idiosyncratic shocks have a relatively higher impact on urban households' vulnerability.

Using an overlapping generations model with a small open economy, we explain why this result modifies the redistributive properties of unfunded pension systems. We use the concept of net contribution to measure the redistributivity of pension systems. We show that pure Beveridgian pension systems remain redistributive. However, the poorest do not necessarily benefit the most from pension systems. For pure Bismarckian pension systems, net contributions are regressive. For mixed pension systems, it is possible to redistribute collected resources in favor of the ends of the distribution of wages.","Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ CES, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Hachon, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",Christophe.Hachon@malix.univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using original data from Vietnam and Russia, we find evidence that discount rates do change over time for many individuals, implying that preferences for savings and credit might not be intertemporally consistent. We find that commonly held beliefs about gender and age influences do not hold once having children and location are controlled for. Within countries, however, residency does matter. Rural Vietnamese populations have higher discount rates, and living in a Russian trading town is associated with significantly higher discount rates and present bias than living in a government town. We argue that these behaviors are particularly likely to influence resource allocation in developing economies because there are fewer formal institutions and competitive markets to temper their effects.","[Anderson, C.

On the other hand, economic integration does influence women's professional lives. In developing countries, trade openness increases female labor force participation; in industrialized states, it decreases the share of working women.

This allows us to perform a growth decomposition exercise where the change in world manufacturing emissions is decomposed into scale, composition and technique effects. The sample covers the period 1990-2000, and includes 62 countries that account for 76% of world-wide emissions. While manufacturing activity has increased by a rough 10% (scale effect), we estimate that emissions have fallen by about 10%, thanks to the adoption of cleaner production techniques (the technique effect) and a small shift towards cleaner industries (between-sector effect). As output and productivity gains have been biased towards large emerging countries like China and India, which are both clean in terms of emissions per unit labor and dirty in terms of emissions per dollar, the sign and magnitude of the between-country effect depends on the choice regarding the scaling factor ( - 2% for employment, + 25% for value-added, with a corresponding adjustment of the technique effect). The paper also shows that these estimates are robust to changes in aggregation across entities (regions or countries) and across industries, and that composition changes are correlated with changes in prices and trade intensities.","[Grether, Jean-Marie; Mathys, Nicole A.] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Mathys, Nicole A.] Swiss Fed Off Energy, Bern, Switzerland; [de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, CERDI, Geneva, Switzerland; [de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel; University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Grether, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Pierre A Mazel 7, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",jean-marie.grether@unine.ch,,"Mathys, Nicole/0000-0002-4981-0333; Grether, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-2601-3585",,,,,13,25,28,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We study two possible credit allocation regimes: one where credits are allocated according to the actual amount of carbon sequestered by the trees on a piece of land and another where credits are allocated according to the long-run potential to sequester carbon on the land. Using a real options model with uncertain future timber prices, we examine the effect on the timing of harvests and the replanting-abandonment decision. We show that both schemes discourage deforestation. Compensating growers for actual carbon sequestration leads to longer rotation periods between harvests, while basing compensation only on the long-run potential level of sequestration induces shorter rotation periods. The former scheme leads to greater benefits of carbon sequestration at lower cost than the latter scheme. Although inducing moderate levels of sequestration is expensive under both schemes, the cost falls dramatically when the level of payments climbs above some threshold. Indeed, providing the payments are sufficiently generous, carbon credit payment schemes offer an effective means of increasing carbon sequestration.","[Guthrie, Graeme] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand; [Kumareswaran, Dinesh] New Zealand Commerce Commiss, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Guthrie, G (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",graeme.guthrie@vuw.ac.nz,,"Guthrie, Graeme/0000-0002-8497-0148",,,,,30,40,50,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It is found that the degree of capital market integration has increased after the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The overall evidence suggests that the crisis has substantially changed the nature of the short run interactions among the real interest rates.

Cross-listed firms with dual-class shares exhibit a permanent increase in valuation regardless of the level of U.S. investor holdings, consistent with firm-level bonding.","[King, Michael R.] Bank Canada, Int Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Segal, Dan] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",Bank of Canada; University of Toronto,"King, MR (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Dept, 234 Wellington, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",mking@bankofcanada.ca,"SEGAL, Dan/F-9099-2013; Segal, Dan/ABG-6589-2020","Govindan, Sumita/0000-0002-8325-1205; King, Michael/0000-0002-4672-347X",,,,,47,78,97,2,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

This pattern cannot be generated by standard models that emphasize storage. We develop an equilibrium model of oil production in which investment is irreversible and capacity constrained. Investment constraints affect firms' investment decisions and imply that the supply elasticity changes over time. Since demand shocks must be absorbed by changes in prices or changes in supply, time-varying supply elasticity results in time-varying volatility of futures prices. Estimating this model, we show it is quantitatively consistent with the V-shape relationship between the volatility of futures prices and the slope of the forward curve.","[Kogan, Leonid] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kogan, Leonid; Yaron, Amir] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Livdan, Dmitry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yaron, Amir] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Pennsylvania,"Kogan, L (通讯作者)，MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Livdan, Dmitry/F-8079-2016","Livdan, Dmitry/0000-0001-7014-8754",,,,,30,51,63,4,36,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-1082,,,J FINANC,J.

The model identifies four key factors that jointly influence an industrys pricecost margin: (i) the intensity of strategic investment (e.g. R&D and advertising), (ii) the skewness of the distribution of market share or market concentration, (iii) the appropriability of strategic investment, and (iv) the extent to which firms market shares are determined by the intensity of their strategic investment. These factors are expected to be positively related to industry profitability, and our empirical analysis provides supportive evidence. The model also suggests that the conventional, single-dimensional hypotheses on profitabilitythe market-power (or market-structure) hypothesis and the efficiency hypothesisare overly simplified. More importantly, existing empirical results allegedly supporting each of these hypotheses are spurious to the extent that the distribution of firm-specific strategic competence reflects firm heterogeneity in efficiency and, at the same time, underlies the distribution of market share or market concentration.","[Lee, Chang-Yang] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Mahmood, Ishtiaq P.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Business Policy, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 119260, Singapore",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); National University of Singapore,"Lee, CY (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, 207-43 Cheongryangri, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",drcylee@business.kaist.ac.kr; bizipm@nus.edu.sg,"Mahmood, Ishtiaq P/B-5078-2016; Lee, Chang-Yang/C-1629-2011",,,,,,52,12,15,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Standard testing procedures are generally inappropriate because regime persistence causes a spurious regression problem - a problem that has led to incorrect inference in a broad range of studies involving regimes representing political, business, and seasonal cycles. The paper outlines analytically how standard estimators can be adjusted for regime dummy variable persistence. While the adjustments are helpful asymptotically, spurious regression remains a problem in small samples and must be addressed using simulation or bootstrap procedures. We provide a simulation procedure for testing hypotheses in situations where an independent variable in a time-series regression is a persistent regime dummy variable.

Combining the international experience in this field with national specificities, a set of indicators is proposed, this paper, that may lead to a national certification system of ecotouristic services within a local community.

This paper shows that when firms also have an investment choice, leverage can lead to weaker product market competition in a limited liability model. In addition, non-zero leverage is still optimal within this model based solely on the limited liability effect. In predatory models debt is motivated by issues outside of product market concerns, for example to solve an agency problem.

This paper studies the relationships between transport costs, industry location, and welfare when freight rates are set by profit-maximizing carriers. We show that the demand for transport services becomes less elastic as the degree of spatial agglomeration rises, which increases carriers' market power and allows them to charge higher markups, Once it is recognized that firms and consumers are free to relocate in response to changes in transport costs, an increasing number of carriers, falling fixed or marginal costs in transportation, or both, trigger a gradual agglomeration of industry. In the long run, this leads to consumer welfare losses (and to aggregate welfare losses under free entry), with more inequality across agents living in different regions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is still discussion about what constitutes global excess liquidity and how exactly it shapes the policy environment. Our approach adjusts liquidity for a longer-term interest rate and output effects and focuses on US and Japanese liquidity as relevant proxies for global developments from a euro area perspective. We find that, in particular, excess liquidity in the US tends to lead developments in euro area liquidity. US excess liquidity is also consistently positive as a determinant of euro area inflation and is shown to be Granger-causal for euro area inflation in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise. There is some evidence that, at least in part, this result seems to be related to a weakening of the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area interest during times of excessive US liquidity.

Survey results confirm earlier findings that there is a higher incidence, amongst full-time paid employees, of part-day homeworking than whole-day homeworking. The paper then separately examines determinants of the desire to part-day homework and whole-day homework and determinants of the reported frequency of part-day homeworking and whole-day homeworking. The determinants considered are socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and belief statements relating to homeworking. Four statements are found to be relevant to desire to part-day and to whole-day homework: avoiding interruptions at work; avoiding wasted time in traffic; other household members appreciating the employee homeworking: and working longer hours. A similar comparison concerning actual frequency of homeworking finds that employer support is relevant for both homeworking practices, with part-day homeworking being associated with avoiding interruptions at work and whole-day homeworking frequency also being associated with commute struggle. For both forms of working practice. the belief statements are better able to explain desire to homework (more) than to explain frequency of homeworking. This is perhaps not surprising given the variability of work patterns at the level of the individual that can occur from week-to-week. The better performance of desire models for whole-day homeworking compared to those for part-day homeworking suggest that other factors are at play that remain to be identified in future examination of part-day homeworking.

A simple model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information. Journal of Finance 42, 483-510] shows that stocks about which not all investors are informed should yield a return premium. This premium depends on the shadow cost of incomplete information which in turn depends on the shareholder base, relative market size, and idiosyncratic risk. Utilizing a comprehensive database of Swedish shareholdings, we demonstrate that stock returns are positively related to the shadow cost. We also find that the shareholder base is negatively related to returns when controlling for size and idiosyncratic risk.

There are two drawbacks to the prominent approaches that focus either on the global sample, or on developing nations. First, it is unclear whether the identified institutions also hold explanatory power in advanced countries. Second, it is unclear whether the identified institutions matter to the same degree across all countries, or whether perhaps an altogether different set of institutions matters in advanced countries. To address these issues, we examine parameter heterogeneity in prominent approaches to institutions and economic performance. We find that parameter heterogeneity is so strong that it requires a new set of instruments to control for endogeneity. At the same time, however, we confirm that a common set of economically important institutions does exist among advanced and developing nations. The impact of these institutions is shown to vary substantially across subsamples; they are about three times more important in developing countries than in OECD countries.","[Eicher, Theo S.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Leukert, Andreas] UBS AG, CH-8002 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Eicher, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",te@u.washington.edu; andreas.leukert@ubs.com,"Eicher, Theo/HZL-8034-2023",,,,,,30,44,50,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The Tijuana River is the empirical setting of water flow from south (Mexico) to north (US) where pollution stock accumulates. Asymmetry between the upstream and downstream countries for costs, damages, and emissions influences incentives to abate pollution. Cost minimization is achieved as the US can finance pollution abatement in Mexico. Game sharing rules (Shapley value, Chander-Tulkens rule, Helsinki rule, egalitarian rule) are analyzed. Financial transfers from two North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) institutions are examined. In most cases of cooperation, transfer payments are positive from downstream to upstream for reductions in flow and stock of pollution.

WAS can be used for infrastructure or policy planning, but it can also assist in the resolution of water disputes. Indeed, WAS-guided cooperation in water can turn what appears to be a zero-sum gain into a win-win situation. It is shown that if WAS sets the rules for cooperation, then, when all claimants use those rules, the coalition of all of them together is stable. Results for possible coalitions of Israel, Jordan, and Palestine are given for varying assumptions as to water ownership. The gains from cooperation are compared and analyzed.

The overall effectiveness of this program at achieving emissions reductions and its low regulatory costs have earned it a good reputation around the world. PROPER had no deterrents or incentives other than those that arose indirectly from publicly disclosing information about the environmental performances of firms. We analyzed plant-level data to relate short- and longer-term environmental responses to facility characteristics. The results revealed that foreign-owned firms were consistently more likely to respond to the environmental rating scheme, compared to private domestic firms. This is a clear and important insight with consequences for a number of issues, such as understanding the pollution haven debate. Also, firms located in densely populated regions, particularly in Java, responded more positively to the public disclosure of PROPER ratings. The main observed effect was however given by the initial level of environmental performance of firms. Those firms that had bad environmental performance records felt pressure to improve, but if the initial abatement steps had already been taken, the incentives to improve further appeared to diminish.","[Garcia, Jorge H.; Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Afsah, Shakeb] Performeks LLC, Bethesda, MD USA; [Sterner, Thomas] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA",University of Gothenburg; Resources for the Future,"Sterner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, POB 640,Vagatan 1,E Bldg,5th Floor, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",thomas.sterner@economics.gu.se,"Sterner, Thomas/AGZ-2537-2022",,,,,,33,28,31,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

There was a significant growth in the number of government companies in India that effectively crowded out the entry and growth of private enterprise. This took place from the mid to late 1950s to the late 1980s and early 1990s. Correspondingly, the amount of private equity capital invested in firms declined until the late 1980s and early 1990s when there was an upsurge of private investment activity. Another feature was that a small number of government companies absorbed most of the corporate sector equity investment in India. The growth in the share of government companies in India that crowded out the entry and growth of private enterprises has had a significantly negative effect on Indias industrial competitiveness. After the introduction of reforms in 1991, there has been a significant crowding in by private enterprises, displacing the government companies from their key position as holders of a very large portion of equity capital, and also reversing the trend in the decline of competitiveness of Indian industry as a whole.","Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Majumdar, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",majumdar@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,58,8,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Under passive fiscal policies lump-sum taxes generate nominal indeterminacy, while with distortionary taxes indeterminacy can be real, but not purely nominal. In general, under distortionary taxation uniqueness of the equilibrium allocation depends on monetary and fiscal policy interactions through taxes, debt, and interest rates. To illustrate this principle, we consider balanced-budget policies under distortionary income taxation and show that a unique equilibrium allocation prevails if interest rates are set consistent with long-run deflation.

Knowledge created endogenously results in knowledge spillovers, which allow entrepreneurs to identify and exploit opportunities.","[Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Royal Inst Technol, Dept Transport & Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IL USA; [Carlsson, Bo] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Econ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH USA",George Mason University; Royal Institute of Technology; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Acs, ZJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",zacs@gmu.edu; pontusb@infra.kts.se; daudrets@indiana.edu; Bo.Carlsson@case.edu,"Lehmann, Erik E./AAB-4787-2022; DEL RÍO, MIGUEL ÁNGEL MONTAÑÉS/F-2359-2013; acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013","Lehmann, Erik E./0000-0002-4108-7523; braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924; Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762",,,,,49,1104,1253,72,609,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Particularly, the conventional regression model, the error correction model (ECM) and the GARCH model are employed in the study considering hedging performance. The hedging effectiveness of each model is determined by variance reduction of returns for in-sample and out-of-sample horizons. The results imply that, the hedge ratio obtained from the GARCH model achieves minimum portfolio variance by outperforming other model's estimates in both horizons.

Besides these traditional obligations, new and complex obligations have been regulated for traders, obligations that are specific to the traders-consumers relation. These regulations are subordinated to the Consumer Law domain, which in Romania represents a contemporary creation, a result of the process of transposing the communautaire acquis. Consumer protection is regulated by general and specific rules, the latter ones referring to the following sub domains: advertising; informing about the prices of the products offered to the consumers for sale; unfair clauses from the contracts concluded between the traders and the consumers; the contracts negotiated away from business premises; concluding and executing distant contracts related to financial services; consumer credit; packages of tourism services; protection of the contracts related to the fight to use some immovable goods for a limited period- timeshare; selling of the products and warranties associated; general safety of the products; responsibility of the producers for the damages generated by the defective products; unfair commercial practices and ways to cease the unlawful practices in respect of the protection of consumers' collective interests. New obligations for the traders are established through the content of both general and specific regulations, obligations that are effected in imperatives and especially in interdictions. The legal regime of the obligations that resulted this way transcend the regime of the traders' traditional obligations, making up the new paradigm of the traders' activity and it represents the theme of this paper. Our research focused on determining the obligations set-up for the traders through both categories of rules and through their legal regime. As a result of the research carried on this theme, we conclude that setting-up this new category of obligations for the traders represents an actual means of achieving the aim of ensuring the consumer protection, adding-up to other legal means set-up in this regard.","[Apan, Rodica Diana] N Univ Baia Mare, Fac Sci, Dept Econ Studies, Baia Mare, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,cab-apan@rdslink.ro,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-061-2,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2009,5.0,,,,,,577,584,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMP23,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000273265800047,0

The research presented in this article was an attempt to assess one of the aspects of a dividend policy dependencies between different categories of financial result in two groups of Polish enterprises of agricultural-foodstuff industry: the first group - companies paying dividends and the second group companies where such payments did not occur in the studied period (years 2001-2006). To meet the aim of the research the following hypothesis was formulated: decisions on dividend payment are taken in companies that achieve higher values of financial result (specified, several categories of financial result were taken into consideration). To proceed with the research the author developed several research tasks involving statistical methods (correlation analysis, test on the mean difference) and comparative descriptive analysis. It was concluded that correlation rates of highest values were observed in dependency between the amount of dividend paid and the level of operating result as well as the level of net financial result. Considerably higher level of the result on sales, operating result, result from ordinary activities before tax and net result was observed in the companies that followed the policy of dividend payment. The results achieved by this group of enterprises showed also smaller amplitude of fluctuations. Results from the test on mean difference revealed that in the whole studied period the result on sales was the factor that was diversifying (in a statistically important way) the compared groups. The net financial result on the contrary turned out to be the factor that diversified the studied groups the rarest in the way that was statistically material.","Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Accountancy Corp Finance & Banking, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Franc-Dabrowska, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Accountancy Corp Finance & Banking, Warsaw, Poland.",justyna_franc_dabrowska@sggw.pl,"Franc-Dabrowska, Justyna/AAF-6904-2020; Franc-Dąbrowska, Justyna/L-7904-2019","Franc-Dabrowska, Justyna/0000-0002-5881-0343;",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-1-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,18,,,,,134,141,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BTX02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288345600018,0

This review provides a broad framework to examine how vulnerabilities can build up and suddenly erupt in a financial crisis, with potentially disastrous feedback effects for sovereign debt and economic growth. Traditional macroeconomic analyses overlook the importance of risk, which makes them ill-suited to examine interconnectedness, risk transmission mechanisms, and contagion. After presenting in overview of the key features of the global 2007-2009 crisis, this review discusses new directions for research on modeling financial crises and sovereign risk, including the need for integrating risk into macroeconomic policy models and enhancing early warning system and financial contagion models through a more comprehensive view of economy-wide risks. Also, new tools to mitigate and control macro risk need to be developed, along with new approaches to,regulate financial sector risk-taking and monitor and manage the interactions between private sector and sovereign risk.","Int Monetary Fund, Monetary & Capital Markets Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Gray, DE (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Monetary & Capital Markets Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dgray@imf.org,,"Gray, Dale/0000-0001-5034-8556",,,,,77,17,20,0,25,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1941-1367,,,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Two pension plans are studied, with opposite results. In a defined contribution plan, an increase in the redistribution levels will delay the preferred legal retirement age. On the other hand, in a defined benefits plan, the same increase in the redistribution levels will lower this preferred age.","[Lacomba, Juan A.; Lagos, Francisco] Univ Granada, Dept Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Lacomba, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jlacomba@ugr.es,"Lagos, Francis/AAT-6192-2020","Lagos Garcia, Francisco Miguel/0000-0003-1945-3272",,,,,15,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Design/methodology/approach- The core analysis of this paper examines how the urban-rural relationship develops especially when urbanization rate reaches a very high level. Through literature review, this paper explores the evolution of urban-rural relationship in developed nations by looking at some international cities in different industrial stages. In parallel, it goes through this relationship in China after 1949 until now. Findings- This paper shows that future urbanization development will be generated largely by rural-urban migration especially the eastern-inclined migration while rural industrialization-lead urbanization would develop at the provincial level. It points that education and training to the labor force is the crucial issue to future urbanization development in China. Originality/value- The obvious value of this paper is to predict, through a historical review and comparison, urban-rural relationship in China of high urbanization level.

The practical experience of the WZLIA in responding to trade friction has special reference to other industrial associations in China while they undergo ongoing trade disputes or encounter trade friction in the future.","[Luan, Xin-jie] China Jiliang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",China Jiliang University,,hzluan@163.com; muyangliangqian@163.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,AMER SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9798471-5-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,593,596,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BNT76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275501800124,0

What are the characteristics of these challenges in developed and developing countries? What is the behavior of countries that are liders and those that are not?

Insurance sector always has its own clear mission: to achieve as high as possible level of spiritual and material safety of the person insured. The vision should be achieving as high as possible level of spiritual and material safety of the person insured in real environment. Mission and vision of the insurance continuously transformed industry from everyday human activity to modem industry. This trend can not be stopped, because we are able to identify more and more risks every day and their identification, processing and management is more challenging. Two components are very important: financial and social. Developed countries formed the insurance industry as powerful and respectful sector that is important part of financial market. Its users are hundreds of millions of citizens and companies. Financial effects of life insurance are much higher that those of non-life. Developing countries has no alternative than to follow, as quickly as they can, the developed countries path. That should make easier building own insurance industry. Globalization, controlled liberalization and all migration movements are additional and unavoidable factors that support insurance challenges. What is the suggestion for small, not enough developed countries as Bosnia and Herzegovina or all countries of ex-Yugoslavia? Basic scientific truths in this field are continuous: probability theory and great numbers law, actuarial calculus based on relevant empiric research. Insurance challenges start with actuarial calculus and data needed. That follows portfolio formulation and investment of temporarily available funds.

However, it is necessary to fulfil several economic conditions and adopt various legal acts both on the level of the EMU and national level. Even if the biggest attention is being paid to the fulfilment of the nominal convergence criteria, legal aspect of the whole process of the Euro conversion is at least as important as economic aspect. This paper seeks to identify economic and legal aspects of joining the European Monetary Union by the means of the Slovak republic case and to generalize the knowledge and suggestions for their applications also in other countries. The aim of the paper is being fulfilled by using the method of abstraction, historical and logical method, comparative method and method of generalization. Slovakia became member of the EMU on the 1st January 2009. Because the real costs and benefits of Slovakia's membership in the EMU will be evident only in the longer period, even more it is necessary to consider also impact of the world financial and economic crises, it is not possible to quantify exactly all the costs and benefits yet.

Although theories of capital structure suggest that corporate tax is an important determinant of capital structure, how exogenous changes of the tax rate affect firms' leverage decisions has not been fully explored. We examine a unique circumstance in which the Chinese government increased the corporate tax rate of firms that had previously received local government tax rebates. The evidence indicates that these firms increased their leverage when the corporate tax rate increased. Further investigation suggests that the adjustment of leverage was mostly driven by firms with a high level of access to bank loans. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, in the moment when we would try to describe the substance of competitive advantage in more detail both from theoretical and practical point of view, we would face some problems. Individual authors have different idea on the understanding of the competitive advantage and its definition. Concordance, yet not absolute, shall remain in the idea of the importance of the advantage against competition. The question is what the root of such contradiction is. One of the reasons upon theoretical level shall be the fact that the term of competitive advantage has become the premise known to everybody and about which it is not necessary to doubt In practice level, the cause of the unclearness is in the variety of companies' behavior, which we always try to include as all-inclusive competitive advantage. Unfortunately, this shall prevent us to note how much individual advantages differ. Maybe not as much as with final consequence of advantage ahead competitor as with the substance which form it. Admittedly this core of the advantage should be the key element of further development of both theory and practice. The concept of success-ability applies this approach in all levels. The paper submits basic theoretical delimitation together with key opening points, and summarized results of research which were used for the establishment of concept. Individual research were focused on company management always in a complex way so as the evaluation of the approaches to the development of competitive advantages in various contexts could be performed. Conclusions of these researches confirmed that the success-ability represents the approach which can be applied not only in the level of research and development of theory, but also in the practical level.","[Zich, Robert] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Econ, Brno 63800, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,zich@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-523-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,432,443,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BMK17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272657000048,0

Empirical studies demonstrate that rents from natural resources, and in particular oil, are an important source of civil war. Allegedly, resource rents attract rent-seekers, which destabilize society. However, there is a large literature on how so-called rentier states manage to pacify opposition groups by handing out special favors. The present paper attempts to bridge the gap between the rent-seeking view of resource rents as a source of conflict and the rentier state view which emphasizes the role of resource rents in promoting peace and stability. The mechanism that we highlight relies on the notion that higher rents may activate more interest groups in a power struggle. We demonstrate that the associated increased cost of conflict may in fact promote regime stability. The peaceful solution is upheld by a self reinforcing transfer program, in the form of patronage employment. The chance of conflict and rent dissipation in our model is highest for intermediate levels of resource rents, where the government cannot make credible commitments to the opposition groups.

First, we show that in western European countries the classical economic argument of opportunity cost is confirmed. That is, the larger is the set of current economic opportunities for individuals the lower is the likelihood or the willingness for them to be involved in a terrorist activity. Second, expected future economic growth seems to be associated with an increase in current terrorist activities. Eventually, our results also show that terrorist brutality (measured in people killed) is positively associated with real GDP per capita. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Roemer that contains not only errors of interpretation of what others have written, but also misunderstandings of settled matters. I respond and reply to Roemer by re-exploring the foundations of intergenerational welfare economics. I show that ethical pluralism gives rise to a very different framework for thinking about the subject than the one Roemer presents in his paper. Moreover, his dismissal of much of what welfare economists write on such concepts as social discount rates has as its source an utterly narrow view of the contexts in which economic evaluation is undertaken in the contemporary world.","[Dasgupta, Partha] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Dasgupta, Partha] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Cambridge; University of Manchester,"Dasgupta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",partha.dasgupta@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,"Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1134890] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,54,17,19,3,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Estimating a Markov-switching model by the Bayesian method, we find the following: First, the Japanese data clearly reject the view that the fiscal policy regime is fixed, i.e., that the Japanese government adopted a Ricardian or a non-Ricardian regime throughout the entire period. Instead, our results indicate a stochastic switch of the debt-GDP ratio between stationary and nonstationary processes, and thus a stochastic switch between Ricardian and non-Ricardian regimes. Second, our simulation exercises using the estimated parameters and transition probabilities do not necessarily reject the possibility that the debt-GDP ratio may be nonstationary even in the long run (i.e., globally nonstationary). Third. the Japanese result is in sharp contrast with the results for the US and the UK which indicate that in these countries the government's fiscal behavior is consistently characterized by Ricardian policy.

We evaluate fiscal sustainability by investigating whether the expected path of the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes or increases without bound. The debt-to-GDP ratio depends crucially on the projected growth rate and the fiscal policy rule. If the government does not react to the current fiscal crisis, the debt-to-GDP ratio will increase without bound, and then the fiscal policy is not sustainable. If the fiscal rule uses Bohn's (1998) idea that involves the response of the primary surplus to the debt, sustainability improves.

Evidence from a global VAR,JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,House price; Global VAR (GVAR); International linkages,,"This paper empirically assesses the prospects for house price spillovers in the euro area, where co-movement in house prices across countries may be particularly relevant given a general trend with monetary union toward increasing linkages in trade, financial markets, and general economic conditions. A global VAR is estimated for three housing demand variables (real house prices, real per capita income, and the cost of borrowing, captured by a real long-term interest rate) on the basis of quarterly data for 7 euro area countries (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands), which together comprise nearly 90% of euro area GDP, over the period 1971-2009. The results suggest limited house price spillovers in the euro area, albeit with evidence of some overshooting in the first year after the shock, followed by a long run aggregate euro area impact of country-specific changes in real house prices related in part to the country's economic weight. This contrasts. with the impacts of a shock to domestic long-term interest rates, causing a permanent shift in house prices after 2-3 years. Underlying this aggregate development are rather heterogeneous house price spillovers at the country level, with a strong importance for weights - either economic or geographic - in governing their general magnitude. More generally, the impact of financing costs on house prices appears to have grown though time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper finds that financial development and investment in information and communications technology (ICT) have significant positive impacts on GDP during macroeconomic structural reforms. We investigate eight Central and Eastern European countries that recently joined the EU. To secure macroeconomic stabilization, the countries have gone through privatization, harmonization and adjustments of the economies based on convergence criteria. Since some instruments are chosen based on the decision of the countries to satisfy the EU economic requirements, this unique experience along with a GMM methodology mitigates potential endogeneity problems. We estimate systems of simultaneous equations by GMM methods for GDP per capita, financial development and investment in telecommunications technology (TEL). We also find that financial development positively impacts TEL and that TEL weakly contributes to financial development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

The paper also uncovers significant nonlinear effects at high levels of public debt as well as significantly negative risk premiums for major reserve currencies, which enjoy a lower probability of currency crash than other currencies ceteris paribus.

At issue is whether the TAF reduced the spread between the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) rates and equivalent-term Treasury rates by reducing the liquidity premium embedded in LIBOR rates. This paper suggests that rather than reducing the liquidity premium in LIBOR rates, the announcement of the TAF increased the risk premium in financial and other bond rates because market participants interpreted the announcement by the Fed and other central banks as a sign that the financial crisis was worse than previously thought.

In an attempt to contribute to this growing literature, this paper investigates the connections between urban built environments and activity-travel patterns in Beijing, the capital city of China. We characterize the built environment in Beijing and establish associations between built environment and activity-travel behaviour in terms of car ownership, time spent for out-of-home activities, and daily trip frequencies and travel time. Activity diaries from 1119 respondents living in ten different neighbourhoods were collected by face-to-face interviews. A household-level structure equations model incorporating intra-household interactions is developed to analyse this data. The empirical results show that residents of different types of neighbourhoods in Beijing demonstrate significant differences in car ownership, time spent for out-of-home activities, trip rate, and travel time. Further, the characteristics of the built environment are found to have more significant impacts on the activity-travel behaviour of the male head than that of the female head. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although it is widely claimed that inflation targeting has been successful in maintaining low and stable inflation, an announcement of an inflation target does not by itself mean that central bankers are precommiting to how they conduct monetary policy. In comparison to the assumption of many theoretical studies, central banks conduct monetary policy in a discretionary fashion and rarely precommit to a rule in reality. Therefore, the central bank in this paper is modeled as discretionary, yet faced with a constraint, that an average of future inflation over a certain horizon should be kept on or near the preannounced target level. It is natural to add this constraint to the central banker's optimization problem, since inflation targeting involves one way or another an evaluation of the performance over a certain horizon. So it is argued that the better outcome of inflation targeting does not come from a commitment but from constrained discretion. This paper also sheds some light on optimal targeting horizon.",,,,junhank@bok.or.kr,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-2879,,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In this paper, a model-based bootstrap is used to generate a series of simulated trials and a modified chart pattern recognition algorithm is applied to all stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). The number of patterns detected in the original price series is compared with the number of patterns found in the simulated series. By simulating the price path specific time dependencies present in real data are eliminated, making price changes purely random. Patterns, if consistently identified, carry information which adds value to the investment process, however, this informativeness does not guarantee profitability. Conclusions are drawn on the relative efficiency of some sectors of the economy. Although the null hypothesis of weak form efficiency on the TSX cannot be rejected, some sectors of the Canadian economy appear to be less efficient than others. In addition, pattern frequencies appear to be negatively dependent on the two moments of return distributions, variance and kurtosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the impact of effective state-business relations on economic growth across Indian states over the period 1985-2006. We propose a measure that captures the various dimensions of effective state-business relations at the sub-national level, and estimate standard growth regressions using dynamic panel data methods. Our results show that effective state-business relations contribute significantly to economic growth and appear to be driven by the intensity of the interactions between the state and the private sector.

Small positive impacts on school progress, school motivation, positive social behavior, child well-being, and parent control endured, but impacts on school achievement and problem behavior were no longer evident. The most likely reasons for lasting impacts were that New Hope families were slightly less likely to be poor, and children had spent more time in center-based child care and structured activities.

It emphasizes the structuring role of the theory of rational addiction developed by Becker and Murphy [1988]. This theory constitutes both a technical achievement thanks to the formalization of the essential features of addiction using a framework with endogenous preferences complying with the hypotheses of the theory of rational choice and a revolution in the way to perceive addiction, which is no more an unwanted behavior, but the outcome of a cost-benefit calculus in the long run. Evidence of its empirical validation however tends to be weak. This emphasizes the limitations of a purely logical approach to addiction. Interdisciplinary collaborations with psychology and neurobiology are at the heart of recent initiatives for a better understanding of these behaviors.","Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Massin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",sophie.massin@univ-paris1.fr,"Massin, Sophie/AAV-4609-2020","Massin, Sophie/0000-0002-4617-1089",,,,,148,1,1,2,32,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We find that long-term incentives and other share-based plans do not affect the default risk faced by firms. However, the extensive use of stock options leads to higher future default risk for insurance firms. We argue that this is because option-based incentives induce managerial risk-taking behavior, which seeks to maximize managerial payoff through equity volatility.

With such preferences, voters with single-peaked, symmetric preferences and perfect information can sincerely prefer a distant candidate to a more proximate candidate. Moreover, negative agenda control in Congress makes such preference orderings inevitable, so party agenda control can allow majority party extremists to defeat more centrist minority party candidates.

Our method improves the subsequent ARCH structure in the sequential method by integrating the filtration (deseasonalization) process and the ARCH process in a united setting and optimizing the model parameters for the raw series instead of the filtered series.

This paper, however, shows that a minor difference in the way the question on bribe payments is asked has a large effect on estimates of the size of the burden. On average, firms report payments that are between 4 and 15 times higher when they report them as a percent of sales than when they report them in monetary terms. The paper discusses several possible reasons for this, but none explain the difference. One plausible remaining reason is that firm managers overestimate bribes when they report them in percentage terms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using three major macroeconomic series that undergo significant revisions (nonfarm payroll, gross domestic product, and industrial production), I present evidence that daily returns on the Standard & Poor's 500 index and revisions are positively related in expansions and negatively related in recessions. The results suggest that revisions do matter, i.e., that investors care about the final revised value of a macroeconomic series, that they infer accurate information from the release of the preliminary inaccurate report, and that the more precise information is aggregated into prices on the day of the initial announcement. The results are consistent with the predictions of rational expectations trading models around public announcements combined with well-established empirical results on the asymmetric interpretation of information across the business cycle.

A panel dataset of French plants, observed between 1993 and 2002, provides annual samples of more than 300,000 new plants, each plant being defined as rural, peri-urban, urban or located in the Paris region. A survival model is developed, introducing the location variable alongside the usual survival determinants, such as size, industry and period. Estimation results clearly show that it is easier to create a new plant in urban areas, particularly in the Paris region, but less difficult to survive in rural ones. Agglomeration forces may explain the first result, and the intensity of local competition variable, the second. However, even once the local competition effect is controlled, rural new plants still exhibit significantly higher survival rates. The entrepreneurial theory of opportunity may help to understand such a result. The density of population, activities and information offer more opportunities to start an activity, but also to quit it once it has been created.","INRA, UMR CESAER 1041, F-21079 Dijon, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon,"Huiban, JP (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR CESAER 1041, BP 87999,26 Bd Docteur Petit Jean, F-21079 Dijon, France.",huiban@enesad.inra.fr,,,,,,,42,18,21,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Based on a comprehensive panel of German multinationals, we find that the tax sensitivity of the capital structure is significantly affected by several firm characteristics.

In the absence of such legislation, the Clean Air Act is a potentially effective vehicle for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Decisions regarding existing stationary sources will have the greatest effect on emissions reductions. Although the magnitude of reductions is uncertain, it is plausible that a 10 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels could be achieved at moderate costs by 2020. This is comparable to domestic emissions reductions that would have been achieved under the Waxman-Markey legislation. These measures do not include the switching of fuels, which could yield further reductions. The ultimate cost of regulation under the Act hinges on the stringency of standards and the flexibility allowed. A broad-based tradable performance standard is legally plausible and would provide incentives comparable to the proposed legislation, at least in the near term.","[Burtraw, Dallas; Fraas, Art; Richardson, Nathan] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Burtraw, D (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",burtraw@rff.org; fraas@rff.org; richardson@rff.org,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

The social comparison theory in behavioral psychology suggests that when people do not know how to make a decision or are exposed to new information, they refer to the behavioral norm of the public or the behavior of others to frame their decisions. I argue that when IPO firms and underwriters are uncertain about an IPO firm's intrinsic values, they refer to similar IPO issuing firms in the same industry that went public earlier to determine the IPO offer price. Using a sample of Taiwan IPOs, I find evidence that supports the social comparison explanation of IPO underpricing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper attempts to overcome this problem by exploiting, as a natural experiment, the exogenous deposit outflow prompted by the removal of a blanket deposit guarantee on time deposits in Japan. We find that during the period of transition from a blanket guarantee to a partial guarantee, weak banks suffered from a large outflow of partially insured time deposits. More importantly, we find that those weak banks were not able to raise a sufficient amount of other types of deposits to make up for the loss of time deposits, which, consequently, forced them to cut back on loan supply. These results are consistent with the theory that the imperfect substitutability of insured deposits and uninsured deposits affects the tightness of banks' financing constraints and ultimately the supply of bank loans.

Market volatility is modeled to have two components, one due to the diffusion risk and the other due to the jump risk. The model implies Merton's ICAPM in the absence of leverage effects, whereas the return-volatility relations are determined by interactions between risk premia and leverage effects in the presence of leverage effects. Empirically, I find a robust negative relationship between the expected excess return and the jump volatility and a robust negative relationship between the expected excess return and the unexpected diffusion volatility. The latter provides an indirect evidence of the positive relationship between the expected excess return and the diffusion volatility. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One downside of this is that firms can experience negative publicity and financial damage if their data are breached. This is particularly the case in the medical sector, where we find empirical evidence that increased digitization of patient data is associated with more data breaches. The encryption of customer data is often presented as a potential solution, because encryption acts as a disincentive for potential malicious hackers, and can minimize the risk of breached data being put to malicious use. However, encryption both requires careful data management policies to be successful and does not ward off the insider threat. Indeed, we find no empirical evidence of a decrease in publicized instances of data loss associated with the use of encryption. Instead, there are actually increases in the cases of publicized data loss due to internal fraud or loss of computer equipment.

The literature has provided many different explanations to the trend in volatility and this paper tests the viability of the different explanations. Virtually all current theoretical arguments that are provided for the trend in the average level of volatility over time lend themselves to explanations about the difference in volatility levels between firms in the cross-section. We therefore focus separately on the cross-sectional and time-series explanatory power of the different proxies. We fail to find a proxy that is able to explain both dimensions well. In particular, we find that Cao et al. [Cao, C., Simin, T.T., Zhao, J., 2008. Can growth options explain the trend in idiosyncratic risk? Review of Financial Studies 21, 2599-2633] market-to-book ratio tracks average volatility levels well, but has no cross-sectional explanatory power. On the other hand, the low-price proxy suggested by Brandt et al. [Brandt, M.W., Bray, A., Graham, J.R., Kumar, A., 2010. The idiosyncratic volatility puzzle: time trend or speculative episodes. Review of Financial Studies 23, 863-899] has much cross-sectional explanatory power, but has virtually no time-series explanatory power. We also find that the different proxies do not explain the trend in volatility in the period prior to 1995 (R-squared of virtually zero), but explain rather well the trend in volatility at the turn of the Millennium (1995-2005).

These are meant to be indicators of fair representation and governing stability, respectively. We then propose a model that combines these two concepts and use it to find the optimal election threshold. We find that the optimal threshold is between 3-5 % under different scenarios that assign different weights to these two concepts.

It is shown that new establishments of existing firms, i.e., organizational foundings, have a mainly short-term positive effect. In contrast, genuinely new firms, i.e., individual foundings, have a longer-lasting effect. Individual foundings are based on the recognition of business opportunities and spur a process of creative destruction spanning a few years. Organizational foundings can be seen as capitalizations of scale economies. They have an immediate effect, but appear to be less relevant for structural change in a regional economy.","Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Urban & Reg Studies Inst, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Koster, S (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Urban & Reg Studies Inst, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",sierdjan.koster@rug.nl,,"koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X",,,,,45,13,14,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Owing to data availability, we restrict the analysis of mortgage pricing to Italian households. Consistent with the more widespread use of credit scoring, estimates indicate that Italian lenders have increasingly priced mortgage interest rates on household credit risk. For mortgages granted between 2000 and 2007, we find that a 1% point increase in the probability of default is associated with a 21 basis point rise in mortgage interest rates, lower than the 38 basis point premium Edelberg (2006) estimated for the US at the end of the 1990s.

I propose an equivalent accrual model that is not subject to the peek ahead bias and further takes into account the reversal of past accruals.

It is unlikely that countries will sign up to a common set of policy rules, nor is it probable that peer pressure alone will convince countries to co-operate. This paper argues that multilateral institutions have to do more to sell the global policy consensus to the influential public in each country, so that leaders are pushed by domestic constituencies to internalize the global good. Rather than solely a top down process of global policy-making, where grand summits make little progress, we also need a bottom up approach, where the summiteers will feel the pressure for global deals from their primary domestic constituencies.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Rajan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",raghuram.rajan@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

However, the SGP rules may result in underinvestment or distortions in the allocation of public expenditure. This paper provides new evidence on the effects of debt sustainability and the SGP fiscal constraints on government expenditure on fixed capital, education and health in OECD countries by estimating government expenditure reaction functions to public debt and cyclical conditions. We find that, at high levels of debt, government capital expenditure and education expenditure are significantly reduced as the debt ratio increases in all OECD countries independently of EMU (or EU) membership. By contrast, neither capital expenditure nor education expenditure is affected by the debt ratio in low-debt countries. These findings are robust to the inclusion of the government deficit in the estimated reaction functions. Hence, it appears that EU countries have been constrained in their investment decisions more by the need to ensure debt sustainability than by the rules of the SGP. In low-debt NMS countries, public investment even increases with the debt ratio, a finding that is reassuring for their growth prospects. However, a less optimistic picture emerges when we focus on expenditures on public health and education, as it appears that NMS governments cut such expenditures - even at low levels of debt - as the deficit increases. Problems in controlling total expenditure together with the preventive arm of the SGP may have penalised investment in human capital in the NMS while leaving fixed capital investment unaffected.","[Bacchiocchi, Emanuele; Missale, Alessandro] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Borghi, Elisa] Univ Carlo Cattaneo LIUC, Castellanza, Italy; [Borghi, Elisa] Univ Bocconi, KITeS, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc; Bocconi University,"Bacchiocchi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",emanuele.bacchiocchi@unimi.it; eborghi@liuc.it; alessandro.missale@unimi.it,"Borghi, Elisa/L-7744-2019; Bacchiocchi, Emanuele/K-8423-2017","Borghi, Elisa/0000-0001-9631-663X; Bacchiocchi, Emanuele/0000-0002-7365-3630",,,,,26,26,26,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We conclude that the standard theory offers too narrow a perspective for many real world problems and that many theories are not empirically tested. Consequently, environmental economics is at risk of producing aeroplanes without engines. Next, we welcome and discuss some recent trends, particularly the rapid developments of behavioural and new institutional economics as well as the increased interest in empirical analysis. Yet, we conclude that more 'logical duels' between competing theories, more interaction between theory and empirics, and more integration between the social sciences are needed to achieve a better understanding of real world environmental problems and the development of adequate policy handles. Finally, we present an outline of steps towards the development of an environmental social science and briefly present the papers that make up this special issue as important building stones of such a discipline.","[Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Dept Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Folmer, Henk] NW A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; University of Groningen; Northwest A&F University - China,"Johansson-Stenman, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",h.folmer@rug.nl; Olof.Johansson@economics.gu.se,,"Johansson-Stenman, Olof/0000-0003-4460-4765",,,,,123,21,21,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

They can influence the attractiveness of locations near the stations and improve accessibility for these locations. Furthermore urban rail can improve a location's attractiveness by its image effect: it makes a station appear modern and dynamic, and thus raises the status of this location. This paper summarises findings on the land-use and economic impacts of the urban rail system of the city of Naples over time and space. It examines changes in residential and non-residential (offices and retail) property prices around the newly built stations between 2001 and 2008 as well as the changes in the number of residents for the same station catchment areas. Ad hoc station control areas have been specified in order to compare the results of these changes. Results show that values in station control areas are lower than those of those of the stations catchment areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We account for the selection that arises in the loan request and approval process. Our findings imply that integration of interbank markets resulted in less stringent borrowing constraints and in substantially lower loan rates. The decrease was strongest in markets with competitive banking sectors.

My analysis of an age uniform sample of men, all of whom are observed from age 22 to 40 years, reveals that racial differences in cross-sectional self-employment rates are largely due to the fact that minority workers' self-employment spells are relatively short-lived. Moreover, I find that minority workers' relatively high exit rates are driven primarily by transitions to nonemployment. Estimates from a multinomial logit model of self-employment exits suggest that minority workers' weak attachment to the labor market prior to entering self-employment is an important determinant of their transition from self-employment to nonemployment, while lack of prior industry and self-employment experience contributes to minorities' transitions to wage employment. When I assign blacks and Hispanics the same (mean) work histories as whites, the predicted black-white gap in the first-year self-employment survival rate decreases by 31% and the Hispanic-white gap decreases by 14%.","Korea Labor Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Labor Institute,"Ahn, T (通讯作者)，Korea Labor Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",tahn@kli.re.kr,,,,,,,28,19,30,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

At least 34% of U.S. counties have environmental compliance costs that are statistically different from their states'.

Evidence from the Russian experiment,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank; Deposit insurance; Financial intermediation; Moral hazard; Russia; State-owned bank,MARKET DISCIPLINE; BANK REGULATION; RISK; OWNERSHIP; GROWTH; REFORM; IMPACT,"This study examines how the introduction of deposit insurance affects depositors and banks, using the deposit-insurance scheme introduced into the Russian banking system as a natural experiment. The fundamental research question is whether the introduction of deposit insurance leads to a more effective banking system as evidenced by increased deposit-taking and decreased reliance upon State-owned banks as custodians of retail deposits. We find that banks entering the new deposit-insurance system increase both their level of retail deposits and their ratios of retail deposits to total assets relative to banks that do not enter the new deposit insurance system. These results hold up in a multivariate panel-data analysis that controls for bank- and time-random effects. The longer a bank has been entered into the deposit insurance system, the greater is its level of deposits and its ratio of deposits to assets. Moreover, this effect is stronger for regional banks and for smaller banks. We also find that implementation of the new deposit-insurance system has the effect of leveling the playing field between State-owned banks and privately owned banks. Finally, we find strong evidence of moral hazard following implementation of deposit insurance in the form of increased bank risk-taking. Financial risk and, to a lesser degree, operating risk increase following implementation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We then show that GC repurchase agreement (repo) spreads across asset classes display jumps and significant temporal variation, especially at times of predictable liquidity needs, consistent with the safe haven properties of Treasury securities: These jumps are driven almost entirely by the behavior of the GC repo rates of Treasury securities. Estimating the collateral rents earned by owners of these securities, we find such rents to be sizable for Treasury securities and nearly zero for agency and mortgage-backed securities. Finally, we link collateral values to asset prices in a simple no-arbitrage framework and show that variations in collateral values explain a significant fraction of changes in short-term yield spreads but not those of longer-term spreads. Our results point to securities' role as collateral as a promising direction of research to improve understanding of the pricing of money market securities and their spreads.","[Bartolini, Leonardo; Hilton, Spence] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA; [Sundaresan, Suresh] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Tonetti, Christopher] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Columbia University; New York University,"Sundaresan, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, 3022 Broadway,Uris Hall 811, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ms122@columbia.edu,,,,,,,28,21,25,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We show that the impact of openness on factor productivity growth is more important than the effect on capital growth. This explains why the growth effects of liberalization appear to be largely permanent, not temporary. We attribute these permanent liberalization effects to the role financial openness plays in stock market and banking sector development, and to changes in the quality of institutions. We find some indirect evidence of higher investment efficiency post-liberalization. We also document threshold effects: countries that are more financially developed or have higher quality of institutions experience larger productivity growth responses. Finally, we show that the growth boost from openness outweighs the detrimental loss in growth from global or regional banking crises. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Some scientists find that democracy has a positive impact in reducing environmental disruption. Other scholars claim that democracy tends to accelerate environmental degradation. By using deforestation rates as a proxy for environmental disruption, we suggest that both sides might be right. Our quantitative analysis has three important outcomes. First, there is evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between deforestation and democracy. Second, countries in democratic transition experience the highest deforestation rates, compared to non-democracies and mature democracies. Third, in explaining deforestation rates democracy has larger explanatory power than income. This last result implies that in reducing deforestation rates the emphasis should not only be on economic development but even more on democratization.","[Buitenzorgy, Meilanie] Bogor Agr Univ IPB, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Resources & Environm Econ, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Mol, Arthur P.

The study was conducted in city of Sarajevo, during the period of three weeks, and the sampling method was the non-probability convenience sampling. The questionnaire used in this study is comprised of three parts: general demographics questions, perceived bank service quality and customer satisfaction. Perceived bank service quality was measured using 22 perception-only items to measure five dimensions of service quality based on the SERVQUAL instrument. Overall customer satisfaction was measured using a three items that identified how satisfied a customer felt with regard to the participating banking service provider. A total of 500 respondents were attracted. The data was analyzed with the help of factor analysis, regression analysis, and descriptive analysis. Factor analysis was applied to assess dimensionality of SERVQUAL's dimensions; regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of identified service quality dimensions on overall customer satisfaction; and descriptive analysis was employed to estimate perceived service quality and customer satisfaction. The results of factor analysis revealed a four dimensional structure of SERVQUAL scale: responsiveness/assurance, empathy, reliability, and tangibles.

Statman [1995] argues that dollar-cost averaging is consistent with the positive framework of behavioral finance. We assume a prospect theory investor who implements a strategic asset allocation plan and has the choice to shift the portfolio immediately (comparable to a lump sum) or on a step-by-step basis (dollar-cost averaging). Our simulation results support Statman's [1995] notion that dollar-cost averaging may not be rational but a perfectly normal behavior.,"[Drobetz, Wolfgang] Univ Hamburg, Inst Finance, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Drobetz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Finance, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",wolfgang.drobetz@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,"Drobetz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-5247-0405",,,,,36,8,12,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1542-7560,,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

However, recent empirical studies document the prevalence of debt-like instruments such as pensions. This paper justifies the use of debt as efficient compensation. Inside debt is a superior solution to the agency costs of debt than the solvency-contingent bonuses and salaries proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends not only on the incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy. Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions of debt and equity is typically inefficient. In most cases, an equity bias is desired to induce effort. However, if effort is productive in increasing liquidation value, or if bankruptcy is likely, a debt bias can improve effort as well as alleviate the agency costs of debt. The model generates a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence.","[Edmans, Alex; Liu, Qi] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Edmans, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Edmans, Alex/F-9562-2011","Edmans, Alex/0000-0002-9781-892X",,,,,26,198,227,2,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Combinatorial auctions are those auctions in which bidders can place bids on combinations of items. The advantage of combinatorial auctions is that the bidder can more fully express his preferences. This is particular important when items are complements. In the experiment presented in the paper, the polluters have two options: (i) to invest individually or (ii) create coalitions, i.e. to prepare and realize common capital investment projects. The common model of combinatorial auctions is described first in the paper.

This paper studies the experience of 14 developed countries over 140 years (1870-2008). It exploits the long-run data set in a number of different ways. First, the paper applies new statistical tools to describe the temporal and spatial patterns of crises and identifies five episodes of global financial instability in the past 140 years. Second, it studies the macroeconomic dynamics before crises and shows that credit growth tends to be elevated and short-term interest rates depressed relative to the natural rate in the run-up to global financial crises. Third, the paper shows that recessions associated with crises lead to deeper slumps and stronger turnarounds in imbalances than during normal recessions. Finally, the paper asks to what extent external imbalances help predict financial crises. The overall result is that credit growth emerges as the single best predictor of financial instability. External imbalances have played an additional role, but more so in the pre-WWII era of low financialization than today.
