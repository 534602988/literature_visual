Several main trends in the economics of biodiversity are identified. First, biodiversity change has come to be analyzed largely through its impact on ecosystem services (in the sense of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment). Second, there has been a growing focus on factors that optimally lead to biodiversity decline, i.e., the benefits to be had from reducing the abundance of pests, predators, pathogens, and competitors. Third, increasing attention is being paid to two global drivers of biodiversity change, climate and global economic integration, and the effect they have on the distribution and abundance of both beneficial and harmful species. Fourth, there has been growing interest in the development of instruments to deal with the transboundary public good aspect of biodiversity, and in particular in the development of payments for ecosystem services. The paper identifies the influence of these trends on attempts to model the role of biodiversity in the production of goods and services.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Perrings, C (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, POB 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",charles.perrings@asu.edu,,,,,,,114,7,8,0,36,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Researchers in foreign exchange markets find that foreign exchange rates also display behaviors akin to momentum and mean reversion. This paper implements a trading strategy combining mean reversion and momentum in foreign exchange markets. The strategy was originally designed for equity markets, but it also generates abnormal returns when applied to uncovered interest parity deviations for five countries. I find that the pattern for the positions thus created in the foreign exchange markets is qualitatively similar to that found in the equity markets. Quantitatively, this strategy performs better in foreign exchange markets than in equity markets. Also, it outperforms traditional foreign exchange trading strategies, such as carry trades and moving average rules. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Local development is here understood as a deliberately induced process of improving the welfare of local communities, which should be democratic, inclusive and sustainable, in particular with regard to creating competitive local economies, stimulating economic growth and ensuring better living conditions for the inhabitants. Local development is an important part of a governance process which involves complex interactions at various territorially defined levels: local, regional, national, cross-national, international. In the case of the regions considered in the present paper a historical opportunity is provided for them by the so called European Union Strategy for the Danube Region. In order to fully exploit this opportunity, the capacity to address local development issues should be strengthened in both countries, especially by well designed education and training programmes. This is why local development was considered a priority topic for the cooperation between the two universities. In the same framework, taking into consideration the challenges which are specific to the Lower Danube Region, other topics of interest were considered: logistics, tourism, consumer affairs or rural development. The authors of the present paper had to avoid overlapping with the work of the other teams. In particular, there are many common points between local development and rural development, because in both countries the regions on the border of Danube are predominately rural and significantly dependent on agriculture. Therefore, here, the needs for education and training are defined in strict correlation with the required capacity for understanding the development process and its priorities, designing, planning, implementing and assessing development policies with a favourable local impact in a regional context. The paper presents as in a mirror the Romanian and the Bulgarian points of view. The two perspectives are quite different but complementary. Briefly said, while the Romanian approach is bottom-up, with a focus on the local capacity to take initiatives that will contribute at shaping the regional development process, the Bulgarian one considers first the priorities of the region, in order to define the capacities required for a proper response at local level. Both perspectives are valid, and it should not be any contradiction between them. This is why we consider they are complementary. The studies rely on documentary research and secondary analysis of data in order to assess the capacity gap in addressing local development issues, and to identify education and training needs in economics and business matters related to local development. They discuss the rationale of cooperation between universities from Bulgaria and Romania in responding to such needs, and, finally they propose an inventory of joint initiatives in this respect. The paper emphasizes the factors which explain the reasons why cooperation between universities in raising the expertise in local development maters on both sides of Lower Danube is required and desirable, such as the vicinity, the common opportunities and responsibilities related to having Danube as a common asset, the similarities in development patterns, the common challenge of European integration, use of EU support and better exploitation of the Internal Market, the need to speed up the modernisation process and to achieve some economies of scope and scale. Among other proposals, authors propose the establishment of a university hub to coordinate networking among higher education institutions from Bulgaria, Romania and other countries of the Danube Macro-region in the field of local and regional development related research, education and training and a joint master program in local development.","[Tachiciu, Laurentiu; Balalia, Alina Elena] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Yankov, Nicola] DA Tsenov Acad Econ, Svishtov, Bulgaria",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Tsenov Academy of Economics,"Tachiciu, L (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Iosif, Alina-Elena/B-4435-2015","Tachiciu, Laurentiu/0000-0002-2566-0342",,,,,16,3,3,0,28,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2010,12.0,,,,4,,815,838,,,,,,24,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,699CQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285641900006,0

However, in response to recent skepticism, this paper examines whether the conventional wisdom about agriculture's contribution to the development process can still be applied to Africa today. We first outline the debate between the proponents of agriculture and its skeptics before presenting a series of case studies reflecting the heterogeneity of initial conditions facing low-income African countries. Drawing on economy-wide modeling, these case studies contrast the effectiveness of alternative growth strategies in reducing poverty. The findings indicate that while Africa does face many new challenges unlike those faced by Asian countries, there is little evidence to suggest that these countries can bypass a broad-based agricultural revolution to successfully launch their economic transformations.

The returns are independent of the liquidity a fund provides to its investors as measured by lockup and redemption notice periods, and they are also robust to commonly used hedge-fund factors, none of which carries a significant premium during the sample period.

The model employed describes a situation of partial equilibrium characterized by imperfect competition among domestic producers, where the domestic good is a substitute for an imported polluting commodity. In this framework, we also bring in the possibility that the domestic firms can introduce innovation offsets via their investment in R&D. From the results, the optimal pollution tax under domestic distortions can be expressed as a function of a 'domestic production effect' and a 'pollution effect'. Furthermore, when the firms execute R&D expenditures, the optimal policy adds an 'innovation effect', which captures the change in welfare coming from a decrease in total costs and can lead our results to a win-win situation.","Univ Nacl San Martin, Escuela Econ & Negocios, RA-1650 San Martin, Argentina",,"Sampaolesi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl San Martin, Escuela Econ & Negocios, 2241 Caseros, RA-1650 San Martin, Argentina.",asampaolesi@unsam.edu.ar,,,,,,,14,1,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We study mean-variance efficiency and spanning, as well as factor relevance. In particular, we assess the relative contribution of the factors in accounting for asset pricing anomalies. Our tests are motivated by a finite-sample distributional theory, invariant to portfolio repackaging, and achieve size control exactly conditioning on observed factors, in normal and non-normal contexts. We focus on the multivariate normal and Student-t distributions, in which case we rely on the simulation procedure proposed and applied in Beaulieu et al. (2007). We also assess, from a finite-sample and multivariate test perspective, the specification and fit of the model and error distributions considered. In its most general form, the model considered includes six factors: the market portfolio, size, the ratio of book equity to market equity as well as term structure variables (a term premium and a default premium) and momentum. Portfolio returns (coming from assets traded at NYSE. AMEX and NASDAQ) from Fama and French's data base are analyzed on monthly frequencies from 1961-2000. Our results show the following. (1) Normality in model residuals becomes more dependable as a working hypothesis, over short time spans, when the book to market equity and size factors or when the momentum factor are accounted for. (2) Allowing for heavy tailed distributions empirically accommodates some stylized asset pricing anomalies. (3) Loadings on the term structure variables and the momentum factor seem (jointly, across portfolios) statistically insignificant at usual levels in many sub-periods. (4) Mean-variance efficiency is rejected in fewer subperiods allowing for non-normal errors in multi-factor settings: the book to market equity and size factors contribute importantly in reinforcing efficiency. (5) Enlarging the set of assets [From a one factor to a six factor model] does not reinforce the mean-variance spanning hypothesis, which is globally rejected at usual levels.

In this paper we argue that such objective, independent and exogenous certifying mechanism provides a better opportunity to test the well established certification hypothesis, especially in the context of emerging markets with institutional voids. Using a sample of 163 Indian IPOs we test the efficacy of IPO grading mechanism. We find, grading decreases IPO underpricing and positively influences demand of retail investors. Grading reduces secondary market risk and improves liquidity. However, grading does not affect long run performance of the IPOs. IPO grading successfully capture firm size, business group affiliation and firm's quality of corporate governance. Our findings imply that, in emerging markets, regulator's role to signal the quality of an IPO contributes towards the market welfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our main result is that bail-outs lead to higher risk-taking among the protected bank's competitors, independently of transparency. The reason is that the prospect of a bailout induces the protected bank to expand, which intensifies competition in the deposit market, depresses other banks' margins, and thereby increases risk-taking incentives. Contrary to conventional wisdom, protected banks may take lower risks when transparency in the banking sector is low and the deposit supply is sufficiently elastic. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We find that proximate banks are more likely to lead underwrite risky bonds and non-rated bonds. On average, the total issue cost is lower if the lead underwriter is a proximate bank. The overall results suggest that geographically proximate banks have better access to private information about issuing companies. We also find that the cost reduction effect of proximate underwriting only appears in developed markets. In addition, this cost reduction effect is relatively weak in countries with a legal system that provides good investor protection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Relying on transactions data from a cross-section of U.S. metropolitan areas, we find that up to 30% of the variability of realized returns to commercial real estate can be accounted for by expected return variability, while expected rent growth rate variability explains up to 45% of the variability of realized rent growth rates. The cap rate-that is, the rent-price ratio in commercial real estate-captures fluctuations in expected returns for apartments and retail properties, as well as industrial properties. For offices, by contrast, cap rates do not forecast (in-sample) returns even though expected returns on offices are also time-varying. As implied by the present value relation, cap rates marginally forecast office rent growth but not rent growth of apartments, retail properties, and industrial properties. We link these differences in in-sample predictability to differences in the stochastic properties of the underlying commercial real estate data-generating processes. Also, rent growth predictability is observed mostly in locations characterized by higher population density and stringent land-use restrictions. The opposite is true for return predictability. The dynamic portfolio implications of time-varying commercial real estate returns are also explored in the context of a portfolio manager investing in the aggregate stock market and Treasury bills, as well as commercial real estate.","[Valkanov, Rossen] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Plazzi, Alberto; Torous, Walter] Univ Calif San Diego, Anderson Sch, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Valkanov, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch, Pepper Canyon Hall,9500 Gilman Dr,MC 0093, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rvalkanov@ucsd.edu,,"Plazzi, Alberto/0000-0001-7894-5395",,,,,55,78,91,1,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Because the market is dynamically complete, full risk sharing obtains and a representative agent can be constructed, though the risk aversion of this agent fluctuates over time with the state of the economy, as the relative wealth distribution of the individual investors changes. We show that preference heterogeneity can cause asset prices to be significantly more volatile than the underlying dividends and that it can lead to leverage-like effects in volatility, in the sense that volatility increases after stock-market declines.

The consumer is willing to pay more for a product produced with clean technology and the model can also be interpreted as a world economy model where each firm represents a country. There exists a critical value of m (proportion of firms adopting the clean technology), m*, such that if m < m* then no country adopts the clean technology, all countries adopt the clean technology only if in > m* while some countries will adopt the clean technology and some will not adopt the clean technology if m = m*. Our results also identify an example of coordination failure. Since symmetric technology adoption delivers the same level of profits as non-adoption, global coordination will be necessary to achieve the clean technology adoption outcome.

However, structural models perform poorly in predicting corporate bond spreads. It is unclear whether this poor performance is caused by characteristics of individual models, missing factors, or different calibration procedures. This study evaluates the performance of four structural models by incorporating two important factors, personal taxes and the liquidity factor, and calibrating these models to data. To ensure our results are not contingent on the calibration method, we further apply the maximum likelihood estimation method to a large sample of individual bonds. Results consistently show that the ability of structural models to predict spreads improves considerably when personal taxes and liquidity are taken into account. Our findings suggest that the poor performance of standard structural models is more likely due to missing factors than the characteristics of individual models or the calibration procedure.

In addition, we summarize some of the studies that have tried to document the size and growth of these markets. We find that the literature has focused mainly on the supply of technology, but several other aspects of these markets remain under-studied, including the demand for external technology, the role of uncertainty in technology markets, and the dynamic interaction between industry structure and the market for technology. Understanding these will illuminate whether markets for technology will continue to grow or remained confined to pockets of the economy.","[Arora, Ashish] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Arora, Ashish] NBER, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, KITeS, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Arora, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 1 Towerview Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ashish.arora@duke.edu; alfonso.gambardella@unibocconi.it,"arora, ashish/A-2513-2008; Gambardella, Alfonso/K-2641-2012; arora, ashish/M-1720-2013","Gambardella, Alfonso/0000-0002-8714-5813; arora, ashish/0000-0001-5097-8646",,,,,74,245,272,8,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In this setting, a random exclusion mechanism is introduced, linked to the normalized group performance (R, from 0 to 1). Every round, each subject is non-excluded from the collective profit with probability R (and with probability 1 - R gets no benefit from the group account). Punishment does not depend on the individual behavior, but the probability of being punished reflects collective performance. As the exclusion probability is computed at the group level, no individual information is needed to implement exclusion. However, the probabilistic punishment risks to be perceived by subjects as procedurally unfair, as all subjects are treated in an identical, non-equitable manner (justice is blind). Our results suggest that random exclusion promotes a significant increase in cooperation. The effect seems to be associated with hot behavioral responses to punishment. However, convergence to full contribution is not observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When these nations capture a 1% share of the U.S. sector, the sector's producer prices decrease by 2.35%. Because import competition also influences the skewness of the distribution of price changes, it is likely to have impacted U.S. equilibrium inflation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we offer an explanation. We model a CEO charged with selecting the firm's strategy that determines the firm's exposure to sector performance. To incentivize the CEO to choose optimally, pay contracts will be positively and sometimes asymmetrically related to sector performance. Consistent with our predictions, the empirical analysis indicates that the observed sensitivity of pay to sector performance is almost fully confined to multisegment firms and is greater in firms that offer greater strategic flexibility to alter sector exposure, for more talented CEOs and for CEOs as compared to their subordinate executives. Our evidence is robust to alternate explanations such as CEO entrenchment.","[Gopalan, Radhakrishnan; Milbourn, Todd] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Song, Fenghua] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Gopalan, R (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, Campus Box 1133,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",gopalan@wustl.edu,"Gopalan, Radhakrishnan/K-8614-2012",,,,,,28,61,77,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The underwriter thus holds a short position that it commonly fills by aftermarket trading when market prices fall or, when prices rise, by executing the so-called overallotment option. This option is a standard feature of initial public offering (IPO) arrangements that allows the underwriter to purchase more shares from the issuer at the original offer price. We propose a theoretical model to study the implications of this combination of short position and overallotment option on the pricing of the IPO. Maximizing the sum of both the profits from their share of the offer revenue and the potential profits from aftermarket trading, we show that underwriters strategically distort the offer price. This results either in exacerbated underpricing when favorably informed underwriters lower prices to secure a signaling benefit, or in informationally inefficient offer prices when underwriters pool in offer prices irrespective of their information.","[Bartling, Bjoern] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Park, Andreas] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada",University of Zurich; University of Toronto,"Bartling, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",bartling@iew.uzh.ch; andreas.park@utoronto.ca,,"Bartling, Bjorn/0000-0002-9496-266X",,,,,22,4,4,0,23,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Community-level studies of unit-based pricing typically do not include fixed effects at the local level. We find that failure to do so may substantially inflate the estimated price effect. We also find that unit-based pricing may be endogenous, and use instrumental variables to account for this. Our analysis shows that user fees depend on user fees in neighboring jurisdictions (policy interaction). Our estimate of the garbage reduction per $1 user fee is lower than any previous estimate bar one. The price effect depends on the pricing system: weight-based systems reduce garbage quantities more than volume-based systems. User fees increase recycling, especially of paper, but not nearly as much as they reduce garbage quantities. We find no evidence for waste tourism or illegal dumping.","[Allers, Maarten A.; Hoeben, Corine] COELO, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Allers, Maarten A.; Hoeben, Corine] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Allers, MA (通讯作者)，COELO, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.a.allers@rug.nl,"Allers, Maarten/A-8276-2010","Allers, Maarten/0000-0002-6838-9046",,,,,38,61,65,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We look at the effect of retirement on food expenditure, production, and consumption to test the universality of results obtained by Aguiar and Hurst (2005) from US data. In contrast to US results, conditional on a similar vector of covariates, we find no evidence of a fall in food expenditure following retirement. Our results suggest that the quality of food consumed by Canadian households improves somewhat with retirement. Similar to US results, we observe that household calorie intake and major nutrient intake seem not to be adversely affected by changes in retirement status. We find evidence that retired households substitute food purchased for consumption away from home for food purchased for at-home consumption. Further, using the 1998 Time Use Survey, we find that individuals who are retired devote more time for food preparation.","[Brzozowski, Matthew] York Univ, Atkinson Fac Liberal & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [Lu, Yuqian] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",York University - Canada; McMaster University,"Brzozowski, M (通讯作者)，York Univ, Atkinson Fac Liberal & Profess Studies, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",,"Brzozowski, Matthew/AAA-3203-2022","Brzozowski, Matthew/0000-0003-4857-7127",,,,,30,4,5,1,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This disappointing performance is often imputed to the insufficient extent of structural reforms in labour and product markets. The ECB conduct of monetary policy, and the Stability and Growth Pact, would on the other hand have no negative role in the growth performance of euro zone countries. The financial crisis while calling for a temporary softening of the constraints (notably on fiscal policy), would also confirm that monetary policy was more virtuous in the euro zone than in the United States. This article proposes a radically different interpretation. We argue that soft growth is the consequence of restrictive macroeconomic policies. These are not linked to the existence of the euro per se, that in fact has helped growth by minimizing monetary perturbations, but rather to the political compromise that led to the current institutions for the economic government of Europe. This compromise imposed rules for monetary and fiscal neutrality while pushing for structural reforms whose main objective was to impose a new norm on the distribution of wealth. Putting in place the appropriate policies for growth requires rethinking this norm, and the financial crisis may be an opportunity to do so.",,,,jeanluc.gaffard@ofce.sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The latter occurs during booms and is due to the strategic substitutability of quantities.

In the presence of structural breaks, PPP holds only for Bulgaria and Romania it does not hold for the other 6 transition countries. Testing the stationarity of real exchange rate series by using four types of unit roots tests, the evidence suggests that real effective exchange rate is nonstationary and thus PPP doesn't hold for all 6 transition countries in the long run.

Deregulation also significantly affects the cross-sectional relation between leverage and its determinants. Leverage is much less negatively correlated with profitability and market-to-book and much more positively (negatively) correlated with firm size (earnings volatility) following deregulation.

The foreign entrant brings a superior technology and therefore may spend resources to prevent spillovers of its technology to the home firm. The home firm has an incentive to spend resources to gain these spillovers. After firms strategically choose their expenditures to influence technology spillovers, they compete in a Cournot-Nash quantity game. This study provides theoretical insight on the positive and negative empirical spillover results of FDI on productivity of local firms. Up to a critical bound, the larger the initial technology gap between the foreign and home firms, the more the home firm spends to gain spillovers. Past that boundary, the home firm decreases spending. As a result, the home firm's profits from spillovers vary, but larger technology gaps engender greater net profit losses from FDI.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Sawada, N (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",nsawada@worldbank.org,,,,,,,39,29,30,0,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, a measurable number of investors select index funds with excessive fees and uncompetitive returns. We call this observation the Index Fund Rationality Paradox because it conflicts with the belief that index fund investors are making a rational, low-cost choice in their 'type of fund' decision. In our analysis of this paradox, we find that both retail and institutional index investors tended to make better choices in recent years, but the cost of poor choices among both groups continues to be significant. In fact, we are able to identify an arguably naive group of retail investors that seem to be unduly influenced by brokers and financial advisors. These investors are largely responsible for the remaining paradox. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We discuss the implications of partial or total internalization of environmental values, showing that internalizing only carbon sequestration may have negative impacts on biodiversity-scenic values. To evaluate the practical relevance, we compare reforestations in the South-west of Spain with cork-oaks (a slow-growing native species) and with eucalyptus (a fast-growing alien species). We do the analysis with two different carbon crediting methods: the Carbon Flow Method and the Ton Year Accounting Method. With the first method, the forest surface increases more, but using mainly eucalyptus. With the second, additional reforestations are done mainly using cork- oaks. We value the impact on visitors of these reforestations using stated preferences methods showing that, when these values are internalized, cork- oaks are favored.","[Caparros, Alejandro; Ovando, Paola; Campos, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Cerda, Emilio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Complutense University of Madrid,"Caparrós, A (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Albasanz 26, Madrid 28037, Spain.",alejandro.caparros@cchs.csic.es; ecerdate@ccee.ucm.es; paola.ovando@cchs.csic.es; pablo.campos@cchs.csic.es,"Ovando, Paola/ABE-3821-2021","Caparros, Alejandro/0000-0002-2841-3566; Ovando, Paola/0000-0001-6915-5826",,,,,36,20,23,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Such approaches have become increasingly controversial: celebrated by optimists as the most empowering way forward for marginal citizens on the one hand, and derided as an abrogation of responsibility by development trustees by sceptics on the other. Uganda provides a particularly interesting context to explore these debates, not least because it has become a standard bearer for inclusive neoliberalism at the same time that regional inequalities within it have become increasingly apparent. Our investigation of the flagship response to deep impoverishment in its northern region, the World Bank-funded Northern Uganda Social Action Fund, offers greater support to the sceptics, not least because of the ways in which the more pernicious tendencies within inclusive neoliberalism have converged with the contemporary politics of development in Uganda.","[Hickey, Sam] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Golooba-Mutebi, Frederick] Makerere Univ, Makerere Inst Social Res, Kampala, Uganda",University of Manchester; Makerere University,"Hickey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",sam.hickey@manchester.ac.uk,"Golooba-Mutebi, Frederick/AAO-4368-2020; Golooba-Mutebi, Frederick/AAA-1661-2019",,,,,,59,31,38,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Yet class and social distinctions through which state actors 'see' poor children result in beneficiary selection practices that routinely exclude the poorest from school, with longer-term adverse effects for their social inclusion and citizenship.","Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Power & Social Change Team, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Hossain, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Power & Social Change Team, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",n.hossain@ids.ac.uk,,"Hossain, Naomi/0000-0002-3244-2319",,,,,47,20,26,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This paper tests panel co-integration among three panel variables by Pedroni residual co-integration test and estimates the model with FMOLS proposed by Philips and Hansen. The results show that there is a panel co-integration relationship among the three panel variables which characterizes the diesel oil consumption of the 36 major sectors of Chinese industry. The conclusions and their implications in this paper can be taken as reference evidence for formulating a long-run energy strategy for China.

However, complex natural and economic interactions make a sound analysis difficult. In this regard, the concept of economies of scope provides a simple policy oriented indicator of jointness. Thus, the existence of economies of scope can be regarded as a precondition for the implementation of agricultural policies with respect to environmental goods and services. We apply the concept of economies of scope to the provision of ecosystem services in the Swiss lowlands using a spatially explicit economic-ecological programming model. Thereby, the consideration of non-agricultural competitors in the provision of ecosystem services allows a simultaneous assessment of economies of scope. A cost-effectiveness analysis shows the least-cost supplier of ecosystem services and spatial patterns in the supply for these services. Results imply the existence of economies of scope and hence strong jointness between agricultural production and the provision of ecosystem services. However, the potential for public cost savings due to structural change in agriculture is considerable. Moreover, the development of the second generation in biomass conversion technologies may enhance a non-agricultural provision of these services. Therefore, a continuous improvement in agricultural production efficiency is a precondition for strong jointness and thus multifunctionality.","[Huber, Robert; Lehmann, Bernard] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Huber, R (通讯作者)，ETH, Sonneggstr 33,SOL D6, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",robehube@ethz.ch,"Huber, Robert/G-4880-2011; Huber, Robert/Q-6512-2019","Huber, Robert/0000-0003-4545-456X;",,,,,47,3,3,1,16,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN 1,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251 POSTFACH 10 06 06, W-6000 FRANKFURT MAIN 1, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Research results show: (1) Affected by the financial crisis and the theory of consumers' utility maximization, the present-day production enterprises are risk-tired investors; (2) the futures market in China cannot be called a mature market, so the short-term futures investment of individual products has a very high risk, and many are noise traders, so production enterprises should consider building the futures portfolio and make a long-term investment; (3) when selecting a futures portfolio, it can be either the positively relevant futures or the negatively relevant futures, and both can help reduce the financial risks; and (4) enterprises can make more profits if they adjust investment portfolio correctly.","[Li Baixing; Shi Wen] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Accounting Sch, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Li Baixing; Shi Wen] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Accounting Sch, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business; Capital University of Economics & Business,,lbx@cueb.edu.cn; shiwen6331@sina.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,1,ORIENT ACAD FORUM,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54627-8,,,,2010,,,,,,,81,90,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYZ54,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799000014,0

Nevertheless, economic research proves that it is not endowed with efficient production technology. This research has been realized in the Czech Republic by Cobb-Douglas frontier production function specified in two types of random effects models - Pitt-Lee, and Batesse-Coelli. Both models omitted one important but unobservable factor of production - management. This implicated so call management bias, which causes distorted technical inefficiency. Therefore, the aim of the proposed paper is a quantification of the technical efficiency of Czech organic farms by including managerial ability in the stochastic frontier production function and the comparison with the results of mentioned random effects models. The partial goal is also a quantification of the differences in technical efficiency between organic and conventional farming. The methodological tool for achieving this aim is an analysis using a stochastic frontier production function specified like Alvarez Fixed Management model, in which management is treated as an unobservable fixed input of a random coefficients model of production. The analysis was conducted on the basis of unbalanced panel data from 143 organic and 388 conventional enterprises, obtained over the time period 2004 - 2008. The farms whose data was entered into this database are legal entities, concentrated primarily on mixed agricultural production. The sample of organic farms represents 58 % of the entire population of organic legal entities. Results of the analyses indicate the strong role of management in measuring technical efficiency and declare the inferiority of organic production technology, by documenting that conventional producers operate, on average, closer to the frontier production function than organic producers.","[Mala, Zdenka; Maly, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Malá, Z (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",malaz@pef.czu.cz; maly@pef.czu.cz,"Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021","Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338",,,,,13,0,0,0,8,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,87,94,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600011,0

Mergers and acquisitions have become a way of corporate life because corporations compete to provide shareholders with a better return on their investments as this is the factor upon which corporate valuations are typically based. Managers produce growth strategies that are often based on acquisitions or alliances. The purpose of the present paper is to analyze the factors that generate the success or failure of mergers and acquisitions focusing on the due diligence review and its importance. We analyze the legal provisions regarding mergers and aquisitions and the mergers operations typology as we believe that knowing very well the kinds of operations that can take place would help managers to develop successful plans. We were also interested in looking closer to the factors that can lead to the success or failure of mergers and aquisitions procedures. The specialised literature tries to prove that mergers and acquisitions are generated inmost cases by external factors and the changes that may occur in the performances of the environment stimulate some companies to look for corporate control. The major problem of all these theories, so present in literature is that they consider that there are no internal factors that could generate economic reactions or that these factors are much too fable to lead to the decision to take part into merger or acquisition activities. Or this is far from reality. In mergers and acquisitions, communication is vital. Both before and after the merger or acquisition, the company that is doing the take-over must make sure that there is set a good communication with shareholders, employees and management of the target company. Determining the potential for a prospective merger or acquisition to create shareholder value and then keeping the promises made to the shareholders is in today's uncertain economic climate more critical than ever. Therefore, we consider that the due diligence review in the mergers and acquisitions operations becomes vital and we try to identify the main steps to be taken in such a review. We conclude that the planning of the merger and acquisition activities and the use of due diligence reviews leads to the success or failure of the operation.","[Nachescu, Miruna-Lucia; Mataragiu, Anca Cristina] W Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,,mnachescu@oxygencomputers.ro,"Nachescu, Miruna Lucia/AAZ-2216-2020","Nachescu, Miruna Lucia/0000-0003-1179-0717",,,,,13,0,0,4,35,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,296,318,,,,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100019,0

High level of financial awareness allows consumers to select financial services most adequate to their financial capabilities and also affects the correct assessment of risk connected with a given product. The paper aims to analyse the state of knowledge and financial skills of rural youth (18 to 29 years of age) in Poland. The investigated problem is particularly important because rural areas in Poland are characterized by a unequal access to educational and financial institutions and on average lower education level in comparison with the urbanized areas. The source of data used for the analysis and deduction was primary information from Authors' own investigations (interview questionnaire). Field research was conducted in 2010 but the information gathered applies to the year 2009. As has been demonstrated by the conducted analyses, Polish youth has a poor financial awareness. The level of knowledge and financial competences among rural youth depend on the education, the amount and source of income of respondents but also on the activity on financial services market. It results from different attitudes of consumers towards using loan and savings products, diversified motives which drive them at the choice of financial product and preferences concerning the sources of financial knowledge. One of the ways to improve the situation is undertaking commonly accessible activities in the field of financial education (Poland has not yet developed a national strategy of financial education as is the case in the US, United Kingdom or Czech Republic, despite the appeals of OECD and the European Commission.) It will help future consumers to make rational decisions on using financial services and facilitate responsible management of household budget.","Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Management & Mkt Agribusiness, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Szafranska, M (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Management & Mkt Agribusiness, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland.",mszafranska@ar.krakow.pl,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,155,161,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600018,0

These constructs are based on the Weber's axes of tension (Weber, 1958; 1961; Weber and Roth, 1968) and Giddens' structuration theory. The practices and criteria at the economic and political level, as well as the practices and criteria at the organisational field level in conjunction with the intra-organisational rationale shaped the company's management accounting system.

Evidence is found that intra-African remittances reduce inequality while intercontinental remittances have the opposite effect.

For the purpose of studying the intrinsic risk accumulation mechanism in the state-owned banks under soft budget constraints, this paper structures an expected earning decision model of a state-owned enterprise senior managers and a investment strategy selection model of a typical state-owned bank executive. Through the analysis on the models, we find that state-owned senior managers tend to expand the scale of enterprise's loan and seek loans for its high-risk project under soft budget constraints. Similarly, soft budget constraint motivates executives in state-owned banks to choose high-risk investment behavior. In conclusion, the dual soft budget constraints both in state-owned enterprise and bank lead to the latter's risk accumulation sustained in long term. This paper points out that the future direction of Chinese banking industry reform should harden budget constraints and lay down institution basis for market elimination function.","[Yu, Zhiyong] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,,yuzychn@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-07-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,42,46,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BUS85,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290245000009,0

However, despite the complexity involved in this sector and the often marginal conditions in which agriculture is practised it appears to be important to a large number of black households. Furthermore, the significance they attach to subsistence agriculture as means of supplementing household food supplies seems to heavily outweigh other reasons for engaging in agriculture. Some South African researchers have indicated the contribution subsistence production makes to household food security, despite the prevalent complexities and the low input nature of this production. Statistics South Africa's Labour Force Survey data from 2001 to 2007 and a case study of subsistence farming in Limpopo Province are used to support the argument that, despite the complexity of this sector, the more than 4 million subsistence farmers, need and merit greater support. Such support should be based on the local context, build on and, where appropriate, improve existing local practices, while addressing various existing threats to this type of production. Recommendations are made as to what policy makers need to consider when considering how best to support subsistence production.","[Aliber, M.] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty & Agrarian Studies, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa; [Hart, T.

We find that female-owned businesses are less successful than male-owned businesses because they have less startup capital, less business human capital acquired through prior work experience in a similar business, and less prior work experience in a family business.

A food security target is a well-defined and measurable goal to reduce the numbers of people who lack enough food of the right quality to live healthy lives. To derive baseline indicators for household food security, the following question is asked: what is the average cost of a nutritionally adequate food basket per person? The cost of recommended nutrient intake is based on estimates of dietary energy costs. Reported food expenditure for each household based on 2005/2006 Income and Expenditure Survey data gets compared to two dietary energy cost baskets. The food expenditure shares of the poorest households vary between 38% and 71% according to different surveys. At food expenditure levels reported in the IES, one in five households meet their average dietary energy cost. Deep levels of food insecurity exist in rural areas with 85% of rural households unable to afford even the 'below average dietary energy costs'. Food security policy based on refined baseline indicators can better target food insecure households. Another policy benefit is that robust indicators help to develop effective monitoring capabilities.","Human Sci Res Council, Ctr Poverty Employment & Growth, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa,"Jacobs, PT (通讯作者)，Human Sci Res Council, Ctr Poverty Employment & Growth, Private Bag X9182, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa.",PJacobs@hsrc.ac.za,,"JACOBS, PETER T/0000-0001-5142-9059",,,,,31,27,40,1,8,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2009,48.0,4,,,,,410,433,,,,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,586UM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276939000004,0

The key result, robust across all scenarios, is that countries with fixed exchange rates will find it much harder to simultaneously meet the criteria than inflation targeters. Probit estimates on the ability of a country to get inflation below the reference value under a fixed exchange rate show a strong effect for the relative price level. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Primarily based on information collected through a field survey in eleven villages, the paper seeks to explain the nature and implications of institutional unevenness in the development of capitalism. Institutional diversity is not simply mapped across space, it is also manifested in the simultaneous existence of market and non-market institutions across the means of production within the same village or spatial context. In addition, there is a continuous and complex interaction among these institutions which both shapes and is shaped by this capitalist transition. Primitive accumulation emerges as a continuing characteristic of the on-going agrarian and non-agrarian capitalist transition. Institutional adaptation, continuity and hybridity are as integral to the emergence of the market economy as are the processes of creation of new institutions and demise of others. There is no necessary correspondence between the emerging commercialization of the different productive dimensions of the agrarian economy. These uneven processes are deeply influenced by existing and emerging power relations and by the state. Framed by the Bernstein-Byres debate about the contemporary (ir)relevance of the agrarian question, evidence is presented to justify the conclusion that although the processes at work are far from the classical models of the transition to capitalism, all aspects of the agrarian question remain relevant.","[Harriss-White, Barbara] Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Mishra, Deepak K.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Reg Dev, New Delhi 110067, India; [Upadhyay, Vandana] Rajiv Gandhi Univ, Dept Econ, Itanagar 791112, India","University of Oxford; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Rajiv Gandhi University, Itanagar","Harriss-White, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Queen Elizabeth House,3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",barbara.harriss-white@qeh.ox.ac.uk; deepakmishra@mail.jnu.ac.in; uvandanaa@yahoo.co.in,,"Mishra, Deepak/0000-0002-7244-8280",,,,,62,31,32,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The limited liability of banks and the presence of a negative externality of one bank's failure on the health of other banks give rise to a systemic risk-shifting incentive where all banks undertake correlated investments, thereby increasing economy-wide aggregate risk. Regulatory mechanisms such as bank closure policy and capital adequacy requirements that are commonly based only on a bank's own risk fail to mitigate aggregate risk-shifting incentives, and can, in fact, accentuate systemic risk. Prudential regulation is shown to operate at a collective level, regulating each bank as a function of both its joint (correlated) risk with other banks as well as its individual (bank-specific) risk.

Demonstrative applications are provided for Swiss inflation that show that (i) the communication of monetary policy announcements generates an asymmetric response for inflation forecasts, (ii) the pass-through effect of import price releases on inflation forecasts is weak, and (iii) macroeconomic releases of real and nominal variables generate nonsynchronized effects for inflation forecasts.

We therefore investigate the determinants of bondholders' abnormal returns for both domestic and cross-border bank merger announcements that involve European acquirers for the period 1998-2002. We find that bondholders' abnormal returns are higher for Domestic Mergers than cross-border mergers, in direct contrast to evidence from equity prices where no difference is found. Further investigations in which we control for the changes in market power for example suggest this result may be indicative of investors perceiving Domestic Mergers as increasing the probability of a government bailout in case of distress. Banks' bondholders also experience higher abnormal returns when the country of the partner bank has stricter rules in relation to forbearance of prudential regulations than the own country, and when functional diversification between lending and fee/trading activities increases.

No econometric evidence of the impact of land transfers has been provided to date and this paper attempts to fill this gap by considering the impact of receiving a land grant on households' food insecurity. Propensity score matching and univariate probit estimates using two national household Surveys indicate that, on average, land grant recipients are more food insecure than comparable non-participants. Recursive bivariate probit estimates suggest that selection bias is not driving this result. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare performance, asset flows, and risk incentives to establish several key differences between these two scenarios: First, prior to concurrent management, hedge fund managers experience worse performance while mutual fund managers achieve better performance relative to their full-time peers. Second, hedge fund managers who choose concurrent management are disproportionately the ones with less experience. Their hedge funds tend to suffer a decline in performance after the event. By contrast, mutual fund managers who choose concurrent management tend to outperform their full-time peers, Based on our findings, we make important recommendations for policy makers and companies. The relevance of our recommendations extends beyond the small share of companies presently engaged in concurrent management. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, either banks are originating and selling loans of lower quality borrowers based on unobservable private information (adverse selection), and/or loan sales lead to diminished bank monitoring that affects borrowers negatively (moral hazard).

The study astutely combines ethnographic and historical detail from in-depth case studies in Mpumalanga Province with critical analysis of land reform policies, and locates these within larger theoretical debates on property rights, citizenship and identity. The author argues that a profound and unresolved tension exists within South Africa's land reform programme between broad and inclusive conceptions of 'rights' that are linked to notions of restored citizenship and sovereignty, and a conception of 'property' as individualized ownership of land, implying a much narrower conception of citizenship. The study also focuses on the roles of a variety of mediators and 'brokers' in land reform. Despite its many strengths, the study is not entirely convincing, partly because some key policy debates are mischaracterized.

We show that even when agents' trading needs are perfectly matched, costly market presence prevents them from synchronizing their trades and hence gives rise to endogenous order imbalances and the need for liquidity. Moreover, the endogenous liquidity need, when it occurs, is characterized by excessive selling of significant magnitudes. Such liquidity-driven selling leads to market crashes in the absence of any aggregate shocks. Finally, we show that illiquidity in the market leads to high expected returns, negative and asymmetric return serial correlation, and a positive relation between trading volume and future returns. We also propose new measures of liquidity based on its asymmetric impact on prices and demonstrate a negative relation between these measures and expected stock returns.

CASE STUDY ON EDUCATIONAL SERVICES,AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC,,,English,Article,,,,,,educational services; improving the quality of services; total quality management; assessing performance; the general strategic chart,,"Improving quality represents for all organizations and especially for those in services one of the most important strategies for enhancing performance and competitiveness. In the current social and economic context, the evaluation of the performance of organizations must be approached holistically. Performance means a special result, obtained in a certain field, which expresses the quality of the adjustment of the organization to the conditions in the environment. Currently, it is necessary to rethink the whole approach to the ways of evaluating performance. The continuous quest for meeting and even surpassing clients' expectations, the involvement of all employees in the organization and the permanent improvement of quality represent important dimensions of Total Quality Management (TQM). As any strategy, TQM comprises a series of activities which lead to meeting all the quality objectives, by optimum use of available resources and of the strengths of the organization. The European model of excellence (the EFQM model established by the European Foundation for Quality Management) provides a set of criteria which can be applied to any enterprise and subsidiary so as to assess performance obtained through TQM. The EFQM model represents a non-prescriptive framework which recognizes the existence of numerous different approaches allowing organizations to obtain sustainable excellence. This framework contains basic concepts specific to The European Quality Award (EQA). Our study presents the use of the European model of TQM as a reference point for management and of the improvement of the quality of services rendered by educational organizations, giving practical applicability and utility to the theoretical concepts presented. It proves that by applying the European model of excellence to assess the performance of educational organizations, a real diagnosis can be performed, which contributes to the elaboration of strategies for improving the quality of training and educational services, adapted to the realities of each school.","[Ioncica, Maria; Petrescu, Eva-Cristina; Ioncica, Diana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Negoita, Iolanda Magdalena] Econ Coll Buzau, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ioncica, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",maria.ioncica@com.ase.ro; negoita_iolanda@yahoo.com; eva_petrescu@yahoo.com; diana_ioncica@yahoo.com,"PETRESCU, EVA-CRISTINA/IQT-9854-2023",,,,,,9,9,11,0,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2009,11.0,26,,,,,402,411,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,462KQ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267351800019,0

This paper extends that argument by showing that the activation of money and economics as aspects of a person's self-concept is one mechanism possibly producing these results. Study I showed that employed adults explicitly primed to think about their own time in terms of money were less willing to volunteer compared to those primed to think about another person's time in terms of money, illustrating the importance of the self-concept in the economic evaluation of time. Mediation analyses showed that participants' view of themselves as economic evaluators fully accounted for both the effect of the manipulation and variation in prior experience with hourly payment on willingness to volunteer. Study 2 showed the undergraduates supraliminally primed with either money or economic concepts were less willing to volunteer their time. The findings suggest that economic evaluation is one causal mechanism affecting attitudes about time use.

We differentiate between direct effects of over-education and indirect effects via other job characteristics that are associated with over-education. Additional fixed-effects estimates are executed to account for individual heterogeneity. The utility consequences of over-education are found to be large and cannot be compensated by a reasonable wage increase at the start of the first employment. These outcomes suggest that, at labour-market entry, over-education is largely involuntary, and is likely to induce negative productivity costs. The negative consequences of over-education are also found to diminish with years of work experience. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper estimates the reactions using high-frequency data on nominal and index-linked bond yields, allowing the effects of news announcements on real rates and inflation compensation to be parsed far more precisely than is possible using daily data. Long-term nominal yields and forward rates are very sensitive to macroeconomic news announcements. Inflation compensation is sensitive to announcements about price indices and monetary policy. However, for news announcements about real economic activity, such as nonfarm payrolls, the vast majority of the sensitivity is concentrated in real rates. Accordingly, most of the sizeable impact of news about real economic activity on the nominal term structure of interest rates represents changes in expected future real short-term interest rates and/or real risk premia rather than changes in expected future inflation and/or inflation risk prernia. Such sensitivity of real rates to macroeconomics news is hard to rationalize within the framework of existing macroeconomic models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Enforcement of insider trading laws improves price informativeness, as measured by firm-specific stock return variation, but this increase is concentrated in developed markets. In emerging market countries, price informativeness changes insignificantly after the enforcement, as the important contribution of insiders in impounding information into stock prices largely disappears. The enforcement does not achieve the goal of improving price informativeness in countries with poor legal institutions. It does turn some private information into public information, thereby reducing the cost of equity in emerging markets.","[Fernandes, Nuno] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariaris, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ferreira, Miguel A.] ISCTE Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Fernandes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariaris, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal.",nfernandes@fcee.ucp.pt,"Ferreira, Miguel/HHZ-6251-2022; Ferreira, Miguel/B-7931-2009","Ferreira, Miguel/0000-0003-0537-2703; Fernandes, Nuno/0000-0002-7156-7077",,,,,40,209,241,7,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

It is found, among other things, that remittances can have significant positive long-run effects on growth. The author confronts the implications of the theoretical model proposed with panel data for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. After considering the effect of long-run investment and demographic variables, and controlling for fixed time and country effects, the empirical analysis indicates that financial intermediation tends to increase the responsiveness of growth to remittances. The overall conclusion is that making financial services more generally available should lead to even better use of remittances, thus boosting growth in these countries.","Univ Oslo, Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Mundaca, BG (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",gabriela.mundaca@frisch.uio.no,,"Mundaca, Gabriela/0000-0003-3448-8406",,,,,46,146,159,1,29,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The choice between the EGS and other activities is modeled in a dynamic optimization framework, taking into account a fixed wage rate and certainty of employment under the EGS and a stochastic wage rate under other activities. Specifically, volatility of wages in the rural labor markets has important implications for switches into the EGS and for concomitant welfare effects. Under such conditions, the higher the EGS wage, the greater is its attractiveness to relatively skilled and affluent workers, and for those already in it to continue.

We analyze the allocation of state road investments in Norway from 1973-1997 exploiting unique data on characteristics of voters, legislative representation and tax prices in 19 election districts. Geographical representation to parliament is biased, mostly due to an ancient constitution.

The term self-enforcing, however, is a bit misleading. The concept refers to the stability of cooperative agreements, not to enforcing compliance with these agreements once they are in place. In this paper we analyze an IEA game in which parties to an agreement finance an independent monitor who audits the compliance performance of the members of an agreement. These audits reveal instances of noncompliance so they can be sanctioned. We find that costly monitoring of compliance limits the circumstances under which international cooperation to protect the environment is worthwhile, but when IEAs do form they will often involve greater participation than IEAs that do not require costly monitoring. Consequently, costly monitoring of IEAs can produce higher international environmental quality. Moreover, under certain conditions, aggregate welfare is higher when IEAs require costly monitoring.","[McEvoy, David M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Stranlund, John K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"McEvoy, D (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Raley Hall,416 Howard St,ASU Box 32051, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",mcevoydm@appstate.edu; stranlund@resecon.umass.edu,,,,,,,37,21,28,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

After policy implementation, allowances were disproportionately higher in locations that (a) supported the president in the 1996 election and (b) were represented by members of the House or Senate Armed Services Committees.","[Carrell, Scott E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carrell, Scott E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hauge, Janice A.] Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Carrell, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",secarrell@ucdavis.edu; jhauge@unt.edu,,,,,,,33,2,3,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2009,138.0,3-4,,,,,367,386,,10.1007/s11127-008-9363-1,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,422NZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264436300006,0

This problem is most likely to be present when individuals are allowed to select a no purchase option instead of being forced to choose from an explicit set of SP alternatives with hypothetical attribute levels. A convenient feature of our model is that researchers do not need to know exactly which omitted real substitute the individual most prefers, only the set of real substitutes that exists. In our empirical illustration, a comparison of rival models suggests researchers who overlook the presence of perceived real alternatives related to an SP experiment can end up with noticeably biased welfare estimates. Our more-general model suggests that it may be prudent for future SP researchers to anticipate, then test and possibly correct for, distortions in utility parameter estimates that result from this problem.","[Cameron, Trudy Ann] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [DeShazo, J.

For this purpose, we present a new methodology to describe the joint distribution of GARCH processes in a non-normal setting. Then, we provide expressions for the response of the moments of the subsequent distribution to a shock. This tool enhances the understanding of the temporal evolution of the joint distribution. We use our methodology to provide stylized facts for the four largest international stock markets. In particular, we document the persistence of large (positive or negative) daily returns. In a multivariate setting , we find that foreign holdings provide a good hedge against changes in domestic volatility after good shocks but a bad hedge after crashes. Finally, using generalized impulse responses, we show that the effect of shocks on the higher moments of the distribution is short-lasting.","[Rockinger, Michael] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1012 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rockinger, Michael] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, CEPR, CH-1012 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Lausanne,"Rockinger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1012 Lausanne, Switzerland.",michael.rockinger@unil.ch,"Jondeau, Eric/D-2072-2018",,,,,,33,12,12,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 37(6), 1047-1066] model to allow for a central bank that penalizes nominal interest rate paths that are too close to the zero lower bound. We analytically derive the optimal interest-rate policy rule in each equilibrium under four policy regimes: (i) benchmark commitment to an ex-ante optimal monetary-policy plan; (ii) benchmark discretionary policy; (iii) optimal delegation to a discretionary policy maker with similar preferences to society; and (iv) optimal delegation to a discretionary policy maker with an additional taste for interest-rate smoothing. Under the commitment benchmark, the optimal interest-rate rule is proved to be intrinsically inertial, whereas this property is non-existent under discretionary policy. In the absence of commitment, there are gains to delegating policy to an interest-rate smoothing central banker. We show that while the endogenous law of one price gap in the model exacerbates the optimal policy trade-off that arises under discretionary policy, the latter feature of interest-rate smoothing acts to weaken it, by mimicking intrinsic inertia under the commitment policy.

We show that, under very general hypotheses, the 'golden rule of public finance', which allows a government to run public-investment-oriented fiscal deficits, leads to a lower balanced-growth path in the long run, and eventually in the short run, compared with balanced-budget rules. Welfare effects are more difficult to assess, and depend on the form of the utility function. Our model shows that debt rules such as the golden rule may improve (if the consumption elasticity of substitution is 'low') or weaken (if the consumption elasticity of substitution is 'high') intertemporal welfare. Consequently, a balanced-budget rule does not necessarily dominate debt rules from the point of view of welfare, while it does from the point of view of long-run economic growth.","[Minea, Alexandru; Villieu, Patrick] Univ Orleans, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Minea, Alexandru] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite de Orleans; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Minea, A (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France.",alexandru.minea@u-clermont1.fr; patrick.villieu@univ-orleans.fr,,,,,,,30,36,40,0,10,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0143-5671,,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Countries with such noneconomic partnerships also find it easier to engage in economic exchanges since they face the possibility that debt default might also spill over to hinder their noneconomic relationships. We present a theoretical model of these ideas and then verify their empirical importance using a bilateral cross-section of data on international cross-holdings of assets and environmental treaties.

Individuals differ in terms of their risk aversion. Risk-averse individuals take more care of their health and are relatively high risk in the annuities market and relatively low risk in the long-term care insurance market. In the long-term care insurance market, both separating and partial-pooling equilibria are possible. However, in the stand-alone annuity market, only separating equilibria are possible. We show, consistent with the extant empirical research, that in the presence of administration costs the more risk-averse individuals may buy relatively more long-term care insurance and more annuity coverage. Under the same assumptions, we show that equilibria exist with bundled contracts that Pareto dominate the outcomes with stand-alone contracts and are robust to competition from stand-alone contracts. The remaining empirical puzzle is to explain why bundled contracts are such a small share of the voluntary annuity market.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Webb, DC (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",d.c.webb@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,23,24,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The authors develop a simple model to investigate whether the introduction of an LCR affects a multinational's choice of technology transfer. The key assumption made in their analysis is that the multinational in an LDC prefers importing intermediate inputs from its home country, for the manufacture of final goods, to purchasing them from local suppliers equipped with outdated technology. However, the LCR of the LDC forces the multinational to purchase a fixed proportion of its intermediate inputs. The authors show that the magnitude of an LCR policy cannot affect the multinational's decision regarding technology transfer under technology diffusion. In addition, an increase in the LCR may foreclose technology diffusion because it could make the multinational establish its own intermediate input supplier(s) and become a vertically integrated multinational.","[Chun, Bong Geul] Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, Seoul 130743, South Korea; [Kwon, Chul-Woo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Taegu 702701, South Korea",University of Seoul; Kyungpook National University,"Chun, BG (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, 90 Jeonnong Dong, Seoul 130743, South Korea.",cwkwon@knu.ac.kr; bgchun@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,28,9,12,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It is also associated with increased volume and decreased open interest in option markets after the release, consistent with market participants using financial options to hedge or speculate on macroeconomic news.","[Beber, Alessandro] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brandt, Michael W.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Brandt, Michael W.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Amsterdam; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Beber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,Global Capital Markets Center of Duke University; National Center of Competence in Research,Global Capital Markets Center of Duke University; National Center of Competence in Research(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank an anonymous referee, Ken Baron, Andrea Buraschi, Mikhail Chernov, Domenico Cuoco, Darrell Duffie, Wayne Ferson, Michael Fleming, Michael Johannes, Krishna Ramaswamy, Tano Santos, Pascal St-Amour, Suresh Sundaresan, Raman Uppal, Josef Zechner (the editor) and seminar participants at the Adam Smith Asset Pricing conference, 2007 American Finance Association meetings, Bank of Italy, Baruch College, Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, the 2006 European Finance Association meetings, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the CEPR Summer Symposium in Gerzensee, the Skinance conference, Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Illinois, the University of North Carolina, the University of Lausanne, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Venice, and the University of Wisconsin for comments.

To fill this gap, this study aims to address the question: what kind of method is being used to improve the employee's performance? To answer this question, we need to find out the motivational factors that lead to performance improvement and explore the role that inner motivation and leader-member exchange play in performance improvement. The study consisted of two steps. First of all, we interviewed four employees from commercial banks in Beijing and find out their opinions on the motivational factors. Secondly, we distributed 208 questionnaires to employees in banks. Based on theory of expectancy and Denisi and Pritchard's framework, the hypothesized research model were examined using structural equation modeling technique in LISREL. The result showed that both inner motivation and leader-member exchange act as two mediators in the relationship between expectation links and employees' performance improvement.","[Ma Jieling; Zhang Tingting; Song Jiwen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,songjiwen@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,6,M D FORUM,ALLAWAH NSW,"17 AUGUSTA ST, ALLAWAH NSW, 2218, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9806854-2-8,,,,2009,,,,,,,1761,1770,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BPO33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279533000219,0

Results indicate that consumers of nearly all of the commodities analyzed will encounter welfare losses, while almost all producers of these commodities will experience welfare gains. However, the gains by producers are insufficient to compensate consumers' losses, and all fourteen West African nations analysed will end up with net welfare losses from these reforms. This finding validates other research results indicating that net food importing countries will become losers of agricultural trade reform, while net food exporters will experience more welfare gains.

Strategies investigated include those directed at increasing the number and size of cocoa pods, those aimed at reducing hosts for pest transmission, two input-intensive approaches, and the alternative of doing nothing beyond harvesting mature cocoa pods. Using 2005 production data from 600 cocoa farms, we identify factors correlated with adoption of each treatment and, controlling for treatment, isolate factors that influence cocoa yields. To study the conditional profitability of input allocation, we compare observed factor shares with profit-maximising input levels and derive lessons for extension efforts. We conclude that the average increase in private returns arising from more intensive cocoa management appears sufficient to compensate for higher production costs, but that observed extension efforts have not been correlated with higher profits among farmers in the sample.","[Shively, Gerald E.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Perdew, Jessica Grace] Kraft Foods Global Inc, Chicago, IL USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Kraft Heinz,"Shively, GE (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",shivelyg@purdue.edu,,,,,,,17,3,3,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

In time and across different countries, economists have attempted to estimate the benefits of education at an individual level (private benefits) and have extented returns to the overall society (social benefits). Although many studies have highlighted the benefits of education in the labor market, there are approaches of non-economic benefits, such as greater social cohesion, lower crime and better health, arising from better-educated people. The funding sources of education have been grouped into two broad categories: public and private. We have presented an overview of the public and private costs in the recent years in Romania, in comparison with those of the European countries. The relative importance of the funds allocated to education in Romania has been considered on the basis of some indicators of internal efficiency and performance or students outcomes. There are some limitations concerning the implementation of cost-benefit analysis in education, whereas becomes difficult a rigorous estimation of the social benefits, as a result of some differences between women and men, on the level of schooling and also depending on the country. Despite these limitations, we support the idea that there is a growing need to use this method in order to increase the efficiency in allocation and use of resources in education.","[Sava, Anca-Stefania; Zugravu, Bogdan-Gabriel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,sava.anca@yahoo.com; zugravu@uaic.ro,"Zugravu, Bogdan Gabriel/JTT-2655-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,2,15,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,577,585,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000088,0

Therefore, in China to what extent nature resources such as land and water can sustain the grain production is in question. By reviewing cultivated land protecting policies and institution reforms of water resources, we conclude that further institution reforms are needed, especially proper incentive structure needs to be taking into account in designing cultivated land protection policy to modify the failure of topdown mode. Institution reform such as water use rights reform, the role of water use associations and water pricing reform should be further enhanced to meet the increasing scarcity of water resources.

Moreover, it has been widely reported that the Federal Reserve played a major role in supplying liquidity to financial markets during this distressed time. This article describes two ways in which the Fed has supplied liquidity since late 2007. The first is traditional: The Fed supplies liquidity by providing credit through open market operations and by lending to depository institutions at the so-called discount window. The second is by enhancing the liquidity of portfolios of some institutions by replacing their less-liquid assets with more-liquid assets. The Fed has used the second approach since late 2007. Unlike several previous occasions, however, it began supplying liquidity in the first, more traditional way only recently-in September 2008. This article notes that the Fed departed from its long-standing tradition of minimizing its effect on the allocation of credit by supplying liquidity to institutions that it believed to be most in need; at the same time, it neutralized the effects of these actions on the total supply of liquidity in the financial market. The article also discusses the Fed's reasons for reallocating credit this time rather than simply increasing the total supply of financial market liquidity.

The basic assumption is that firms that have exhausted scale economies are in non-increasing returns to scale. The same firms are also assumed to have a size greater than MES estimated on sales (total turnover), employment or fixed assets. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used, on a sample of firms in three Greek manufacturing industries, to classify firms in operation according to increasing or non-increasing returns to scale. On the basis of the results of the DEA input oriented model, the MES measure correctly predicts over 85% of the cases. A probit model is applied to those cases that are not identically predicted by MES concerning returns to scale. Results indicate that technical efficiency, size and age are the factors that compel MES to yield the same prediction as the DEA approach.","[Tsekouras, Kostas; Dimara, Efthalia; Skuras, Dimitris; Tzelepis, Dimitris] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Patras 26500, Greece",University of Patras,"Tsekouras, K (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26500, Greece.",tsekour@econ.upatras.gr,"SKURAS, DIMITRIOS/B-4964-2012","Tsekouras, Kostas/0000-0002-9524-3237; Skuras, Dimitris/0000-0002-7146-9549",,,,,36,1,1,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

However, in practice, one may not get limited to the operating activities of these entities, but the risk management in a company also ought to comprise the investment and financial activities. Only such a formula ensures the comprehensive management of any threats in the activities of construction businesses. In Polish construction companies, no risk management systems have been implemented so far that would comprise all the areas and levels of these companies functioning. Also, there's no independent occupation of a risk manager in the Polish construction industry. Due to such innovations, it would be possible to limit the risk negative impact in a company. In particular, the operated system of the integrated risk management would allow for timely anticipation of some of the types of threats or for determining the most suitable manner of risk response. The risk management system operated within the company ought to be fully IT-supported.

By principle, each risk manager ought to possess the relevant knowledge about the potential threats in the company, so as to manage the risk effectively.

Risk and hazardous factors can be eliminated and controlled effectively to guarantee project quality. It can play important role for the development of blasting enterprises. By analyzing characteristics of blasting engineering and importance of safety management, an innovation mode of whole process quality management of engineering blasting enterprise based on engineering supervision is proposed in this paper. Safety management of blasting enterprise can be divided into three stages, pre-blasting, blasting and post-blasting. Meanwhile, safety supervision is carried out in the whole process of blasting. Basic methods and emphasis of safety construction of blasting in different stages can be also proposed to standardize and normalize design and construction for blasting enterprises.

The cost-benefit Analysis of major rice-planting household shows that current different mode of agricultural subsidies in China played different roles in promotion of the scale operation of peasant households. The three kinds of subsides, including purchase subsidies of agricultural machines, subsidies of superior seed varieties and trial soil testing for determining appropriate fertilizer formulas, and subsidy of major grain farming household, played positive role in land consolidation and farming a large scale, but the direct food subsidies imposed negative influence on large-scale production. As we know, although land consolidation and farming a large scale has slightly increased during those years, land fragmentation is likely to remain high in China.

Population growth is endogenous. The problem is analytically solved, yielding closed-form solutions to optimal demographic and economic dynamics. It is shown that provided the economy is not driven to optimal finite time extinction, the optimal solution is egalitarian for appropriate choices of the critical utility levels: all individuals of any cohort are given the same consumption.

Our main finding is that the efficiency and labor wedges generally account for most of the fluctuations in output, consumption, investment and hours of work. We also looked for different factors which could generate the wedges.

This article reviews the existing empirical evidence on the impacts of environmental monitoring and enforcement actions. We first provide context by investigating the U.S. regulatory setting. We then briefly discuss how economists think about environmental enforcement. We next consider recent empirical evidence linking regulator actions to subsequent pollution discharges and compliance behavior. Since the literature primarily studies U.S. institutions, our review focuses mainly on the effects of Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. state activities. The consistent findings from this literature review are as follows: (1) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate substantial specific deterrence, reducing future violations at the targeted firm; (2) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate substantial general deterrence, reducing future violations at facilities other than the targeted one; and (3) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate not only reductions in violations but also significant reductions in emissions.

This freely disposable time (FDT) may be put to any use available and allowed in the local context, such as above-basic leisure, work to acquire above-basic consumer goods, or investments in the future such as education or soil conservation. Thus, FDT represents people's freedoms and a key condition for any out-of-poverty strategy.

The first two biases are known in the literature, and we offer insight on the size of the bias for a specific example. Our work on spatially transferable risk is novel. We develop the concept and show how it may undermine typical invasion prevention strategies. We find three key results. First, partial equilibrium estimates of welfare loss are significantly overestimated relative to general equilibrium estimates. If ecosystem services and market goods are substitutes the partial equilibrium bias is greater than if they are compliments. Second, well-intended policies do not necessarily reduce overall risk; risk reduction actions can transfer risk to another time or location, or both, which may increase total risk. Third, policies of quotas and inspections have to be extreme to improve welfare, with inspections having advantages over quotas.","[Warziniack, Travis] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Finnoff, David; Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Bossenbroek, Jonathan] Univ Toledo, Toledo, OH 43618 USA; [Lodge, David] Univ Notre Dame, Ctr Aquat Conservat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Wyoming; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; University of Notre Dame,"Warziniack, T (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",warziniack@eco.uni-heidelberg.de; finnoff@uwyo.edu; jonathan.bossenbroek@utoledo.edu; jramses@uwyo.edu; dlodge@nd.edu,"Warziniack, Travis/JXL-2826-2024; Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021; Bossenbroek, Jonathan M/F-3664-2011; Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019; Bossenbroek, Jonathan/C-9184-2012","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Finnoff, David/0000-0003-0775-9733; Warziniack, Travis/0000-0002-9431-2288",,,,,49,11,14,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

First we derive conditions under which the LA problem is equivalent to the MV and CVaR problems and solve analytically the two-asset problem of the LA investor for a risk-free and a risky asset. Then we run simulation experiments to study properties of the optimal LA and MV portfolios under more realistic assumptions. We find that under asymmetric dependence LA portfolios outperform MV portfolios, provided investors are sufficiently loss-averse and dependence is large. Finally, using 13 EU and US assets, we implement the trading strategy of a linear LA investor who reallocates his/her portfolio on a monthly basis. We find that LA portfolios clearly outperform MV and CVaR portfolios and that incorporating a dynamic update of the LA parameters significantly improves the performance of LA portfolios.

The Harbor Communities Time Location Study (HCTLS) examines the nature, extent and implications of underreported locations/trips in a case study which used portable Global Positioning Systems (GPS) devices to track the diurnal patterns and traffic exposure of 47 residents of communities near the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex. Participants were similar to adults nationwide in time spent indoors, in-vehicle, and outdoors, but spent more time indoors at home (78% vs. 66%). Overall, participants did not report nearly half (49%) of the locations and trips identified in GPS-enhanced data on their activity diaries, resulting in about 3 h/day in unreported locations and 0.6 h/day in unreported trips. The probability of a location/trip being underreported was systematically correlated with participant and location/trip characteristics. Self-reported data missed about 50 min of heightened air pollution exposures during the 5 h/day on average participants spent in high-traffic areas and about 30 min during the 4 h/day near truck routes.

Maritime transport in the Arctic: an analysis of shipowners' intentions,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sea shipping and transportation; Arctic; Arctic routes; Shipping; Northwest Passage; Northeast Passage,,"The seasonal melting of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, which has been confirmed for several summers in a row and is widely documented, has become a hot topic in the media. It is fuelling many speculative scenarios about the purported renewal of a cold war, or even an actual armed conflict, in the Arctic, for the control of both its natural resources and its sea routes. The melting sea ice is indeed giving a second wind to projects, abandoned in the 19th century, to find shorter sea routes between Europe and Asia. A look at the map shows the savings in distance that can be achieved with the Arctic routes: for example, a trip between London and Yokohama through the Northwest Passage is 15,700 km and 13,841 km through the Northeast Passage, which is significantly shorter than the route through Suez (21,200 km) or Panama (23,300 km).(2) These findings fuel the idea that these Arctic routes, because they are shorter, are bound to attract abundant through traffic, and consequently will become a major political issue. Amid the media widespread image of a future maritime highway across Arctic seas, even some scientists yield to the popular image and assert, without proof, that Arctic traffic is set to increase rapidly.(3) Beyond the seemingly decisive advantage of Arctic routes, however, there remain many obstacles to navigation (Lasserre, 2010d). In addition, these scenarios for the development of marine traffic in the Arctic remain highly speculative and are not based on an analysis of shipowners' perceptions, which is the goal of this paper. This article will thus present the results of an empirical survey conducted among shipping companies to determine their interest in developing activities in the Arctic. Besides examining the potential development of shipping in Arctic routes, this research must be replaced in the context of intense competition between shippers, competition that makes both service reliability and costs of transport paramount. In this competition structure, the benefits of established routes between major hubs seems to prevail, so that new routes have difficulty being established. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of quality, perceived by the traditional consumer in the classical, deterministic and objective sense, loses its facets nowadays and transcends into another dimension, in the vision of the new consumer, in which the perception of quality in a predominantly subjective manner, comes first. This paper presents the objectives of a research project that we intend to develop, in order to highlight the mutations that occurred in the foodstuff quality perception of the new consumers from Romania. We focused on foodstuff because it is a customary part of our daily lives, that shouldn't be approached merely as a common factor for meeting physiological needs of macro and micro-nutrients, but from a holistic perspective in terms of its social and identity functions and the effects on individual health. Another important goal of the project is to improve the standard of education and culture in foodstuff consumption and to give to the new consumers from Romania the skills for an objective assessment of food quality.

Using a unique data set of aggregate business failures of both private and public firms from 1926 to 1997, I build portfolios that track news about future firm failures. These tracking portfolios optimally hedge aggregate distress risk and earn a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) alpha of approximately -4% a year. Both HML and SMB predict changes in future failure rates. Small stocks have lower returns than large stocks and value stocks have lower returns than growth stocks when the market expects an increase in future failure rates. Finally, a two-factor model with the market and the tracking portfolio for aggregate distress as factors does as well as the Fama-French three-factor model in pricing the 25 size and book-to-market sorted portfolios.

We find a positive relation between CEO risk-taking (vega) incentives and cash holdings, and we find a negative relation between vega and the value of cash to shareholders. The negative effect of vega on the value of cash is robust after controlling for corporate governance, is stronger in firms with high leverage, is reversed for unlevered firms, and is not present in financially constrained firms. We also find that the likelihood of liquidity covenants in new bank loans is increasing in CEO vega incentives. Our evidence primarily supports the costly contracting hypothesis, which asserts that bondholders anticipate greater risk-taking in high vega firms and, therefore, require greater liquidity.

The anti-mining movement was studied during five months of participant and qualitative research, focusing on its strategies and discourses. The movement is multiscalar, with local, national and transnational dimensions, but the defence of community is a central claim in its discourse. The community is reclaimed as a legitimate scale for decision-making by the anti-mining movement because it is: (a) the scale that suffers the material impacts of mining; (b) the place of Maya cultural resistance for reimagining alternative development projects; and (c) an historically marginalized sector of the population, that should be empowered in order to achieve more participative and fair decision-making processes. As in other peasant struggles, defending the community is not an objective per se, but a strategy to contest domination. The community is dialectically redefined in relation to Guatemala's historical injustices.","Autonomous Univ Barcelona, ICTA, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Urkidi, L (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, ICTA, Sci Bldg C,9th Area,4th Floor, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain.",leire.urkidi@gmail.com,,"URKIDI AZKARRAGA, LEIRE/0000-0003-3141-3556",,,,,110,60,79,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

When we use changes in breadth of institutional ownership as a new metric of information content to corroborate our findings, we find that splits with the greatest increase in breadth experience positive post-split abnormal returns and positive abnormal earnings growth.

We combine the results of the dynamic model with an empirical study of nonmarket forest benefits to create a bioeconomic model of ecosystem management. Estimating the empirical model in a Bayesian framework allows us to treat the economic coefficients of the dynamic model as random variables. We specify distributions for the biological parameters and examine the effects of both biological and economic uncertainty on the predictive distribution of net benefits. We find that the net benefits of the program are positive, and that uncertainty in the biological model contributes substantially more to the variance of our estimate than does uncertainty over the valuation of the resource.","[Moore, Christopher C.] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Phaneuf, Daniel J.; Thurman, Walter N.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; North Carolina State University,"Moore, CC (通讯作者)，US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, NW, 1200 Penn Ave,MC 1809, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",moore.chris@epa.gov,,,,,,,42,4,4,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This study examines the determinants of the initial start-up financing of entrepreneurial firms in 27 countries. There are information asymmetries and moral hazard problems inherent in the funding of an initial start-up firm. Empirical results show that institutional investors rely on the experience of entrepreneurs in managing start-ups and the quality of investor protection to reduce moral hazard. On the other hand, informal investors are also common in initial start-up funding. They tend to be attracted to the type of products in the new firm. In comparison, informal investors are likely to have a social relationship with the entrepreneur, and thus have information about that person's skill and character, which renders entrepreneurial experience less important.

In this article, rather than writing a new survey of the large number of contributions in this active field, we discuss some of its micro-foundations to show that they have a clear and compelling character; then we evoke the debates on the ability of the canonical macroeconomic model DMP (Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides) to replicate stylized facts of the business cycle. We then show that unlike competitive models, the value of this model class is to generate non-trivial policy recommendations. Finally we discuss four tracks for future research: directed research; strategic wage bargaining within firms; on-the-job search; and finally, interactions with other market frictions, including financial and product markets.","Sci Po Paris, Paris, France",,"Wasmer, E (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Paris, France.",etienne.wasmer@sciences-po.fr,,"Wasmer, Etienne/0000-0002-6275-1286",,,,,68,0,0,0,6,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Studying an emerging market provides an excellent opportunity to test whether the consensus on the inability of mutual funds in developed and highly efficient markets to beat the market, also holds in less efficient markets. While the weaknesses of legal institutions and underdeveloped capital markets in emerging countries could negatively contribute to performance, a certain level of market inefficiency might also enable fund managers to successfully apply security selection and therefore beat the market. This paper presents an overview of the Polish mutual fund industry and investigates mutual fund performance using a survivorship bias controlled sample of 140 funds. The latter is done using the Carhart (1997) 4-factor asset-pricing model. In addition, we investigate whether Polish fund managers exhibit hot hands, persistence in performance. Finally the influence of fund characteristics on risk-adjusted performance is considered. Our overall results suggest that Polish mutual funds on average are not able to add value, as indicated by their negative net alphas. Interestingly, domestic funds outperform internationally investing funds, which points at informational advantages of local over foreign investors. Finally, we detect strong persistence in mean returns up to 1 year. It is striking that winning funds are able to significantly beat the market, based on their significantly positive alpha's. These results deviate from studies on developed markets that conclude that even past winners are not able to significantly beat the market. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Traditionally, the focus of such a model system has been major metropolitan areas such as Sydney, where we have developed Tresis (Hensher, 2002). Given the growing concern about regional accessibility to many service classes, there is a need for a modelling capability that can be used to prioritize and guide policy decisions in regions that are often described as remote, rural, low density and small town. In developing a framework that is capable of integrating both demand and supply elements of transportation and land use activity, we recognized the challenges in developing primary data sources, and the high likelihood of a reliance on secondary data sources. This suggested an alternative approach to demand modelling that was not dependent on choice models; namely a suite of continuous choice models in which we capture the actual activities undertaken by each mode on both the demand and supply side at high spatial resolution.

The main innovation in this paper is methodological as the median voter 's satisfaction is described by a Stone-Geary utility function. Then, we are able to specify the public spending function in a simplified linear expenditure system, which can be estimated without price measurement. Then, the median voter model offers a price variable which the voter uses to define her demand for local public goods. So, we are able to estimate the specification with a price measurement. We provide new evidence using French municipalities of more than 20,000 inhabitants. The main results suggest that the minimum public spending value is dominant but decreases with the population size. Estimates oblained with price measurement lead to an overestimation of the preferences parameter and to an underestimalion of the minimum part. Price and income elasticities are greater than values obtained with the traditional method.","Univ Rennes 1, CREM, UMR CNRS 6211, F-35014 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Binet, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM, UMR CNRS 6211, F-35014 Rennes, France.",Marie-estelle.binet@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,23,0,0,2,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We find that monitoring quality improves when a majority of independent directors serve on at least two of the three principal monitoring committees. These firms exhibit greater sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance, lower excess executive compensation, and reduced earnings management. The improvement in monitoring quality comes at the significant cost of weaker strategic advising and greater managerial myopia. Firms with boards that monitor intensely exhibit worse acquisition performance and diminished corporate innovation. Firm value results suggest that the negative advising effects outweigh the benefits of improved monitoring, especially when acquisitions or corporate innovation are significant value drivers or the firm's operations are complex.

This approach is particularly useful for evaluating projects in the framework of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), although it may also be used in trans-national projects in other geographical areas. The methodology is based on the appraisal of spatial spillovers generated by trans-national projects by using accessibility indicators (access to markets) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Projects are split into sections and spillover effects of each section are then computed. The sections that produce a high proportion of spillovers in relation to internal benefits generate a high EVA. Additionally, indicators are obtained of the effects of each section in terms of spatial concentration on the different countries affected, efficiency (general improvement in accessibility) and territorial cohesion (reduction in accessibility disparities between regions). The validity of this approach is verified by applying it to TEN-T priority project 25. This methodology does not seek to replace existing project appraisal methodologies (particularly the cost-benefit analysis); rather it provides complementary data for decision-making. Sections which are scarcely profitable from the cost-benefit analysis perspective but which have high European value added should receive more European funding than more profitable sections of markedly national interest.

Firstly, the transport and social exclusion discourse, which highlights the role that low mobility plays in the experience of exclusion. Secondly, the widening participation discourse, which emphasises inequitable access to and achievement in higher education (HE) by non-traditional students as a component of social exclusion. The paper reports the results of a series of focus groups, undertaken with current HE students from a diverse range of backgrounds, many of whom may be considered to be non-traditional students. Results suggest that inadequate access to transport is a substantial barrier to access and achievement in HE, for these students. This highlights the influence of transport upon the successful implementation of social policy. Without consideration of transport and the physical accessibility of HE, the aim of increasing and widening participation in HE is unlikely to be realised. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, after checking the validity of a potential criterion method for measuring active commuting route distances, this method was used to assess the validity and reproducibility of four methods of approximating the commuting route distances covered by pedestrians and bicyclists. The methods assessed were: self-estimated distance, straight-line distance, GIS shortest-route distance, and GPS-measured distance. For this purpose, participants were recruited when walking or bicycling in Stockholm, Sweden. Questionnaires and individually-adjusted maps were sent twice to 133 participants. The distances of map-drawn commuting routes functioned as criterion distances. The participants were also asked to estimate their distances. The straight-line distance between origin and destination was measured using map-drawn routes. The shortest route between home addresses and workplace addresses was calculated with three GIS algorithms. Eighty-six trips were measured with GPS. The main results were that test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) exceeded 0.99 for all methods, except for self-estimated distance (ICC = 0.76). No order effects existed between test and retest. Significant differences were, however, noted between criterion distance and self-estimated distance (114 +/- 63%), straight-line distance (79.1 +/- 10.5%), GIS shortest route (112 +/- 18% to 121 +/- 22%) and GPS distance (105 +/- 4%). We conclude that commonly-used distance estimation methods produce systematic errors of differing magnitudes when used in a context of active commuting in suburban and urban environments. These errors can at average level be corrected for, whereas individual relative errors will remain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

How does acceptance vary across different types of corrupt behavior? An original survey of Kathmandu residents shows substantial variation in attitudes toward different types of corrupt behavior. Overall, respondents generally agreed that large-scale bribery was unacceptable, but there was relative discord over behaviors involving petty corruption, gift giving, and favoritism. Education consistently emerged as the primary determinant of these attitudes, with more educated respondents showing less accepting attitudes across the range of corrupt behaviors. These findings suggest that improving access to education in developing countries may reduce the presence of corruption norms and ultimately corruption itself, although further research is needed to test the strength of these relationships outside of Nepal.

On the contrary, we show that higher levels of financial intermediation can increase firm failures. We also find that the beneficial effects of stock market development are more pronounced during the later years of our sample, while the adverse effects of bank intermediation have declined over time.

Three empirical models are estimated utilizing a panel data from Michigan: a fixed effect model, a fixed effect model with lagged dependent variable, and an instrumental variable model. The key findings are that when a school district faces competition from charter schools they spend a larger percentage on instructors (most likely most of this is going toward teachers and not teacher aides), while spending a smaller percentage on employees that support instructors. The models seem to imply that the increased spending on teachers may not be reflected in a salary increase.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Welsch, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Hyland Hall 4400, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",welschd@uww.edu,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

In particular, remittances can enable investing in children's human capital and reduce child labour, key outcomes from the perspective of growth in a developing country. Using data for El Salvador, this article shows: a) a null or insignificant overall impact of remittances on schooling; b) a strong reduction of child wage labour in remittance-recipient households; and c) an increase in unpaid family work activities for children in those households. Moreover, the evidence shows important differences by gender and age of the child in consideration. While girls seem to indeed increase school attendance upon remittance receipts by reducing labour activities, boys do not benefit on average from higher schooling hut some time substitution takes place favouring family work activities over paid jobs. And among secondary school-aged children, the impact of remittance may even be negative for educational prospects.

The results indicate that regulations and incentives that promote private monitoring (PMON) have a positive impact on productivity. Restrictions on banks' activities relating to their involvement in securities, insurance, real estate, and ownership of nonfinancial firms also have a positive impact. Regulations relating to the first and second pillars of Basel II, namely, capital requirements (CAPR) and official supervisory power (SPR) do not have, in general, a statistically significant impact on productivity over the study period although they appear to gain in importance following the onset of the financial crisis in 2007.

Moreover, our estimates reveal that a 1 percentage point increase in copayments leads to an increase in the probability of returning home by 0.04% for residents of welfare care facilities and 3.7% for those of health care facilities and a decrease in the probability of being re-hospitalized by 3.3% for residents of health care facilities and 1.9% for those of medical care facilities.

This simulation analysis was completed in three steps. First, we reviewed the literature to characterize the state-specific individual insurance markets with respect to state regulations and to identify the effect of those regulations on health insurance premiums. Second, we used empirical data to develop premium estimates for the simulation that reflect case-mix as well as state-specific differences in health care markets. Third, we used a revised version of the 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to complete a set of simulations to identify the impact of three different scenarios for national market development. (National market estimates are based on the simulation model with competition among all 50 states and moderate impact assumptions.) We find evidence of a significant opportunity to reduce the number of uninsured under a proposal to allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines. The best scenario to reduce the uninsured, numerically, is competition among all 50 states with one clear winner. The most pragmatic scenario, with a good impact, is one winner in each regional market.","[Parente, Stephen T.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Feldman, Roger; Abraham, Jean; Xu, Yi] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Parente, ST (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",sparente@umn.edu; feldm002@umn.edu; abrah042@umn.edu; xuxxx211@umn.edu,"KOH, Francis/D-2165-2010","Parente, Stephen/0000-0003-1155-9937",,,,,15,10,14,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The article assesses the relative importance of these transfers fir welfare and poverty in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe. A longitudinal analysis based on panel data reveals that private transfers and social insurance transfers are effective in improving welfare and reducing poverty whereas social assistance transfers have little or no effect. Social insurance and social assistance seem to have swapped roles. Social insurance is most relevant for lifting people out of poverty while social assistance if anything has a small role in protecting the non-poor from falling into poverty. We also find that the different types of transfers do not crowd-out each other and that social insurance may in fact reinforce the capacity of private transfers to reduce poverty. Such findings have several policy implications for the near future: (a) poor households in Former Soviet Union transitional economies remain highly vulnerable to shocks in public and private transfers; (b) the 2008-2009 recession is likely to expose this vulnerability and result in a surge in poverty larger than expected; and (c) the social assistance systems remain in great need of pro-poor reforms and cannot currently provide an adequate protection from economic shocks.","[Verme, Paolo] Univ Turin, Dept Econ, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Verme, P (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, Via Po 53, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",paolo.verme@unito.it,"verme, paolo/P-5228-2019","verme, paolo/0000-0002-8754-1138",,,,,28,5,5,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Based on recent psychological research on guilt and shame, we posit that the intensity of shame experienced after buying on impulse will be positively associated with the use of avoidant coping strategies, whereas the intensity of guilt experienced will be positively associated with the use of problem-focused coping strategies. Furthermore, we predict that the use of avoidant coping strategies will be linked with more frequent depressive symptoms and worse financial well-being. These hypotheses were generally supported in an on-line survey of 274 respondents who had recently made an impulse purchase and reported the emotions and coping strategies associated with the event.

We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types of aid for trade have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that aid for trade facilitation reduces the costs of trading. Moreover aid for trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main category of aid for trade, aid to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This fast growth rate was achieved thanks to the development of intensive horticulture and its processes of change from the 1970s to the present day, due to the factors reviewed in the present study.

The incentives for workers with DB pension plans to stay in their jobs shift dramatically over the course of their careers. Moreover, limited transferability of pension wealth across states and between public and private jobs impedes mobility in the labor market. Yet, little is known about the labor market effects of pensions on state and local government workers. The literature on private-employer pensions has made contributions on some of these fronts in recent years that can shed light on policy concerns raised by the possibility that pension plans will be modified in coming years. Moreover, some of the limitations constraining research on pensions may be overcome by focusing on government workers, with recent work on public school teachers pointing the way.

The paper finds strong evidence of buffer stock savings in poor and vulnerable households. It also shows that membership in a financial cooperative is a determinant of higher household liquidity levels.

Lack of information and public awareness are fundamental factors that render informal regulation by civil society ineffective. In India, a number of environmental problems have been addressed using the institution of public interest litigation (PIL) by 'public-spirited' citizens. This paper examines the economic advantage of PIL over other conventional legal forms. An important outcome of judicial interventions of this kind in environmental cases in India is a spillover effect, which generates public information via media coverage. Using a case study, we test whether the judicial directives that followed a PIL filed and the subsequent spillover effect of media publicity were effective in getting the state to enforce the standards. This is done using autoregressive distributed lag models and univariate structural break analysis. The results show that judicial intervention and public information were effective in controlling pollution.","[Rathinam, Francis Xavier] ICRIER, New Delhi 110003, India; [Raja, A.

In an infinite horizon framework with demand uncertainty, we consider a foreign firm's decision on whether to form a joint venture or to open a fully owned subsidiary. Without the possibility of future share adjustment, the foreign firm enters the market through a joint venture if the host-country firm helps to reduce the uncertainty significantly. Consequently, the firm enters at an earlier point in time compared to the situation in which opening a fully owned subsidiary is the only option to the firm. The possibility of future share adjustment in the joint venture further increases the incentive to speed up foreign investment. Although the possibility of share adjustment results in a joint venture buy-out and can reduce the future profits of the host-country firm, it may increase host-country welfare by attracting foreign investment at an earlier point in time.

J,"Greenspan, A",,,,"Greenspan, Alan",,,Activism,INTERNATIONAL FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The US recovery from the 2008 financial and economic crisis has been disappointingly tepid. What is most notable in sifting through the variables that might conceivably account for the lacklustre rebound in GDP growth and the persistence of high unemployment is the unusually low level of corporate illiquid long-term fixed asset investment. As a share of corporate liquid cash flow, it is at its lowest level since 1940. This contrasts starkly with the robust recovery in the markets for liquid corporate securities. What, then, accounts for this exceptionally elevated level of illiquidity aversion? I break down the broad potential sources, and analyse them with standard regression techniques. I infer that a minimum of half and possibly as much as three-fourths of the effect can be explained by the shock of vastly greater uncertainties embedded in the competitive, regulatory and financial environments faced by businesses since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, deriving from the surge in government activism. This explanation is buttressed by comparison with similar conundrums experienced during the 1930s. I conclude that the current government activism is hampering what should be a broad-based robust economic recovery, driven in significant part by the positive wealth effect of a buoyant U.S. and global stock market.","Greenspan Associates LLC, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Greenspan, A (通讯作者)，Greenspan Associates LLC, 1133 Connecticut Ave NW,Suite 810, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",katie.broom@greenspan-associates.com,,,,,,,5,8,8,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1367-0271,,,INT FINANC,Int.

Tariffs were reformed in an across the board manner consistent with implementing World Bank programs: the average tariff was reduced and the dispersion of tariffs was compressed, with the highest tariffs being eliminated. There is limited evidence of political economy influences on the cross sector pattern of tariffs and reforms, except for a tendency to offer greater protection to larger manufacturing sectors in all countries except Uganda. The technocratic reforms have diluted relative protection and political economy influences in all the four countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that these two models differ starkly in terms of their implied predictions. The conditional logit model represents a zero-sum world, in which one region's gain is the other regions' loss. In contrast, the Poisson model implies a positive-sum economy, in which one region's gain is no other region's loss. We also show that all intermediate cases can be represented as a nested logit model with a single outside option. The nested logit turns out to be a linear combination of the conditional logit and Poisson models. Conditional logit and Poisson elasticities mark the polar cases and can therefore serve as boundary values in applied research.

Trade liberalization can result in a race to the bottom in environmental taxes, which makes both countries worse off. This is not due to the terms of trade motive, but rather the incentive, in a strategic setting, to reduce the incidence of transboundary pollution. With command and control policies (emission quotas), countries are unable to influence foreign emissions by strategic choice of domestic policy; hence, there is no race to the bottom. However, with internationally tradable quotas, unless pollution is a pure global public bad, there is a race to the bottom in environmental policy. Under free trade, internationally nontradable quotas result in the lowest pollution level and strictly welfare-dominate taxes. The ordering of internationally tradable quotas and pollution taxes depends, among other things, on the degree of international pollution spillovers.","[Sikdar, Shiva] Yonsei Univ, E Asia Int Coll, Wonju 220710, Gangwondo, South Korea; [Lapan, Harvey E.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Yonsei University; Iowa State University,"Sikdar, S (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, E Asia Int Coll, Jeongui Gwan 338,234 Maeji, Wonju 220710, Gangwondo, South Korea.",hlapan@iastate.edu; shivasikdar@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,18,18,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This means that for a 10% increase in the number of labor, gross production will increase by 6.1%.

Torcal and Mainwaring (Br. J. Polit. Sci. 33:55-84, 2003) show the relevance of a purely political cleavage for structuring the party system in the case of Chile, challenging the freezing hypothesis's claims. They also dispute case-specific research that argues Chile's party system still reflects a three-thirds division between Left, Right, and Center. Revisiting this debate, our study employs spatial maps of the party system. Such political-economy models are rare in studies of Latin American politics. The application here supports a democratic/authoritarian political cleavage in Chile.","[Bonilla, Claudio A.] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile; [Carlin, Ryan E.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Love, Gregory J.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Polit Sci, Oxford, MS USA; [Silva Mendez, Ernesto] Univ Desarrollo, Ctr Polit Publ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad del Desarrollo; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Mississippi; Universidad del Desarrollo,"Bonilla, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Desarrollo, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.",cbonilla@udd.cl; rcarlin@gsu.edu; gjlove@olemiss.edu; esm@udd.cl,"Carlin, Ryan/KCX-8392-2024; Bonilla, Claudio A./P-4777-2016","Carlin, Ryan/0000-0002-0945-205X",,,,,42,21,25,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2011,146.0,1-2,,,,,9,21,,10.1007/s11127-009-9580-2,0.0,,,13,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,691TK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285103500002,0

The Indian economy can well be studied in two distinct sectors, organized and unorganized (informal). The widespread informal sector in the country is a major contributor to its development but at the same time it is plagued by several problems such as no proper service rules, no wage rules and no possibilities of career advancement. Another notable fact is that as many as 94% of total women workers work in the informal sector in India but they have to face gender discrimination which is almost inexistent in formal sector.

These factors, in addition to environmental effects and governmental support are decisive for bioenergy to succeed on the market. The results show that there is a trade-off between economic profits and energy gains; 1% reduction in profit would result in 4.4% increase in net energy gains. Costs for consumers resulting from difference between conventional energy and bioenergy would be nearly 20 bil. CZK in the economic scenario and 5.5 bil.

First a simple approach deploying directly own price elasticities is applied and later deeper investigations are made using the Czech national CGE model.

Data obtained for three large urban centers - Hamilton, Toronto, and Montreal - are analyzed using spatial expansion models, a technique used to obtain spatially-varying coefficients that help to tease out contextual person-location variations in travel behavior. Detailed geographical results help to enhance our understanding of the spatiality of travel behavior of the population segments of interest. Substantively, the results provide evidence of significant interactions between location, various demographic factors, and mobility tools.

As women are integral part of society, her status and participation in decision making as well as economic activities is very low. Microfinance plays role in improving women decision making by contributing in economic activities. In this study an attempt is made to explore the socio economic determinants of women empowerment in which microfinance is crucial economic determinant. This study used regression analysis based on primary data of Bahawalpur City to check the relationship of different socio economic determinants on women empowerment. Women empowerment measured by constructing simple index using five indicators related to child health, education, selection of spouse of children, purchase of basic goods and decision about the use of loan. The results show that women empowerment is considerably influenced by age, education of husband, father inherited assets, marital status, number of sons alive and microfinance. Age, education of husband, no of live sons and father inherited assets are more statistically significant variables in this study., Further, this study decompose data with male and female using loan which implies that females uses loan by themselves has some better results than where loans were used by male family members. Finally, it is concluded that as microfinance is major explanatory variable in this study has some positive role in empowerment but not as much as was expected. It is suggested that education facilities and family protection must be provided in proper way. Microfinance institutions should strengthen and expand their support to resource poor women.","[Noreen, Sara] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Econ, Bhawalpur, Pakistan",Islamia University of Bahawalpur,,gauhar.muez@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,6,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,328,334,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400063,0

Finally the whole methodology has been applied to gold asset class to validate the present method.

A literature review was closely undertaken to elicit the organizational dynamic routines that affect knowledge identifying, creating, sharing, using and storing in the context of KM processes. These identified routines that play a potential intervening role between absorptive capacity (ACAP) and KM stage include system or knowledge transfer, strategic planning, cultural environment, information technology advances and organizational structure.

While a variety of agri-environmental modelling tools exists which are able to predict social, economic, and ecological consequences of policies, there are no standardised ex-ante policy assessment tools capturing the institutional dimension. In this paper, we introduce a procedure for ex-ante modelling institutional aspects for policy implementation. PICA (Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment) is a systematic methodology to assess the institutional compatibility of policy options with the respective national and regional institutional contexts. PICA has been designed as an explorative, yet formalised methodology that enables policy-makers to identify, at an early stage, potential institutional incompatibilities. After a brief introduction of the concept of institutional compatibility for policy assessment, the four distinct steps of PICA are elaborated. Subsequently, the practical and empirical processes as well as the results of the application of PICA for the (in the year 2007) planned implementation of the EU-Nitrate Directive in the Departement Puy-de-Dome in the Auvergne, France, will be presented. In the conclusions we stress PICA's explorative character and give an outlook on the further methodological development of the procedure.","[Schleyer, Christian] Berlin Brandenburg Akad Wissensch, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Theesfeld, Insa] Leibniz Inst Agrarentwicklung Mittel & Osteuropa, Halle, Saale, Germany",,"Schleyer, C (通讯作者)，Berlin Brandenburg Akad Wissensch, Nachwuchsgrp Okosyst Leistungen, Jagerstr 22-23, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",schleyer@bbaw.de,"Theesfeld, Insa/AAE-2214-2020; Schleyer, Christian/I-6868-2012","Theesfeld, Insa/0000-0002-0200-756X; Schleyer, Christian/0000-0002-9604-1653",,,,,23,1,1,1,11,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

It is not only the taste of wines that has become more diversified, but quality signals are increasingly utilized, too. Quality signals include information on the wine bottle, such as origin, grape variety or brands. Additionally, there is a strong trend towards using the product design, i.e. bottle type or style of the wine label, as an instrument of product differentiation. The objective of this article is to analyze whether the product design affects the perceived taste of wine and the willingness to buy a wine. Primary data, which have been collected from an experiment combined with a survey of wine consumers, reveal that product design strongly affects the willingness to buy a wine. This strong effect occurs when the wine is tasted prior to the purchase decision. Interestingly, the product design affects consumers' taste evaluation of the wine that is crucial for the consequential effects on the willingness to buy. An alternative modeling approach with a direct impact of product design on willingness to buy strongly underestimates the role of product design. A cluster analysis additionally reveals that product design and other quality signals do matter in some wine consumer segments but less in others.","[Szolnoki, Gergely] Forsch Anstalt Geisenheim, Fachgebiet Betriebswirtschaft & Marktforsch, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; [Herrmann, Roland] Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Szolnoki, G (通讯作者)，Forsch Anstalt Geisenheim, Fachgebiet Betriebswirtschaft & Marktforsch, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany.",szolnoki@fa-gm.de,"Szolnoki, Gergely/AAA-8381-2022","Szolnoki, Gergely/0000-0002-7791-7218",,,,,47,3,3,2,21,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The rural poor are often concentrated in fragile, or less favorable, environmental areas. Consequently, their livelihoods can be intimately dependent on natural resource use and ecosystem services. The relationship between poverty and natural resource degradation may depend on a complex range of choices and tradeoffs available to the poor, which in the absence of capital, labor, and land markets, is affected by their access to outside employment and any natural resource endowments. The paper develops a poverty-environment model to characterize some of these linkages, and concludes by discussing policy implications and avenues for further research.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,105,170,194,3,101,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The analysis makes use of a rich dataset containing data on innovation and other economic characteristics of a large representative sample of Norwegian firms in manufacturing and service industries for the period 1998-2004. First, we decompose TFP growth into technical progress and efficiency changes by means of data envelopment analysis. We then estimate an empirical model that relates these two productivity components to the characteristics of technological regimes and a set of other firm-specific factors. The results indicate that: (i) TFP growth has mainly been achieved through technical progress, while technical efficiency has on average decreased; (ii) the characteristics of technological regimes are important determinants of firm-level productivity growth, but their impacts on technical progress are different from the effects on efficiency change; (iii) the estimated model works differently in the two Schumpeterian regimes. Technical progress has been more dynamic in Schumpeter Mark II industries, while efficiency change has been more important in Schumpeter Mark I markets.","[Castellacci, Fulvio; Zheng, Jinghai] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, Dept Int Econ, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",,"Castellacci, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, Dept Int Econ, POB 8159, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",fc@nupi.no; jz@nupi.no,,,,,,,62,38,42,2,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

While there is mixed evidence on the effects of these inclusion policies on the students with special needs, research examining potential spillovers of inclusion on non-disabled classmates has been scarce. There is particularly little research on the effects of inclusion policies on classmates during early elementary grades. This paper begins to fill in this gap by using a nationally representative, longitudinal survey of kindergartners. Cross-sectional results suggest that having a classmate with an emotional problem decreases reading and math scores at the end of kindergarten and first grade by over 10 percent of a standard deviation, which is one-third to one-half of the minority test score gap. To control for nonrandom sorting of students to schools, as well as students to classrooms, this paper uses school-level and then student-level fixed effects. Results from the preferred empirical models suggest a decrease of approximately 5 percent of a standard deviation in math and reading scores, though the reading results are less robust. The results also indicate moderate racial and gender differences in the effects.

Our model implies that the efficient portfolio with background risk can be separated into two independent components: the traditional mean-variance efficient portfolio, and a self-financing component constructed to hedge against background risk. Our analysis also shows that the presence of background risk shifts the efficient frontier of financial assets to the right with no changes in its shape. Moreover, both the composition of the hedge portfolio and the location of the efficient frontier are greatly affected by a number of background risk factors, including the proportion of background assets in total wealth and the correlation between background risk and financial risk.

Unlike a cap and trade system, an emissions performance standard does not guarantee a certain overall level of emission reductions, a fact that has led to significant criticism. However, because of the dynamics of performance standards, they may reduce concerns over reductions in international competitiveness in cases where a country has climate policies that are more aggressive than those of some of its trade partners. Likewise, a performance standard may mesh more efficiently with existing taxes and therefore cause less overall economic impact than an absolute cap and trade system. This paper considers the theoretical arguments for and against such a performance standard system and evaluates it in comparison to a cap and trade system using a dynamic general equilibrium model applied to Canada.","[Rivers, Nic; Jaccard, Mark] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Rivers, N (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,,,,,,,40,5,7,1,9,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We study dual-class shares with equal cash flow rights and show that a simple trading strategy exploiting gaps between their prices appears to create abnormal profits after transactions costs. Trade and quote data show that investors shift their trading patterns to take advantage of gaps. Contrary to common perception, long-short arbitrage plays a minor part in eliminating gaps, and one-sided trades correct most of them.

The Strategy of the Danube represents a project initiated in the year 2008 by Germany, Austria and Romania to which subsequently there adhered the other states on the Danube and which became a program of the European Commission. It shall have allotted a budget of 50 milliards euro until the year 2013. It shall be preponderantly addressed to the population in the Danube Basin, which is estimated at 115 millions, following to be developed through cross-border projects. In December 2010 there is foreseen the approval of the Action Plan for the program the Strategy of the Danube by the European Commission. The integration process needs premises and conditions for further development. One of them is the connectivity and it supporting system - the logistics. The problem of the connectivity is one of the pillars of the Danube strategy, which could play an important role in the Lower Danube Macro region's development. Those problems need different approaches, specialized research and training. The situation of the two countries in the domain of fluvial logistics may be characterized as unsatisfactory in relation to their potential. At the present moment there is a single bridge which connects the two countries (Giurgiu - Ruse) and several travels with the passage boat. The harbour infrastructures are old and inefficient. There are no modern multi-modal platforms or a coherent vision in their design. The transportation on the Danube is insufficiently exploited. As well, the river is not capitalized in other domains, too: agriculture, pisciculture, energy, ecology, tourism, arrangement of the territory, etc. Within a more restrained context, but correlated with the Strategy of the Danube, Romania and Bulgaria cooperate within the Cross-Border Program 2007-2013.

The model emphasizes the role of political entry and deadweight costs of taxation on the joint determination of these economic and political outcomes. Contrary to popular belief, my model shows that natural resource abundance is an economic blessing even in a rent-seeking society, although resource dependence can be negatively associated with economic performance. In a contested political market, dictators care about popular support and hence resource wealth can help reduce the deadweight cost of taxation (and hence the cost of public good provision). On the other hand, natural resource wealth can be a political curse, because it encourages political entry and hence it induces incumbent dictators to run more repressive regimes. With constant returns counterinsurgent technology, however, the equilibrium number of insurgents is independent of the size of resource wealth. The onset of civil war, therefore, depends on the counterinsurgent technology and whether the costs of entry deterrence are affected by resource wealth. This helps clarify the two seemingly contradictory hypotheses that resource wealth enhances regime durability'' and resource wealth fuels conflict.''","Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Tsui, KK (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",ktsui@clemson.edu,,,,,,,68,27,32,0,19,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Therefore, most climate-change studies are based on the models and scenarios of economic growth. Economic growth itself, however, is likely to be affected by climate-change impacts. These impacts affect the economy in multiple and complex ways: changes in productivity, resource endowments, production and consumption patterns. We use a new dynamic, multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the world economy to answer the following questions: Will climate-change impacts significantly affect growth and wealth distribution in the world? Should forecasts of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions be revised, once the climate-change impacts are taken into account? We found that, even though economic growth and emission paths do not change significantly at the global level, relevant differences exist at the regional and sectoral level.

This finding holds across exchanges as well as size, price, and volume quartiles. Higher right-skewness is consistent with more competition among market makers; which may reduce cross-subsidization across periods of high and low asymmetric information, unlike a monopolistic regime that can maintain a relatively constant spread. Confirming this intuition, proportional differences in spreads between earnings announcements and normal periods have increased considerably even as trading costs have declined on average. Skewness also is cross-sectionally related to information proxies such as institutional holdings and analyst following. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Conceptualizing innovation as a search and learning process that results in a successful product, we introduce a two-phase model of collective innovation that accounts for the deliberateness of the innovation process. Using agent-based modeling, we explore how interaction structure among a group of actors affects the speed at which the group can collectively innovate. In addition, we present results from counterfactual simulations to highlight the importance of deliberate search and changing realized connections in modeling collective innovation process.

It turns out that the cross-country differences in the performance of revenue forecasting are first of all associated with uncertainty about the macroeconomic fundamentals. To some extent, they are also driven by country characteristics such as the importance of corporate and (personal) income taxes. Also, differences in the timing of the forecasts prove important. However, controlling for these differences, we find that the independence of revenue forecasting from possible government manipulation exerts a robust, significantly positive effect on the accuracy of revenue forecasts.","[Buettner, Thiess] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Buettner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany.",buettner@ifo.de; kauder@ifo.de,,"Buettner, Thiess/0000-0001-7490-0122",,,,,42,24,25,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Short-term and sometimes long-term emissions reduction goals are established, as California does for 2020 and 2050, but little attention has yet been focused on annual emissions targets for the intervening years. We develop recommendations for how these annual targets-which we collectively term a compliance pathway-can be set, as well as what flexibility sources should have to adjust in light of cost uncertainties. Environmental effectiveness, efficiency, equity, adaptability, and encouraging global participation are appropriate criteria by which these intertemporal policy alternatives should be judged. Limited but useful knowledge about costs leads us to recommend a compliance pathway characterized by increasing incremental reductions along it. This can be approximated by discrete linear segments, which may fit better with global negotiations. Although the above conclusion applies to any long-term GHG regulatory program, many jurisdictions will rely heavily on a cap-and-trade system, and the same pathway recommendation applies to its time schedule of allowances. Furthermore, borrowing constraints in cap-and-trade systems can impose substantial unnecessary costs. To avoid most of these costs, we recommend that sources be allowed early use of limited percentages of allowances intended for future years. We also find that a three-year compliance period can have substantial benefit over a one-year period.

However older driver serious injury and fatality rates per distance travelled are higher than middle-aged drivers, and crash and injury rates are likely to increase in the coming decades as a result of the ageing population, increased car ownership and overall travel amongst older people. Evidence suggests that contributory factors to this high risk are (for most) frailty, (for some) the high proportion of driving in urban areas, and (for a few) reduced fitness to drive as a result of medical conditions and associated functional limitations. Australasia has recently adopted the 'Safe System' approach which aims to manage vehicles, the road infrastructure, speeds, and the interactions between these components, to ensure that when crashes do occur, crash energies will remain at levels that minimize the probability of death and serious injury. A system which aspires to achieving Safe System objectives cannot ignore the challenges that older road users pose - and will pose - to the transport system. This paper discusses the so-called 'older driver problem', presents crash data and evidence of the impacts of driving location and reduced fitness to drive on crash risk, and recommends countermeasures within the 'Safe System' context, with particular reference to urban road design and operation.

We find that mortgages that are originated by institutions with large negative stock returns in the quarters prior to the origination date tend to have higher credit spreads and default more than other mortgages with similar observable characteristics. Properties financed with these mortgages also exhibit weaker post-securitization operating performance. In addition, stock price loser institutions are anxious to securitize mortgages they originate more quickly. Finally we find that credit rating agencies require higher levels of subordination for CMBS pools (i.e., view these pools as riskier) that include more mortgages originated by underperforming originators. This evidence is consistent with reputation models in which poorly performing originators have less incentive to carefully evaluate the credit quality of prospective borrowers, thereby letting relatively riskier mortgages pass through their weaker screening standards.","[Titman, Sheridan] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Finance, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tsyplakov, Sergey] Univ S Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Dept Finance, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Titman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Finance, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Sheridan.Titman@mccombs.utexas.edu; sergey@moore.sc.edu,,,,,,,28,34,40,2,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

However, an important trend in tax administration policies in recent years is the recognition that this paradigm is incomplete. Instead, a revised service paradigm recognizes the role of enforcement, but also emphasizes the role of tax administration as a facilitator and a provider of services to taxpayer-citizens. This research utilizes laboratory experiments to test the effectiveness of such taxpayer service programs in enhancing tax compliance. Our basic experimental setting mimics the naturally occurring environment: subjects earn income, they must choose whether to file a tax return, and they then must choose how much of their net income to report to a tax authority that may audit the subject. To investigate the effects of taxpayer services, we complicate these compliance decisions of subjects, and then provide services from the tax administration that allow subjects to compute more easily their tax liabilities. Our results indicate that uncertainty reduces both the filing and the reporting compliance of an individual.

A Case Study for India,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper examines the impact of economic liberalization on interregional inequality in India. It has been observed in many studies that interregional inequality in India has been steadily increasing over time. This paper is a further confirmation of this result. We have tried to locate the cause of rising interregional inequality within the production structure of the economy and observed that it is positively and systematically related to the cross-regional inequalities in agriculture and manufacturing. This systematic relationship has further been examined from a structuralist viewpoint to unravel the factors determining manufacturing production across regions where we have found that trade openness is the key factor determining the manufacturing share in income across the regions. Our further enquiry into manufacturing and trade patterns has shown that the Herfindahl index of concentration has been increasing over time on both counts. This result, along with the findings of the structuralist model about disproportionate growth of manufacturing across regions, provides an explanation of the cause of rising interregional inequality in India.","[Chakraborty, Pavel] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Barua, Alokesh] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India","Syracuse University; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Chakraborty, P (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",alokesh.barua@gmail.com; pavel.chakraborty@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,14,14,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1363-6669,,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We first study the volatility, persistence and stationarity of the Italian inflation rate over the long run and across various exchange-rate regimes that have shaped Italian monetary history. Next, we estimate alternative Phillips equations and investigate whether nonlinearities, asymmetries and structural changes characterize the inflation-output trade-off in the long run. We capture the effects of structural changes and asymmetries on the estimated parameters of the inflation-output trade-off, relying partly on sub-sample estimates and partly on time-varying parameters estimated via the Kalman filter. Finally, we investigate causal relationships between inflation rates and output and extend the analysis to include the US and the UK for comparison purposes. The inference is that Italy has experienced a conventional inflation-output trade-off only during times of low inflation and stable aggregate supply. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, this may not always be true, particularly in the short term, as it requires substantial investments and may impose financial burdens on firms undertaking such investments. This study empirically examines the effects of technological modernization in China's iron and steel industry in the 1990s on conventional economic productivity (CEP) and environmentally sensitive productivities (ESPs). We employ a directional distance function that can handle multiple inputs and outputs to compute relative production efficiencies. We apply these models to the data covering 27 iron and steel firms in China between 1990 and 1999 a period when the Chinese iron and steel industry modernized rapidly. We find that ESPs have continuously improved, even in the period when the CEP declined.","[Fujii, Hidemichi; Managi, Shunsuke] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan; [Kaneko, Shinji] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Hiroshima 7398529, Japan",Tohoku University; Hiroshima University,"Fujii, H (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Aoba Ku, 6-6-20 Aramaki Aza Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan.",kshinji@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Fujii, Hidemichi/E-8261-2014; Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Kaneko, Shinji/G-5913-2012","Fujii, Hidemichi/0000-0002-3043-1122; Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; Kaneko, Shinji/0000-0002-9026-5728",,,,,45,30,30,3,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We propose a method of forecasting inflation based on the present-value formulation of the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve. To evaluate the forecasting performance of this model we compare it with forecasts generated from a traditional Phillips Curve and time series models at different forecast horizons. As state-of-the-art time series models used in forecasting we employ a Bayesian VAR, a conventional VAR and a simple autoregressive model. We find that the New Keynesian Phillips Curve delivers relatively more accurate forecasts of inflation in Austria compared to the other models for longer forecast horizons (more than 3 months) while they are outperformed by the time series models only for the very short forecast horizon. This is consistent with the finding in the literature that structural models are able to outperform time series models only for longer horizons. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We have two analytical results. First, a transfer in cash, such as a public pension, prevents economic growth because a strategic behavior concerning caregiving generates a disincentive effect on education. Second, a transfer in kind, such as public formal care, promotes economic growth because the valuation of the service generates an additional benefit of education, which dominates the disincentive effect. Our results show that old age support should be in kind rather than in cash in the context of economic growth and also welfare if bequests are strategic.","Doshisha Univ, Fac Econ, Kyoto 6028580, Japan",Doshisha University,"Miyazawa, K (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Fac Econ, Kyoto 6028580, Japan.",kazu@mail.doshisha.ac.jp,"Miyazawa, Kazutoshi/ABC-8373-2020","Miyazawa, Kazutoshi/0000-0001-6495-5939",,,,,54,5,5,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

In this study, we analyze the impact that a new hydroelectricity royalty paid by Hydro-Quebec to the Quebec Treasury has on total equalization payments received by the province; to do this, we consider the equalization formulas used before 2004 and after 2007. This royalty, which generates approximately $600 million each year, reduces Quebec's equalization payments by just over $100 million, using either formula. Under the terms of the current equalization formula, Quebec loses 38 cents in equalization rights for each additional dollar of income received from natural resources. The new hydroelectricity royalty and the increase in the dividend rates applied to this government-owned corporation have made it possible for the Quebec government to benefit from a transfer of $1.15 billion; on the other hand it loses $437 million in equalization payments. In this study, we provide and describe an important counter example to the hypothesis concerning the strategic behaviour of provinces that benefit from an equalization scheme.","[Bernard, Jean-Thomas; Ben Mabrouk, Soufiene] Univ Laval, GREEN, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Laval University,"Bernard, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, GREEN, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We use a panel of 76 developed and developing countries during the period 1960-2004 to identify episodes of output collapse and estimate counterfactual post-collapse TFP trends. Collapses are concentrated in developing countries, especially Africa and Latin America, and were particularly widespread in the 1980s in Latin America. Overall, output collapses are systematically associated with long-lasting declines in TFP. We explore the conditions under which collapses are least or most damaging, as well as the type of shocks that make collapses more likely or severe. Furthermore, we provide a quantification of the associated welfare loss with output collapses.","[Daude, Christian] OECD Dev Ctr, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Blyde, Juan S.; Fernandez-Arias, Eduardo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Inter-American Development Bank,"Daude, C (通讯作者)，OECD Dev Ctr, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",christian.daude@oecd.org,,,,,,,54,5,8,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We find a striking difference in convergence depending on the level of aggregation. While aggregate national inflation rates are diverging, disaggregate inflation rates are converging. We find that aggregation appears to bias evidence towards non-convergence.

While the direction of asymmetry remains unchanged, the magnitude of asymmetry is attenuated considerably as the investment horizon increases. Similar horizon effects also occur on the tail dependence.

This paper aims to answer this question with two studies. Study 1 is a survey carried out in Italy to explore citizens' perceptions of a fiscal reform introduced in 2005. It shows both effects imputable to the methods used to describe the bonus and differences between respondents belonging to different occupational groups. But it does not allow disentangling these factors. Study 2 aims to investigate whether and how (1) the frame used to describe a fiscal bonus and (2) taxpayers' occupational status, influence their evaluation of this tax reduction and the uses they intend to make of it. To this end, 252 participants belonging to different occupational groups were submitted to two between-subject framing conditions (the bonus being described as a reduced loss or as a gain). They were then asked to evaluate the bonus' importance for their personal wealth and to state how they intended to use it. Results demonstrate that the frame, rather than the occupational status of the respondent, influences taxpayers' responses to the bonus. Respondents attached a higher importance to the bonus and were keener to save it when it was described as a loss reduction, compared to it being presented as a gain. These results are interpreted with reference to Prospect Theory, producing new insights into the processes through which framing can affect fiscal policy evaluations. The study is also relevant from a pragmatic perspective, as it shows that the way fiscal policy is communicated can be decisive for the achievement of economic and political goals.

We investigate portfolio improvement if investors have full and partial access to the derivatives markets, i.e. situations in which derivatives are written on some but not all stocks or risk factors traded on the market. The focus is on markets with jump risk. In these markets the choice of optimal exposures to jump and diffusion risk is linked. In a numerical application we study the potential benefit from adding derivatives to the market. It turns out that e.g. diffusion correlation and volatility or jump sizes may have a significant impact on the benefit of a new derivative product even if market prices of risk remain unchanged.

The analysis of a multinational company belonging to the consumer goods industry, that multinational company that produces foodstuffs as well as non-foodstuffs, represents the case study by means it is intended to point to the complexity of the internal systems to assure and certify the own product quality and safety. The main instrument to collect data has been the interview; it is this way that relevant information for this study has been collected; further on, these information sets have been completed with information sets that have been taken over from different available internal documents. This was the way in which there has been noticed the means by which the multinational company has managed to introduce elements that are related to safety and quality even from the designing and production phases with the help of creativity and innovation since the latter two elements occupy an extremely important place if the company wishes to reach performance; there is more to it as these two elements are continuously granted attention in case of contracting third parties, and then, till the moment in which the products reach the clients and the consumers. With such a purpose in mind, communication is vital, be it about ingredients or about solving crisis since it is the company's responsibility to strive to keep the good name that has been obtained by means of the own brands no matter where on the earth. The knowledge gathered from the analyzed company could help generate a complex mechanism for adapting to consumer requirements regarding their protection. This new mechanism would be useful for the management team on one side and on the other side, for the governmental and intergovernmental institutions with specific tasks for elaborating specific legislation.","Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pamfilie, AM (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ampamfilie@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,6,6,0,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2010,12.0,28,,,,,466,478,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,617XA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279314000015,0

Two subjective pricing models are fitted to show that executive stock option prices incorporate a subjective discount. It depends positively on implied volatility and negatively on option moneyness. Further, risk preferences are estimated using the semiparametric model of Ait-Sahalia and Lo (2000). The results suggest that relative risk aversion is just above 1 for a certain stock price range. This level of risk aversion is low but reasonable, and it may be explained by the typical manager being wealthy and having low marginal utility.

Using returns on at-the-money straddles written on the CAC 40 index as a proxy for systematic volatility risk, I document significant differences between volatility factor loadings of value and growth stocks. Furthermore, when markets are classified into expected booms and recessions, volatility factor loadings are also time-varying. When expected market risk premium is above its average, i.e. during expected recessions, value stocks are seen riskier than their growth counterparts. This implies in bad times, investors shift their preferences away from value firms. Instead they use growth stocks as hedges against deteriorations in their wealth during those times.

We show that, in the benchmark case of full transparency, the optimal inflation targeting weight (or penalty) is decreasing with the preference for robustness. Departing from the benchmark equilibrium, the central bank has then incentive to be less transparent in order to reduce the optimal inflation targeting weight and thus to become more independent vis-a-vis the government. We also find that greater opacity will increase the sensibility of inflation and model misspecification to the inflation shock but will decrease that of output-gap. Since macroeconomic volatility could be increased or decreased under more opacity, there could exist in some cases a trade-off between the level and the variability of inflation (and output gap). Persistent inflation shocks could be associated with a higher inflation targeting weight as well as a higher sensibility of inflation and output gap to the inflation shock but a lower sensibility of model misspecification.","[Dai, Meixing; Spyromitros, Eleftherios] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Dai, MX (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.",,"Spyromitros, Eleftherios/AAK-6252-2021",,,,,,33,9,9,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The findings are that the increase in imports from China initially broadened access to trading for the poor, creating short-term improvements in livelihoods, but competition is driving down profit margins, and restricting the trade to a survival mechanism for many today. Thus it has provided limited long-term potential as an economic platform for national development and poverty reduction.

The distribution of public spending between public health care and pollution abatement that maximizes equilibrium income is also derived.

At lower levels of competition, a subject's probability of winning is affected more by her own expenditures than by the expenditures of others. Predicted expenditure levels are positively associated with higher levels of competition. Consistent with previous rent seeking experiments, we find that subjects spend significantly more than the Nash equilibrium prediction at all levels of competition. However, expenditure patterns generally follow the Nash prediction; expenditures decrease as the level of competition decreases. Our experimental design also includes a lottery choice experiment to control for subjects' risk preference.

Neither can it for insurance companies, though data restrictions impede further conclusions.

In contrast, funds that are expected to be backed by less skilled investors show performance predictability and have a non-significant flow-performance relationship. These results suggest that only skilled investors use all available information to adjust their capital allocation and, as a result, eliminate performance predictability as argued theoretically by Berk and Green (2004). Results also show that Kaplan and Schoar (2005) overstate the persistence in fund performance by not using an ex ante measure of the performance of earlier funds. Whether or not an ex ante measure is used, however, the persistence is largely due to unsophisticated investors.

Our results show that higher corporate tax rates reduce not only the demand for capital, but also the demand for labor due to complementarities between both inputs. An interesting element of the results presented in this article is the asymmetry between the effects of taxation according to company size. The impact on labor demand is significantly higher in large corporations than in small enterprises, while the demand for capital is more responsive to corporate tax changes in small firms. We can explain these results based on differences in credit constraints according to firm size.","[Cerda, Rodrigo A.; Larrain, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Cerda, RA (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",rcerda@faceapuc.cl,"cerda, rodrigo/ABB-4527-2020","cerda, rodrigo/0000-0001-6486-4025",,,,,17,7,8,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

First, we extend this view by using the theory of rules versus discretion to explain why the ability of debt to constrain excessive growth is contingent upon lenders relinquishing discretion and committing to rigid rules. Next, we draw on the financial intermediation literature to distinguish between two types of debt. We explain that transactional debt (i.e. public securities such as bonds and commercial paper) conforms to a rules regime, and thus can serve as effective governance mechanisms for limiting the agency costs of over-investment in growth. In contrast, relational debt (i.e. private loans from financial intermediaries) is best characterized as a discretionary regime, and therefore is less effective in curtailing these agency costs. Paradoxically, it is the very intention of lenders to act optimally in the future that may result in this governance breakdown. Our empirical analysis of a large sample of Japanese firms confirms that the type of debt influences both firm growth and the performance consequences of that growth.","[O'Brien, Jonathan] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Lally Sch Management, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"O'Brien, J (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Lally Sch Management, 101 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",obriej8@rpi.edu; parthiban.david@american.edu,,,,,,,86,6,6,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The setting up of accounting procedures and policies is vital for any entity's existence, at least due to the following reasons: it facilitates the building of a system of efficient internal control, it prevents frauds, it protects the wealth of the business' owners and it facilitates the making of financial communication policy. According to the accounting regulations in accordance with the European directives, the entities must develop their own accounting policies sanctioned by the managers. Therefore, the main purpose of our paper is to investigate the main perceptions of the accountants or managers working in a small or medium sized enterprise in Bihor county on enterprise accounting policies, on their usefulness in offering a true and fair view by the financial statements. Our research is based on the setting up of a questionnaire made up of 25 questions which has been applied to 150 SMEs in Bihor county, selected according to size criteria, based on the main indicators published at the end of the 2008 financial year. After processing the answers to the questionnaire applied, the following has been noted: out of the 123 respondents, only 92,68% agree with the provisions of Article 10 of Order 3055/2009, according to which entities must develop their own accounting policies approved by the managers, only 75,60% of the respondents agree that the existence of written accounting policies at the enterprise level improves the quality of the financial reporting and the managers' decision making process and a significant number of respondents (21,95%) do not know the fact that during a financial year, a firm's accounting policies cannot be changed. After statistically testing our research hypotheses, it is worth mentioning that between the level of professional training of the financial statements makers and the importance given to the setting up of personalized written accounting policies there is a significant correlation and also, between the necessity to improve the human resources in the field of accounting policies and the necessity to set up a manual of personalized accounting procedures and policies according to the specific of each entity there is a correlation at the level of total population. The main result of our research consists in detecting the weaknesses in projecting hallmarked accounting policies at the level of Bihor SMEs, the need to form and improve the human resources in writing accounting policies and the necessity to set up a manual of accounting procedures and policies which can be easily personalized according to the specific of each enterprise by the managers.","[Bogdan, Victoria; Mester, Ioana Teodora; Popa, Dorina Nicoleta] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,,vicbogdan@yahoo.com,"Mester, Ioana/AAL-1915-2021; Popa, Dorina-Nicoleta/ABE-4767-2021; Bogdan, Victoria/AAL-1847-2021; Mester, Ioana Teodora/IUN-3402-2023","Popa, Dorina-Nicoleta/0000-0002-6505-6553; Mester, Ioana Teodora/0000-0001-5133-6979",,,,,33,0,0,0,7,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",,,978-606-505-347-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,818,838,,,,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSE06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000284258100049,0

This extension highlights public debt projection uncertainty resulting from both the intrinsic volatility of debt determinants and the inaccuracy of the parameter estimates of econometric models employed in the projections. The revised algorithm is applied to conduct a debt sustainability analysis of Uruguay. As part of this exercise, a restricted vector autoregression and a country-specific fiscal reaction function are employed. The resulting increase in the variance of the debt projections that account for the uncertainty of parameter estimates in the forecast is smaller than may have been anticipated, as the improved specification of the underlying econometric model reduces the variance of debt projections. Hence, more precise estimates of economic fundamentals and fiscal policy reaction allow for a feasible debt forecast with a more accurate depiction of its inherent forecast uncertainty.

The implication is that avoided deforestation can be expected to have a significant negative impact on segments of the population who would benefit from the business and employment opportunities that would otherwise be generated, directly or indirectly. Palm oil companies typically spend about three dollars on goods, services and labour for every dollar of profit. The author argues that any compensation package for avoided deforestation needs to include all the potential beneficiaries of palm oil production, not just the palm oil companies, and to generate economic activity similar to that being replaced.

The proposed prediction model is constructed by replacing the linear regression function in the usual ordered probit model with a semiparametric function, thus it allows for more flexible choice of regression function. The unknown parameters in the proposed prediction model are estimated by maximizing a local (weighted) log-likelihood function, and the resulting estimators are analyzed through their asymptotic biases and variances. A real data example for predicting issuer credit ratings is used to illustrate the proposed prediction method. The empirical result confirms that the new model compares favorably with the usual ordered probit model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In many decision-making situations geography plays a very important role. Many spatial problems are complex and require the use of analysis and models and an interdisciplinary and group approach to their solution. Spatial problems are often semi-structured or ill-defined because all of their aspects cannot be measured or modeled. Essential tool for solving of these problems is a geographic information system (GIS). GIS allows us to view, understand, interpret, and visualize geographical data in many ways that shows relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of maps, globes, reports, and charts. GIS helps to solve problems by data which are quickly looked and easily shared. GIS, maps and models represent special forms of (data, information and) knowledge formalization. The knowledge map is a visual interception of knowledge with the aim of its storage, sharing and development for decision-making. The mathematical model and its solution also support information and knowledge formalization and sharing among group members. GIS can be viewed in three ways - the database view, the map view, and the model view. GIS application can be one of the three types - data sorting and storing, analysis and processing data, decision-making and knowledge creation. Our aim is to formalize correspondence between these items. In this paper we will discuss decision-making process using GIS, various forms of knowledge maps in GIS and models in GIS. We will show selected examples of knowledge maps in GIS application.","[Klimesova, Dana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Klimesova, Dana] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Brozova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Klimesová, D (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",klimesova@pef.czu.cz; brozova@pef.czu.cz,"Brozova, Helena/K-2834-2017; Klimesova, Dana/F-3511-2015","Brozova, Helena/0000-0002-0322-251X; Klimesova, Dana/0000-0002-3003-7205",,,,,13,0,0,0,9,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2123-6,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2010,,,,,,,343,356,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA6AE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000337077600039,0

The text therefore considers the criteria for defining lobbying, the defining of the environment for lobbying and the role of interest groups and tries to map the relevant literature on the topic. When you define the issues of lobbying in the EU, the emphasis is on structural differences between the EU in terms of influence and being influenced and the bureaucratic apparatus throughout the countries. For various interest groups operating in the European political market is important to know the position of the EU institutions to lobbying and their willingness to create binding standards of behaviour and conduct (codes), as well as the need to define the line between lobbying and corruption.

Therefore, a search for solutions to informal housing and the rising need for formal housing delivery have been a challenge and issues of high importance for many developing countries. Though many efforts have been given to the effective planning and policy approaches to formalise/legalise the informal housing, in many cases the efforts remain ineffective as the country context of the situation is often neglected. The research paper suggests that formalisation or legalisation is highly contextual and associated with settlements' social, cultural and political circumstances and prevailing land tenure system. Furthermore, different stakeholders involved directly or indirectly in the informal housing development processes influence the context also. Therefore, in analysing the extent of participation in housing formalisation process it is vitally important to take into consideration the context (historical,cultural aspects) of a community. The paper argues that formalisation or legalisation of informal housing cannot be treated as technical term and not a matter of political issue only. A wide range of formalisation options should respond to the diversity of the needs of low-income people living in informal housing. Local situations and needs must be assessed and evaluated prior to the definition of the goals of formalisation policy. Therefore, the paper came up with the conclusion that it is crucially important to begin the formalisation process with the present and future need assessment and inquiry into the socio-political-cultural perspective to enhance the capacity of the community to improve and develop their housing. The paper also highlights few recommendations that could be made to ensure that participation yields better results to realise a number of potential benefits.","[Masum, Fahria; Klaus, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Land Water & Environm Risk Management, D-80290 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,,masum@landentwicklung-muenchen.de; klaus@landentwicklung-muenchen.de,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,CHINA ARCHITECTURE & BUILDING PRESS,BEIJING,"BAIWANZHUANG XICHENGGU, BEIJING, 10037, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-112-12328-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,456,461,,,,,,6,Economics; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,BRM62,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283112400033,0

Given its peripheral situation in the Union, Portugal was a key target for some of these projects. A decade later, it is pertinent to ask whether the new infrastructure achieved its objective of promoting lagging regions. The objective of this paper is to analyze one of the lagging regions in Portugal, to try to establish the link between changes in accessibility levels brought by improvements in the transportation network, and two indicators commonly used in accessibility research (population and purchasing power), while controlling other variables of possible relevance, such as the levels of educational achievement of the Population in the region. The analysis is based on the use of spatially autoregressive models which allow the representation of accessibility as spatially lagged variables of first and second order. The results place the contribution of accessibility changes in context, and point at the relevance of education as an alternative policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The important part of globalisation form supranational corporations, which are reaction on the rising competitiveness and need for strategic alliances. The more open is the economy, the more important are the effects of globalisation on the goods and capital flows. This is the case of the Czech Republic, which is vitally dependent on the successful export performance. The export performance is relatively specialized concerning its product and territorial structure. In the period after EU accession the intensity of international cooperation grew rapidly in all the Central European countries, which is mostly the result of the huge FDI inflow at the beginning of the decade. Generally the process of globalisation has its positive and negative effects. For the Czech Republic the positive aspects of globalisation prevail due to its geographical location, qualified and cheap labour force and EU membership.","Coll Econim & Management, Ctr Econ Studies, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic",,"Rojicek, M (通讯作者)，Coll Econim & Management, Ctr Econ Studies, Narozni 2600-9A, CZ-15800 Prague 5, Czech Republic.",marek.rojicek@vsem.cz,,,,,,,27,10,10,1,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

From a theoretical point of view, sports betting products may be superior to a fixed rate investment because of heterogeneous expectations, risk-loving behavior of investors or additional non-monetary utility components. In comparison to the direct placement of bets at bookmakers', sports betting products may be preferable in cases of hedonic framing. Our experimental section, however, reveals the limited practical relevance of these theoretical arguments for average decision makers. Despite this, financial instruments with sports betting components offer a certain profit potential due to the diversity of preferences across individuals. Summarizing, the issuance of sports betting products may actually be mainly driven by marketing aspects, nevertheless sports betting products may be considered to be 'viable niche products with low cost of capital for banks.

The evidence from this sample of Chilean firms indicates that dollar-denominated debt increases with firms' size and degree of exposure to foreign competition. We find evidence that dollar-denominated debt combines with exchange rate movements to produce a negative balance-sheet effect that reduces firms' investment in periods of strong exchange rate depreciation.

We compare earnings of Hispanic female entrepreneurs to both Latina wage/salary workers and to self-employed female non-Hispanic whites. Latina entrepreneurs are observed to have lower mean earnings than both white female entrepreneurs and Latina employees. However, our findings indicate that Latina entrepreneurs often do well, once differences in mean observable characteristics, such as education, are taken into account.

This paper studies the effects of subsidies upon tax evasion in a competitive market, and describes their incidence and their effect on the government's revenue. The role of search costs borne by consumers who are looking for such subsidies and that of administrative costs are taken into account.

In the theoretical section of this paper, we develop an endogenous growth model where the institutional environment is captured through two indicators: judicial system efficiency and easiness of informal trade. We show that an improvement in the institutional environment has two effects. First, it intensifies the causality direction from banking to economic growth through a reduction in defaulting loans. Second, it reduces the interest rate spread. In the empirical section of the paper, we find bidirectional causality when analyzing 22 Middle Eastern and North African countries over the period 1984-2004. The first causality, which runs from banking development to economic growth, is more intense in countries with more developed institutional environment. The second causality runs from economic growth to banking and indicates that a more developed economy has a more developed banking system.","[Nabi, M.

We empirically test whether strong corporate governance would lead to higher payout to minimize agency problems (outcome hypothesis), or to lower payout to avoid costly external financing (substitute hypothesis). We find that firms with higher (lower) external financing constraints tend to decrease (increase) payout ratio with an improvement in their corporate governance. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that the relation between payout and corporate governance is reversed depending on the relative sizes of agency and external financing costs.

He claims the unique bounded equilibrium is learnable, and the explosive equilibria are not. However, he assumes that agents can directly observe the monetary policy shock. Reversing this assumption, I find the opposite: the bounded equilibrium is not learnable and the unbounded equilibria are learnable. More generally, I argue that a threat by the Fed to move to an unlearnable equilibrium for all but one value of inflation is a poor foundation for choosing the bounded equilibrium of a new-Keynesian model.

Our panel estimations show that transnational terrorist attacks had a significant growth-limiting effect. An additional terrorist incident per million persons reduces gross domestic product per capita growth by about 1.5%. In populous countries, many additional attacks are needed to achieve such a large impact. Transnational terrorism reduces growth by crowding-in government expenditures. Unlike developing countries, developed countries are able to absorb terrorism without displaying adverse economic consequences. An internal conflict has the greatest growth concern, more than twice that of transnational terrorism. Conflict variables are associated with smaller investment shares and increased government spending, with the crowding-in of government spending being the dominant influence.","[Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",tsandler@utdallas.edu,"Gaibulloev, Khusrav/F-4799-2019","Gaibulloev, Khusrav/0000-0002-9014-9532",,,,,36,112,121,0,13,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The proposed method is a two-step procedure, separating the estimation of the correlation structure from that of the univariate dynamics, thus facilitating the incorporation of non-Gaussian innovations distributions in a straightforward manner. The generalized hyperbolic distribution provides an excellent parametric description of financial returns data and is used for the univariate fits, but its convolutions, necessary for portfolio risk calculations, are intractable. This restriction is overcome by saddlepoint approximations for the Value at Risk and expected shortfall, which are computationally cheap and retain excellent accuracy far into the tails. It is further shown that the mean-expected shortfall portfolio optimization problem can be solved efficiently in the context of the model. A simulation study and an application to stock returns demonstrate the validity of the procedure.","[Broda, Simon A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Quantitat Econ, Amsterdam Sch Econ, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Paolella, Marc S.] Univ Zurich, Swiss Banking Inst, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Amsterdam; University of Zurich,"Broda, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Quantitat Econ, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.a.broda@uva.nl,,"Paolella, Marc/0000-0002-5133-6677; Broda, Simon/0000-0003-1686-9512",,,,,40,43,46,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equity-sharing partnerships.","[Chibanda, M.; Ortmann, G.

The low frequency momentum trading strategy offers greater directional accuracy, higher returns and Sharpe ratios, lower maximum drawdown and less frequent trading than traditional moving average rules. Moreover, unlike traditional moving average rules, the performance of the low frequency momentum trading strategy is relatively robust across different time periods.

One important area where both economic realities and markets are changing is catastrophe risk and its financing. This article examines and compares regulatory and other government policies in the United States and the EU generally and their approaches to the financing of catastrophe risk specifically. It is important to understand the fundamental differences between the two systems to gain insights into their disparate treatment of catastrophe risk financing. Although policies could be improved in both jurisdictions, we argue that the much greater reform is needed in the United States relative to the EU regulatory policies that are being developed. We offer recommendations on how U.S. policies could be significantly improved as well as comment on issues facing the EU. We conclude with some observations on the needs for further progress in the U.S. and EU regulatory systems.","[Klein, Robert W.; Wang, Shaun] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Klein, RW (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",rwklein@gsu.edu,,,,,,,43,32,37,0,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

(2003). The world economy-Historical statistics. Paris: OECD Development Centre] to generate deviation cycles for the period from 1870 to 2001. The cyclical deviates are examined for their bilateral cross-correlation values in three separate periods, those of the first globalization wave (1870-1914), the period of the bloc economy (1915-1959) and for the period of the second globalization (1960-2001). Cluster analysis is applied and the McNemar test is used to test for the relative coherence of alternative groupings of countries in the three periods. The bloc economy period emerges as one that features some well-defined sub-global clusters, where the second globalization period does not, the first globalization period lying between the two in this respect. The second globalization period shows a generally higher level of cross-correlations and a lower variance than the other two periods. The features uncovered suggest that the second globalization period is indeed one that comprises a more inclusive world economy than ever before. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we focus on FTAs (also called European agreements) between the European Union (EU-15) and the Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC-4, i.e. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania) and model their effects on trade flows by treating the agreement variable as endogenous. Our theoretical framework is the gravity model, and the econometric method used to isolate and eliminate the potential endogeneity bias of the agreement variable is the fixed effect vector decomposition (FEVD) technique. Our estimation results indicate a positive and significant impact of FTAs on trade flows. This finding is robust to the inclusion in the sample of a group of control countries (specifically Belarus, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine) that did not sign an FTA. Besides, we show that trade growth after the FTA agreement with the EU was signed exceeded trade growth of the control group of countries, which did not become members.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria; Rault, Christophe; Sova, Robert; Sova, Anamaria] Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, London UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Ctr Empir Finance, London UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,"Sova, Robert A/P-3822-2016",,,,,,43,39,48,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Post-Hurricane Mitch organizational practices and reconstruction policies in Northeastern Honduras afforded women access to joint property titles and participation. Yet the practices and processes through which women gained new rights reproduced certain exclusionary gender structures and created new barriers to women's participation. These contradictory consequences speak to recent feminist assessments of women's land rights under neo-liberal land titling programmes and a resurgence of policies addressing agrarian reform, and reveal the broader stakes of struggles for women's land rights. In so doing, they underline the importance of attending to spatial connections and historical articulations between the present and the past, and thus the past and the future.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Casolo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, 507 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jjcasolo@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,82,12,16,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Our results show that across countries, cash-flow uncertainty, as proxied by stock return volatility, has a negative impact on the amount of dividends as well as the probability of paying dividends. The impact of cash-flow uncertainty on dividends is generally stronger than the impact of other potential determinants of payout policy-such as the earned/contributed capital mix, agency conflicts, and investment opportunities. We also find that the effect of cash-flow uncertainty on dividends is distinct from the effect of a firm's financial life-cycle stage. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For treaties involving TIPGs, a coalition of rich developed countries are apt to shoulder more of the provision burden than a coalition of poor developing countries. This burden inequality worsens if the developed countries unilaterally display altruism to future generations; nevertheless, altruistic benefits may offset reduced spillovers. When current generations strategize with respect to future generations, provision and efficiency suffer; however, the hypothesized unequal burden sharing improves somewhat. For alternative aggregator technologies of public supply, these one-sided burdens may be partly ameliorated.","Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dallas, TX 75230 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Dallas, TX 75230 USA.",,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0036-9292,,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

While most authors have investigated positive adoption decisions, this paper focuses instead on consumer resistance to innovation. The current study presents a conceptual framework which explicates the major components of consumer resistance: (I) rejection, (2) postponement, and (3) opposition, and discusses two main groups of antecedents to consumer resistance: (I) degree of change required and (2) conflicts with the consumer's prior belief structure. This framework is explored with both a literature review and a qualitative focus group study. These joint efforts result in the formulation of a model of consumer resistance. Finally, the authors discuss several relevant theoretical and strategic implications, and point out directions for future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Creditors are more likely to impose a capital expenditure restriction as a borrower's credit quality deteriorates, and the use of a restriction appears at least as sensitive to borrower credit quality as other contractual terms, such as interest rates, collateral requirements, or the use of financial covenants.

We explore two hypotheses with regard to these controlling shareholders and corporate transparency, focusing on their role as monitor in-place and their potential to exploit firm opacity to accrue private benefits of control. To test these notions, we create an opacity index that ranks the relative transparency of the two thousand largest industrial US firms and find founder and heir ownership in 22% and 25% of these firms, respectively. Our analysis indicates that, in large, publicly traded companies, both founder and heir firms are significantly more opaque than diffuse shareholder firms. We also find that founder and heir-controlled firms exhibit a negative relation to performance in all but the most transparent firms. Surprisingly, additional tests reveal that concerns about divergences it) ownership versus control (management type, dual class shares, and board influence) appear to be Substantially less important than corporate opacity in explaining the performance impacts of founder and heir control. Finally, we decompose corporate opacity into disclosure and market scrutiny components, finding that the disclosure quality component appears to be of greater importance to investors. However, irrespective of whether these controlling shareholders create or stay in the firm because of corporate opacity, our analysis suggests that founders and heirs in large, publicly traded firms exploit opacity to extract private benefits at the expense of minority investors.

The proportion of individuals who use outdoor recreation services increases with income, and frequency of use differs by the users' gender and life situation (e.g., depending on whether they are students or older citizens). The decomposition of distributive incidence shows that a bias in favor of high-income groups may be accentuated when the perceived value of these services is taken into account in monetary terms. We compare alternative strategies in terms of equity for improving recreation opportunities, e.g., reduced distance to or increased acreage of recreation sites. Our results indicate that although these strategies improve the welfare distribution among the income groups, a considerable proportion of benefits nevertheless accrue to high-income groups.","[Huhtala, Anni; Pouta, Eija] MTT Econ Res, Agrifood Res Finland, Helsinki 00410, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Huhtala, A (通讯作者)，MTT Econ Res, Agrifood Res Finland, Luutnantintie 13, Helsinki 00410, Finland.",anni.huhtala@mtt.fi,,"Pouta, Eija/0000-0002-4580-1237; Huhtala, Anni/0000-0002-8613-3749",,,,,43,9,10,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

When examining human-weather relationships, it is often advantageous to examine air masses, which take into account the entire parcel of air over a region. Spatial synoptic classification characterizes air masses based upon numerous meteorological variables at a given location. Thus, rather than examining temperature or precipitation individually, here we compare daily ridership to synoptic air mass classifications for three urban rail systems: Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), and the Hudson-Bergen light-rail line in northern New Jersey. Air masses are found to have a significant impact on daily rail ridership, with usage typically increasing on dry, comfortable days and decreasing on moist, cool ones, particularly on weekends. Although the comfort of a particular air mass changes throughout the year, seasonality is not a significant factor with respect to the air mass-ridership relationship. The results of this study can benefit rail system managers who must predict daily ridership or in the development of cost-benefit analyses for station improvements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Workers are ex ante identical but not ex post since their jobs can be hit by a technological shock which decreases their productivity. They reside in a city, and commuting to the job center involves both pecuniary and time costs. As a result, workers with high wages are willing to live closer to jobs to save on time commuting costs. We show that, in equilibrium, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the productivity space and the urban location space. Workers with high productivities and wages reside close to jobs, have low per distance commuting costs and pay high land rents. We also show that higher per distance commuting costs and higher unemployment benefits lead to more job destruction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

While the home has become what might be called a communication hub, open to question is the impact this Virtual mobility is having on our physical mobility. The questions we address in this article concern the extent to which network communication is carried out in our homes and this in relation to (I) activities that demand transport, (2) those of us who utilize these options, and (3) the virtual and physical mobility/communication patterns. Data from a nationwide Norwegian sample are utilized in investigating these questions. The dataset comprises 2700 respondents with access to the Internet at home and who answered questions about daily travel and home-based use of information and communication technology (ICT) for purposes such as information-seeking, shopping, paid work, net-banking, chatting and playing games. The analysis indicates that while use of the Internet for many of these activities is common, it varies between groups. We discuss whether virtual activities have physical equivalents - physical twins - or whether these come in addition to previous equivalent activities. It is shown that the relation between virtual and physical mobility varies depending on type of activity and social group, but, Overall, that is not very strong. One possible explanation is that many new ICT services and applications do not have as clear-cut functional equivalents - or physical twins - as many of the earlier ICT technologies had. and, if true, will make it increasingly difficult to track down the interplay between transport and communication.

This paper proposes a micro-founded model of wage rigidity-an equilibrium business cycle model of job search, where risk neutral firms post optimal long-term contracts to attract risk averse workers. Equilibrium contracts feature wage smoothing, limited by the inability of parties to commit to contracts. The model is consistent with aggregate wage data if neither worker nor firm can commit, producing too rigid wages otherwise. Wage rigidity does not lead to a substantial increase in the cyclical volatility of unemployment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Managers are more likely to initiate share repurchases when employees hold a large stake in the firm.

Private sector's expectations, in these studies, are often taken to be homogeneous and rational, at least in the limit of a learning process. In this paper, instead, we consider the case in which private agents are heterogeneous in their expectations formation mechanisms and hold heterogeneous expectations in equilibrium. We investigate the impact of this heterogeneity in expectations on central bank's policy implementation and on the ensuing economic outcomes, and the general result that emerges is that the central bank should disregard inaccurate private sector expectations and solely base its policy on the accurate ones.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Berardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Michele.Berardi@manchester.ac.uk,"Berardi, Michele/ABD-2410-2020","Berardi, Michele/0000-0001-8145-5207",,,,,27,11,12,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

A very important part in this dialogue is played by the instrumental panel and also by the other devices of the financial administration control, which will have to be readjusted in a proper manner according to the changes occurred within the economic and business environment.","[Aslau, Titus; Cuc, Lavinia Denisia] Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Arad, Romania",Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad,,07titus@gmail.com; laviniacuc@yahoo.com,"Cuc, Lavinia Denisia Lavinia/AAI-6979-2021","Cuc, Lavinia Denisia Lavinia/0000-0002-6416-259X",,,,,6,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,21,25,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS73,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287985000003,0

Trade liberalisation has had a larger impact, particularly on imports of intermediate goods and exports of certain manufactures.

The analysis demonstrates that poor and rural households are not the main beneficiaries of the expanded network. The results of the CGE model show that direct price effects are weaker than general equilibrium effects on poverty and inequality.

The problem studied is to find a linear index of economic variables that responds to perturbations in the same direction as social well-being. The thesis of a large literature, that net national product (which is a flow) is that index in closed economies, is shown in some interpretations to be simply false and in others to suffer from deep estimation problems. It is argued that capital depreciation using shadow prices should certainly be included in national accounts, but that the right welfare index is a comprehensive measure of wealth, defined as the shadow value of an economy's stock of all capital assets. It is shown that comprehensive wealth is usable as a criterion for policy evaluation as well as for determining sustainable economic development.","Univ Cambridge, St Johns Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Dasgupta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, St Johns Coll, Cambridge, England.",partha.dasgupta@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,140,116,124,2,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, this modem learning and teaching concept has not been equally accepted throughout student population. There are numerous reasons for this state of affairs, one of the most important ones being disproportion, i.e. unequal pace of its introduction at different university and vocational studies in Croatia. These discrepancies cannot be eliminated without active support by all the actors participating in the education process. The greatest responsibility, nevertheless, lies with the people directly in charge of the e-learning process. To fulfil its task more efficiently, e-learning management requires relevant information on different aspects of its usage, as well as its acceptance among students.

PE internationalization not only has theoretic support but also actual support, as well. Compared with dominant internationalization, recessive internationalization is more urgent and feasible for PE. The financial crisis has had a huge negative influence on the global economy, but to the PE that has had a long-term premeditation to internationalize, this is actually as if it is a the heaven-sent opportunity for going global. While we consider that internationalization resembles a double-edged sword, where opportunity and challenge coexist, the PE must think in depth, plan carefully, and do things within the limits of their own energy. If they do this, then its successful internationalization may go steadily and quickly.

My attempts to establish pricing theory for options fell a bit short of the Black-Scholes-Merton Holy Grail. For life cycle investing, mathematicians' maximum growth Kelly criterion was debunked, as were vulgar notions that necessarily riskiness is averaged downward for long-term investors. Popular Markowitz-Tobin quadratic programming was shown to hold generically only for smallest price variations or for unrealistic risk-aversion functions. Because economic history at best obeys only quasi-stationary probabilities, no sure-thing formulas will ever be definable.

While the results of the April legislative elections confirm a slow but steady change in electoral politics, the July presidential election also highlights a degree of continuity through the re-election of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. However, the incumbent's landslide victory does not guarantee that his second term will be more effective than the first.

The aim of this paper is to assess the extent of inequity in prescription drug use for people eligible for Ontario Drug Benefit coverage, and to explore the different possible explanations for inequities. The analyses draw on the Canadian Community Health Survey from 2005, which is linked to pharmacy and Ontario Health Insurance Plan claims data. We model the number of therapeutically different prescription drugs and the total expenditures on medications on a set of health, demographic, and socioeconomic indicators, and we calculate the concentration index of income-related inequality in medicine use. The results show that low-income individuals who have enrolled in the reduced cost-sharing program on average use more medications than those with higher income, even after adjusting for a comprehensive set of health and demographic variables. While Ontario's public drug program appears to have ensured access to medications for low-income seniors, the results of this study raise concerns about the potential inappropriateness of medication use and point to a gap in drug policy in Ontario.","[Allin, Sara] Univ Toronto, Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Laporte, Audrey] Univ Toronto, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Allin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,40,6,9,0,14,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Our analysis considers abatement, monitoring and sanctioning costs, as well as perfect and imperfect information on the part of the regulator with regard to the polluters' abatement costs. Under perfect information we find that (a) the total-cost-effective design of a program based on standards is one in which the standards are firm specific and perfectly enforced, and (b) the total cost of an optimally designed program based on standards is lower than the total cost of an optimally designed transferable emission permits system, except under special conditions. This is true when it is optimum to induce perfect compliance and when it is not. Under imperfect information, nevertheless, it is only by implementing a system of tradable permits and perfectly enforcing it with a constant marginal penalty tied to the price of the permits, that the regulator can surmount the informational problem and at the same time minimize the total cost of the program with certainty.","[Caffera, Marcelo] Univ Montevideo, Dept Econ, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Chavez, Carlos A.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Montevideo; Universidad de Concepcion,"Caffera, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montevideo, Dept Econ, Prudencio Pena 2440, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay.",marcaffera@um.edu.uy; cchavez@udec.cl,"Chávez, Carlos/AAL-9080-2021","Chávez, Carlos/0000-0002-6045-2282",,,,,15,7,9,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We present short questions that only state the nature of the small crime, as well as vignette questions, describing in detail a fictitious person committing the small crime and other factors related to the circumstances in which the small crime is committed. We find that the perceived severity of small crimes varies systematically with characteristics of the respondent as well as of the person committing the crime.

Politicians may be good, bad, or populist. Initially the existence of only good and populist politicians is assumed: the incentives for good politicians to pool with or separate from populists are investigated and the implications for voter welfare are explored. Then the consequences of the inclusion of bad politicians are considered. The paper makes three main contributions. First, I provide a rational choice analysis of populism as populism is commonly understood. Second, I locate a potential role for government as a persuasive provider of information regarding the quality of policy. Third, when bad politicians are added to the analysis, it is shown that a little potential corruption can improve voter welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Deviations of the federal funds rate from its target can be interpreted as demand innovations for federal funds. Permanent adjustments to demand are modeled as an unobserved component and estimated using the Kalman filter to identify liquidity effects. The demand-based approach for identifying the liquidity effect contrasts previous work which concentrates on errors forecasting the supply of federal funds. This paper finds a liquidity effect several times larger than that from previous studies, indicating the market for federal funds is less liquid than previously thought.

Applying generalized method of moments estimators to large samples of Chinese firms, we estimate the stochastic discount rates derived from actual investment and examine how they vary across institutional variables. We document robust evidence that ownership is the primary institutional factor affecting corporate investment in China. The derived discount rate for a nonstate firm is approximately 10 percentage points higher than that of an otherwise equal state firm.

A society's cultural orientation toward egalitarianism is manifested by intolerance for abuses of market and political power and a desire for protecting less powerful actors. We show egalitarianism to be based on exogenous factors including social fractionalization, dominant religion circa 1900, and war experience from the 19th century. We find a robust influence of egalitarianism distance on cross-national flows of bond and equity issuances, syndicated loans, and mergers and acquisitions. An informal cultural institution largely determined a century or more ago, egalitarianism exercises its effect on international investment via an associated set of consistent contemporary policy choices. But even after controlling for these associated policy choices, egalitarianism continues to exercise a direct effect on cross-border investment flows, likely through its direct influence on managers' daily business conduct.

We develop three proxies for underwriter reputation based on either the registered capital of each underwriter, the relative market share, or the number of all IPOs managed by each underwriter. We find little influence of underwriter reputation on the level of IPO underpricing, but a significantly positive relationship between underwriter reputation and the level of IPO long-run performance, which is meaningful for both academics and professionals. Although the significantly negative three-year market-adjusted buy-and-hold abnormal return suggests a potential loss to investors who hold Chinese IPOs in the long run, investing in IPOs managed by more prestigious underwriters helps mitigate the loss. The results are robust to various checks that control for the problem of endogeneity or correct for cross-sectional dependence of observations in the buy-and-hold abnormal returns.

The analysis also reveals a threshold effect where only misalignments exceeding a certain level of overvaluation have a positive and significant impact on future volatility.

The number of passengers boarding at each station in the Madrid Metro network is estimated as a function of the characteristics of the stations (type, number of lines, accessibility within the network, etc.) and of the areas they serve (population and employment characteristics, land-use mix, street density, presence of feeder modes, etc.). The paper considers the need to evaluate the distance threshold used (not the choice of a fixed distance threshold by assimilation from other studies), the distance calculation procedure (network distance versus straight-line distance) and, above all, the use of distance-decay weighted regression (so that the data from the bands nearer the stations have a greater weighting in the model than those farther away). Analyses carried out show that weighting the variables according to the distance-decay functions provides systematically better results. The choice of distance threshold also significantly improves outcomes. When an all-or-nothing function is used, the way the service area is calculated (straight-line or network distances) does not seem to have a decisive influence on the results. However, it seems to be more influential when distance-decay weighting is used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper argues that in malapportioned legislatures, such as the U.S. Senate, industries become over-represented in a legislature if they are disproportionately located in small constituencies. As a result, industries that are disproportionately located in smaller constituencies are likely to receive greater protection from international trade. To argue this point theoretically, this paper develops a new model, combining legislative bargaining and a model of lobbying to study trade protection while allowing for a legislature with multiple legislators and differently sized constituencies. We then test the predictions of this new model using tariff votes from the U.S. Senate in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and a panel of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade in the U.S. in the 1990s. Considerable support is found for the model's predictions. Industries concentrated in states where the population is low receive greater protection from imports.","[Hauk, William R., Jr.] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Hauk, WR (通讯作者)，Moore Sch Business, Dept Econ, 1705 Coll St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",hauk@moore.sc.edu,"Hauk, William/AFL-6109-2022","Hauk, William/0000-0003-1754-9019",,,,,23,4,4,0,11,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN, MA 02148-529 USA",0954-1985,,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Model fit is poor when epsilon is too small or too large, although the fitted LGDs have strong bi-modal distribution with very small epsilon. Therefore, models that produce strong bi-model pattern do not necessarily have good model fit and accurate LGD predictions.

Projects turn out randomly a quick payoff or a long-term payoff that requires a rollover of the loan. The model generates, under proper parameter conditions, two steady states without or with rollover, and rollover is socially inefficient. Under imperfect information, the standard debt contract is privately efficient. However, it extends the domains of equilibria with socially inefficient rollover. The global dynamics displays a continuum of equilibrium paths that each exhibits sudden discontinuities-crises-in which the mass of outstanding loans is reduced by a quantum amount of terminations.

We show that with the Sims-type (1994) transaction-cost technology, a passive, rather than an active, interest-rate rule is more likely to generate a stabilizing effect against belief-driven fluctuations if both the intertemporal elasticity of substitution with respect to consumption and the sensitivity of the transaction costs with respect to the velocity of money are low. This result is valid under either an unbounded or a bounded transaction-cost technology. Of importance, our result is relevant under empirically plausible parameters, while it sharply contrasts with Taylor's (1993) prediction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A private bidder does not know a firm's true valuation, which affects its gain from a potential takeover. Consequently, a private bidder pursues a suboptimal restructuring policy. An alternative route is to complete an initial public offering (IPO) first. An IPO reduces valuation uncertainty, leading to a more efficient acquisition strategy, therefore enhancing firm value. We calibrate the model using data on IPOs and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The resulting comparative statics generate several novel qualitative and quantitative predictions, which complement the predictions of other theories linking IPOs and M&As. For example, the time it takes a newly public firm to attempt an acquisition of another firm is expected to increase in the degree of valuation uncertainty prior to the firm's IPO and in the cost of going public, and it is expected to decrease in the valuation surprise realized at the time of the IPO. We find strong empirical support for the model's predictions.","[Hsieh, Jim] George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Lyandres, Evgeny] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02445 USA; [Zhdanov, Alexei] Univ Lausanne, CH-1007 Lausanne, Switzerland",George Mason University; Boston University; University of Lausanne,"Hsieh, J (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Management, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jhsieh@gmu.edu; lyandres@bu.edu; azhdanov@unil.ch,,,,,,,60,52,55,0,35,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The intent of this paper is to model and jointly estimate preference heterogeneity using stated-preference choice data and preference-statement data. The starting point for this analysis is the belief that the individual has preferences, and both his/her choices and preference statements are manifestations of those preferences. Our modeling contribution is linking the choice data and preference-statement data in a latent-class framework. Estimation is straightforward using the E-M algorithm, even though our model has hundreds of preference parameters. Our estimates demonstrate that: (1) within a preference class, the importance anglers associate with different Green Bay site characteristics is in accordance with their responses to the preference statements; (2) estimated across-class utility parameters for fishing Green Bay are affected by the preference-statement data; (3) estimated across-class preference-statement response probabilities are affected by the inclusion of the choice data; and (4) both data sets influence the number of classes and the probability of belonging to a class as a function of the individual's type.","[Breffle, William S.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Morey, Edward R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Thacher, Jennifer A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",Michigan Technological University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of New Mexico,"Breffle, WS (通讯作者)，Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Business & Econ, 126 Acad Off Bldg,1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",wsbreffl@mtu.edu; Edward.Morey@Colorado.edu; jthacher@unm.edu,", Edward Morey/GYA-2829-2022; Thacher, Jennifer A/F-5035-2012","MOREY, EDWARD/0000-0002-4992-0786",,,,,50,27,38,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The ACA transforms the non-group insurance market in the United States, mandates that most residents have health insurance, significantly expands public insurance and subsidizes private insurance coverage, raises revenues from a variety of new taxes, and reduces and reorganizes spending under the nation's largest health insurance plan, Medicare. Projecting the impacts of such fundamental reform to the health care system is fraught with difficulty. But such projections were required for the legislative process, and were delivered by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This paper discusses the projected impact of the ACA in more detail, and describes evidence that sheds light upon the accuracy of the projections. It begins by reviewing in broad detail the structure of the ACA, and then reviews evidence from a key case study that informs our understanding of the ACA's impacts: a comparable health reform that was carried out in Massachusetts four years earlier. The paper discusses the key results from that earlier reform and what they might imply for the impacts of the ACA. The paper ends with a discussion of the projected impacts of the ACA and offers some observations on those estimates.","MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Gruber, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gruberj@mit.edu,,,,,,,24,15,21,0,9,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The data used is of privately-securitized subprime ARMs (adjustable rate mortgages), originated between 1997 and 2008, and observed between 2000 and 2009. The period studied thus encompasses the beginning of the subprime crisis. Given the estimated model, contractual properties of the loans are then used to infer the market price of default risk for the various quarters of origination. It is empirically determined that a change in the inherent nature of borrowers led to a deterioration in their default performance, a change which can be first detected in late 2004. On the other hand, the evidence also indicates that the secondary mortgage market became aware of this change at about this same time. The large rise in defaults in 2007 cannot, therefore, be attributed to any surprise other than the unexpectedly large fall in housing prices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We show that the central bank should lower the interbank rate when confronted with a crisis that causes a disparity in the liquidity held among banks. This suggests that the traditional tenet prescribing the separation between prudential regulation and monetary policy should be abandoned.

We apply this model to international equity and bond markets, to allow for inter-market movements.

Systematic factors make very little contribution to spreads, even if higher moments or downside effects are taken into account. Instead we find that sizes of spreads are strongly related to idiosyncratic-risk factors: not only to idiosyncratic equity volatility, but even more to idiosyncratic bond volatility and idiosyncratic bond value-at-risk. Idiosyncratic bond volatility helps to explain spreads because it reflects not just the distribution of firm value but is also a proxy for liquidity risk. Idiosyncratic bond value-at-risk adds to this by capturing the left-skewness of the firm-value distribution. We confirm our results both for the initial 1997-2004 sample period and also out of sample for 2005-2009, which includes the sub-prime crisis. Overall, credit spreads are large because they incorporate a large risk premium related to investors' fears of extreme losses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a new theoretical model, using a mechanism design method, which predicts the substitution between the two credits and its counter-cyclic behavior, subject to the condition of technological efficiency not less than one. This model also helps explain the somewhat contradictory evidence in the literature, on the relationship between the two credits. We present empirical evidence on the substitution effect and its counter-cyclic behavior, by using a balanced panel data set of 284 listed Chinese companies for the period 1998-2006. We further find that the substitution behaves counter-cyclically with respect to the coincident macroeconomic indicator, namely, GDP.

Limited access to private and public transport has often been identified as a major contributing factor to social isolation and economic poverty that certain groups in the community experience. To date, an insufficient amount of research attention has focused on the elderly or seniors, who are often identified as being subject to social exclusion because of difficulties associated with travelling outside their homes to access services and facilities especially for non-car drivers. Moreover, a disproportionate amount of research undertaken on transport related forms of social exclusion in Australia has understandably looked towards the outskirts of its major urban centres, where services and facilities are sparsely located and generally only accessible by car. This paper provides a different insight by analysing a middle distant municipality where large spatial concentrations of seniors are to be found, some of whom do not have ready access to a car or have difficulty accessing the public bus service. Using a variety of data sources for a municipality in Melbourne, this case study reveals that social exclusion of non-car driving seniors is reinforced by a regional public transport system that cannot adequately service the entire municipality. For now, the incidence of locational and transport related disadvantage is restricted to small pockets of the municipality, but as seniors age and surrender their car driving licences this problem could become more serious. The study concludes by calling for more analyses to be undertaken into transport engendered social exclusion if this problem is to be contained as the post-war baby-boomers generation ages across most of the middle suburbs of Australian cities.

The irrigation game was used to explore the provision and appropriation decisions under asymmetric or sequential appropriation, complemented by a voluntary contribution mechanism experiment which looks at provision decisions under symmetric appropriation. The overall results were consistent with the patterns of previous studies: the zero contribution hypotheses is rejected whereas the most effective institution to increase cooperation was face-to-face communication, although we find that communication works much more effectively in Colombia than in Kenya.

To explore these issues, this paper presents a case study of municipal water conservation in Canada. The analysis identifies governance-related barriers to water conservation and explores the relationship between these barriers and broader issues stemming from the multi-scalar, fragmented nature of environmental governance in Canada.","[Furlong, Kathryn] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Bakker, Karen] Univ British Columbia, Program Water Governance, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Bakker, Karen] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Universite de Montreal; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Furlong, K (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",,,"Furlong, Kathryn/0000-0001-8968-0142",,,,,79,14,15,0,59,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This means that people are seen as fully rational and acting in a self-regarding manner. In line with this, economics emphasizes efficient policy solutions and the associated advantages of price incentives. Behavioral economics offers alternative, more realistic views on individual behavior. In this paper we investigate opportunities to integrate bounded rationality and other-regarding preferences into environmental policy theory to arrive at recommendations for more effective policies. For this purpose, we will address decisions made under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, decision heuristics, other-regarding preferences, heterogeneity, evolutionary selection of behaviors, and the role of happiness. Three aspects of environmental policy are considered in detail, namely sustainable consumption, environmental valuation and policy design. We pay special attention to the role of non-pecuniary, informative instruments and illustrate the implications for climate policy.","[Gsottbauer, Elisabeth; van den Bergh, Jeroen C. J.

Standard regression analyses do not show any significant dynamic relations between daily index futures returns and the trading imbalance, regardless of whether the trading imbalance metric is lagged, contemporaneous, or leads the index futures return. However, when the analyses are focused on periods with extreme trading imbalances I find that the daily index futures returns exhibit significant reversals following periods of extreme (low) trading imbalances and low returns. I also find some evidence of residual momentum in consecutive daily index futures returns following periods of extreme (high) trading imbalances and high returns. Trading simulation, directional accuracy, and market timing tests show these effects to be economically significant, even after accounting for transaction costs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The liquidity of a bond is measured using a recently developed measure called latent liquidity, which is defined as the weighted average turnover of funds holding the bond, where the weights are their fractional holdings of the bond. We find that bonds with higher latent liquidity are more expensive relative to their CDS contracts after controlling for other realized measures of liquidity. Analysis of interaction effects shows that highly illiquid bonds of firms with a greater degree of uncertainty are also expensive, consistent with limits to arbitrage between CDS and bond markets, due to the higher costs of shorting illiquid bonds. Additionally, we document the positive effects of liquidity in the CDS market on the CDS-bond basis. We also find that several firm- and bond-level variables related to credit risk affect the basis, indicating that the CDS spread does not fully capture the credit risk of the bond.","[Nashikkar, Amrut] Barclays Capital Inc, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Nashikkar, Amrut] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Subrahmanyam, Marti G.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Mahanti, Sriketan] Orissagrp, Waltham, MA 02451 USA",Barclays; New York University; New York University,"Nashikkar, A (通讯作者)，Barclays Capital Inc, 745 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019 USA.",amrut.nashikkar@barclayscapital.com; subrahm@stern.nyu.edu; sriketan@idomail.com,,,,,,,26,59,73,4,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

However, empirical evidence on the effects of an RMB appreciation on China's exports has been mixed for the largest category of exports, processed exports. Since much of the value-added of these goods comes from parts and components produced in Japan, South Korea, and other East Asian supply chain countries, it is important to control for exchange rate changes in these countries. Employing DOLS techniques and quarterly data, this paper finds that exchange rate appreciations across supply chain countries would cause a much larger drop in processed exports than a unilateral appreciation of the RMB.

The problem of global environmental negotiations is argued to be of the nature of a bargaining problem, in which bargainers must agree on the distribution of cooperative surplus in order to move to the bargaining frontier. We discuss the importance of both efficiency (bargaining frontier) and fairness (recognition of characteristics of bargainers) in the choice of the appropriate contract. We show that the incremental cost contract, used to resolve the biodiversity bargaining problem, is of the form of an extreme point contract that fails to recognise the contributions of the South to the production of cooperative surplus. A rational response to such a contract is the use of threats of biodiversity destruction.

Women contribute less to this household common pool than men and opportunism is widespread. These results cast doubts on many models of household decision making.

If promised payments are viewed as default free, then it is appropriate to use discount rates given by the Treasury yield curve. If plans are frozen at June 2009 levels, then the present value of liabilities would be $4.4 trillion. Under the typical actuarial method of recognizing future service and wage increases, this figure rises to $5.2 trillion. Compared to $1.8 trillion in pension fund assets, the baseline level of unfunded liabilities is therefore around $3 trillion. A 1 percentage point reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) would lower total liabilities by 9-11%; implementing actuarially fair early retirement would reduce them by 2-5%; and increasing the retirement age by 1 year would reduce them by 2-4%. Dramatic policy changes, such as the elimination of COLAs or the implementation of Social Security retirement age parameters, would leave liabilities around $1.5 trillion more than plan assets. This suggests that taxpayers will bear the lion's share of the costs associated with the legacy liabilities of state DB pension plans.","[Novy-Marx, Robert] Univ Rochester, Simon Grad Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Novy-Marx, Robert; Rauh, Joshua D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rauh, Joshua D.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Rochester; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University,"Novy-Marx, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Grad Sch Business, 305 Schlegel Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",robert.novy-marx@simon.rochester.edu; joshua-rauh@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,16,16,26,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

This type of performance-based decision-making has been repeatedly highlighted as key to achieving favorable development assistance outcomes in a variety of programming areas. I collect recipient environmental performance information from all available post-project evaluations since 1990 and create an indicator of environmental reputation using a Bayesian updating model. I use this environmental reputation indicator to demonstrate that the ADB responds to previous borrower environmental performance when approving environmentally risky projects, but that past environmental performance does not positively influence the allocation of projects with no environmental risks.

I present three new empirical facts about the evolution of city growth. First, the distribution of cities growth rates is skewed to the right in most countries and decades. Second, within a country, the average rank of each decade's fastest-growing cities tends to rise over time. Finally, this rank increases faster in periods of rapid growth in urban population. These facts can be interpreted as evidence in favor of the hypothesis that historically, urban agglomerations have followed a sequential growth pattern: Within a country, the initially largest city is the first to grow rapidly for some years. At some point, the growth rate of this city slows down and the second-largest city then becomes the fastest-growing one. Eventually, the third-largest city starts growing fast as the two largest cities slow down, and so on. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A close examination of this rule reveals that it ranks portfolios by computing the divergence, in the Kullback-Leibler sense, between the unweighted portfolio return distribution and a tilted distribution meaned at the predetermined target or benchmark rate of return selected by or imposed upon the investor. This result implies, in the IID case, that Stutzer's rules can be written as a benchmark constrained Kullback-Leibler-based optimization problem with an endogenous utility interpretation. Here we expand on this idea by introducing two closely related portfolio selection rules based on the empirical likelihood divergence and the Hellinger-Matusita distance. The first of these is the reversed Kullback-Leibler divergence and the second is proportional to the average of the two divergences. The theoretical and in-sample properties of the new criteria suggest them to be competitive with and in some cases better than existing methods, especially in terms of skewness preference.

The effective allocation proportion between the two offerings is determined by a high level of syndicate discretion but before the bookbuilding period starts. Claw back clauses, a typical device of Italian IPOs, allow the syndicate to shift shares ex post from the retail to the institutional offering in a discretionary fashion. We document significant increases of the retail offering size ex post and show that this is done by more reputable underwriters in IPOs with lower institutional demand, a higher proportion of secondary shares and significantly lower levels of initial underpricing. As a result, retail investors end up buying more shares only in less profitable IPOs, although the net economic effect on their expected returns is rather small. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

First, by formulating urban pollution as a dirty input in manufacturing, we find that an increase in the urban pollution tax rate can increase the level of urban unemployment even with intersectoral capital mobility. That is, the optimistic finding by Rapanos (2007) that environmental protection policy reduces urban unemployment in the long run does not always hold. Second, the (sub)optimal pollution tax rate under urban unemployment is higher than the Pigouvian tax rate (the marginal damage of pollution).

The study found differences in local food perceptions, buying experiences and perceived benefits and risks associated with local food sourcing activities. The study also identified some competition between local independent food retailers and alternative market outlets.

Social entrepreneurial initiatives are identified as a set of innovative approaches for dealing with complex social needs. With its unconventional approach to resolving social issues coupled with its emphasis on deriving benefits of collaboration among different groups, social entrepreneurial initiatives transcend tradition views on entrepreneurship to develop radical and new strategies for resolving existing social issues. However, the understanding of social entrepreneurship is still limited offering an opportunity for extended research in this domain. This paper attempts to provide an insight into the emergence of social entrepreneurship in developing nations as a radical and effective mechanism for dealing with social problems. The first part of the paper deals with the examination of the unique preconditions in developing countries influencing the emergence and development of social entrepreneurship. The second part of the paper discusses the key characteristics of social entrepreneurial initiatives as an outcome of the entrepreneurial conundrum in developing countries.

Looking at the airline industry, business models are converging. Low-cost carriers increasingly serve holiday destinations. Some scheduled and charter airlines are adopting successful low-cost carriers' elements and participating in the low cost market. The boundaries between these models are increasingly diminishing. Consequently, due to the rapid changes in the airline industry and ever-increasing competition between carriers, only the most adaptable ones will survive and evolve further. The main objective of this paper is to examine how different airline business models affect both aeronautical and commercial revenues of Croatian airports. Moreover, it measures and compares the impact of three main airline business models traditional scheduled, charter and low-cost - on airports' commercial revenues. Two empirical models are used to estimate the rate of growth with regard to flight and passenger numbers. The explanatory variables in the first model include low-cost, charter and full service carrier flights, while the second model consists of passengers from low-cost, charter and full service airlines. The time period considered is from 2004 to 2008. The results indicate that the flights of all three airline business models contribute significantly to airports' aeronautical revenues. However, charter airlines have the largest impact on airports' aeronautical revenues. On the other hand, the figures show that charter and full service passengers have a significant impact on airports' commercial revenues. By contrast, the contribution of low-cost passengers to airports' commercial revenues is still insignificant. The findings have important implications for airport managers. In particular these include complementing airline business models and generating more commercial revenues.","[Bezic, Heri] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,,bezic@efri.hr; katija.vojvodic@unidu.hr,"Bezić, Heri/S-5281-2018",,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

This paper uses an evaluation of Law 25/2009 on Public Services as a means to assess whether the new political setting has increased the leverage of the citizenry over the state. Adopted in July 2009, the law introduced a range of regulations for public service providers. It also expanded the responsibilities of the Ombudsman's office and called for the establishment of citizen committees to monitor public service delivery. However, the legal quality of the law is poor and the broader institutional and political environment is not conducive to its enforcement. Overall, the law aims beyond the capacity of the current political and legal system. Ironically, in order for society to gain greater leverage in politics, state capacity must increase as well.","No Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Buehler, M (通讯作者)，No Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",mbuehler1@niu.edu,,"Buehler, Michael/0000-0003-4892-0183",,,,,57,9,9,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

These times were characterized by an increase of state debt as a result of a postwar economic reconstruction. From 1949 to 1953 the structure of the state budget was adapting to its new function in the economy and the amount of the debt appeared to stabilize. The most important subject of controversy is the solution chosen in 1953. The monetary reform imposed in that year brought an overall nullification of internal state liabilities. There were two reasons for this decision: to substantively break away from the past and to substantially reduce the value of financial assets held by the wealthier segment of society.","[Chalupecky, Petr; Tajovsky, Ladislav] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Chalupecky, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam Winstona Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",chalupec@vse.cz; hyvrys@post.cz,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The paper disseminates a part of the results obtained within the national research project Parteneriate/Partnership 92116. The research project takes into account ethical and moral issues in higher education with special references to equality of chance, management of diversity and intercultural dialogue-as prerequisite for higher education development and sustainability. The designed methodology consists of case studies, interviews and questionnaires applied both to the Faculty of Business Administration (with subjects taught in foreign languages) at the Academy of Economic Studies Bucharest and the Faculty of Engineering in Foreign Language at Politehnica University from Bucharest. Qualitative interpretation refers to students opinions regarding intercultural sensitivity within the two faculties that function as multicultural learning environments. The team supports the idea according to which intercultural sensitivity and intercultural dialogue issues are very important in order to better understand the complexity and dynamics of multicultural learning environments within the framework of a global knowledge-based society. Intercultural competence and effectiveness can make the difference for the quality and sustainability of higher education. In Romania the previous studies concerning intercultural sensitivity have focus mostly on the ethnic dimension. The originality of our research regards the fact that it focuses mostly on topics such as intercultural effectiveness and intercultural dialogue analyzed within a multicultural learning environment where students interact by learning the same subjects and topics in a foreign language.","[Christina, Suciu Marta; Marian, Ramona Spiridon] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,suciuchristina@yahoo.com; marcella.pompili@uniromal.it; marta.donolo@gmail.com; Ramona.spiridon@yahoo.com,"Neagu, Ana-Maria/P-3805-2015","Neagu, Ana-Maria/0000-0002-9660-4380",,,,,25,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-6-9,,,,2011,,,,,,,2363,2379,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEO28,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000317550001128,0

The article tries to find the basic relationship between the behavior of investors and that of financial intermediaries who can, on the basis of published information, intensify current financial market development.","[Gargulakova, Monika] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Fio Banka, AS, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,monika.gargulakova@fio.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-020-2,,,,2011,,,,,,,108,115,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBD48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306544000009,0

This study attempted to examine the perceptions of youth towards the use of celebrities in advertisements in Pakistan to get an insight about its effectiveness.

An important indicator of regional importance of this sector is less than 19 thousand registered vine-growers in the country. The wine-production industry is participated in the job creation as well as to promote the development of downstream industries such as glass, steel, machinery and equipment, transportation, hotels and restaurants and more. Specialized human resources are mostly college graduates from the Mendel University and students from many secondary vocational schools. The wine sector can help to reduce seasonal unemployment, because this sector needs to use other human recourses to the other necessary activities.

An Analysis with Scanner Data for the German Market of Yoghurt,GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,German,Article,,,,,,product innovations; scanner data; yoghurt market; Germany; hedonic prices,FOOD-INDUSTRY; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE,"A high degree of product proliferation is characteristic for many markets of processed foods, as is an increasing competition due to globalization and a further liberalization of agricultural markets. It seems increasingly important to secure market shares and sectoral income on unregulated food markets, e. g. by the successful introduction of new food products. It is the objective of this article to elaborate for a market with a high degree of product differentiation, i.e. the German yoghurt market, which determinants may affect the success of product innovations. To examine this question, scanner data are utilized. The success of innovations is measured by the revenue reached within a year after the introduction of a new product in a specified number of stores. As all selected products remained on the shelves for at least 12 months after their introduction, we compare product innovations with a minimum degree of market success among each other. Multiple regression analyses reveal that the variation of revenues across 41 new products can be explained by more than 90 % with ingredients and other attributes of the products, with the type of the marketing channel, with characteristics of the innovations and dummy variables for the names of the manufacturing firms. Interestingly, it is not so much the price premium of an innovation that matters as it is often stressed in hedonic analyses. According to our success criterion, it is more important to realize a sizeable share of the market in order to create a particularly successful new product.","[Herrmann, Roland; Schroeck, Rebecca] Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Herrmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agrarpolit & Marktforsch, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",Roland.Herrmann@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,33,0,0,1,14,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Concentrated funds with higher levels of tracking error display better performance than their more broadly diversified counterparts. We show that the observed relation between portfolio concentration and performance is mostly driven by the breadth of the underlying fund strategies; not just by fund managers' willingness to take big bets. Our results indicate that when investors strive to select the best-performing funds, they should not only consider fund managers' tracking-error levels. More important is that they take into account the extent to which fund managers carefully allocate their risk budget across multiple investment strategies and have concentrated holdings in multiple market segments simultaneously.

It is alleged that trading in CDS caused the 2007 credit crisis, and therefore trading CDS is an evil which needs to be eliminated or controlled. In contrast, we argue that the trading of CDS is welfare increasing because it facilitates a more optimal allocation of risks in the economy. To perform this function, however, the risk of CDS seller failure needs to be minimized. In this regard, government regulation imposing stricter collateral requirements and higher equity capital for CDS traders need to be imposed.","[Jarrow, Robert A.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jarrow, Robert A.] Kamakura Corp, Honolulu, HI 96815 USA",Cornell University,"Jarrow, RA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",raj15@cornell.edu,,,,,,,71,22,27,0,14,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4803-8,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

However, it is still ambiguous whether the bias remains when the stock market suffers from financial crises. This paper utilizes the disposition coefficient to verify whether the disposition effect exists in Taiwan and Chinese stock markets during the periods of financial crises, and to discuss the differences of the disposition effect between appreciation and depreciation periods. The empirical results show that during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the disposition effect significantly exhibits in the both markets. On the other hand, during the 2008 global financial crisis, the disposition effect only exhibits in Chinese stock market. Nevertheless, there are no significant differences of disposition effect between A-shares and B-shares. This paper further concludes that the disposition effect would significantly exhibit in appreciation period, but not in depreciation period no matter during the global financial crisis or the Asian financial crisis.","[Lin, Huei-Wen] Aletheia Univ, Dept Finance & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan",Aletheia University,,au4345@mail.au.edu.tw,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,5,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-8720-9,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,4.0,,,,,,6,10,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZX59,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303217400002,0

Village funds are analyzed in a cross-sectional approach in comparison to competing financial institutions. We find, first, that they reach the target group of lower income households better than formal financial institutions. Second, village funds provide loans to those kinds of borrowers who tend to be customers of informal financial institutions. Third, village funds help to reduce credit constraints. Thus, village funds provide services in the intended direction, albeit to a seemingly limited degree. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The term structure derived in this paper is governed primarily by the federal funds rate and secondarily by banks' income smoothing behavior. It is consistent with the estimation results and differs significantly from the standard term structure of interest rates. The downturn phase of business cycles appears to be accompanied by more aggressive income smoothing by banks (compared with the upturn phase) due to their pessimistic expectations of future profits. The compositional shift in banks' liabilities during the downturn phase away from CDs toward transaction deposits may pose a greater withdrawal risk for banks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this sense the further research hypothesis was set: SEEC banks are primarily strategically orientated toward retail segment, and they are preferring to finance consumption rather than investment according to what they are designing banking and non-banking products and a manner of market communication. The purpose of this paper consist in estimating the future banks' strategic orientation according to which they are designing assortment of banking and non-banking products and conduct appropriate market activities. In order to test research hypothesis various scientifically based methods were used among most important role have statistical and sampling methods, pooling method and methods of description, analysis and synthesis. The research performed among eight biggest banks operating in Croatian banking market, as a representative of SEEC banking markets, include the gathering of information by questionnaire comprised of 28 questions regarding banks' future strategic orientation, the structure, development and management of banking and non-banking products as well as the future trends in banking industry. Research results confirm the aforementioned hypothesis and indicate that although banks are strategically focused toward retail segment that comprises households and small enterprises and crafts, the most important segment is still households. According to segments focused, banks are trying to expand and enhance the existing assortment of banking and non-banking products and services, taking into account the needs of micro regions. The research results clearly indicate that the bank are introducing a new and develop existing loan and deposit products with rising role of virtual banking in order to maintain and expand strategic position in the very competitive banking market. In addition to typically banking products, banks are focused on the development of non-banking products and services and their connection with banking products, what is directly affecting the availability of funding sources. Aforementioned was confirmed by the surveyed banks' views on further increase in revenues from fees and commissions, so called non-interest revenues, with an emphasis on balancing the share of interest and non-interest revenues in the total revenues from banking business.","[Perak, Ticijan; Zenzerovic, Robert] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Dept Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,,tperusko@efpu.hr; robert.zenzerovic@efpu.hr,"Zenzerović, Robert/AAU-5020-2021","Zenzerović, Robert/0009-0007-6959-6091",,,,,18,0,0,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Capital markets are completely integrated if assets of equal risk have identical expected returns, irrespective of the location of the capital market. Therefore the risk that the investor agrees to take in the integrated international market is the result of common factors and it is not possible to diversify the risk. The degree of financial integration of capital markets can be determined by analyzing the movement of market indices. In this paper the multivariate VAR(5) econometric models were set up and tested in order to analyze the multilateral integration of selected capital markets of developed European countries (Britain and Germany) and selected - new EU member states (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary). Input data of the model are daily stock market indices (FTSE, DAX, BUX, SAX, PX and SBI20) for the time period January 2001 to October 2009. The study was conducted in three stages: In the first stage each series index was tested for the presence of unit roots, in order to determine whether the time series was stationary or not (to do this, ADF and Phillips - Perron tests were used). In the second stage multivariate VAR(5) models were set up, to which the Johansen method for determining cointegration was applied In the third stage of the research process, the dynamics of the integration of underlying capital markets was determined by calculating the relevant lambda(trace) value and dividing it by the critical lambda value.","[Svilokos, Tonci] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,,tonci.svilokos@unidu.hr,"Svilokos, Tonći/JTS-6609-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Productivity development is assessed with the use of Malmquist Indices based on Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The analysis is based on a balanced panel of farm records of 151 organic and conventional farms, respectively. A matching procedure is applied to identify for each organic farm a conventional counterpart with similar structural features. The study reveals a similar development of productivity in organic grazing livestock and mixed farms, but the productivity level is still lower compared to their conventional counterparts. Only organic arable farms had started off with a higher level of productivity in 1999/2000 but they were not able to maintain their advantage over their conventional counterparts. The Malmquist analysis highlights that these changes cannot be attributed to low rates of technical progress. Lack of technical and scale efficiency are rather to be seen as the key drivers of the slowed productivity development in organic agriculture.","[Tiedemann, Torben; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Tiedemann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Agr Okon, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",ttiedem@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",,,,,39,11,11,1,25,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

However, the estimated Markowitz portfolio rule and most of its extensions not only underperform the naive 1/N rule (that invests equally across N assets) in simulations, but also lose money on a risk-adjusted basis in many real data sets. In this paper, we propose an optimal combination of the naive 1/N rule with one of the four sophisticated strategies the Markowitz rule, the Jorion (1986) rule, the MacKinlay and Pastor (2000) rule, and the Kan and Zhou (2007) rule as a way to improve performance. We find that the combined rules not only have a significant impact in improving the sophisticated strategies, but also outperform the 1/N rule in most scenarios. Since the combinations are theory-based, our study may be interpreted as reaffirming the usefulness of the Markowitz theory in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This makes them unique from other universities and extension programs can have a synergistic effect on both agribusiness teaching and research programs. While being relatively young, Agribusiness Extension programs have evolved from a rich history of agricultural economics programs to meet the current needs of a changing clientele and environment. While initial emphasis in extension programming focused on the needs of farmers at the production level of the supply chain, agribusiness extension programming has reached out to involve more suppliers and buyers in support of the entire chain. This paper examines the evolution of agricultural economics into agribusiness extension programs and looks at what is currently happening with agribusiness extension programs including the linkages to research and teaching. The paper then current and predicted trends and what they might mean for agribusiness extension programs in the future. Agribusiness Extension programs have evolved into many strong programs that universities in the face of budget cuts continue to support. However, these programs face many challenges and opportunities and will need to continue to build on their success of providing answers to a changing clientele to take them into a strong future.","[Ward, Ruby A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Woods, Timothy] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Wysocki, Allen] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Kentucky; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Wysocki, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, 1161 McCarty Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ruby.ward@usu.edu; tawoods@uky.edu; wysocki@ufl.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,2,20,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

As of 2008 a lot has changed and the debate over Leaning against the wind or Clean afterwards? is being revisited among central bankers and academicians. At the same time the question Does money matter in monetary policy is on the table again. This paper focuses on the discussion of these issues; moreover, some new challenges that emerged in previous three years are discussed. The crisis has highlighted an urgent need to incorporate banks and financial frictions into monetary policy modelling framework - therefore some new findings on this field of research are outlined. An important lesson from the crises is that price stability is not a sufficient precondition for financial stability, therefore an operational framework for financial stability is being searched this is subject of the final part of this paper.","Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank,"Zamrazilová, E (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Prikope 28, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",eva.zamrazilova@cnb.cz,,,,,,,50,7,7,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This paper develops a framework for recovering information on this question from the spatial pattern of votes cast for referenda on the provision of spatially delineated public goods. We specify a model linking voter support for environmental improvement to the distance at which such improvements are expected to occur. The empirical application is to a river restoration referendum in the Swiss canton of Bern. Our results indicate that the benefits from river restoration have a strong local component, sufficiently strong that voter approval would not occur if only canton-wide benefits were at stake. Surprisingly, support for river restoration is no greater, and in some specifications is actually lower, in locations where rivers are a prominent feature in the environment.","[Deacon, Robert T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Schlaepfer, Felix] Univ Zurich, Socioecon Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schlaepfer, Felix] Fed Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Deacon, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",deacon@econ.ucsb.edu,"Schlapfer, Felix/B-1939-2008","Schlapfer, Felix/0000-0003-2377-2807",,,,,69,6,8,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The issue has been hotly debated in the recent literature. Our main contribution is to use formal modeling to uncover some factors overlooked in these arguments. For example, we show that claims that shareholder control would reduce value because shareholders lack sufficient information to make important decisions or because they have a non-value-maximizing agenda are flawed. We also show, however, that even if shareholders seek to maximize firm value and can delegate decisions to management, shareholders should not control all major decisions.

Instrumental-variable-type estimators are more robust and efficient, although they require restrictive assumptions. We estimate empirical investment models using alternative methods. Real-world investment data contain firm-fixed effects and heteroscedasticity, causing high-order moments estimators to deliver coefficients that are unstable and not economically meaningful. Instrumental variables methods yield estimates that are robust and conform to theoretical priors.

Higher per capita income is associated with higher prices and higher wage dispersion with lower prices. The effects of higher income and wage dispersion are moderated for the more tradable products. The effects of wage dispersion, on the other hand, are magnified for the more labor-intensive products, particularly low-skill services. The differences in prices across countries are reflected in differences in the composition of consumption. Countries in which prices of labor-intensive services are very high, such as the Nordic countries, consume much less of them. For some services, the shares of GDP consumed in high-price countries are less than 20% of the shares in low-price countries. Since these are services of very low tradability, the low consumption levels of these services imply low employment in them.","[Swedenborg, Birgitta] Ctr Business & Policy Studies SNS, S-11486 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lipsey, Robert E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10016 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research,"Swedenborg, B (通讯作者)，Ctr Business & Policy Studies SNS, Box 5629, S-11486 Stockholm, Sweden.",rlipsey@gc.cuny.edu; b.swedenborg@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,5,6,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Using disaggregated CPI data for the United States and Japan, however, this study finds that the relationship is neither linear nor stable over time. The overall relationship is approximately U-shaped around a nonzero threshold inflation rate. RPV therefore changes not with the inflation rate per se, but with the deviation of inflation from the threshold inflation rate. More importantly, the relationship is by no means stable over time but instead varies significantly in a way that coincides with regime changes of inflation or monetary policy. The relationship was positive during the period of high inflation of the 1970s and the early 1980s, as has been documented by a number of previous studies, whereas it takes a U-shape profile during the Great Moderation. The results are robust to the use of core inflation, which excludes the traditionally volatile prices of food and energy. This paper then presents a modified version of the Calvo-type sticky price model to describe the observed empirical regularities. Simulation experiments show that the modified Calvo model fits the data well, and that the underlying relationship hinges upon the degree of price rigidity, which is systematically related to inflation regime. For countries and periods with low inflation rates, the relationship takes a U-shape as price adjustment is more sticky. In a high-inflation environment, when price setting becomes more flexible, the U-shaped profile vanishes.","Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Choi, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",cychoi@uta.edu,,,,,,,40,31,34,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Idiosyncratic risk deters arbitrage, regardless of the arbitrageur's diversification. Reversal is prevalent only in high idiosyncratic risk stocks, suggesting that idiosyncratic risk limits arbitrage in reversal mispricing. This finding is robust to controls for transaction costs, informed trading, and systematic relations between idiosyncratic risk and subsequent returns. Momentum is not related to idiosyncratic risk. Momentum generates a smaller aggregate return than reversal, so the findings along with those in related studies suggest that transaction costs are sufficient to prevent arbitrageurs from eliminating momentum mispricing.","Univ Alberta, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Alberta,"McLean, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Business, 4-20K Business Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada.",rdmclean@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,52,76,84,0,38,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

The instrument is a private contract (tax buyout), offered by the government to each citizen, whereby the citizen can choose to pay a fixed price in exchange for a given reduction in her tax rate for a period of time. We introduce the tax buyout in a dynamic overlapping generations economy, calibrated to match several features of the US income, taxes and wealth distribution. Under simple pricing, the introduction of the buyout is revenue neutral but, by reducing distortions, benefits a significant fraction of the population and leads to sizable increases in aggregate labor supply, income and consumption.

The first outside CEO director appointment has a higher stock-price reaction than the appointment of another outside director.

An important question has remained on the minds of economists despite this success: just how close does the prescriptive SMarT plan come to approximating the normative life-cycle/permanent-income consumption rule? That is, does it pay (in a lifetime utility sense) to participate in a SMarT plan? We attempt to provide some rigorous answers to this question by employing a quantitative-theoretic model to perform dynamic welfare analysis, and our results tend to support the SMarT plan as a decent first approximation to the life-cycle/permanent-income rule. We also consider the problem of an altruistic employer seeking to maximize the lifetime utility of employees by appropriately choosing the default SMarT parameters in the face of employee heterogeneity in saving rates and uncertainty about whether they will actually stick with the plan. The employer's problem is augmented to include employee heterogeneity concerning risk taking, and we also consider the possibility that SMarT saving may be met with increased borrowing.","[Findley, T.

The premium reflects the value of the option to delay developing the marginal piece of undeveloped land. Competition amongst landowners reduces the option value relative to the standard open-city framework, but as long as undeveloped land is heterogeneous-does not reduce it to zero. Calibrating a special case of the model to US data suggests that the premium is economically significant. In addition to proving that prices can exceed costs without regulation, this paper shows that the relationship between volatility and the rate of investment is more complicated than previously thought.

For that purpose the range directional model (RDM), a particular case of the directional distance function, is used for computing efficiency in the presence of negative data. We use RDM efficiency measures to arrive at a Malmquist-type index, which can reflect productivity change, and we use RDM inefficiency measures to arrive at a Luenberger productivity indicator, and relate the two. The productivity index and indicator are developed relative to a fixed meta-technology and so they are referred to as a meta-Malmquist index and meta-Luenberger indicator. We also address the fact that VRS technologies are used for computing the productivity index and indicator (a requirement under negative data), which raises issues relating to the interpretability of the index. We illustrate how the meta-Malmquist index can be used, not only for comparing the performance of a unit in two time periods, but also for comparing the performance of two different units at the same or different time periods. The proposed approach is then applied to a sample of bank branches where negative data were involved. The paper shows how the approach yields information from a variety of perspectives on performance which management can use. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Portela, Maria C. A.

Looking at the strength of firms' balance sheets, this paper shows that the opposite holds true in non-crisis periods. The reason is that balance sheets and thus spending decisions are less affected by external shocks under fixed regimes. This result is obtained through several theoretical and empirical methodologies that are useful for identifying balance sheet effects in a non-crisis setting. Simulations reveal a larger (smaller) output response under flexible regimes when these effects are included (excluded). Although the transmission of foreign interest rate shocks to domestic interest rates is stronger under fixed regimes, it appears the limited effects on balance sheets generate a more muted output response.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Aysun, U (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 341 Mansfield Rd,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",uluc.aysun@uconn.edu,,"Aysun, Uluc/0000-0002-3136-2915",,,,,56,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Most research has focused on disagreement about the expected returns. Several authors have shown that if the average belief coincides with the true expected return, in the portfolio context prices are unaffected by disagreement. In this paper we study the pricing effects of disagreement about return variances. We show that i) disagreement about variances has systematic and significant pricing effects-more disagreement leads to higher prices, and ii) prices are very sensitive to the degree of disagreement: Even if the average belief about the variance is constant, tiny fluctuations in the disagreement about the variance lead to substantial price fluctuations. This second result may offer an explanation for the excess volatility puzzle: When small changes in the degree of disagreement occur, they induce relatively large price changes. Yet, the changes in disagreement may be hard to directly detect empirically, leading to apparent excess volatility.","[Duchin, Ran] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levy, Moshe] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem Sch Business, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Duchin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",duchin@umich.edu; mslm@huji.ac.il,,,,,,,31,9,9,0,17,UNIV WASHINGTON SCH BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATION,SEATTLE,"C/O OFFICE MANAGER, 115 LEWIS HALL, BOX 353200, SEATTLE, WA 98195-3200 USA",0022-1090,,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

As expected, the effect of investment knowledge on belief in one's future capability of orchestrating a plan to achieve investment goals was mediated by confidence. Overall, employees' applied investment knowledge accuracy was low: 57%. In general, investment knowledge was reliably related to confidence. However, confidence and investment knowledge accuracy were completely independent for 9 of 21 items, implying an inability to inhibit poor investment decisions or an inability to exploit investment opportunities. A policy of required investment training could be implemented so as to not impede individuals' freedom of choice, which would likely help the truly uninformed to become more informed and ultimately successful investors.

Both studies indicated that, contrary to what was assumed in the past, the structure of these attitudes is not unidimensional and is reasonably described by two dimensions, Fear of Debt and Debt Utility. In Study 3, confirmatory factor analysis indicated the superiority of the two-factor solution for the attitudes to debt of a sub-sample of Study 1 questioned a year later. The two factors have somewhat different relationships with other variables.

This study adopts a reverse-engineering approach: given a particular market proxy, we find the minimal variations in sample parameters required to ensure that the proxy is mean/variance efficient. Surprisingly, slight variations in parameters, well within estimation error bounds, suffice to make the proxy efficient. Thus, many conventional market proxies could be perfectly consistent with the CAPM and useful for estimating expected returns.","[Roll, Richard] UCLA Anderson, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Levy, Moshe] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Roll, R (通讯作者)，UCLA Anderson, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rroll@anderson.ucla.edu,,,,,,,27,44,52,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

This paper examines whether R&D spending in Europe in a similar way was sensitive to fluctuations in the supply of internal and external equity during the late 1990s and early 2000s. I conjecture that UK and Continental Europe, due to their different financial systems, differ in terms of equity supply. I estimate dynamic R&D regression models for UK and Continental European high-tech firms separately and find significant joint cash-flow effects for newly listed firms in both samples. However, only new firms in the UK experienced a joint external equity effect as well.

We investigate the role of family altruism using both survey data and demographic and local government budget data in Norway from 1992 to 2004.

We build a simple model of the U.S. patent review process. Among the model predictions are that, controlling for a patent's position in a new technology cycle, more important innovations would be approved more quickly. Also, the approval delay is likely to decrease as an industry moves from the early stages of an innovation cycle to later stages. These predictions are in line with the evidence we obtain from a data set on U.S. patents granted in the field of genetically modified crops from 1983 to 1999.

We show how this pattern can arise through the interacting location decisions of sellers, buyers, and non-user households. Areas with high demand density (cities) have lower prices and more tightly packed sellers in equilibrium relative to areas with lower demand density (suburbs) under autarky. When trade between city and suburb is possible, competitive pressure from the city lowers suburban prices and seller density. Higher income households distance themselves from street vice, causing the exposed population to become poorer and disproportionately Black. Even mild preferences over neighborhood racial composition can then induce lower income Whites to exit, resulting in racial segregation. The relationship between segregation and exposure to vice can be non-monotonic and discontinuous: decreased segregation implies greater sorting by income, and hence larger wage disparities between city and suburb. If such disparities get too large, all sales can shift discontinuously to the city and result in higher overall Black exposure even though more Blacks now reside in the suburbs.

Therefore, supermarket managers continue to develop strategies to decrease the customer queue waiting times. This study aims to provide a guide for supermarket managers to efficiently design their check-out areas. For this purpose it develops queuing models to decide if any express check-out lane should be opened. Using the models developed, it investigates the effects of express check-out lanes on the customers' queue waiting times and derives a formula, applicable to any supermarket, for the optimum number of express check-out lanes. Results show that opening express check-out lanes in a supermarket will theoretically never be disadvantageous, provided that the number of express check-out lanes opened is carefully decided.","Mersin Univ, IIBF, TR-33342 Mezitli, Mersin, Turkey",Mersin University,"Aytemiz, T (通讯作者)，Mersin Univ, IIBF, Ciftlikkoyu Kampusu, TR-33342 Mezitli, Mersin, Turkey.",taytemiz@hotmail.com,"Aytemiz, Tevfik/AAA-1872-2021","Aytemiz, Tevfik/0000-0001-8370-4721",,,,,12,0,0,0,5,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

We argue that a team's performance in terms of scored and conceded goals decreases with the distance to the foreign playing venue. To test this hypothesis empirically, we investigate 6389 away games from the German Football Premier League ('Erste Deutsche Bundesliga') between the playing seasons 1986-87 and 2006-07. We find that distance increases a guest team's propensity to concede goals and exhibits a negative but insignificant impact on the ability to score goals. The parameter estimates of the squared distance terms indicate that the effects of distance on team performance are non-monotonic. Further, focusing on the outcome of the game (i.e., win, draw or defeat) as a measure of the overall success of a football team we observe significantly negative effects of distance.

This study examines the impact of degradation of private as well as common pool land resources on migration decisions, based on primary data from over one thousand households in three dry land districts in Gujarat. The study finds that economic assets and natural capital have differential impacts on short-term and long-term migration decisions. Thus, any employment creation in rural dry land regions is likely to help the poorest. Further degradation of common-pool land resources influences short-term but not long-term migration. Therefore, better management of common-pool resources would strengthen the livelihood base of traditional herder communities and limit migration among middle-income households. Overall, in dry areas such as Gujarat, access to irrigation, rather than land ownership per se, is likely to deter migration.","Gujarat Inst Dev Res, Ahmadabad 380060, Gujarat, India",,"Shah, A (通讯作者)，Gujarat Inst Dev Res, Ahmadabad 380060, Gujarat, India.",amitagidr@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,20,22,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The vulnerability of manufactured housing, combined with its growing share of the U.S. housing market, has led to proposed mandates for community shelters in mobile home parks. Expected utility theory, however, predicts that households should account for tornado risk in their housing choice. We test for an effect of tornado risk on manufactured housing demand using cross-sectional state data, as well as counties in three tornado prone states. We find that people do respond to tornado risk; our estimates indicate that each expected annual state tornado death per million residents reduces demand for manufactured homes by about 3%.

Of the contentions and potential solutions surrounding higher gasoline costs, one receiving relatively little attention has been the role of public transit. This research examines that question by analyzing the relationship between gasoline prices and transit ridership from January 2002 to April 2008 in nine major US cities. Regression analysis is used to assess the degree to which variability in rail and bus transit ridership is attributable to gasoline costs and fluctuations in gasoline cost, controlling for service changes. seasonality, and inherent trending. The results indicate that a small but statistically significant amount of ridership fluctuation is due to changes in gasoline prices. The results are discussed in light of the policy and practical implications of higher gasoline prices for mass transit and the potential for long term changes in US travel behavior.

We find that foreigners invest less in firms that reside in countries with poor outsider protection and disclosure and have ownership structures that are conducive to governance problems. This effect is particularly pronounced when earnings are opaque, indicating that information asymmetry and monitoring costs faced by foreign investors likely drive the results.

Housing-rich but income-poor elderly homeowners often complain about rising tax burdens, and anecdotal evidence suggests that some move to reduce their tax burden. There has been little systematic analysis, however, of the link between property tax levels and the mobility rate of elderly homeowners. This paper investigates this link using household-level panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and a newly collected data set on state-provided property tax relief programs. These relief programs generate variation in effective property tax burdens that is not due solely to arguably endogenous local community choices about taxes and expenditure programs. The findings provide evidence suggesting that higher property taxes raise mobility among elderly homeowners. The point estimates from instrumental variable estimation using relief programs to generate instruments suggest that a $100 increase in annual property taxes is associated with a 0.73 percentage point increase in the 2-year mobility rate for homeowners over the age of 50. This is an 8 percent increase from the baseline 2-_year mobility rate of 9 percent. These results are robust to alternative specifications.

Building on historical evidence that long predates the modern environmental movement, the contrary case is made that the interplay of voluntary exchange, private property rights, and self-interest has generally resulted in the so-called triple bottom line (economic, social, and environmental) through more efficient use of materials and the continual creation of higher quality resources. However, because market processes continually eliminate less competitive firms and tend to concentrate business activities geographically, political pressure brought to bear by adversely affected vested interests often results in the creation of policies that cause greater environmental harm than would otherwise be evident. Environmental CSR proponents often misinterpret these government failures as market failures, and characteristically advocate policies that further distract firms from their core objective and resulting triple bottom line. The article concludes by arguing that the most promising path toward truly sustainable development lies in the unwavering pursuit of profitability within the bounds of well-defined and enforced private property rights.","Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Desrochers, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",pierre.desrochers@utoronto.ca,"Desrochers, Pierre/G-9166-2017","Desrochers, Pierre/0000-0002-7200-3847",,,,,153,9,14,1,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The policy coherence debate is an old theme in the international economics literature, which is revisited here by looking at the relationships between aid and migration policies towards new Member States. Are they substitutes or complements? What happens if eastern European labour markets conditions improve? In theory, potential migrants. will stay home, and the concern of being invaded by skilled or unskilled workers searching for better conditions and higher wages in the old Member States can be alleviated. But in practice, at low levels of income in the origin countries, economic progress can result in lowering the budget constraint of moving, leading to more migration pressures. We therefore compute the critical level of GDP, above which an increase in transfers and improvement in the economic situation will not lead to an increase in migration. It amounts to USD 2,837 for migration within Europe. We argue that this critical level is not the same for a skilled and unskilled individual. The critical income level, under which a skilled individual with better opportunities abroad decides to migrate, will be higher than for an unskilled worker, who may be better off by staying and looking for a job at home: USD 15,085 for the former, and USD 4,384 for the latter. This has important implications, namely that in some cases, more financial transfers will result in increasing the gap between skilled and unskilled departures from countries already suffering from a brain drain.","[Berthelemy, Jean-Claude] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Maurel, Mathilde] Ctr Nat Rech Scientifique, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,,berthele@univ-paris1.fr,"Maurel, Mathilde/AAN-2096-2021","Maurel, Mathilde/0000-0003-4543-4286",,,,,26,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-642-12515-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,95,+,,10.1007/978-3-642-12516-4_6,0.0,,,3,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BUC56,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288879000006,0

We propose a procedural guidance on how to address problems regarding operational risk internal auditing by stressing particularities of banking organization working on Rumanian territory.","[Danescu, Tatiana; Muntean, Anca] Petru Maior Univ, Fac Econ Jurid & Adm Sci, Targu Mures 540088, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures",,tatiana_danescu@yahoo.com; oltean_anca2005@yahoo.com,"Danescu, Tatiana/I-5356-2014; Muntean, Adrian/F-4802-2012","Muntean, Adrian/0000-0002-1160-0007",,,,,11,0,0,0,5,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",2223-5779,,978-960-474-184-7,WOR MULTIC APP ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,92,97,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300068000021,0

The key concept of this model, famously known as the Solow-Swan model, is the neoclassical form of production function with declining returns to capital combined with a fixed saving rate. On the basis of these assumptions, an economy, regardless of its starting point, converges to a balanced growth path, where long-run growth of output and capital are determined solely by the rate of labor-augmenting technological progress and the rate of population growth (see, for example, Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1995). Ferrara and Guerrini (2008) have analyzed the role of a variable population growth rate within the Solow-Swan model by assuming a logistic-type population growth law. Within this set up, the model is proved to have a unique equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable. As well, its solution is shown to have a closed-form expression via Hypergeometric functions. As is typical in the neoclassical model, the human population size is assumed to be equal to the labor force. An assumption of that model, however, is that the growth rate of population is constant, yielding an exponential behavior of population size over time. Clearly, this type of time behavior is unrealistic and, more importantly, unsustainable in the very longrun. A more realistic approach would be to consider a logistic law for the population growth rate. Brock and Taylor (2004) have demonstrated that the Solow-Swan model and the environmental Kuznets curve (hereafter EKC) are intimately related (for the EKC, see, for example, Grossman and Krueger, 1995). Amending the Solow-Swan model to incorporate technological progress in abatement, the EKC is a necessary by-product of convergence to a sustainable growth path. The resulting model, which they called the Green-Solow model, generates an EKC relationship between the flow of pollution emissions and income per capita, and the stock of environmental quality and income per capita. The main objective of this paper is to combine within the same framework these two different research lines that have been analyzed separately in the recent past. The two research lines we aim at joining together are, respectively, the one studying the effects of including emissions, abatement and a stock of pollution in the Solow-Swan model (Brock and Taylor, 2004), and that analyzing the role of a variable population growth rate within the Solow-Swan model (Ferrara and Guerrini, 2008). Within this framework, the economy is described by a three dimensional dynamical system, whose solution can be explicitly determined, and proved to be convergent in the long-run. Finally, we prove that sustainable growth occurs if technological progress in abatement is faster than technological progress in production. An EKC may result along the transition to the balanced growth path.","[Ferrara, Massimiliano] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dept SSGES, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,,massimiliano.ferrara@unirc.it,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING ACAD AND SOC,ATHENS,"AG LOANNOU THEOLOGOU 17-23, 15773 ZOGRAPHOU, ATHENS, GREECE",2223-5779,,978-960-474-184-7,WOR MULTIC APP ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,15,16,,,,,,2,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT01,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300068000003,0

In the second step, we adopt a stress testing approach to calculate the potential impact on banks' position of any adverse changes in these determinants. These calculations suggest that a 1.3 percentage point increase in mortgage interest rate leads to a 20% decrease in a typical bank's distance to default. Finally, we look at the cross-sectional differences to identify the most vulnerable banks.

According to the above study, recommendations are derived that some appropriate policies could be conduced to fully take advantage of FDI and human capital flow's effect on regional technology progress, such as improving the quality of labors, reducing the cost of labor flowing and improving the approach of FDI introduction, etc.","[Zhang Hongxia; Yuan Lin] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Jinan 255049, Peoples R China",Shandong University,,Zghx002@sina.com,"li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023",,,,,,9,1,1,0,4,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54471-7,,,,2010,,,,,,,131,135,,,,,,5,Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BDJ45,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313542100024,0

Four potential explanations for this decline are discussed: interdisciplinary spillover of research is slower than within a discipline; the increasing use of mathematics in economics made economics less useful for business scholars; economics articles are by their nature more long-lived than business articles; business has grown recently more quickly than economics. The data support the second and fourth explanations.

Blockholders have strong incentives to monitor the firm's fundamental value because they can sell their stakes upon negative information. By trading on private information (following the Wall Street Rule), they cause prices to reflect fundamental value rather than current earnings. This in turn encourages managers to invest for long-run growth rather than short-term profits. Contrary to the view that the U.S.'s liquid markets and transient shareholders exacerbate myopia, I show that they can encourage investment by impounding its effects into prices.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Edmans, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Edmans, Alex/F-9562-2011","Edmans, Alex/0000-0002-9781-892X",,,,,81,517,620,17,197,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

First, the situation where nature's assimilative capacity is completely destroyed involves normative problems that require further research. Second, environmental restoration with initial pollution above the steady-state stock requires an economy to initially allocate a relatively high share of its resources to cleaning-Up activities. In return, this generally results in an intertemporally efficient development path that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. Third, optimal trajectories in situations with initial stocks of pollution below the long-term optimum generally imply an increase in pollution and a decline of optimal consumption. In this case, the investment of the environmental rents accruing from nature's assimilative capacity into man-made capital is required in analogy to the famous Hartwick rule to maintain a constant flow of instantaneous welfare. This would facilitate growth in consumption sufficient to compensate for the rising disutility of pollution.","Bern Univ Appl Sci, Swiss Coll Agr, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland",,"Hediger, W (通讯作者)，Bern Univ Appl Sci, Swiss Coll Agr, Laenggasse 85, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland.",werner.hediger@bfh.ch,,,,,,,36,8,10,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This paper examines the effects of foreign assistance in countries with plentiful investment opportunities when interest groups compete for unproductive government transfers. We assess conditional and unconditional assistance (project and program aid, loans, and grants). We find that project conditionality alone may fail to spur growth. Official development loans channeled to investment may not increase the recipient's growth and welfare even if interest groups are unable to appropriate aid funds directly. Conditions must tackle the domestic drivers of inefficient fiscal policies. To improve the composition of government expenditure, increase growth, and improve welfare, tax rates must be kept constant and loan repayment be financed by cuts in unproductive transfers. Official development grants are superior to loans of the same net present value if donors cannot enforce conditions on assistance.

Using measures of uncertainty constructed from the state probabilities estimated from two-state regime-switching models of aggregate market return and of aggregate output, I find a negative relationship between the level of uncertainty and asset valuations. This relationship shows substantial cross-sectional variation across portfolios sorted on size, book-to-market, and past returns, especially conditional on the state of the economy. I show that a conditional model with investors' beliefs and an uncertainty risk factor is remarkably successful in explaining a large part of the cross-sectional variation in average portfolio returns. The uncertainty risk factor retains its incremental explanatory power when compared to other conditional models such as the conditional CAPM.

We also want to understand if the rise of supermarkets has changed supply chains. Our analysis uses spatially sampled data from 200 communities and 500 households in the Greater Beijing area. In contrast to fears of some researchers, we find small and poor farmers actively participate in the emergence of China's horticulture economy. Moreover, there has been almost no penetration of modern wholesalers or retailers into rural communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

If money is the only asset, then inflation mostly hurts the wealthier and more productive agents, while those poorer and less productive may even benefit from inflation. The converse holds in a more sophisticated financial environment where agents can insure against consumption risk with assets other than money. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
