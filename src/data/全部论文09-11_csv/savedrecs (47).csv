The results indicate that the number of firms exposed to exchange rate fluctuations is higher in periods of crisis and under a fixed exchange rate regime. In addition, the results point out that, although companies' international activities, operational hedging, and financial policies are important determinants of firms' exposure, the changes in companies' exposure that took place when Brazil moved from a fixed to a floating exchange rate regime were mainly driven by changes in companies' foreign currency borrowing and the use of derivatives that occurred in that period.","Insper Inst Educ & Res, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Insper,"Rossi, JL (通讯作者)，Insper Inst Educ & Res, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",joselrj1@insper.edu.br,,,,,,,39,11,12,1,28,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Project financing implies a complex decision-making process that is based on an agent's choice of financial sources. Selecting between various financing options is guided by risk and reward. These two criteria make up the value of each project financing option. The differences of value between options offering various utilities to the subject are the ones that set in motion the entire decision-making mechanism. The one that offers the highest utility is preferred to homo oeconomicus. This is characterized by rational behavior, directed towards maximizing its utility and lays the foundation of the classical economic theory. Modern economic theories such as game theory or behavioral finance reveal different facets of human decision behavior. Agent-based modeling uses the synergy between the classical and modern theories to simulate decision-making process.","[Scarlat, Emil] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Bolos, Marcel] Oradea Univ, Oradea, Sweden; [Popovici, Ioana Florina] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Scarlat, E (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",emil_scarlat@csie.ase.ro; marcel_bolos@yahoo.com; popovici.florina@yahoo.com,"Coita, Ioana Florina Popovici -/A-4088-2012","Coita, Ioana Florina Popovici -/0000-0002-0782-2790",,,,,13,3,3,1,21,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

A bioeconomic model of an offshore capture-based bluefin tuna aquaculture facility is used to evaluate the economic feasibility of this form of production on the US East Coast under a variety of economic, biological, and regulatory assumptions. The results suggest that of the three proposed farming sites along the US East Coast, the expected net present value (NPV) of the operation over a 10-year operating horizon is highest at the Gray's Reef GA, site. The second part of this article assesses the extent to which the opportunity to engage in capture-based bluefin tuna aquaculture production could improve the net economic value generated in the US East Coast bluefin tuna fishery The results suggest that if the fishery had the opportunity to engage in capture-based bluefin tuna aquaculture production, there would be an increase in the net revenue generated in the fishery Depending on how the seasonal quota was enforced, economic improvement in the fishery ranged from a 52-142% improvement in net revenue. Even when the cost per fish associated with capture-based bluefin tuna aquaculture production was doubled, the results still indicated that the opportunity to engage in capture-based bluefin tuna aquaculture production would lead to a 12% increase in net revenue in the fishery.","Goucher Coll, Baltimore, MD 21204 USA",,"Shamshak, GL (通讯作者)，Goucher Coll, 1021 Dulaney Valley Rd, Baltimore, MD 21204 USA.",gina.shamshak@goucher.edu,,"Shamshak, Gina/0000-0001-7318-7126",NOAA [DGG133F06SE4106]; Norwegian Research Council; Goucher College,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Goucher College,"This research was supported in part by NOAA Grant DGG133F06SE4106, the Norwegian Research Council, and the Goucher College Summer Research Grant Program (2010).",,35,15,15,0,22,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Our goal is to illustrate the extent of both interest rate subsidies and repayment burdens with respect to Thailand's Student Loans Fund (SLF), using methods pioneered in measurement terms by Ziderman (1999, 2003). Our critical innovation is to calculate repayment burdens for graduates with widely differing earnings, and we find that these generally are relatively low because the SLF is heavily subsidized. Even so, for graduates with very low income the burdens can be high. Importantly we analyze and illustrate what the repayment streams would be if the SLF was redesigned to have no interest rate subsidies and find that the burdens increase to extremely high levels for the lowest income graduates.

The model approach with its roots in American military scenarios of the 1950s, the design approach in French urban and regional development of the 1960s, and the strategic conversation approach in scenarios made in the private sector since the 1970s. In theory, these traditions can be integrated by organising the scenario project in a cyclical way. The territorial scenarios for Europe were made by combining workshops, a literature review and modelling. Thematic scenarios were produced for various themes, like demography, the economy, energy, and climate change. These thematic scenarios were combined into four integrated scenarios. The robustness of the scenarios was tested by introducing several wild cards and by exploring their territorial impacts throughout Europe.

To characterize these changes, the individuals and organizations who purchased forest land from Minnesota's county land departments were surveyed using a mail questionnaire. The sale of county forest land did not appear to produce noticeable changes in timber harvesting or the level of investment in forest management. However, the level of professional forestry expertise overseeing the management of these lands declined considerably. Additionally, while nearly all forest land managed by county land departments is open to the public for recreation, more than half became posted to prohibit public trespass after it was sold. From 2002-2005, county land departments generated approximately US$12.3 million in real annual net income, or US$4.53 per acre. When comparing the capitalized value of annual net revenue generated from the land to its market value, retaining county forest land in public ownership cannot be rationalized solely on its ability to generate. income. Yet public ownership of these lands can be justified when the full suite of benefits derived from the forest land's public recreational, environmental, and amenity values is considered.

This study set out to determine the objectives of private forest owners for their forests and to establish whether they planned to thin their stands. It also looked at the factors influencing a private forest owner's decision to harvest and the role that extension plays in this process. A survey of 120 private forest owners who had afforested land since 1980 was conducted in 2007. The study found that while most forest owners hoped to produce timber from their woods many of them either planned to use the timber themselves or were unsure as to whether they would put it on the market.

Robustly significant determinants of the premium include the lagged premium, the official real exchange rate, the implied returns from arbitrage, and the oil price. Our preferred model exhibits outstanding out-of-sample forecasting performance, with an average prediction error of 0.9 percent, and an error standard deviation of 7.8 percent, during the ten-month period until July 2009. We provide evidence that the exogenous change of the black market swap vehicle to government bonds in 2007 induced a significant shift in the relative importance of the determinants of the premium, causing shocks to become significantly more persistent, the coefficient on the implied returns from arbitrage to double, and rendering the beneficial effect of oil price increases insignificant.","[Malone, Samuel W.] Univ Andes Colombia, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia; [ter Horst, Enrique] Euromed Management, Marseille, France; [ter Horst, Enrique] Inst Estudios Super Adm, Caracas, Venezuela",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Institute of Advanced Studies in Administration (IESA),"Malone, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Andes Colombia, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia.",samuel.malone@gmail.com; enriqueterhorst@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,3,4,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This paper presents new evidence about the local effects of strictly protected areas in Thailand, combining data on socioeconomic outcomes from a poverty mapping study with satellite-based estimates of forest cover. The selective placement of protected areas is addressed by controlling for characteristics which drove both protection and development and by instrumenting for protection with priority watershed status. The estimates indicate that protected areas increased average consumption and lowered poverty rates, despite imposing binding constraints on agricultural land availability. Socioeconomic gains are likely explained by increased tourism in and around protected areas. However, net impacts are largest at intermediate distances from major cities, highlighting that the spatial patterns of both costs and benefits are important for efforts to minimize conservation-development tradeoffs.

However, in many developing countries like Benin, former management strategies kept human from protected areas using coercion. Fortunately, more recent regimes attempt to give local populations more control on the management but little is known about local residents' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward the management of these areas. This study, carried out around the Pendjari National Park, determined factors which support local communities' positive perceptions towards biodiversity conservation in the park, analysed their assessment of current park management activities compared to former management approaches and draw the implications for effective participatory management of protected areas. We collected socio-demographic data from 164 residents on their awareness of conservation methods. We used Stepwise Discriminant Analysis to differentiate the variables that had the greatest power for discriminating between local residents' perception to conserve or not biodiversity and to manage the park. The findings indicated that the positive behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within Pendjari National Park was highly correlated with the current management strategy that involved more effectively local communities, the educational level of participants and their geographical origins. Participants' perceptions of biodiversity conservation were strongly related to locally perceived benefits. Although 89% of participants were favorable to the concept of biodiversity conservation within the park, the decision to ban encroachments due to agricultural activities increased negative opinion on this park management option. Our results suggested that understanding local residents' perceptions and using them as a starting point to improve the park-people relationship could help park management staff to involve more effectively local communities and improve their awareness about biodiversity conservation within the park.

In this context, it is timely to revisit the Marxian concept that profits derive from the dual role of labour, as both a commodity and a non-commodity. Surplus is created by the difference between the commodity dimension of labour, the value of labour power, and its non-commodity dimension the value added by labour, over and above the value of inputs, or the cost of reproducing the workforce. Since the 1980s and 1990s, however, labour has become a commodity in a new sense. Risks to working class self-reproduction in the form of wage decline and withdrawal of state welfare, have pushed workers into becoming entrepreneurs of their own lives, calculating the risks of debt servicing and involuntarily buying services from privatised and financialised utilities and health care providers. In this sense, newly commodified labour is required to treat itself as a commercial entity, and it is thereby a player in the market for risk. The reproduction of labour power has itself become a source of surplus value, in the form of interest payments. But, as indicated by the US sub-prime housing market and its fall-out, capital now shares in the risk, through a fall in the value of labour power (lower consumption), and through incalculable financial instability.","Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Bryan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",dick.bryan@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,16,10,11,1,18,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Vietnam. The hypotheses of the study are derived from new home economics theory. The reactions of households in the study areas to two types of shocks, namely covariate weather-related and idiosyncratic health shocks are analyzed. Using a probit model, results show that households affected by idiosyncratic health shocks, experienced by economically active household members, and severe weather shocks were more likely to extract forest products.

But evidence suggests that even the small- and mid-sized have achieved some gains and reduced losses in bargaining with the strong. They have managed in some cases by using astute combinations of negotiation moves at the table and away from the table. Being small even has a few advantages, paradoxically. To help improve practice beyond the current World Trade Organization (WTO) stalemate and recession, negotiation researchers need to devote more attention to the experience of small- and mid-sized states. Those states need to invest more in training not only in economics and law but also in negotiation analysis and strategy.","Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Odell, JS (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",odell@usc.edu,,,,,,,42,11,14,1,13,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

On average, a 1% increase in the number of full-time faculty is associated with about 0.2% increase in total R&D expenditure. Further, a one percentage point increase in the share of full-time faculty members that are not on tenure-track lines is associated with a decrease in total external R&D expenditure by about 0.6%, suggesting that full-time faculty that are tenured or on tenure-tracks are the main category of faculty that generate external R&D funding. Further, our results suggest that an increasing usage of part-time faculty, holding constant the institution's full-time faculty size, boosts an institution's external R&D expenditures. On average, a one percentage point increase in the share of part-time faculty members is associated with a 0.44% increase in the total external R&D expenditures. Increases in graduate student enrollments are associated with increases in external R&D expenditures. Finally, an institution's external R&D expenditures are significantly influenced by both the amount of its own institutionally financed research expenditures and the level of federal funding for research.

The paper investigates the preconditions for change by scrutinizing prevailing interest group theories by random surveys of private forest owners and in-depth interviews of forest policy decision-makers. As a result of the empirical research it has been found that, in spite of the large number of private forest owners, there are good chances for the formation of private forest owners' interest associations in all four countries, mainly because of the high critical mass of engaged private forest owners and the support of the majority of forest policy decision-makers.

In particular, Szymanski and Kesenne (2004) argue that formulating the decision-making problem in a noncooperative game leads to radically different conclusions about the nature of competition in sports leagues. The author describes a simulation model that can be used in a classroom to demonstrate how competition works in a noncooperative context. More generally, in simulation exercises, students typically gravitate quickly toward the Nash equilibrium, making this a simple and powerful way to introduce them to the concept.

There is a decline in the percentage of net dividend payers, accompanied by a decline in the aggregate level of net real dividends paid. Contrary to the situation in developed markets, earnings and dividends concentration have declined over the sample period. The first mandatory dividend payment regulation pushed some firms to collect the distributed dividends back through rights issues and this resulted in low net dividend payments. One of the striking findings of this paper reveals that a majority of ISE firms prefer dividend omissions rather than dividend reductions. Once a firm keeps paying dividends, it puts much effort into increasing dividend payments rather than reducing them. Further, dividend payment and reduction decisions are affected by the current earnings of the firm and financial crisis significantly explains both the dividend payment and dividend reduction decisions.","[Kirkulak, Berna; Kurt, Guluzar] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Kirkulak, B (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Business, Dept Business Adm, Izmir, Turkey.",berna.kirkulak@deu.edu.tr; guluzar.kurt@deu.edu.tr,"GÜMÜŞ, Gülüzar KURT/AAA-2645-2020; KIRKULAK-ULUDAG, Berna/S-5749-2019","KIRKULAK-ULUDAG, Berna/0000-0001-9622-0363; KURT GUMUS, GULUZAR/0000-0002-9016-285X",,,,,31,19,21,0,16,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In this study, an ecological footprint model is used to measure the forest impact embodied by Chinese log imports from 1995 to 2007. Special attention is given to the ratio of the forest ecological footprint for Chinese log import to the biocapacity of the import origins. Chinese log demand continues to rely more on domestic supplies. Despite that the log import has increased the forest ecological footprint from Europe, those from Oceania and Asia, and Africa were less affected.

Bottom trawling is known to cause particularly destructive damage to habitat that is effectively non-renewable, such as cold water corals. This paper applies the production function approach to estimate the link between cold water corals and redfish in Norway. Both the carrying capacity and growth rate of redfish are found to be functions of cold water coral habitat and thus cold water corals can be considered an essential fish habitat. The paper also estimates a facultative relationship between cold water coral and redfish stocks. The essential habitat model shows the best fit to the data. Comparative statics of an essential habitat indicate an approximate annual loss in harvest of between 11 and 29% within the bounds of coral decline estimated by scientists. In terms of policy, our results indicate that essential fish habitat protection should be considered when managing commercially important species.","[Foley, Naomi S.; Armstrong, Claire W.] Univ Tromso, Dept Econ & Management, N-9001 Tromso, Norway; [Kahui, Viktoria] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Christchurch, New Zealand; [van Rensburg, Tom M.] NUI Galway, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Otago; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Foley, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Dept Econ & Management, N-9001 Tromso, Norway.",naomifoley@gmail.com; vkahui@business.otago.ac.nz; claire.armstrong@nfh.uit.no; thomas.vanrensburg@nuigalway.ie,,"Armstrong, Claire/0000-0002-1837-9165",,,,,42,23,24,0,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Several problems associated with the management of these plantations were identified first. Current management plans for plantations of this species consist of the systematic and somewhat arbitrary application of the area control method. Thus. these plans do not take into consideration the optimum length for one full plantation cycle that maximizes the land expectation value, neither do they formulate the area control method through any mathematical programming model for scheduling regeneration harvests. In this paper, we present a modelling approach based on linear and goal programming. The models consider area and volume control regulation strategies, and take into account variations in land productivity among site classes and successive rotation intervals. To illustrate this approach, we applied the models to a neighbourhood community-owned forest currently managed by the Regional Forest Service with a recent management plan. The results showed that the models provided more flexible harvest schedules, and the profitability of eucalypt stands was 64% higher than that under the current management plan. Finally, extensions to this study were identified. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Renewal of wage-setting institutions provides a necessary but insufficient foundation for the elimination of low-wage work.

We extend the models of generic prescription by Hellerstein (Rand J Econ 29(1):108-136, 1998) and Lundin (J Health Econ 19:639-662, 2000) to allow for substitution between analogues and use difference-in-difference models to assess the effect on two drug groups (lipid-lowering and rheumatism drugs). For both drug groups we find evidence of a significant effect of the intervention. In the case of lipid-lowering drugs, we found a significant larger impact on GPs with low loyalty to the insurer and with indication of low prescription quality. In contrast we found that the intervention had a significantly lower impact on this group of GPs in the case of rheumatism drugs. We conclude that the effectiveness of the voluntary approach may partly be due to its indirect effect on GPs' altruistic motivation, which makes the GPs and the authorities collude in a common agency role.","[Olsen, Kim Rose; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte; Boegh, Andreas; Hansen, Sofie Hartung] DSI, Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Olsen, KR (通讯作者)，DSI, Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, Dampfaergevej 27-29, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kro@dsi.dk,"Olsen, Kim Rose/ABA-9678-2021; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Olsen, Kim Rose/AAU-5526-2020","Olsen, Kim Rose/0000-0002-0473-4736; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,17,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Because of the presence of punishment effects and stronger own and cross-tariff effects, we find that discrimination yields higher standards than MFN (and free trade) independently of the extent of pollution spillovers. When pollution is local and incentives to free ride on other countries' abatement efforts are weak, we show, however, that welfare is larger under MFN than under discrimination. In a dynamic setting, we consider the impact of symmetric and asymmetric treatments on the sustainability of an international environmental agreement (IEA) and obtain that multilateral cooperation is easier to sustain under discrimination than under MFN (or free trade).

In this context, bill co-sponsorship acts as a signal to interest groups that a legislator is working to promote their interests and thereby maximize the payoffs received from such groups. In this paper we seek to identify factors associated with bill co-sponsorship, to determine whether interest group politics significantly explain bill co-sponsorship behavior in the U.S. Senate. Specifically, we examine Senate Bill 402, a bill seeking to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for qualified timber gains. Senate co-sponsorship decisions concerning S.B. 402 are assessed using a model that identifies various political and industry (forestry) interests/characteristics. We demonstrate that a Senator's co-sponsorship of this bill is correlated with his/her seniority, tax-cutting ideology, strength of electoral victory in his/her most recent election, campaign contributions received from forestry interests, the relative contribution of forestry to Gross State Product, and the percent of total land in his/her state that is privately owned.

We interviewed senior local NHS managers about their experience and expectations of the impact of PbR. A high degree of 'NHS solidarity' was apparent, and competition between NHS hospitals was muted.

This paper examines the factors underlying this apparently myopic behaviour. We find that standard economic factors explain observed borrowing decisions to some extent. Students with easier access to financial resources borrow less often. Students with good earnings prospects and/or a high discount rate borrow more often, as do students who are prepared to take risks. An important non-standard factor affecting borrowing choices is debt aversion. We also find that a reduction in working hours will only have a limited positive impact on the time spend on studying.

The 1591 responses were stratified by income with analyses conducted using SPSS. The number of differences in garden-related participation and purchases decreased as income level increased across age groups. Where differences were observed, generally younger consumers purchased garden-related products and participated in gardening-related activities to a lesser extent than older consumers. At every income level, older consumers had a higher mean satisfaction and factor scores, and higher regret mean and factor scores. This indicated that older consumers experienced greater satisfaction and less regret than younger persons, regardless of income. For marketers, this shows a heterogeneous market at lower-income levels and a more homogeneous market at upper-income levels. Age could be used as a basis for market segmentation, especially at lower income levels. Results further suggest longitudinal research could show if this is a static or dynamic trend.","[Behe, B.

Web-based sensor nodes such as field servers allow the monitoring of various types of sensor data, including image data, via the internet. The agent program performs complicated operations on the sensor nodes from a remote site via the internet; it can also analyze monitoring data easily using web applications. To evaluate the effectiveness of the image monitoring system, we executed a long-term field experiment at a grape farm in Obuse-town, Nagano, Japan. Four types of sensor data concerning environmental condition and two types of image data concerning plant detail and field overview were collected and stored at a remote site via the internet. The image data were analyzed using a filtering approach operated by the agent program and web applications, which were used for calculations in a background subtraction model. The proposed system has worked stably since May 2006 and provided results in which approximately 84% of unnecessary image data were filtered.

Results suggest that the current fleet of 117 vessels will be reduced by roughly 50%-66% to 40-60 vessels, resulting in annual cost savings of $18-$22 million (based on 2004 price and cost estimates). However, cost savings could he significantly less if restrictions on quota trading across vessels are incorporated into the program design. Alternative modes of collecting fees to fund program administration and their impact on fleet size and total fishery value arc also studied.

Under the Community Development Blocks program, the intention was to improve nutrition rather than to seek profit however farmers adopted the innovation as a means for maintaining their livelihood. With a depleting land base due to population pressure, assured irrigation and improved inputs, both public and private extension mechanisms were instrumental in this silent revolution, often termed the Golden Revolution. The impact has been phenomenal in terms of the area cultivated under vegetables and the encroachment of vegetable crops into non-traditional areas; the introduction of new crops; extending the seasonality of supply through staggered plantings and placing vegetables into non-traditional cropping sequences; increased productivity through intercropping, mixed cropping, relay cropping, multilayered cropping and alley cropping. Although production faces occasional gluts, the industry has generated employment in cultivation, marketing and food processing.

Thus a number of complex activities are carried out to provide children with places in pre-school educational establishments: starting from the definition of children's age proper for pre-school, defining the number of children per territory when a PEE is needed, and providing places in pre-school educational establishments. The tasks should be accomplished hand in hand with local municipalities.

Our evidence indicates that derivatives held for hedging purposes can yield cash flows of the same order of magnitude of capital expenditures, operational earnings, and financial expense, unlike what was previously found by Guay and Kothari (2003) for U.S. firms. We study not only the decision to use derivatives, but also the magnitude of derivatives holdings and the importance of operational hedging in firms' risk management strategies. We find that economies of scale, financial distress costs, informational asymmetry, and growth opportunities are important for risk management decisions, and that firms do not hedge because of potential tax benefits.","[Schiozer, Rafael F.] FGV EAESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Schiozer, RF (通讯作者)，FGV EAESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",rafael.schiozer@fgv.br; richard.saito@fgv.br,"Schiozer, Rafael F/B-8930-2013","Schiozer, Rafael/0000-0003-3890-6345",,,,,36,18,22,2,25,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The aim is to maximize utility from the harvest, net of effort cost. Yield depends on effort, catchability, and population age structure. The recruitment function is nonlinear The age-structured model can be viewed as a generalization of the biomass approach. Comparison with the biomass model shows that the age-structured information influences the optimal steady-state population and harvest and the qualitative features of optimal transition. Pulse fishing or interior limit cycles are possible, but the optimal solution may represent a smooth, sustainable harvest even when the model is linear in effort. Linearity assumptions do not guarantee the optimality of constant escapement. If the age distribution is dominated by young age classes, the optimal yield may be lower with higher biomass. With knife-edge selectivity, the optimal steady state may become independent of the interest rate.","[Tahvonen, Olli] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Fishery & Environm Management Grp, FEM, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Tahvonen, Olli] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Helsinki 00170, Finland",University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Tahvonen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Fishery & Environm Management Grp, FEM, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",olli.tahvonen@metla.fi,,,,,,,41,39,41,0,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

This study uses data from New York City to assess the relative effectiveness and retention of career-switchers. It provides some evidence that these teachers are no more effective than other new teachers, and, in fact, they appear to be less effective at raising math scores of elementary and middle school students.

In the absence of data measuring the number of years of schooling required to perform particular jobs, we propose a new approach to testing for overeducation. Overeducation is confirmed if we observe that education levels rose in jobs that offer very low returns to education and that underwent little technological change. Using labor force surveys from four developing countries, we find evidence of overeducation in unskilled jobs in the Philippines, mild evidence in Mexico, and little evidence in India and Thailand. We show that a job's mean and modal years of schooling are poor proxies for required education. We also show that overeducation sometimes increases within unskilled jobs, even while a growing share of educated workers enter skilled jobs. This may be because the quality of education segments the labor market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that only a few of these predictors have statistically significant relationships with student and teacher outcomes. However, the individual variables load onto two factors, which measure what one might describe as teachers' cognitive and noncognitive skills.

Justice (alternatively, equity or fairness) is taken as requiring a full consideration of the criteria of needs, equality, liberty and just deserts, as well as matters of efficiency. Inequity occurs when the interests of weaker stakeholders are given inadequate consideration. Applying these criteria suggests that the Australian retirement system intrudes on the liberty of some groups of stakeholders inconsistently and inappropriately in mandating contributions at younger ages particularly, and by the imposition of unnecessarily bureaucratic means tests. It also fails to provide for the incapacitated older aged.","[Asher, Anthony] Univ New S Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Asher, Anthony] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Asher, A (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.asher@unsw.edu.au,,"Asher, Anthony/0000-0002-7102-3627",,,,,43,1,1,0,6,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

During the 24-year period from 1976 to 2000 agricultural land use increased by 35% at a cost of loss of forestland. Agricultural expansion was most conspicuous at higher elevations (1150-2000-m). About 36%, 18% and 6% of forestland was converted into agricultural activities from higher, middle and lower elevations respectively in the period from 1990 to 2000. Spatial distribution of living standard parameters, including farm family income and, food availability obtained from family surveys, shows a decreasing trend as the elevation increases whereas percentage of food bought shows an increasing trend. In this way it was found that, lost forest areas were smaller when located around high-income areas with good quality agricultural land and near an administrative centre as compared to areas located around low-income areas with low quality agricultural land and far from an administrative centre. Additionally, a regression model is constructed, to link the socioeconomic variables with the conversion of forestland into agricultural activities, breaking the study area into smaller zones. The spatial trajectories of these zones are then contrasted, paying particular attention to the socioeconomic conditions and institutional arrangements governing access to land resources. The study finds that while overall land change patterns in the region are largely explained by elevation and the socioeconomic conditions of people living adjacent to the forestland, more specifically, in sub-regional areas, trajectories reflect the signatures of institutions governing access to land. As sustainability of the watershed is dependent on forests, continued depletion of forest resources will result in poor economic returns from agriculture for local people together with loss of ecosystem services.

Combining evidence from a number of data sets spanning the entire postwar era, we find that internal migration within the United States is procyclical. This result cannot be explained by cyclical variation in relative local economic conditions, suggesting that the net benefit of moving rises during booms. Migration is most procyclical for younger labor-force participants. Therefore, cyclical fluctuations in the net benefit of moving appear to be related to conditions in the labor market and the spatial reallocation of labor.","[Saks, Raven E.] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC USA; [Wozniak, Abigail] Univ Notre Dame, Natl Bur Econ Res, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Saks, RE (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC USA.",,,"Molloy, Raven/0000-0002-5041-803X",,,,,55,79,110,3,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Resource allocation, teacher compensation and finance lawsuits",ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Educational finance; Teacher salaries; Resource allocation,CLASS SIZE-REDUCTION; ACHIEVEMENT; REFORM; SCHOOLS,"Despite a large literature examining the effect of litigation on education finance and student achievement, there is relatively little recent evidence about how extra resources generated by litigation are spent. This paper uses national data to examine the effects of high court finance rulings from 1991 to 2002 on school districts' education spending: including the categories of capital, plant, and support expenses as well as the teacher wage bill. It also decomposes the latter change into a quantity effect from teacher hiring and a price effect due to increased wages. I find that the largest spending increase comes from salary increases to teachers, with other large increases for hiring more instructors and increasing support spending. Further evidence suggests that the higher salaries are manifest more in an increased experience premium rather than higher salaries for new teacher hires. This evidence helps rationalize the role teachers unions play in supporting, and sometimes originating finance lawsuits. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This system places pressure on school administrators to redirect educational resources from groups of students likely to demonstrate proficiency towards those who are marginally below proficient. Using statewide observations of 3rd and 4th grade math tests, this paper demonstrates that students of successful racial groups at schools likely to be sanctioned gain less academically over their subsequent test year than comparable peers at passing schools. This effect is stronger at schools more likely to suffer from NCLB sanctions and is robust to corrections for non-random sample selection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The article illustrates that MAS can create binding obligations and that MAS are WTO law, given the explicit reference to them in the DSU, their intimate relation with the WTO-covered agreements and the requirement for compliance with these agreements. In addition, the article offers an interpretation of the DSU that allows panels and the Appellate Body to regard MAS as applicable law.

Today, the financial imbalance in many school districts is so large that there may be few alternatives to teacher layoffs. In nearly all school districts, layoffs are currently determined by some version of teacher seniority. Yet, alternative approaches to personnel reductions may substantially reduce the harm to students from staff reductions relative to layoffs based on seniority. As a result, many school district leaders and other policy makers are raising important questions about whether other criteria, such as measures of teacher effectiveness, should inform layoffs. This policy brief, a quick look at some aspects of the debate, illustrates the differences in New York City public schools that would result if layoffs were determined by seniority in comparison to a measure of teacher effectiveness.","[Wyckoff, James] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Boyd, Donald] SUNY Albany, Rockefeller Coll, Ctr Policy Res, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Lankford, Hamilton] SUNY Albany, Sch Educ, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Loeb, Susanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Virginia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Stanford University,"Wyckoff, J (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",boydd@rockinst.org; hamp@albany.edu; sloeb@stanford.edu; wyckoff@virginia.edu,,"Wyckoff, James/0000-0002-5223-6221; Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",,,,,18,38,50,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

We first describe new developments in wildfire simulation technology that catalyzed the development of risk-based decision support systems for strategic wildfire management. These systems include new analytical methods to measure wildfire risk to human and ecological values and to inform fuel treatment investment strategies at national, regional, and local scales. Application of the risk management framework to support wildfire incidents has been dramatically advanced with the Wildland Fire Decision Support System and allowed policy modifications that encourage management of incidents for multiple objectives. The new wildfire risk management decision support systems we discuss provide Federal agencies in the US the ability to integrate risk-informed approaches to a wide range of wildfire management responsibilities and decisions. While much progress has been made, there remain several barriers that need to be addressed to fully integrate risk science into current wildfire management practices. We conclude by identifying five primary issues that if properly addressed could help public land management better realize the opportunities and potential payoffs from fully adopting a risk management paradigm.

When technological progress in an alternative energy source can occur through learning-by-doing, resource owners face competing incentives to extract rents from the resource and to prevent expansion of the new technology. We show that in such a context, it is not necessarily the case that scarcity-driven higher traditional energy prices over time will induce alternative energy supply as resources are exhausted. Rather, we show that as we increase the learning potential in the substitute technology, lower equilibrium energy prices prevail and there may be increased resource extraction and greenhouse gas emissions. We show that the effectiveness and the incidence of emissions reduction policies may be altered by increased potential for technological change. Our results suggest that treating finite resource rents as endogenous consequences of both technological progress and policy changes will be important for the accurate assessment of climate change policy.

According to this idea, (1) 'people who live in glass houses should not throw stones'; (2) with the proliferation of RTAs, WTO members are likely to place their interests before the interests of the multilateral system; and (3) there would be fewer WTO members demanding stricter disciplines for RTA regulation. However, our finding is that WTO members have at least continued to accord attention to the problems associated with RTA proliferation, and they continue to engage in active scrutiny of individual RTAs. We are not saying that WTO members do not act in their own interest or that they are motivated by altruism but simply that such self-interest has not prevented scrutiny of RTAs under the new transparency mechanism (TM). The proliferation of RTAs (and any felt need to protect one's 'own RTA programme') has not prevented discussion on improved (disciplines. Notwithstanding the intent underlying the establishment of the TM - that is, the prevention of another impasse caused by controversy over various 'systemic issues' connected with questions of RTA compliance - WTO members continue to discuss these issues in ways that demonstrate fidelity to important questions of principle and policy. One notable development, however, has been that East Asian members are no longer seen to be as prominent in expressing a strict approach towards RTA regulation as they were a decade ago.","[Crawford, Jo-Ann] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Lim, C.

We are especially interested in the similarities of and differences between the two cases and therefore compare the policy challenges and lessons to be drawn. While the two debates differ on important issues, they share a technocratic orientation to public policy, and susceptibility to similar pitfalls. In both debates alarming scenarios about future catastrophes play an important role. We suggest that climate change policy discourse needs to focus more closely on the social, economic, and political dimensions of climate change, as opposed to its excessive emphasis on emission reduction targets. We also argue that an excessive faith in the market mechanisms to supply global warming mitigation technologies is problematic. In this respect, we provide a reality check regarding the political implications of emission targets and timetables and suggest how policy issues can be moved forward. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of these shortcomings, its main varieties have consumer potential because they are smooth textured, sweet and aromatic. Capitalising on these positive attributes could provide a means to sustainable industry improvement. A joint Australia-Pakistan research project to address mango industry improvement began in 2006 and has received funding approval to continue until 2014. This paper presents the conceptual model on which the project is based, the main areas of activity that have been pursued over the last three harvest seasons, the results, both positive and negative, and modifications that may be needed in future. The model is based around the aim of delivering a better quality Pakistan mango to the consumer. To achieve this aim, the project adopts a three pillar strategy focused on: (1) improving fruit quality; (2) improving market knowledge; and (3) building better supply chains. Each of these three pillars is supported by capacity building activities. Execution of the model is based on the principle that there should be no barriers between postharvest science and technology, market research and development, supply chain management, and capacity building. Results to date include the uptake of fruit quality improvement practices by significant growers in the industry, a small but encouraging impact on market performance domestically and in export markets, five demonstration chains whose members have implemented the project's 'best practice' recommendations. Capacity building activities have provided hands-on training for scores of market agents, wholesalers, exporters and retailers, and many hundreds of farmers and contractors.","[Collins, R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Syst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Collins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Syst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,,,,,,,11,9,9,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-89-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,895.0,,,,,,91,97,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR09,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323845300011,0

We argue that trade volumes are unlikely to significantly rise as a result of this ruling as it does not affect China's right to keep out foreign films and publications if China finds them objectionable. However, foreign producers of audiovisuals can now gain potentially large economic rents, by being able to export and distribute their products into the Chinese market.

CSR impacts business economic performances and improves the relationship among stakeholders. The failure to integrate CSR into business strategies and practice leads to locking the value and the potential for achieving company's competitive advantages. As a result, the following insights highlight: lack of strategic focus on CSR, inadequacies in internal and external stakeholder engagement, and failure to align CSR strategy with business strategy. A basic assumption underlying this paper is that making business ethically and socially responsible is good for business and society. The purpose of this paper is to develop a practical framework that aligns CSR with business strategies and managerial practices. The primary objective of this paper is to determine how the CSR is integrated into business strategies and practice contributes to company's competitive advantage. To meet this objective, company should align business and corporate responsibility strategies with management practices. The aim of this research is to identify, prioritize, and address the social causes that make the highest impact on society and business's future. The major results of this paper are: (a) the change of the general attitude towards CSR, from a philanthropic to a strategic approach, (b) understanding CSR has improved, especially the impact of CSR on their business, community and workplace, (c) positively influence managers and decision and policy makers, (d) promotes a good practice of CSR. In conclusion, companies who can integrate CSR into business strategies and practices will achieve a competitive advantage. Addressing stakeholder interest through management practice, companies will benefit from an enhanced reputation. Their stakeholder management, corporate citizenship, corporate philanthropy, and the business model will lead to sustainable growth and better balance between the society and the business.","[Katavic, Ivica; Kovacevic, Andrea] VERN Univ Appl Sci, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,,ivica.katavic@vern.hr; deakov86@yahoo.com,"Katavic, Ivica/HGU-3249-2022",,,,,,45,1,6,2,28,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Linking farmers to markets via private sector mechanisms is one such method. In order to better understand how such linkages can impact on farmers and their livelihoods, focussing on the strategies that may be employed by marketers in their endeavour to become, and remain, viable business entities, would be useful. This paper reports on the results of an in-depth case study of a small domestic marketer in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, who specialised in the marketing of a high-value perishable crop and linked farmers to markets without any intervention or assistance. The marketer was the lead firm in this chain and his strategy was analysed from this perspective. He employed a very sophisticated marketing strategy based on market segmentation and risk mitigation, and margins along the chain were finely balanced. He operated in different market segments that required different product attributes, relating primarily to quality, quantity, timing and continuity of supply. His relationships with the buyers in the different segments were associated with slightly different levels of commitment. He had three sources of supply and his level of commitment to each of these supply sources also varied. This focus on the marketer as the lead firm and then analysing relationships with farmer suppliers from this perspective allowed some interesting insights to emerge that can add to the debate on linking farmers to markets through private sector mechanisms.","[Martin, S.] Lincoln Univ, Canterbury, New Zealand",,"Martin, S (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Canterbury, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-89-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,895.0,,,,,,167,175,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.895.21,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR09,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323845300021,0

And if yes, how? Applied consciousness research is currently one-sidedly understood as brain research, and it is carried out mainly by the Natural Sciences under the influence of the Economic-Technological Complex and its relatively narrow interests. With its paradigmatic materialism determining the cultural spread of its temporary findings, it is already modifying our imaginary about what a human being is, what its rational self-determination can be, and how a good society can work. What is at stake with the change related to the findings of the new consciousness technologies is not only the principal socio-philosophical status of the human self' or I, but also the related concepts of humanism, open societies, individualism and rationality. Thus, the new neurotechnologies and their neurophilosophies are currently in the process of profoundly influencing the very basics of our cultural self-understanding, grown over centuries.

It concludes by discussing the applicability of the skill ecosystem concept to a mature, low-skill industry such as meat processing and then draws some conclusions about the limitations of the skill ecosystem concept itself.","[Cooney, Richard; Jerrard, Marjorie; Donohue, Ross; Kimberley, Nell] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Cooney, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Management, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Richard.Cooney@monash.edu; Marjorie.Jerard@monash.edu; Ross.Donohue@monash.edu; Nell.Kimberley@monash.edu,,"Cooney, Richard/0000-0002-6913-5689",,,,,51,5,5,1,10,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We use birth certificate records from 1999 to 2004 to assess whether parents systematically time childbirth before these eligibility cutoff dates to capture the option value of sending their child to school at a relatively young age, thereby avoiding a year of child care costs. Testing for discontinuities in the distribution of births around cutoff dates, we find no evidence that the option value influences the timing of birth. Similarly, we find no systematic discontinuities in average mothers' characteristics or babies' health outcomes around cutoff dates. Timing in the neighborhood of eligibility cutoffs occurs only when the cutoffs coincide with weekends or holidays, which may have implications for recent research that assumes birth dates in the neighborhood of cutoffs are essentially randomly assigned.

This is opposed to a roll-backward scenario in which the situation at the end of the time period is defined and the scenario then explores the path to reach this situation.). In the trend scenario renewed efforts are made for the Lisbon strategy, demanding extra investments in R&D and education. Regional policy will also be continued with vigour. In the Competition Scenario bold decisions are made regarding Europe's continued prosperity. The Lisbon strategy takes precedence over institutional reform and other sectoral policies. In the Cohesion Scenario Europe is confronted with the challenge of fully integrating the various regions in Europe. The budgets for Regional Policy and Rural Development Policy are enhanced and targeted to the most needy regions. The scenarios are described as stories about the future, supported by model calculations and visualised by various maps. They concentrate on urban and rural development and on territorial developments in different parts of Europe, like North-West Europe, the Alpine Space and Central and Eastern Europe. In addition, a proactive, roll-back scenario explores the possibilities to combine competitiveness, cohesion and sustainability. A message, derived from the scenarios, is that independent of the explored policy options the European territory will be confronted with large challenges like a (rapid) decline of fossil energy resources and increasing impacts of climate change. The scenarios appear particularly helpful in the context of the current paradigm shift in European regional policy from a policy for balance to a policy for aggregate growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Transdisciplinarity is currently perceived as an extended knowledge production including a variety of actors and with an open perception of the relevance of different forms of scientific and lay knowledge. By stressing scope of collaboration, a clearer distinction can be established between interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity than was possible with the former focus on degree of integration. However, integration is still an essential feature of transdisciplinarity and in emphasising the need to acknowledge the different roles actors can play in knowledge production a distinction can be identified between two different forms of transdisciplinarity; consulting versus participatory transdisciplinarity. This distinction draws upon the qualitative difference between research conducted including all kinds of actors on equal terms in the knowledge production process (participatory transdisciplinarity) or having actors from outside academia responding and reacting to the research conducted (consulting transdisciplinarity). Both forms fulfil the basic requirements of transdisciplinarity but differ regarding the challenges involved, and thus a distinction needs to be made between them when discussing, commissioning or evaluating research.

However, most studies use cross-sectional data, implicitly assuming that workers are randomly assigned to being overeducated. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the period 1979-2005, this study conducts a panel analysis to account for time-constant individual characteristics. It uses a numerical approach to provide the wage effects in the presence of non-classical measurement error in the educational mismatch variables. The results provide evidence that overeducated status does not cause lower earnings. Instead, the significant wage differential found in previous studies is simply a result of ignoring the non-random assignment of workers to jobs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Migrants moved from semi-subsistence agricultural systems where income generation was trivial in search of incomes, goods and experience(s). Forced migration gave way to conscious choice. Similarities in the organisation of recruitment, acquisition of income and skills and improved material well-being attend both phases. Women have been more likely to participate in the second phase.

With circumscribed employment rights, the increased significance of temporary migrant workers underscores arguments that globalisation has engendered a more profound commodification of labour. The instrumentalist approach, especially of international financial institutions in promoting temporary labour migration as a panacea for development, reinforces this impression. Encapsulated in migration-development discourse, labour migration, like other commodities, is presented as a means of generating export revenue for the South. Karl Polanyi's critique of this market-defined construct of labour as a commodity, when labour can only ever be a fictitious commodity, provides a basis for contesting the representation of labour in the migration-development discourse. However, recourse to a Marxist method is held to be essential if we are to move beyond an appreciation of the process in order to interrogate the rationale that is driving the transformation of labour.","Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Rosewarne, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",stuart.rosewarne@sydney.edu.au,,"Rosewarne, Stuart/0000-0002-1467-4124",,,,,19,36,39,2,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Iran, however, has experienced a rapid increase in nonoil exports in the past decade. Against this background, the paper tests whether the conventional wisdom still applies to Iran and concludes that the emergence of the nonoil export sector has made currency depreciation expansionary. The expansionary effect is particularly evident regarding anticipated persistent depreciation in the long run. Notwithstanding the varying effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the demand and supply sides of the economy, managing a flexible exchange rate gradually over time toward achieving stability in the real effective exchange rate may strike the necessary balance.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Kandil, Magda] Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Caribbean Div 2, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; International Monetary Fund,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu; mkandil@imf.org,,,,,,,38,10,10,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The proposed SSM includes no procedural and minimal notification requirements. It would expand by arithmetic formulas the bounds within which a Member might unilaterally impose new import restrictions. Simulations indicate that the formulas provide a poor guide for policy they would (a) allow an import restriction more often in situations when it is not beneficial than when it is, and (b) in situations in which an import restriction would help, they more often ban it than allow it. If procedural requirements are out i.e., developing Members insist on a 'usable' safeguard then the simple rule 'bound rates may be exceeded for a maximum of [x] tariff lines at any one time' is better economics than the proposed price and volume triggers.

Although this effect potentially applies to any student-report variable, the systematic overreporting of academic achievements such as grade point average is often of preeminent concern. This concern can be easily circumvented if official records data are available; however, many researchers can only access student-reported data. In this article, the authors examine whether using student-survey data in place of official records data meaningfully biases regression estimates. They motivate their contribution by noting a useful statistical feature of overreporting on bounded variables such as grade point average. Specifically, the misreports will be negatively correlated with the true grade point average, yielding a form of nonclassical measurement error that actually counteracts the bias. The authors connect this observation to reliability ratios used in labor economics, which are simple ways to adjust for attenuation bias, when needed. In two applications, we find that it is unnecessary to correct for the LWE bias because it is so small.","[Haley, M. Ryan; Johnson, Marianne F.; McGee, M.

Combining the standardized test scores of children enrolled in Defense Department schools with their military parent's personnel data, we evaluate the effect of a soldier's deployment on the academic achievement of his or her children.

As we all know, there is a certain relationship between housing rents and real estate prices. According to the general rule of the market economy in developed countries and regions, housing price to rent should have a relatively fixed value between 1:300 and 1:200. In general, buying housing may be the active of speculative investment; however, renting housing is a kind of basic living needs. So housing price-to-rent ratio can reflect the basic housing demand and reflect the local real estate market supply and demand objectively in cities. The essence of using housing price-to-rent ratio to value real estate is the income approach application in real estate appraisal. Like the income approach, applicable objects of housing price to rent ratio are those kinds of real estate which have revenue or potential revenue, such as housing, apartments, offices, hotels, shops, restaurants, playgrounds, heaters, parking lots, gas stations, standard factory building, storage, agricultural land. Applicable conditions of housing price to rent ratio is that real estate's future earnings and risk can be accurately quantify.

Using dynamic panel methodology, is estimated the relationship between several internal Corporate Governance variables and firms' performance. The main results obtained are: 1. The existence of entrepreneurial stagnancy in Mexico; 2. The preference to adopt passive Corporate Governance strategies; 3.

We consider a vertically differentiated duopoly where endogenous market quality affects waste disposal costs. Each producer has to meet a take-back requirement that forces it to collect and treat the waste associated with its products. In line with reality, we assume that the producers either organize themselves individually or cooperate by setting up a producer responsibility organization (PRO). We study the various implementations of EPR. Central to the analysis is the trade-off between collusion through the PRO and market power in the waste industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike traditional technical assistance and outreach, knowledge is primarily shared among landowners as opposed to being derived from natural resource professionals. While potentially promising, few studies have investigated these approaches. Through a study of a landowner cooperative in Wisconsin, I report on a finding that considers both the effectiveness of a landowner cooperative in the Upper Midwest (USA) and the social network members rely on in decision-making. The former relies on an importance-performance analysis (IPA) of the services provided by the cooperative and the latter on an egocentric network analysis of members with an emphasis on strong and weak ties. Data were collected via a mail survey to which 146 members (81%) responded. The IPA indicates that the cooperative is providing services with which members are largely satisfied. The network analysis suggests that members, through strong ties, discuss their land with on average three others-primarily natural resource professionals (including cooperative staff), as opposed to other members, neighbors, and kin. However, by virtue of membership, they share weak ties with other members whom they see as trustworthy. The extent to which a network perspective might be applied to similar situations is discussed, as are conceptual implications and future directions. The main conclusion is that the emergence of local landowner associations and peer-to-peer learning requires research methods that better capture the social nature of these new directions.

Results indicate that the state-level judicial-legal climate does appear to influence administrators' discipline policies; that students appear to be truant less often when discipline is stricter; and that school and long-run labor participation outcomes appear higher for students from schools with stricter discipline policies.

The rather confused pattern of tourism development and growth illustrates a major dichotomy which exists in tourism, namely, that between its dynamism and its inertia, and the tension between these two attributes accounts in part for a general difficulty in being able to predict the future patterns of tourism. This paper reviews some of the approaches used to describe and predict the future nature and scale of tourism and argues that few have been effective or accurate, and that this is due in part to the heterogeneous nature of tourism, in both its demand and Supply, and that the role of external agents is constantly altering the anticipated pattern of growth and development. Particular attention is paid to the life cycle model which has been used for a quarter of a century to describe the process of development of tourist destinations, whether Such a model can be used to predict future patterns, and whether cycles, waves or wheels are suitable analogies for the pattern of tourism growth. The paper argues for a blending of both evolutionary and revolutionary predictions in the case of tourism destinations, an approach which allows for the incorporation of ideas such as chaos theory and chance into the equation of growth, in order to reflect both the inertia and dynamism that are inherent in tourism.

J,"Williams, PW; Ponsford, IF",,,,"Williams, Peter W.; Ponsford, Ian F.",,,Confronting tourism's environmental paradox: Transitioning for sustainable tourism,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Tourism requires environmental resources as core ingredients and compelling backdrops for the production of tourism experiences. Paradoxically it also depends on the protection of the ecological integrity of these features for sustained competitiveness. This 'resource paradox' has epitomized relationships between tourism and the environment for decades. However, unprecedented reportings of the frequency, severity and persistence of adverse weather conditions; climate change; natural disasters; disease outbreaks: and various forms of environmental pollution, Cumulatively highlight the urgency for more systematically managing tourism's resource paradox. This paper characterizes the industry's environmental and sustainability performance, and Suggests planning and management approaches that will be needed to move it towards a More sustainable future. It uses a Case study of 'sustainability-focused' tourism destination planning to illustrate the type of collective actions that must occur if the industry is to successfully manage tourism's challenging environmental relationships. It is argued that more collective and vision-oriented approaches to tourism industry planning are needed to address broader and more pervasive environmental and sustainability challenges.

We find that non-attainment designation has no effect on the average monitor in non-attainment counties, after controlling for weather and socioeconomic characteristics at the county level. In sharp contrast, if we allow for heterogeneous treatment by type of monitor and county, we do find that the 1990 CAAAs produced substantial effects. Our best estimate suggests that PM10 concentrations at monitors with concentrations above the national annual standard dropped by between 7 and 9 mu g/m(3), which is roughly equivalent to a 11-14% drop. We also show that monitors which were in violation of the daily standard experience two fewer days in violation of the daily standard the following year. Empirical results suggest that this treatment effect is independent of whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized the non-attainment designation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In order to evaluate this question, we focus on the therapeutic biotech industry and draw a German-British comparison. Proponents of the varieties-of-capitalism (VoC) approach assume that German firms underperform in this industrial sector in comparison to British firms due to the institutional framework in which German firms operate; this framework is assumed to provide them with hardly any strategic latitude. The VoC approach is challenged by two alternative perspectives, in both of which it is believed that firms can have a high level of strategic leeway; in the first approach this is possible due to institutional heterogeneity within national market economies; and in the second approach, the above can be seen as the result of economic internationalization. Our empirical findings show that British firms are indeed more competitive in the therapeutical biotech industry but only to a limited extent. German firms perform better than projected by the VoC approach because they operate in an institutionally heterogeneous environment and due to the impact of internationalization. Thus, we argue for the integration of these three perspectives in one explanatory approach.","Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-1000 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Lange, K (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-1000 Berlin, Germany.",knut.lange@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,38,39,40,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

It needs to do so from three perspectives: 1) futures research is regarded as an applied science: a closer connection between studying the future in an academic manner and conducting futures research can improve the quality and subsequently the use and impact of futures research, since this will set a cyclic process between theory and practice in motion. An important condition for ensuring this is to increase the amount of empirical research concerning the way futures research is carried out in real life; 2) a reappraisal of predicting the future: although history has shown that predicting the future is difficult, stating that, in the future, predictions will not be a part of futures research is in itself a prediction. in fact, predictions can serve as valuable starting points for discourses on the future; 3) the context of futures research: futures researchers should be more aware of the context in which they do their work. This can significantly enhance the usability of futures research but it also means that futures researchers should become more flexible in applying their methods and processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper also compares earnings penalties associated with over and under education across immigrant and minority ethnic groups for men and women. The results show that compared to Whites, Black African, Other Non-White and Indian men are more likely to be over-educated, whilst for women it is Indian and Pakistani/Bangladeshi's who are more likely to be over-educated. Estimating earnings equations shows significantly large over-education penalties for South Asian immigrant and native men, as well as White immigrant men, Black women and White UK born women. However, there are large returns to occupational skills for some minority ethnic and immigrant groups, over and above the returns to qualifications. It is suggested that these groups may therefore find it easier to find a suitable job for their UK education level if higher or further education programmes for immigrants were combined with occupational specific training.

This paper discusses smallholder farmers' decision to adopt selected hybrid varieties of cucumber, chilli pepper and sweet corn, and the impact of that decision on the farmers' livelihood. The information comes from focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews conducted in five locations in Central and North-Eastern Thailand. Results show a positive net improvement in income per hectare after the adoption of the selected hybrid varieties. These crops provided employment opportunities for farmers and were a very important supplementary source of income for poor farmers. Farmers preferred hybrid varieties due to their high production potential and superior characteristics. The location specific factors such as availability of water and good transport were also crucial. While market demand and product price played an important role, local agents provided the necessary inputs including credit and thus played an important role in facilitating adoption. Although local agents provide essential services, it is necessary to facilitate and monitor their activities through effective public-private partnerships so that farmers can maximize the benefit from the adoption of appropriate varieties.","Asian Inst Technol, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Bastakoti, RC (通讯作者)，Asian Inst Technol, POB 4, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand.",,,"Bastakoti, Ram C/0000-0003-2456-5420",,,,,7,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,91,100,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.809.6,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300006,0

The aim in this process was to define the land-use allocation and the corresponding forest management operations for state-owned forests within these planning regions. Mesta was used in examining and evaluating the strategy alternatives from the viewpoint of the stakeholders' objectives. The basic idea in using Mesta is to define the acceptance thresholds that divide the alternatives into 'acceptable' and 'not acceptable' alternatives with respect to each decision criterion. The thresholds are adjusted holistically, i.e. so that all decision criteria and criteria values of all decision alternatives are simultaneously visible from the user interface. The holistic adjustment process is continued until an acceptable solution compliant with the production possibilities of the planning area is found. In the NRP process, the members of the stakeholder group first used Mesta individually to set their own thresholds. Next, the participants' acceptance thresholds were combined and a negotiation process was launched to find the group's common acceptance thresholds. This negotiation was also supported by Mesta. The result of the negotiation was that the participants were able to collaboratively decide on their recommendation for the future land-use allocation and the forest management principles to be applied in the two planning regions. The main benefit of Mesta as a decision-support toot during the negotiation process of the group was that the participants were forced to merge their preferences with the realistic production possibilities of the planning regions.

Two main information sources statistic data of GUS (Central Statistical Office in Poland) and the data from Social Diagnosis showing conditions and quality of life of Poles were used in the article. Literature presents different measures of the human capital level. The present research defines the quality of the human capital mainly using the level of education. However since the use of only one factor is insufficient, apart from this measure the following other factors were also considered: level of professional activity, extent up to which people over 20 years of age use educational services, and ability to use computer. The article presents also the calculation of the so-called human capital resources index in rural areas of the following five provinces in Poland: Lodzkie, Mazowieckie, Slaskie, Zachodniopomorskie and Warminsko-Mazurskie. Human capital resources index is based on education, employment, enterprise, and professional activity indexes. Mazovia is a central province in Poland, but the level of human capital in the rural areas is not the highest possible. The level of human resources quality is the lowest in Warminsko-Mazurskie province, while in Zachodniopomorskie province the level of enterprise index is the highest in Poland.","[Mossakowska, Ewa] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,249,254,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700032,0

Irrigation has a significant contribution for the safety and productivity of crops, although it also could contribute to important deterioration of soil quality if the water is not used efficiently. Model optimization of crop structure, by including specific restrictions represents all efficient way to progress toward the current goals of crop production.

Added value is defined here as the difference in economic value between the physical inputs and outputs of a production process, and is generally analysed at the firm or national economy level. In this study we identify and discuss issues involved in quantifying added value at the industrial process level, and develop a bottom-up method to estimate the value added by forest industry processes. We calculate the value added by 14 traditional and emerging processes within the Swedish forest products industries, and express the results using various indices. We find that the type of biomass input strongly influences the potential for adding value, with sawlogs allowing more added value and being less sensitive to input price fluctuations than pulpwood and forest residues. Structural wood products such as lumber and glue-laminated beams are found to give the greatest value added. Co-production of multiple products from a single raw material increases total value added. Integrating the value chain of pulp and paper production significantly increases the value added to pulpwood. Multiple conversion processes exist for using forest residues as fuel, with a range of potential added value. Consideration of the climate benefits of forest product use, through the application of a carbon tax, significantly increases the added value. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, crop management practices are implemented on an average basis without considering the substantial variation in soil properties, bare spots, topographic features, and yield in blueberry fields. Yield maps along with fertility, weed, and topographic maps can be used to generate prescription maps for site-specific application of agrochemicals. Two wild blueberry fields were selected in central Nova Scotia to evaluate a photographic method for fruit yield estimation. A 10-megapixel 24-bit digital color camera was mounted on a tripod and pointed downwards to take photographs of the blueberry crop from a height of approximately 1 m. At harvest time, blueberry crop images were collected in each field at 30 different sample locations displaying a range in yield. Actual fruit yield was sampled from the same locations by hand-harvesting a 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat, using a commercial blueberry rake. Custom image processing software was developed to count the blue pixels of ripe fruit in the quadrat region of each image and express it as a percentage of total quadrat pixels. Linear regression was used to calibrate the fruit yield with percentage blue pixels separately in each field and then the calibration equation of field 1 was used to predict fruit yield in field 2 for validation of the method. Percentage blue pixels correlated highly significantly with manually harvested fruit yield in field 1 (R-2 = 0.98, n = 30) and field 2 (R-2 = 0.99, n = 30). The correlation between actual and predicted fruit yield in the second field (validation) was also highly significant (R-2 = 0.99, n = 30, RMSE = 277 kg/ha). Non-significance of the t-test for actual versus predicted yield indicated that there was no bias in the yield estimation and that the predicted yield was accurate. Based on these results, an automated yield monitoring system consisting of a digital camera, computer, and DGPS will be developed and incorporated into a harvester to monitor and map blueberry fruit yield in real time.","[Zaman, Q.

The private sector has successfully deployed them for strategic planning, examining key parameters such as markets, competition and consumer trends. However in public policy, most energy future studies remain disconnected from policy making. One reason is that they often ignore the key political and institutional factors that underpin much of the anticipated, wished-for or otherwise explored energy systems developments. Still, we know that institutions and politics are critical enablers or constraints to technical and policy change. This paper examines how analytical insights into political and institutional dynamics can enhance energy future studies. It develops an approach that combines systems-technical change scenarios with political and institutional analysis. Using the example of a backcasting study dealing with the long term low-carbon transformation of a national energy system, it applies two levels of institutional and political analysis; at the level of international regimes and at the level of sectoral policy, and examines how future systems changes and policy paths are conditioned by institutional change processes. It finds that the systematic application of these variables significantly enhances and renders more useful backcasting studies of energy futures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Egyedi, T; Spirco, J",,,,"Egyedi, Tineke; Spirco, Jaroslav",,,Standards in transitions: Catalyzing infrastructure change,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Infrastructures are difficult to change in response to new societal demands. They are entrenched, materially and socio-institutionally, and seem to be 'locked-in'. Scholars have addressed this problem by, for example, devising strategies for de-entrenchment, alternative path creation and transition management that focus on the process of change (emphasis on 'how'). In this paper, we take a novel and counterintuitive approach, and focus on standards as a starting point for change (emphasis on 'what'). We analyze in what manner standards can play a catalyzing role in infrastructure transitions and which standards characteristics facilitate in doing so. Central to our framework are the concepts of gateway technology and compatibility. We analyze three cases, i.e., the modal shift in freight container transport: the transition from barcode to Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID): and the possibility of a Dutch energy transition from natural gas to hydrogen. The article concludes that standards can catalyze infrastructure transitions if, first, their content well-reflects relevant stakeholder interests; and, second, if standard specifications are simple and performance-oriented. Their impact is highest in stable markets and for expanding infrastructures. Under these conditions standards can exploit the forces of entrenchment and socio-technical lock-in to bring about change.

Data were based on Swedish registries, reports and databases, published literature, and an expert panel. There were 100,557 individuals with AF as primary or secondary diagnosis that were either hospitalized or treated in hospital outpatient care in 2007. The total cost of AF was estimated at a,not sign708 million. The major cost driver was the direct cost of complications (54%), followed by hospitalization due to AF including AF as secondary diagnosis (18%), and production loss (12%). This is a comprehensive, nation-based cost analysis of AF where relevant data were derived from national registries covering the entire Swedish population.

Focusing on the Swiss machine industry, we analyse the erosion of traditional non-market mechanisms of corporate control and finance and the adoption of a liberal corporate governance system. We then discuss the consequences of the reorientation of firms towards shareholders' interests. Takeovers and strategic controls, disinvestments, mergers and layoffs appear as a consequence of investor pressures and new managerial preferences. The erosion of the strong links between firms and banks and with other industrial firms in the networks of interlocking directorships also shows the decline of non-market forms of coordination. The Swiss experience of financialization finally suggests a fine-tuning of the current concepts apprehending the trajectory of 'coordinated market economies'.","Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, EESP Haute Ecole Travail Social & Sante, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland,"Widmer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, EESP Haute Ecole Travail Social & Sante, Lausanne, Switzerland.",frederic.widmer@eesp.ch,,,,,,,39,20,24,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The test plots were considered representative of conifer plantations in the Alps and were split in two halves, each harvested with a different technology level. During harvesting, researchers recorded all work time, volume output and resource usage of all ongoing operations on a daily basis. These data were used to calculate harvesting cost, labour productivity and energy consumption. As an average, the application of modern harvesting technology allowed reducing harvesting cost by a half, shrinking it to 24.8 (sic) m(-3) from the original 50.1 (sic) m(-3). However, the rates actually paid by the forest owner were not significantly different, and were in the range of 40 (sic) m(-3). This may indicate that the mechanized firm and the traditional firm internalize a significant portion of the profits and the losses, respectively. Such instance may depend on the virtual oligopoly enjoyed by mechanized firms and on the capacity of traditional firms to use resources available at marginal costs. Mechanization allows multiplying operator productivity and for this reason achieves an overwhelming superiority over traditional technology, which makes it a better choice even when utilization rates and labour cost are comparatively low. A break-even between the two technology levels is obtained only when the utilization rate and labour cost are not higher than 300 h year(-1) and 8 (sic) h(-1) respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of modern machinery does not result in a higher consumption of fossil energy per unit of product. A major technology shift may be occurring in Italian forest operations, as it did occur further north in recent years.

The analysis-which refers to a stated preference framework-contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether benefits resulting from reduced mortality risk should be valued differently depending on the age of the beneficiaries. By focussing on a life-threatening environmental phenomenon I show that the consideration of the individual's age-specific hazard rate is important. If a particular risk affects all individuals regardless of their age so that their hazard rate is age-independent, VSL is rather constant for people at different age; if hazard rate varies with age, VSL estimates are sensitive to age. The results provide an explanation for the mixed outcomes in empirical studies and illustrate in which cases an adjustment to age may or may not be justified. Efficient provision of live-saving measures requires that such differences to be taken into account.","Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Leiter, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",andrea.leiter@uibk.ac.at,,"Leiter, Andrea/0000-0002-8628-5072",,,,,45,5,5,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The findings provide new evidence that momentum profits are due to idiosyncratic risk and investors' underreaction to industry-specific information.

As a result of the researches led by developed nations to detect adverse effects of human-originated greenhouse gas emissions, which have already reached dangerous levels in the atmosphere, on the climate system, the need to take global action about this matter has been revealed. Kyoto Protocol, which is adopted in 1997 and now considered as the most significant international effort ever made to minimize the effects of global warming and climate changes, is of great importance for determining the obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the applicable mechanisms. After a long process, Turkey has become a party to Kyoto Protocol in 2009 and thus undertaken the obligations stipulated for the parties thereto. In the present study, deforestation has been picked out of the five driving factors of the said Protocol due to importance of forests as significant carbon sinks, and adequacy of Turkish environment and forest legislation relating to this matter has been analyzed. Purpose of this study is to assess, under the title of deforestation. Turkish environment and forest legislation with respect to achievement of Kyoto Protocol's goal and to reveal deficiencies of this legislation, and according to the results of such assessment, to make suggestions for Turkey's fulfillment of its obligations mentioned above. As a result of the general assessment made in the light of all data above on Turkish environment and forestry legislation with respect to deforestation, we can say that this legislation is currently cannot be considered as adequate to fulfill the obligations under Kyoto Protocol. However, this does not mean that the norms are wholly negative and inadequate. Having signed Kyoto Protocol short time ago. Turkey has not undertaken any responsibility for the first period of obligations, but will be subject to the next period of obligations. The first step to fulfill the obligations under the Protocol is to revise the existing legal arrangements, to determine their gaps and to begin working to ensure that the legislation will be adequate to fulfill the obligations to be imposed during the second period of obligations.

J,"Friedrichs, J",,,,"Friedrichs, Joerg",,,Peak energy and climate change: The double bind of post-normal science,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL,"Insofar as the viability of industrial society is at stake, energy supply and climate change are not normal scientific issues. Fossil fuel is the ultimate finite resource, and the atmosphere the ultimate finite sink. There is dispute about the most fundamental issues and values to be promoted or defended. The concept of post-normal science has been introduced for precisely this kind of situation, where facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent (Ravetz [1, p. 349]). Although this applies equally to energy supply and climate change, the related knowledge regimes offer a remarkable contrast. Mainstream energy science, on the one hand, has refused to engage in post-normal science. The accredited experts at the International Energy Agency (IEA) and elsewhere have left peak energy to mavericks at the fringes or outside mainstream scientific discourse. Consequently, the pressing issue of future energy scarcity has been kept from the public agenda. Official climate science, on the other hand, has embraced post-normal science. But even though the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been uniquely successful in placing climate change on the public agenda, the inherent ambiguities of post-normal science have plunged climate science into a deep legitimacy crisis. Most people prefer denial and self-deception to an unvarnished vision of the truth when intractable problems such as peak energy and climate change are at stake. In such cases, scientists are in a double bind: they are damned if they do and doomed if they do not engage in post-normal science. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies indicate that beach width positively affects coastal property values, but these studies ignore the dynamic features of beaches and the feedback that nourishment has on shoreline retreat. We correct for the resulting attenuation and endogeneity bias in a hedonic property value model by instrumenting for beach width using spatially varying coastal geological features. We find that the beach width coefficient is nearly five times larger than the OLS estimate, suggesting that beach width is a much larger portion of property value than previously thought. We use the empirical results to parameterize a dynamic optimization model of beach nourishment decisions and show that the predicted interval between nourishment projects is closer to what we observe in the data when we use the estimate from the instrumental variables model rather than OLS. As coastal communities adapt to climate change, we find that the long-term net value of coastal residential property can fall by as much as 52% when erosion rate triples and cost of nourishment sand quadruples.

The arguments for privatisation are reviewed, in particular the need for increased competition and/or appropriate regulation where a former public monopoly, such as Sydney Airport, is sold. The aftermath of the privatisation of the airport has led to complaints by the major airlines and consumers of ever increasing charges for use of the airfield and for car parking and other services. This highlights that the 'light-handed' monitoring regime has not constrained the airport's ability to charge monopoly rents. The aftermath of privatisation has resulted in labour shedding, outsourcing and a focus on cost minimisation by the airport's management.","[O'Donnell, Michael; Glennie, Miriam; O'Keefe, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kwon, Seung-Ho] Univ New S Wales, Korea Res Inst, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian Defense Force Academy; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"O'Donnell, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Business, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",m.odonnell@adfa.edu.au,,,,,,,53,10,12,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This will enable certain locations in the High North to become important activity areas. Of most consequence are the fundamental activity structures of Earth, like global shipping, world trade and oil extraction. These will be impacted as the Arctic sea routes have opened, opening up shorter shipping distances between the N-Pacific and N-Atlantic Oceans. The reduction of ice in the Arctic Ocean will also lead to ever improved access to the resources of Arctic ocean-floor and the Arctic Region-perhaps most importantly to oil and gas. The conclusions also indicate that some central regions of the globe may loose relatively, for instance in terms of global shipping. Oil-rich central areas-like the Persian Gulf area-will face losses in activity as their oil starts to dwindle. Arctic oil is now about 10% of the world production. The rate of Arctic ice reduction will influence the rate of growth in Arctic resource extraction and it will likely occur later this century. The activity and importance of the Arctic will thus grow relatively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we look at whether participation in Intramural and Recreation programs is associated with freshman grade point average at a mid-sized public institution with extensive recreational opportunities.

This paper analyses several institutional innovations with the capacity to create considerable changes in the rules of the game of forest policy making in Austria, Scotland and France. All cases provide relevant examples of the public effort in promoting institutional innovation, in a context characterised by a shift from government regulation to governance mechanisms. They also provide examples of the basic role of the market in orienting innovation, independently from the institutional perspective. They also show that the outcome is often different to that which was expected. Whilst technical innovations in wood production are perhaps more easily learned and developed, economic considerations often intervene to impede organisational innovations aimed at promoting the multifunctional management of forests. The paper reflects on the role of the market, in inter-linking with policy decisions, and develops ideas on the comprehensive dynamics of promotion of innovation in the forest sector, where policy and markets work at the same time both as drivers as well as barriers, in creating the framework conditions for change. It focuses on the role of social and policy learning in the process of re-definition of the stakeholder networks which orientate innovation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Apart front the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade facilitation is a subject of substance within a wide range of international organizations including several United Nations (UN)-type bodies, the World Customs Organization (WCO) as well as those concerned with economic development, supply chain security, and sector-specific issues such as international transport and logistics. The resulting body of international trade facilitation instruments and initiatives, which include conventions as well as detailed technical recommendations, is extensive. This article provides a general review of key elements and topics that are associated with trade facilitation and sets them against underlying challenges and obstacles in practice as well as for research. While much of the current effort in trade facilitation begins with a top-down premise - whereby governments seek to implement international conventions and recommendations nationally - the author argues that trade facilitation is inherently an operations-focused topic and deserves to be approached front a bottom-up approach, too. Such approach not only provides a strong case for an interdisciplinary research agenda, it also brings into question whether current institutions concerned with trade facilitation have the necessary capabilities to apply themselves to the more operational aspects associated with international trade.","[Grainger, Andrew] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Grainger, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",andrew.grainger@nottingham.ac.uk,"wassie, mengistu/ABT-3222-2022","Grainger, Andrew/0000-0002-4423-3522",,,,,73,34,38,1,41,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Using two volunteer student samples of CT and PT test scores collected as part of the field testing and national norming of the Test of Economic Knowledge (Walstad, Rebeck, and Butters 2010), the present authors investigated how CT and PT affect student test responses.

Firms are more interested in direct marketing when it allows them to capitalize on consumer goodwill. Other studies have shown that firms which practice corporate social responsibility have a marketing edge. Another body of research emphasizes the importance of product quality in earning consumer loyalty and goodwill. The difficulty for consumers wishing to buy organic products is the veracity of the firms' organic claims. There are multiple channels for marketing organic products in Taiwan, including specialty shops, supermarkets and chain stores. Lee Zen is a successful supply chain growing exponentially in Taiwan. It currently has 160 ha of land, 433 accredited farmers, three logistics centres and 76 stores selling fresh organic produce and processed food. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors contributing to the sustainability of the chain, including production, marketing and distribution. The results show that Lee Zen has been able to earn considerable consumer goodwill through its practice of corporate social responsibility. On the supply side, Lee Zen is trusted by contract farmers and consumers for their organic practices. The company's success can be attributed to the wheel of wellness theory, the principle of enlightened business, Senge's mental model, and the Confucian individual success model. This study indicates that the supply, marketing and distribution of organic products requires the trust of producers, retailers and consumers who all benefit from having a vision that is ethical and socially responsible.","[Chang, L.

West Virginia's Managed Timberland (Managed Timberland) is designed to retain private forest land in forested use. In West Virginia, although private forest land owners hold 9.7 million acres of forest land (83% of forest land), Managed Timberland enrolled acres have remained at approximately 2 million acres since 1998. This lack of enrollment may be a cause for concern regarding the success and benefits of the program. This study evaluates West Virginia's Managed Timberland program, examines the factors that influence forest landowners' decision to participate in the program, and proposes strategies for increasing enrollment and improving the program. The data for this study were collected from a mail survey of participants and non-participants of the program conducted in the fall of 2008 on West Virginia forest landowners. Participants tended to hear about the Managed Timberland program from a professional forester and the majority of them were satisfied with the program administration. Aspects of the program that participants opposed most strongly were the annual contract renewal requirement and the tax assessors' overriding authority. Most participants (51%) indicated that a longer contract time was a favorable change to the program. Many non-participants reported that they were not enrolled in Managed Timberland because they had never heard of the program. Although most non-participants were undecided as to whether they would enroll in the future, 25% said they would consider it. Significant factors influencing enrollment were age, income, place of residence, county location of the enrolled property, and perceived benefits of the program.

Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that research shows that 80% of global economy is, directly or indirectly, influenced by weather. And while weather may be the oldest risk businesses face with, it gained much needed attention only recently, as impacts of climate change became more obvious. Uncertainty in future weather conditions translates into uncertainty in future cash flows, which consequently leads to higher cost of borrowing capital. Regardless of the risk type, there are four basic management strategies avoidance, acceptance, reduction and transfer named in the order of their effectiveness. In the past, companies have simply ignored the weather risk, but today principles of weather risk management have become inevitable due to the heavy competition, worldwide economic crisis and climate change. Currently, weather derivatives present the most effective instrument of weather risk protection. For the purpose of this paper a research was conducted among large Croatian enterprises in order to assess their level of weather risk awareness, to determine which strategies they use to protect themselves from adverse weather and to determine to what extent are researched companies familiar with weather derivatives, as one of the newest and fastest growing derivatives market in the world. Findings imply that many companies acknowledge weather as a source of risk while only few of them try to actively protect themselves from financial exposure to weather.","[Lazibat, Tonci; Stulec, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,tlazibat@efzg.hr; istulec@efzg.hr,"Štulec, Ivana/A-9080-2013","Štulec, Ivana/0000-0002-6646-505X",,,,,28,1,1,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The ecological footprint, carrying capacity, and ecological deficit of Chang Dao County were calculated. Furthermore, the concept and model of ecological footprint pressure index (EFPI) as well as the grade system of regional ecological security was put forward based on ecological footprint so as to analyze the regional ecological security. From 2003 to 2008 the per capita ecological capacity and the per capita ecological footprint of Chang Dao show an increasing tendency. The per capita ecological deficit appears an increasing tendency. According to the ecological security grade system measured off by EFPI, the security degree of ecology system belongs to IV,and it is a worsening state. The improved method makes evaluation results more objective, precise and measurable. The improved models in this paper could make an important contribution to decision-making for Chang Dao's governors and to the development of the island regional planning incorporation assessment and prediction of ecological security.

Yet changing the level of resources is one of the key policy levers open to governments. In England, school expenditure has increased by about 40% since 2000. Thus assessing whether such spending has had an impact on educational outcomes is of paramount importance. We address this issue using data of better quality than what are often available in similar studies and test our identification assumption by use of a falsification test. We find that the increase in school expenditure over recent years has had a consistently positive effect on outcomes at the end of primary school. Back-of-envelope calculations suggest that the investment may well be cost-effective. There is also some evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of expenditure, with higher effects for students who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For mismatched men the income penalty is about twice as large as that found for US men, whereas for women the penalty is of about the same size as for US women. Controlling for cognitive ability further establishes that the income penalty is not caused by a sorting by ability, at least for Swedish men. The income penalty for men decreases with work experience, which is an indication that education-specific skills and work experience are substitutes to some extent. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

GATS Mode 4, EPAs, and Bilateral Migration Agreements",JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SERVICES; TRADE,"International economic migration is steered internationally by the interplay of migration-related agreements at three levels: the multilateral opening of services markets for natural persons in the so-called 'mode 4' of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, the preferential trade agreements, which replicate the GATS modalities at regional or cross continental levels and the non-trade, bilateral migration agreements concluded in a securitarian context. This fragmentation in terms of hierarchical norm allocation is further exacerbated by a split running horizontally or thematically through trade and non-trade agreements in terms of occupational skill levels. Whereas bilateral, non-trade agreements correct the high-skill bias of unilateral immigration law and the multilateral regime for liberalizing the movement of natural persons in WTO/GATS, the economic partnership agreements (EPA), for their part, combine openings for the highly-skilled with access for lower-skilled professions. In the final analysis, the most-favored-nation clause (MEN) of the WTO/GATS functions to de-fragment the incoherent landscape of agreements pertaining to economic migration. Insofar, as the MEN-clause of WTO/GATS requires multilateralizing market openings, it disciplines the preferential recruitment schemes based on nationality characteristic for bilateral migration agreements. In so doing, the MEN clause takes pressure off the classic corridors of migration and thus contributes to distributing the burdens of receiving migrant workers more evenly among the WTO Membership.","Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Panizzon, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",marion.panizzon@wti.org,"Panizzon, Marion/AAW-5104-2021","Panizzon, Marion/0000-0002-1846-7130",,,,,81,14,14,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We argue that transition research is important for the understanding and development of possible sustainable future pathways. However, there are several controversies in transition research, including, the role of agency in transitions; the relationships between levels (niche, regime and landscapes); the origin of transitions; the identification of a transition, including starting and ending point of transition processes; and the paradox of replicability and scaling up of independent experiments. We argue that transition research, and future studies can benefit from taking complexity theory seriously. In the paper, we elaborate four insights from complexity studies that can move the research agenda of transition studies forward: empirically investigating the degree of complexity of a system; investigating complexity at the level of the policy-making system; longitudinal and retrospective research designs for the identification of transitions; methodological tools which accommodate complexity, such as agent-based modeling and ARIMA modeling. Further, we suggest how these can improve our knowledge of transitions towards sustainable future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We employ a general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with a unique treatment of capital dynamics that permits close attention to profit impacts. Effects on profits depend critically on the relative reliance on auctioning or free allocation of allowances. Freely allocating fewer than 15% of the emissions allowances generally suffices to prevent profit losses in the most vulnerable U.S. industries. Freely allocating all of the allowances substantially overcompensates these industries. When emissions allowances are auctioned and the proceeds employed to finance cuts in income tax rates, GDP costs are about 33% lower than when all allowances are freely allocated. Our results are robust to policies differing in stringency, the availability of offsets, and the opportunities for intertermporal trading of allowances. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike other jurisdictions, North American governments needed to save leading regional producers from liquidation.

Because DB plans pay off fully with a fixed income after retirement only if a teacher stays in the profession for decades and yield little or nothing if a teacher leaves early, DB plans induce a strong, nonlinear relationship between years of tenure and benefit accrual. One implication is that as many current teachers approach eligibility for full pensions, there are strong incentives for retirement and associated consequences in the teacher labor market. In this article, we assess the key features of DB plans, discuss the general incentive effects, and consider the application to the particular case of teachers. This work highlights the importance of assessing the characteristics of teachers who respond most to the retirement timing incentives.","[Friedberg, Leora] Univ Virginia, TIAA CREF, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Turner, Sarah] Univ Virginia, NBER, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Virginia,"Friedberg, L (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, TIAA CREF, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",lfriedberg@virginia.edu; sturner@virginia.edu,,,,,,,46,14,18,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This article presents an overview of the various types of state regulation of public pension plans that affect possibilities for reform. Nearly all of the various approaches to public pension plan protection taken by the states have significant flaws. These flaws include a lack of clarity regarding what plan changes the relevant legal standard will allow, combined with either too much or too little protection for plan participants. This article argues that states would be well served to adopt a contractual approach to public pension benefits but to limit that contractual protection to accrued benefits. This approach is clear, protects legitimate participant interests, and preserves an employer's ability to respond to changing economic conditions.","Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Monahan, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Walter F Mondale Hall,229 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",monahan@umn.edu,,,,,,,3,33,38,0,2,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

However, this paper shows that in an intergenerational framework, these policies can raise social mobility only for some investment situations but not in general. I also study the impact of both policies on the aggregate skill ratio and inequality. While redistributive taxation can raise social mobility but at the same time never reduces inequality, education subsidies can, under some conditions, achieve both simultaneously. Unfortunately, these conditions necessarily require a population in which the skill ratio is already quite high. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Spangenberg, JH",,,,"Spangenberg, Joachim H.",,,World civilisations at crossroads: Towards an expansionist or a sustainable future-Lessons from history,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Like may periods of the past, the future will be characterised by resource scarcities, with limited pollution sink capacities constituting a new constraint. The strategic choices discussed in the West today resemble quite closely the strategies developed in Europe during past centuries to deal with resource scarcities: to overcome them by means of market mechanisms leading to efficiency improvements and substitution, by global trade enhancing resource availability, or by forcefully seizing foreign resources. In order to learn lessons for the future, these strategies are discussed regarding their past performance and their present applicability. They face severe limits regarding their problem solving capabilities, either because they are structurally unsuitable as a response to global economic and environmental scarcity problems, or their success is too questionable to rely on it. Consequently, another strategy is needed to adapt human economies and societies to the limits of Planet Earth. Sustainable development is such a strategy, developed in Europe in the 18th century to deal with absolute scarcities; its roots help to understand its current relevance. In a globally interconnected world it cannot be operationalised top-down, but is dependent on cooperation to become effective. Sustainability strategies cannot be designed as one-size-fits-all solutions, but are civilisation specific. This in turn requires an international institutional framework based on the subsidiarity principle (the imperative to take decisions at the lowest effective level), requiring the acceptance of political and cultural diversity of the current and future world society. It encourages different civilisation specific development objectives and trajectories, however with all actors contributing in their own ways to the achievement of agreed common goals like combating climate change, preserving biodiversity or eradicating poverty, following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.

Recent interest in producing energy from wood has raised questions about how a vibrant wood-energy market will impact the traditional southern wood supply chain. By using a survey of consulting foresters, this study examined how harvest tract size, forest ownership, and forest industry structure have changed within the U.S. South and how foresters expect the wood-energy market to impact the wood supply chain in the future. Results indicate that there are currently inadequate markets for timber as a result of expanded timber supply and reduced forest products industry capacity. Only 12% of respondents reported having sold timber to an energy facility, although 98% of respondents report their clients are willing to sell to an energy facility. In addition, 89% of respondents believe that a vibrant wood-energy market will provide an additional market for timber and will not displace forest products industry capacity. This study found excess logging capacity as evidenced by frequent mill quotas; however, an aging logging workforce and tight credit markets make logging capacity uncertain in the long term as the U.S. economy rebounds from recession and wood-energy demand increases. The percentage of respondents reporting an average harvest tract size over 16 ha (40 ac) decreased from 95% in 1999, to 70% in 2009, and only 47% predict an average harvest tract size over 16 ha (40 ac) in 2019. This study suggests that the southern wood supply chain is in position to take advantage of an expanded wood-energy market; however, decreasing harvest tract sizes, increasing urbanization, and a decline in the forest products industry are lingering issues for landowners, mills, foresters, and loggers in the South.

Employing multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling, which allows for potential spillovers and asymmetries in the variance covariance structure for the market returns, the paper investigates the volatility interactions among each of the three futures-spot market systems. For all market systems under study, the volatility spillovers are found to be important and bidirectional. For the stock index market system, in line with the previous literature, volatility shows asymmetric behavior and strong asymmetric shock transmission.

Guidance counselors credit the improvements to greater AP access, changes in social norms towards APs, and better student information.","Cornell Univ, ILR Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Jackson, CK (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, ILR Sch, 345 Ives Hall E, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ckj5@cornell.edu,,,,,,,36,78,121,0,14,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

We collected 72 monthly summaries of diabetes prescriptions from all hospitals in Taiwan. Hospital-level pharmaceutical concentration was measured by penetration of TZD, defined as monthly market share of TZD in each hospital. Concentration of diabetes drugs was measured by Herfindahl-Hirschman indices. We found a negative association (coefficient = -0.3610) between TZD penetration and concentration of diabetes drug but a positive association between penetration of TZD and the volume of prescribed diabetes drugs (coefficient = 0.4088). In conclusion, hospital characteristics and volume of services determined the concentration of pharmaceuticals at the institution level, reflecting the heterogeneous competition between pharmaceutical companies within each hospital.

We first argue that the entrepreneur exists in a much broader institutional context than current economic models of entrepreneurship consider. We then develop a definition of entrepreneurship as a special case of foresight we argue that entrepreneurs are individuals who enact a unique vision of the future, and show how this view of entrepreneurial action leads to a new view of the basis of competitive advantage for startup firms. We then use this definition of entrepreneurship and the expanded view of institutional context to develop a model of entrepreneurial policies that takes the state of economic development and the unique historical context of the country into account.

First, we find that leverage plays a dual role: whereas it negatively affects the value of firms with growth opportunities (i.e., underinvestment theory), it positively affects the value of firms without growth opportunities (i.e., overinvestment theory). Second, we find that dividends play a disciplinary role in firms with fewer growth opportunities by reducing free cash flow under managerial control. Finally, the results show that ownership structure has a nonlinear effect-that is, ownership concentration initially improves the value of most firms. However, after a certain threshold, in firms with growth opportunities, the risk increases that large shareholders expropriate wealth at the expense of minority shareholders.","[Lopez Iturriaga, Felix J.] Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Iturriaga, FJL (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain.",flopez@eco.uva.es; vlc@ufc.br,"Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J./F-5321-2012; Crisóstomo, Vicente Lima/D-1655-2015","Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J./0000-0003-0875-5283; Crisostomo, Vicente/0000-0002-8593-0471",,,,,66,45,49,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

When information is symmetric and freely available and agency is perfect, VBP is efficient and desirable. Because of substantial information asymmetries, medical insurance distortions, and the prescribing monopoly of physicians, VBP is rare for prescription drugs, though a number of countries have recently moved in this direction. Because the potential benefits can be sizable, it is high time for a review of actual VBP-based decision-making in practice. Sweden, with its pharmaceutical benefits board (TLV), was an early adopter of VBP decision-making. We illustrate actual decision-making, thus, using the case of Acomplia(A (R)) for the treatment of obesity in Sweden, with and without the presence of co-morbid conditions. This example has a number of features that will be useful in illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of VBP in actual practice, including multiple indications, a need for not just one but two economic simulation models, considerable sub-group analysis, and requirements for additional evidence development. TLV concluded, in 2006, that Acomplia was cost-effective for patients with a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 35 kg/m(2) and patients with a BMI exceeding 28 kg/m(2) and either dyslipidemia or type 2 diabetes. Because of uncertainty in some of the underlying assumptions, reimbursement was granted only until 31 December 2008, at which time the manufacturer would be required to submit additional documentation of the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness in order to obtain continued reimbursement. Deciding on reimbursement coverage for pharmaceutical products is difficult. Ex ante VBP assessment is a form of risk sharing, which has been used by TLV to speed up reimbursement and dispersion of effective new drugs despite uncertainty in their true cost-effectiveness. Manufacturers are often asked in return to generate additional health economic evidence that will establish cost-effectiveness as part of ex post review. The alternative is to delay the reimbursement approval until satisfactory evidence is available.","[Persson, Ulf; Willis, Michael; Odegaard, Knut] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, S-22002 Lund, Sweden",,"Persson, U (通讯作者)，Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Box 2127, S-22002 Lund, Sweden.",up@ihe.se; ok@ihe.se,,"Willis, Michael/0000-0002-6565-7025",,,,,30,31,32,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Many governments have realized that a single-issue focus is often insufficient in dealing with emerging threats and opportunities. They have therefore started to experiment with strategic foresight that deliberately cuts across the traditional boundaries of policy areas and government departments. This article reviews the foresight activities of three countries that have been at the forefront of this trend: the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the Netherlands. To this end, the article discusses the concept of strategic foresight and explains the two distinct ways in which it contributes to public policy-making: on the one hand, it informs policy by providing more systematic knowledge about relevant trends and developments in an organization's environments; on the other hand, it acts as a driver of reflexive mutual social learning processes among policy-makers that stimulate the generation of common public policy visions. The article concludes by drawing lessons with regard to the key success factors allowing strategic foresight to make an effective contribution to public policy-making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by rituximab treatment of RA is compared to TNF-inhibitor change (standard sequence) in a Markov-model (perspective: health care payer, full life-time approach). Direct cost components taken into account were treatment costs (medication-, administration-and monitoring costs) and resource utilisation (outpatient costs, inpatient costs). Indirect costs were estimated separately by the assessment of impaired work capacity due to RA (2008 Euro currency, discount rate 3.5%). Utility measures for the different treatment options were obtained from the ACR-response rates of published pivotal clinical trials. Results Direct costs amount to (sic) 178,373 (standard sequence) and (sic) 192,295 (rituximab sequence), respectively, rendering incremental direct costs of (sic) 13,922. Incremental utilities yield 0.57 QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness-ratio (ICER) of rituximab compared to the standard sequence amounts to (sic) 24,517. Inclusion of indirect costs leads to less incremental costs and a lower ICER of (sic) 15,565/QALY. Thus, ICERs stay beneath the accepted threshold of (sic) 50,000/QALY. Conclusion Rituximab appears to be a cost-effective treatment alternative compared to the switch between TNF-inhibitors as second line biological treatment in patients with active RA having failed etanercept.","[Merkesdal, Sonja; Kirchhoff, Timm] Hannover Med Sch, Div Clin Immunol & Rheumatol, Working Grp Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Wolka, Diane; Ladinek, Gunter] Roche Pharma, Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany; [Kielhorn, Adrian] Hoffmann La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Rubbert-Roth, Andrea] Univ Cologne, Div Internal Med 1, Cologne, Germany",Hannover Medical School; Roche Holding; Roche Holding; University of Cologne,"Merkesdal, S (通讯作者)，Hannover Med Sch, Div Clin Immunol & Rheumatol, Working Grp Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Carl Neuberg Str 1,OE 6830, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.",merkesdal.sonja@mh-hannover.de,,,,,,,39,30,31,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This article uses data from 400 seafood eating Floridians to determine awareness of reported substitution, effects on consumption, and willingness to pay (WTP) for a product integrity labeling program. Using a novel frequency-based polychotomous choice (PC) contingent valuation format, designed for products that are purchased often, WTP is estimated based on level of commitment to the product integrity labeling program. Sixty-two percent of respondents were aware of the reported substitution, 57% of those changed their seafood consumption, and respondents were willing to pay an average premium of $0.83 to $3.18 for grouper entrees at restaurants with a product integrity label. The factors that helped to explain the change in consumption and WTP were identified and can be used to help improve current labeling and marketing efforts.","[Ropicki, Andrew J.; Larkin, Sherry L.; Adams, Charles M.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ropicki, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",aropicki@ufl.edu; slarkin@ufl.edu; cmadams@ufl.edu,,"Larkin, Sherry/0000-0002-8850-0856; Ropicki, Andrew/0000-0002-9275-1463",,,,,34,20,23,0,18,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

There is a risk that the introduction of ill-designed tax not only fails to reach the intended environmental goals, but also cause different costs for the society. Distributional effects of environmental taxes could be an important threat, causing the welfare loss for people with the lowest incomes. One possible solution is to implement a comprehensive ecological tax reform providing double dividend - reaching environmental goals and stimulating the economy. Conclusions of polish researchers on the possibility of implementing the principles of ecological tax reform are moderate positive. The reform can provide a greater opportunity to integrate environmental objectives in the state tax system, thereby creating a basis for sustainable development.","[Telega, Ivan] Uniwersytet Ekon, Katedra Polityki Przemyslowej & Ekologicznej, Krakowie, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Telega, I (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon, Katedra Polityki Przemyslowej & Ekologicznej, Krakowie, Poland.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-5396,,978-83-88421-65-5,ORG KOMER NIEKOMER,,,2010,,,,,,,333,344,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4NK,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000371969900028,0

In the model, an increase in the energy price from NOK 0.50/kWh (0.06Euro/kWh) to NOK 0.70/kWh by the year 2015 reduces production by 12% for particleboard and by 4% for pulp (mainly sulphate), whereas the production of fibreboard was unaffected. The pulp and paper industries in Norway are mainly relying on spruce pulpwood, which is only partly affected by increased bioenergy prices. In the sawmill industries, the negative impact of higher energy prices (input of electricity) is compensated by higher prices received for chips, sawdust and bark. The production of pine sawnwood (accounting for about 31% of the sawnwood production in Norway) increased by 3% by 2015 when the energy price increased from NOK 0.50 to 0.70NOK per kWh, whereas the production of spruce sawnwood (accounting for 69% of the sawnwood production) decreased by 0.4%.

J,"Coates, JF",,,,"Coates, Joseph F.",,,"Risks and threats to civilization, humankind, and the earth",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper is a brief look at a wide range of risks that are said to present great threats to humankind. It was stimulated by several interacting factors. First, too many books and articles about astrophysical catastrophes, in the scientific and semi-scientific press, give relatively little attention to their timeframe or the measures to anticipate and prepare for them. Second, and most important, is that the overblown effects of 9/11 have distorted the United States of America's perspective and agenda on catastrophes. The result is that billions of dollars have been wasted and attention turned away from threats that could be truly catastrophic for the United States and, in many cases, for the rest of the world. Third, are books that have become popular by raising the threat that what will happen to us will be similar to what happened to earlier societies such as the Maya and the Easter Islanders. Most notably among these is Jared Diamond's Collapse [Jared Diamond, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Penguin Group, 2005]. The failure in these doomsday arguments is to overlook the greater sophistication, knowledge, awareness, monitoring and preparation currently in the United States and in other parts of the globe. The institutional structure and scientific knowledge today would either prevent or deal with the kind of socio-economic decline anticipated by the collapse arguments. In contrast several geophysical and celestial risks do imply global catastrophe. The value of this paper is as broad background to the specific scenario papers that follow. While it leans heavily on the work of others, it offers three new features for the analysis of any extreme risk. First is a scale of devastation, based on deaths. Second is a comprehensive time frame-now to the end of the Earth. Third is an outline of general questions that must be addressed for any risk, however large or small, if it is to provide insight into policy choices and promote systemic thinking.

We use exclusive and not publicly available data to investigate the link between scenario planning and firm performance from a qualitative perspective. The focus was primarily on firms that had real-life experiences with this strategic tool. Our research suggests that scenario planning is interwoven in how strategy is formulated and that it has a major influence on decisions taken by management. We also found that none of the firms reported formal efforts of assessing the success rate of scenario planning. Participants report that this is due to difficulties in measuring qualitative and quantitative outcomes and because standardized assessment tools are not readily available for this kind of strategic intervention. Overall, participants generally regarded scenario planning as an effective intervention with a positive contribution to the firms' performance. When pressed for more detail, participants revealed that scenario planning techniques were useful in exploring the business environment and future risks, isolating trends, understanding interdependent forces, and considering the implications of strategic decision-making.

Second, we estimate an equilibrium error correction model of inflation, deploying, among other variables of interest, the long-run solutions derived in the first step. The derived model of inflation suggests that inflation inertia and Croatian trading partners' inflation are most important for explaining the short-run behavior of inflation. Apart from these two variables, markup, excess money, output gap, nominal exchange rate, and broad money also contribute to inflation changes in the short run.","[Vizek, Maruska; Broz, Tanja] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Vizek, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",mvizek@eizg.hr; tbroz@eizg.hr,"Broz, Tanja/R-6554-2019",,,,,,12,8,10,0,11,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Rothstein (2008, 2010) shows that typical value-added models indicate large counterfactual effects of fifth-grade teachers on students' fourth-grade learning, indicating that classroom assignments are far from random. This article quantifies the resulting biases in estimates of fifth-grade teachers' causal effects from several value-added models, under varying assumptions about the assignment process. If assignments are assumed to depend only on observables, the most commonly used specifications are subject to important bias, but other feasible specifications are nearly free of bias. I also consider the case in which assignments depend on unobserved variables. I use the across-classroom variance of observables to calibrate several models of the sorting process. Results indicate that even the best feasible value-added models may be substantially biased, with the magnitude of the bias depending on the amount of information available for use in classroom assignments.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Rothstein, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, 2607 Hearst Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rothstein@berkeley.edu,,"Rothstein, Jesse/0000-0001-6140-0858",,,,,23,154,256,0,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

At the saute time, it is critical to set out a proper institutional arrangement to ensure that regional service liberalization initiatives reinforce the global service regime.

Building on the varieties of capitalism (VoC) school, this paper points out three distinct shortcomings of this literature: first, the VoC approach does not fully account for the variation of skill regimes in coordinated market economies (CMEs); second, the VoC approach underestimates the importance of authoritative certification in determining the real portability of vocational skills; and third, the complementarities between skill formation and social policies are different from what is expected in the VoC contributions. I argue that the variation of skill regimes in CMEs covers not one, but two separate dimensions: firms' involvement in skill formation and the vocational specificity of the Education system. On the basis of three case studies, I demonstrate the existence of three distinct skill regimes in CMEs: the segmentalist (firm-based) skill regime of Japan, the integrationist (school-based occupational) skill regime of Sweden and the differentiated (workplace-based occupational) skill regime of Germany.","Max Planck Inst Study Societies, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Busemeyer, MR (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Societies, Cologne, Germany.",busemeyer@mpifg.de,"Busemeyer, Marius R./Q-6951-2016","Busemeyer, Marius R./0000-0003-4085-1689",,,,,101,88,97,2,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Evidence from Indonesia,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Program evaluation; Scholarships; Education policy,,"This paper evaluates the role played by Indonesia's Social Safety Net Scholarships Program in reducing school drop-out rates during the Asian financial crisis. The expectation was that many families would find it difficult to keep their children in school and drop-out rates would be high. The scholarships are found to have been effective in reducing drop-outs at the level of schooling at which students were historically most at the risk of dropping out-lower secondary school. At this level drop-outs were reduced by about 3.0% points (or 38%) and costs were recovered. Given its success, the program can be viewed as a model to be followed by other countries that find themselves in a similar situation of crisis. How well the program adhered to its documented targeting design and how effective this design was in reaching the poor is also examined. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This process of 'de-institutionalisation' is surprising in view of widely accepted theories of institutional stability and 'path dependency'. The process is investigated in this paper along the four dimensions of the policy arrangement approach: discourse, power, rules and actors. It is argued that a discursive shift, moving the focus from production forest to 'forest as part of nature' and fuelled by a number of underlying factors, lies at the heart of the process. In concordance with this shift, advocates of timber autarky lost power in favour of 'nature advocates'. A more diverse set of actors became involved in forest policy, also reflecting a more general trend in Dutch politics towards greater openness and the erosion of neo-corporatist rules. Thus, changes in all four dimensions of the policy arrangement worked into one direction. This may explain the unusually quick and radical 'de-institutionalisation' of Dutch forest policy.

In this paper, we build upon existing literature, especially the literature that uses the experience of teenagers who had a miscarriage as the appropriate comparison group. We show that miscarriages are not random events, but rather are likely, correlated with (unobserved) community-level factors, casting some doubt on previous findings. Including community-level fixed effects in our specifications lead to important changes in our estimates, By making use of information on the timing of miscarriages as well as birth control choices preceding the teenage pregnancies we construct more relevant control groups for teenage mothers. We find evidence that teenage childbearing likely reduces the probability of receiving a high school diploma by 5 to 10 percentage points, reduces annual income as a young adult by $1,000 to $2,400, and may increase the probability of receiving cash assistance and decrease years of schooling.","[Fletcher, Jason M.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Wolfe, Barbara L.] Univ Wisconsin, Inst Res Poverty, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Yale University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Fletcher, JM (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,"Wolfe, Barbara/0000-0002-8803-9019",,,,,20,111,138,1,21,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

States can play varied roles in the provision of teacher education and professional development. This policy brief summarizes states' policy approaches to teacher professional development and education throughout teachers' careers. It explores what states are currently doing in the realms of pre-service education, induction and mentoring, ongoing professional development, and teacher evaluation, as well as the existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of such policies. We find that states play disparate roles in the provision of teacher education and professional development that fall along the regulatory spectrum from highly prescriptive to rather laissez-faire. Research on the effects of such policies is still in the early stages, and more attention is needed to determine the effectiveness of states' professional development policies.","[Strunk, Katharine O.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Educ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Loeb, Susanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Miller, Luke C.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Stanford University; Urban Institute,"Strunk, KO (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Sch Educ, 1 Shields Ave,2069 Acad Surge Bldg, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sloeb@stanford.edu; lmiller@urban.org; kostrunk@ucdavis.edu,,"Loeb, Susanna/0000-0003-1854-8843",,,,,17,12,33,2,26,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This paper develops an approach to institutional change more extended than the one provided in Hall and Soskice (in Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage, oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001) but congruent with its varieties-of-capitalism perspective. It begins by outlining an approach to institutional stability, which suggests that the persistence of institutions depends not only on their aggregate welfare effects but also on the distributive benefits that they provide to the underlying social or political coalitions; and not only on the Pareto-optimal quality of such equilibria but also on continuous processes of mobilization through which the actors test the limits of the existing institutions. It then develops an analysis of institutional change that emphasizes the ways in which defection, reinterpretation and reform emerge out of such contestation and assesses the accuracy of this account against recent developments in the political economies of Europe. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this perspective for contemporary analyses of liberalization in the political economy.","[Hall, Peter A.] Harvard Univ, Minda de Gunzburg Ctr European Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Thelen, Kathleen] Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL USA",Harvard University; Northwestern University,"Hall, PA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Minda de Gunzburg Ctr European Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",phall@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,98,467,529,4,225,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Not only did the Panel have to take a stand on the limits of science, or technocratic regulatory controls, to protect against objective risk, but in this regard faced more complex issues than ever addressed before by an adjudicating body. The dispute also concerned an extremely charged political issue, partly because of inherent ethical sensitivities with regard to foodstuffs, partly due to public skepticism about the role of science, and partly due to a common public perception of the complaint as being driven by the interests of an untrustworthy industry. Because of these and other challenges, the Panel faced an almost impossible task. This paper discusses how the Panel addressed some of these issues. The recently (after our report was drafted) decided appeal in EC-Hormones Suspension is likely to reduce the significance for WTO jurisprudence of some of the Panel's findings in EC-Biotech, given the apparently different approach of the AB to fundamental interpretative issues under SPS concerning the meaning of risk assessment and precaution.","[Howse, Robert L.] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Horn, Henrik] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Horn, Henrik] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England",New York University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Howse, RL (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,15,17,20,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2009,8.0,1,,,,,49,83,,10.1017/S147474560800414X,0.0,,,35,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,426GN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264696100007,0

One example of how such co-operation can be organised is 'Partnership Alnarp', an organisation of representatives of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and member companies or organisations within the industry. The structure of research, higher and professional education and advisory services has been described as constituting the Agricultural Knowledge System (AKS), when applied to agriculture as a whole. The scope of this paper is to describe and discuss the Triple Helix Concept of co-operation between academia, industry and government, the changes in the Agricultural Knowledge System (AKS) of research, higher and professional education and advisory services, and the organisation of collaboration between the university (SLU) and the industry in Partnership Alnarp. Some experiences of this co-operation from the member, academic and student point of view, with results from a recently made evaluation of this partnership are presented. Results show that the partner companies and organisations were very content with the collaboration, as were the academics and students who participated in Partnership Alnarp. Firms and organisations tend to favour applied and short term research over a more basic one. This should initiate serious discussions about the role of science. Collaboration between students and firms is highly appreciated by both parties and may lead to higher employability of the students. Networking, closeness and personal relations play a crucial role in the success. The project so far can be described as a success story, a generator of growth and a brand creator for Alnarp.","[Larsson, J.; Ekelund, L.; Carlsson, M.] SLU Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Larsson, J (通讯作者)，SLU Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Box 88, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,55,64,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.831.6,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700006,0

The aim of this paper is to analyze the trade flows between this two area's countries using some different panel data estimation methods like as Fixed Effect Model (FEM, Random Effect Model (REM, Hausman-Taylor (HT) and Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). Using HT method to estimate our gravity model, we get unbiased and efficient parameters estimation, even when a correlation exists between the explanatory variables and the specific unobservable characteristics of each individual.

It is generally accepted that countries with large trade volumes will use the DSU more than smaller economies. It stands to reason that developed countries would also be faster to participate in dispute settlement processes after acceding to the WTO Agreement. This article shows that economic development status does not explain the speed at which members engage in dispute settlement following accession. In fact, there is less uniformity in the pace at which members undertake dispute settlement than might be expected given the global divisions of wealth, access to information and availability of legal talent.","[Froese, Marc D.] Canadian Univ Coll, Dept Hist & Polit Sci, Lacombe, AB, Canada; [Froese, Marc D.] Canadian Univ Coll, Int Studies Program, Lacombe, AB, Canada",,"Froese, MD (通讯作者)，Canadian Univ Coll, Dept Hist & Polit Sci, Lacombe, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The paper describes a special kind of scenario methodology to build a future model for city development as a planning tool in facilitating a sustainable society. Backcasting in futures studies is widely discussed together with the comparison of three selected backcasting approaches, including Robinson's approach, The Natural Step Framework, and the Sustainable Technology Development approach. The purposes of this paper are to examine and discuss the use of the backcasting method within the Project Goteborg 2050, lessons learned and findings drawn from the experience.

This trend is further reinforced in 2010/2011 by the fact that despite the fears and turbulences that spread all over the world in reason of the global economic and financial crisis, SWFs have blatantly retained their influence. SWFs create a regulatory and theoretical challenge because they serve two masters with very different agendas. This article is the first to explore the challenges governments face when they wish to set up an SWF. It explores determinants and policy options governments have to set up an SWF by analysing the fiscal and monetary parameters while simultaneously focusing on the regulatory determinants funds may and should comply with in order to be better accepted as international investors. The challenges are important since SWF are expected to grow in the future and might emerge as decisive investors throughout a world in crisis.","[Chaisse, Julien] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Ctr Financial Regulat & Econ Dev, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chakraborty, Debashis; Mukherjee, Jaydeep] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, New Delhi, India",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Chaisse, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Ctr Financial Regulat & Econ Dev, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",julien.chaisse@cuhk.edu.hk; debchakra@gmail.com; jaydeepm74@gmail.com,"Chaisse, Julien/AAU-4113-2020; Mukherjee, Jaydeep/JDW-6996-2023; Chakraborty, Debashis/AAU-1399-2020","Chaisse, Julien/0000-0001-8793-0590; Mukherjee, Jaydeep/0009-0006-4724-7694;",,,,,44,12,12,0,18,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

However, so far only few studies have made an effort to quantify the income elasticity of school enrolment, in particular in the Sub-Saharan African context. The empirical problem in identifying the causal impact of income on enrolment is to control for parental ability, which is largely unobserved, and to deal with reverse causality and measurement error. This paper uses for identification a natural experiment in Burkina Faso, a country with particularly low enrolment rates. The results show that naive estimates largely underestimate the true income elasticity of school enrolment. The results can provide a basis for safety net policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research has found that the trade relationship between the two states in a dispute iufluences the potential potency of retaliatory threats. This analysis builds off of previous studies and hypothesizes that membership in a Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) will increase a state's bargaining position and its success in the dispute process. A probit regression is used to test this hypothesis. Fifty-seven dispute settlement cases from 1995-1998 are included in the analysis. The results indicate that RTA membership does increase a state's likelihood of success in the WTO dispute settlement process, but only for the complainant state in the dispute.",,,"Jacobs, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",jacobsm3@unr.nevada.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper shows that the impact of finance on exports depends not only on the extent to which the sector relies on external finance but also on the financial channels available. With a data set of 27 sectors from over 120 countries, I find that financial access and efficiency variables-particularly the geographic penetration of bank branches and the business loan application processes-significantly impact exports.

The first is to test for the presence of size and book-to-market value effects in the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). Such effects have been found in the U.S. stock market and in many other developed stock markets. The authors demonstrate that size and value do explain the expected return/cost of capital in eastern Europe. From this result they proceed by constructing regional size and book-to-market portfolios for a combined Visegrad market. Returns on these portfolios serve as factors in addition to the market portfolio. The second objective is constructing a model for the cost of capital. The regional three-factor model outperforms country-specific versions of the model, and it can be estimated for a more current sample in Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, and Bratislava. Therefore, it is a plausible model for the cost of capital in this region, and it is used to calculate the cost of capital for the following industries: banks; capital goods; food, beverage, and tobacco; materials; and utilities.","[Borys, Magdalena Morgese; Zemcik, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ CERGI EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Borys, Magdalena Morgese; Zemcik, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Borys, MM (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ CERGI EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",magdalena.borys@cerge-ei.cz; petr.zemcik@cerge-ei.cz,"Zemcik, Petr/H-2928-2014",,,,,,42,10,10,0,18,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We assess the different impacts on timber harvesting of the forest legal framework as compared to the adoption of forest certification, on the ten Forest Management Unit (FMUs) that had received a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification by mid-2009, and discuss some differences between legal and certified timber. Results show that the average reduction in the annual allowable cut (AAC) of concerned FMUs is about 11% when legal harvesting rules are adopted, about 18% when the FSC rules as requested by the certifying bodies (CBs) are applied, and about 34% when the 'FSC logic of sustainable harvesting', as agreed upon on paper by logging companies and CBs, is used. Our findings confirm that forest certification has the potential to improve weak normative frameworks that allow the unsustainable use of forests. However, they also suggest that certifying bodies tend to reduce the stringency of the FSC rules in certified FMUs if not backed by a uniform FSC standard and by a stronger legal framework.

In recent years, this sector has had to tackle far-reaching changes taking place in the social, economic and political system. New demands are now being addressed and policies reformulated. As a response to this pressure, new decision-making structures and innovation activities are taking place in the forestry sector. The aim of this paper is to study learning processes on the management level of forest enterprises. We focus on the production of new ecosystem goods and services; a result of such learning and adaptation processes during the last ten years. The main questions we ask are: How did forest enterprises react to the different changes with respect to their products and services? What are the driving forces and causes for learning and adaptation? In order to operationalise this research aim, we conducted a case study analysis among 6 forest owners in Switzerland between 1995 and 2005. We identified the production of new ecosystem goods and services mainly in the category of cultural services. As we expected, the most important impulse for these adaptation activities was the decrease of returns from traditional timber production. However, other explanatory factors such as external contacts and innovation strategies also seemed to play a similar role. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The method follows Card and Krueger (1992) and Heckman et al. (1996), but I extend their analysis in two ways. First, I correct state-level returns to schooling for selective migration, adapting a method from Dahl (2002). Second, I use more recent data and assess the degree to which the 1999 labor market capitalized school inputs (with 2000 Census data). Higher state-level school inputs are associated with higher returns to schooling after correcting for selective migration. These positive effects are present in all Census years I study.

However, it is also recognised that visually appealing landscapes may not be ecologically healthy and these differences may cause tensions as indirect ecosystem services become an increasingly important focus for forest management. This study used a questionnaire survey to investigate the extent to which public preferences for characteristics such as forest cover and stand structure varied when framed in terms of attractiveness or good management objectives. The research took place in northern Portugal and also examined the implications of using verbal prompts or visual stimuli (e.g. photographs) as means of eliciting preferences. Key results from the study were: 1) public preferences regarding forest cover and stand structure do not, in general, differ under attractiveness and management criteria, 2) there were statistically significant differences in preferences for forest cover and stand structure amongst user groups 3) because ground cover vegetation was not regarded as attractive or good then strategies for future whole catchment management may face some tension, and 4) there were some inconsistencies identified in the preferences derived from verbal prompts and visual stimuli. By contrasting preferences for attractiveness and management criteria the research presents a simple quantitative approach that provides a basis for interventions through design or knowledge exchange to help align aesthetic and ecological goals. However, it also suggests that research approaches able to provide a deeper engagement with the public regarding the indirect ecosystem services from forests via qualitative approaches such as focus groups and incentive mechanisms are likely to be important.

This study uses individual-level data for several OECD countries to examine how men's participation in home production can explain the positive relationship between fertility and women's labor force participation at the cross-country level. It finds that women living in countries where men participate more in home production are better able to combine having children with market work, leading to greater participation in the labor force at relatively high fertility levels. Within each country however, women with higher relative wages continue to have lower fertility and to participate more in the labor force than lower-paid women due to the higher opportunity cost of remaining at home. This finding on men's home production can thus explain the positive cross-country correlation between female labor force participation and fertility.","[de Laat, Joost] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [de Laat, Joost] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [de Laat, Joost] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Sevilla-Sanz, Almudena] Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC USA; [Sevilla-Sanz, Almudena] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",The World Bank; Harvard University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Congressional Budget Office; University of Essex,"Laat, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,48,27,32,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This labeling requirement, followed shortly thereafter by similar requirements in other states, received extensive media coverage. The primary objective of this study was to consider, within the context of a complete demand system, the impact of mandatory warning labels and associated media attention on the demand for the product subject to regulation and media attention (i.e., Gulf product) as well as substitute products. Results indicate that warning labels lowered the demand for oysters originating from the Gulf and Chesapeake and increased demand for oysters originating from the Pacific and foreign sources.

Further, time-use information on job searches and household work provides insights into the interconnectedness of gender inequalities in the labor market and the household. An analysis of the time-use patterns of 10,465 working-age women and men in South Africa shows that a nontrivial proportion classified as either not in the labor force or unemployed actually engaged in subsistence, temporary, and casual forms of employment. This study finds that while women's and men's hours of unpaid work do not vary greatly across employment status, these obligations affect women's employment options and their ability to look for paid work.

While there is a growing body of work about the role of university research in informing forest policy, comparatively little attention has been paid to government science in forestry. This paper describes the characteristics of government science and explores how it informs forest policy using the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR), Canada, as a case study. A close and effective relationship was found between scientists and policy developers/analysts where the OMNR was legally required to engage in scientific research to inform the development of guidelines and associated evaluation processes. Other factors that contributed to an effective use of research in the development of policy included the active engagement of policy developers/analysts in the design of projects using policies as hypotheses within an adaptive forest management framework. While our results suggest that government science at the OMNR has effectively addressed many of the policy risks associated with forest management, it can also generate risks where government science challenges the strategic directions set by forest policy in response to societal values. Another associated risk is that publicly-funded research will result in irrelevant knowledge in the context of current policies. These risks are difficult to manage and can affect relationships. Nevertheless, the OMNR will need to continue taking calculated risks to effectively monitor the dynamic relationship between forests, policy and society into the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by our fieldwork, and using a spatial-temporal model, we focus on the paths of forest degradation and regeneration and villagers' utility before and after an access restriction is introduced. Our paper illustrates a number of key points for policy makers. First, the benefits of forest conservation tend to be greatest in the first few periods after an access restriction is introduced, after which the overall forest quality often declines. Second, villagers may displace their NTFP collection into more distant forests that may have been completely protected by distance alone before access to a closer forest was restricted. Third, permitting villagers to collect limited amounts of NTFPs for a fee, or alternatively fining villagers caught collecting illegally from the protected forest, and returning the fee or fine revenue to the villagers, can improve both forest quality and villagers' livelihoods.

The levels of technical, allocative, and cost efficiency are estimated using a nonparametric methodology and then regressed on a number of bank-specific, institutional, and EU-related factors. The findings indicate that foreign banks were more efficient than domestic private banks, although the gap between them narrowed over time. State-owned banks ranked last, but their privatization resulted in efficiency gains. Capitalization, liquidity, and enterprise restructuring enhanced bank efficiency, whereas banking reforms had an adverse effect. The Treaty of Accession and EU membership were associated with significant efficiency improvements.","[Tochkov, Kiril] Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Nenovsky, Nikolay] Univ Orleans STUDIUM, New Orleans, LA USA; [Nenovsky, Nikolay] ICER, Turin, Italy; [Tochkov, Kiril] Bulgarian Natl Bank, Sofia, Bulgaria",Texas Christian University,"Tochkov, K (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",k.tochkov@tcu.edu; nenovsky@gmail.com,"Tochkov, Kiril/F-1779-2017","Nenovsky, Nikolay/0000-0002-9544-9024; Tochkov, Kiril/0000-0001-8356-1310",,,,,38,20,20,0,22,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Starting initially with air cargo shipments, the development of reefer logistics in West Africa enabled the development of a fresh mango export industry. However, smallholder mango farmers in the more remote areas have benefited only marginally. On the initiative of a development organization, a farmers' union was established, aimed at directly exporting Fairtrade certified mangoes, bypassing existing traders and exporters. The trial was not successful as the right contractual agreements between farmers as principals and farmer union staff as agents were not present, leading to uneconomic behaviour by the agents. It became clear that traders and the way their contracts were arranged, played an essential role in quality control, organization of harvesters, transport and risk management, as well as the provision of credit. Based on this experience, an export company was established, working in close cooperation with farmers' groups, with access to its own packing house and able to contract efficient refrigerated logistics services. By involving the value chain actors in a triangular organization model including farmers, harvesting traders and exporters, it was possible to build on the strong points of each actor and to make the value chain more profitable and attractive for all actors. Moreover, the triangular organization was conducive in obtaining GlobalGAP, organic and Fairtrade certification. The experience with the triangular export organisation demonstrates some important lessons for the development of value chains in the transitional economies. It is important to study the way in which contractual relationships between value chain actors are regulated and to plan interventions with appropriate incentives stimulating behaviour that profits all actors.","[van der Waal, J.

First, whether the cost-of-carry model can describe the relationship between index futures prices and underlying stock indexes is examined. As anticipated, the cost of carry model cannot accurately predict the prices of these two index futures, because the two underlying Chinese stock markets display high price volatility. Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that different risk-free interest rate proxies have little effect on the mispricing of the cost-of-carry model. Next, this study compares the pricing performance of the cost-of-carry model and the Hemler-Longstaff (1991) model with stock market volatility. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating stock market volatility into pricing models appears beneficial for estimating prices on these two index futures. Furthermore, the component GARCH model improves the pricing performance of the Hemler-Longstaff model. Finally, the autocorrelation and regression results suggest high persistence in mispricings.","Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Wang, JC (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Money & Banking, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",janchung@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,11,11,2,18,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This study's replication partially supports their proposed relationships between three groups of movie signals and movie performance. The results suggest that overall movie quality signal (e.g., Best Picture Award) has a positive impact on sales revenue and consumer evaluation, respectively. Furthermore, both production budget and release days constantly enhance movies' success. The other two groups of movie quality signals, star performance (e.g., Best Actor Award, Best Actress Award, etc.) and peripheral quality of a movie (e.g., Best Original Score Award, Best Original Song Award, etc.) do not show significant impact on sales revenue and consumer evaluation, respectively.

The method involves developing and analyzing plausible narratives of the future and evaluating them for a range of implications. The power of scenarios lies in creating and considering compelling stories about the future. Thus, narrative, defined as an account of a series of events, is central to the process and plays a pivotal role in engaging participants in a scenario analysis exercise. While a good scenario story can engage individuals and influence their suspension of disbelief, we know little about how participants actually respond to the scenarios so they can, and will, suspend disbelief in scenario outcomes. We explored the role of narrative in suspension of disbelief in a scenario-based study of the long-term future of Canada's forests and forest sector. We discovered that specific aspects of the scenario narratives themselves influenced participants' suspension of disbelief. While interacting with the scenario narratives, participants actively worked to suspend disbelief by creating new narratives or accessing other existing ones, and by projecting themselves into the scenarios as characters in the stories. Our results may help scenario writers, practitioners, and researchers understand what, in one project, cued people's abilities to suspend disbelief and engage productively in discussions about possible futures.

Data is taken from the 2003 wave of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). There is socioeconomic-related inequality in mathematics achievement, favoring the higher socioeconomic groups in each country. There are important differences among countries. The inequality is higher in Germany, Greece, Great Britain, Belgium, and Portugal and is lower in Sweden and Finland. Socioeconomic factors represent between 14.9% and 34.6% of the overall inequality in education. The decomposition exercises add important insights for policy. Despite the differences. EU-15 member states can be categorized into two main groups. The first includes the Nordic countries plus Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Greece, where socioeconomic-related inequality appears to be explained mainly by the students' background characteristics. In Portugal and, to a lesser extent, in Spain the high contribution of socioeconomic background is mainly due to the prevalence of high socioeconomic inequality and socioeconomic concentration of educational resources. The second group includes Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and France. In these countries, the high impact of schools' composition on individual achievement is the main driver of the studied inequality. Differences between countries are also explored.

We consider an environmental policy that delegates the prices-versus-quantities decision to the firms by offering them the choice between an emissions tax and permit trading. Such an approach is currently used in Swiss climate policy. We provide a detailed characterization of the optimal policy and show that this approach reduces expected social costs compared to a pure tax or permit-trading regime. We demonstrate that an optimal allocation of firms to instruments can be achieved despite substantial informational constraints, and that all firms gain from the introduction of the instrument choice compared to optimally designed single-instrument policies. Furthermore, we discuss the conditions under which this approach is likely to be preferable to a hybrid regulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To parameterize the model, a new and rich dataset spanning 17 years of home sales in the seven-county Twin Cities area of Minnesota was assembled. Heterogeneity across types of open space and across households is shown to be a critical determinant of the welfare impacts of open space conservation. Our general equilibrium simulations allow housing prices to re-equilibrate in response to policy-induced demand shifts, demonstrating that as the scale of intervention becomes larger, general equilibrium and partial equilibrium welfare measures increasingly diverge.

This indispensably calls for strategic approaches based on visions and transdisciplinary creativity. Hence, this paper critically reviews the Leitbild concept, an idea on spatial planning which has been widely discussed in the German-speaking planning literature but which has received scant attention elsewhere. Although the term has been translated as a 'vision', this paper shows that the concept is far richer in its content than these casual translations suggest. The paper shows that it defines a particular paradigm for landscape planning that embodies a transdisciplinary approach in which lay-people and experts develop both goals and strategies for realising their joint visions. A systematic overview of the key characteristics that make up the Leitbild approach is provided and set in relation to already available approaches for decision makers. Although there are similarities between the Leitbild approach and other planning and decision-support tools, such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Strategic Impact Assessment (SEA) and Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA-sust), the paper shows that the particular combination of issues considered when developing a Leitbild makes it distinctive. Through an iterative process, the development of a Leitbild allows new approaches to spatial planning in which space and place can be considered as a social construct, and in which the values and understandings of local actors can be better represented.

Jurgen Habermas's discourse theory is used as a hermeneutic device to disentangle the types of 'orientations' (compromise, consensus, and mutual understanding) pertaining to DSS procedures. We show that these latter are oriented primarily to put the parties in a position to reach mutual understanding. Such an orientation is no mere idiosyncrasy of the DSS but is the only one consistently conducive to the WTO's general aims, in response to the various types of disputes that may arise between its Members.

This paper asks: how has the TPRM responded to demands from developing countries for information and transparency ? The paper uses a typology of information systems to explain the evolution of surveillance in the trade regime and asks whether the TPRM was assigned the functions of an ideal-type information system. The paper, then, evaluates the performance of the TPRM against its given mandate of increasing transparency to promote improved adherence with trade rules. It presents, for the first time, empirical evidence on the content of reports and the participation of countries, to highlight persisting content- and participation-related challenges. It discusses the capacity challenges within the WTO Secretariat and briefly outlines efforts made by developing countries to boost surveillance capacity at home. The paper ends by outlining priorities for monitoring in the trade regime: generating specific information that developing countries need, supporting domestic capacity for surveillance (including from non-official sources), and concentrating on improved peer review and follow-up procedures.","Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Ghosh, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",arunabhaghosh@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,33,37,2,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2010,9.0,3,,,,,419,455,,10.1017/S1474745610000261,0.0,,,37,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,629PC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280211100001,0

The Russian Law dates from 2001 when the current version of the IPPC ('1997 revision') was already in place but basically adopts the plant health principles of the previous version. Hence, some key provisions of the 1997 version that bring the IPPC in line with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) of World Trade Organization (WTO) are lacking. Overall, the Law is not an obstacle to trade in plants and plant products in itself, but the lack of details in such important matters as pest risk analysis (PRA) suggest that barriers could arise in the interpretation of the Law or in its application through (secondary) normative acts.","[Kireeva, Irina] NCTM OConnor, Brussels, Belgium; [Black, Robert] Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England",University of Greenwich,"Kireeva, I (通讯作者)，NCTM OConnor, Rue Spa 30, Brussels, Belgium.",i.kireeva@nctm.it; r.black@gre.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Because persons with private insurance were exempt from the copayments, this health-care reform can be regarded as a natural experiment. We used a difference-in-difference approach to examine whether the new copayment effectively reduced the overall demand for physician visits and to explore whether it acted as a deterrent to vulnerable groups, such as those with low income or chronic conditions. We found that there was no significant reduction in the number of physician visits among SHI members compared to our control group. At the same time, we did not observe a deterrent effect among vulnerable individuals. Thus, the copayment has failed to reduce the demand for physician visits. It is likely that this result is due to the design of the copayment scheme, as the copayment is low and is paid only for the first physician visit per quarter.","[Schreyoegg, Jonas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Sch Management, Dept Hlth Serv Management, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Schreyoegg, Jonas] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Grabka, Markus M.] DIW Berlin, German Socioecon Panel SOEP, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Grabka, Markus M.] Berlin Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Empir Econ, Berlin, Germany",University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Schreyögg, J (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Sch Management, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",schreyoegg@bwl.lmu.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161",,,,,27,41,48,3,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The scenario planner has to establish and manage a 'successful client relationship'-but what actually constitutes that for a scenario planning project? The client acts as the conduit between the scenario planner and the organization for which the scenario planning project is being undertaken. The 'client as conduit' implies several challenges for the scenario planner including: The client's awareness and understanding of scenario planning as a method for their organization to learn from the future [1]. The client's level of commitment to learning from the future. The size and context of the scenario planning project. The position of the client within a network of people and/or resources required to run a scenario planning project. The client's involvement or position within the scenario building team created in the project. The benefits and risks accruing to the client through the execution of the scenario planning project. The client organization's capacity to act strategically; its power to perform. This paper will explore, through storytelling, different pictures of client relationships associated with scenario planning. The stories are developed from a deep and extensive well of scenario practitioner and consulting experience over the last 15 years to explore and discuss these client issues, and how clients for scenario planning projects have evolved, and how they may enhance or restrict scenario planning projects in the future.

The empirical analysis is based on tests of whether government expenditure and revenue are cointegrated, considering the economic liberalization period of 1989-2008.

We have adopted a social practice perspective, which we base within an interpretative world view, to better understand how organisational foresight is enacted. This offers a reading of the phenomena, of which the essential contribution is that organisational foresight is more than an organisational property: it is something that reflective people do as they engage with various inputs from the outside and as a result of the continuous interaction between activity systems and their constituting elements. A longitudinal case study illustrates the importance of understanding the construction of collective and individual meaning in working with organisational foresight. The study shows how the inherent rigidity of the existing activity system and the weak ties between these diverse subsets of the organisation may block the interaction between emerging social practices and organisational intentions resulting in ongoing failures of understanding and enactment. A model is developed to include these parameters in an augmented activity systems model. Based on this we have identified the linking of organisational levels as one of the key dimensions to be considered for which the social practice perspective holds significant explanatory strength.

Mapping is one solution that is gaining popularity as it enables health state utility values to be predicted for use in cost per QALY analysis when no preference-based measure has been included in the study. This paper presents a systematic review of current practice in mapping between non-preference based measures and generic preference-based measures, addressing feasibility and validity, circumstances under which it should be considered and lessons for future mapping studies. This review found 30 studies reporting 119 different models. Performance of the mappings functions in terms of goodness-of-fit and prediction was variable and unable to be generalised across instruments. Where generic measures are not regarded as appropriate for a condition, mapping does not solve this problem. Most testing in the literature occurs at the individual level yet the main purpose of these functions is to predict mean values for subgroups of patients, hence more testing is required.","[Brazier, John E.; Yang, Yaling; Tsuchiya, Aki; Rowen, Donna Louise] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Brazier, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",j.e.brazier@sheffield.ac.uk; d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk,"Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",MRC [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MC_U145080960] Funding Source: Medline,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,48,368,386,0,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Using this property, we estimate the average labor supply elasticity to public school districts in Missouri. We leverage the plausibly exogenous variation in prenegotiated district salary schedules to instrument for actual salary. These estimates imply a labor supply elasticity of about 3.7, suggesting that school districts possess significant market power.

Districts that fail to meet their academic targets for 3 years must use their Title I funds to pay for supplemental education services (SES) that provide tutoring or other academic instruction. Many districts, including the Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS), have also adopted additional tutoring programs designed to help students reach proficiency goals. This paper examines student participation and achievement in two PPS tutoring programs-the NCLB-mandated SES program and a state-developed tutoring program.

The results indicate that the greater a woman's education level, the greater her labor participation; that older women participate more, though the rate of growth of this effect is decreasing; and the number of children that a woman has is negatively correlated to her decision to participate in the labor force. The article also examines machismo and other cultural values that influence female labor participation. The evidence suggests that the more the women have internalized machista and conservative cultural values, the less they participate in the labor market. Finally, the article concludes that the existence of these cultural factors as a group more than compensates for the positive effect of human capital variables and is statistically associated with low female labor participation in Chile.","[Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatas, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] UNDP, Santiago, Chile; [Plaza, Gonzalo] Interamer Dev Bank, Off Evaluat & Oversight, Washington, DC USA",Universidad de Chile; Inter-American Development Bank,"Contreras, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatas, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,25,85,106,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The quantitative variables taken into account are shaped using grey systems theory, while the qualitative variables are being transformed in quantitative ones by using some experts' opinion and by creating expertons. Expertons are in fact intervals built using the phi-fuzzy sub-set and the opinion of several experts over a certain problem.

For these companies we computed the provisions-to-liabilities ratio (PLR) and performed several group tests, according to the following original qualitative classification of national accounting cultures.

To encourage shift in exports from roundwood to value-added industrial products, Russia has set large tariffs on its roundwood exports, and announced that even higher ones would be introduced in the future. Using a global forest sector model, the EFI-GTM, we analyse how the Russian and global forest product markets will evolve towards 2020 under alternative tariff levels and assumptions on investment climate in Russia. Our results show that the tariffs decrease harvest and roundwood prices in Russia, but improve the speed of development in the Russian sawnwood and pulp industry. The results also suggest that policies which improve the investment climate in Russia are more vital than the tariffs for the Russian forest industry to develop favourably. Among the tariff settings considered, the prevailing one of 15(sic) per cubic meter with non-coniferous pulpwood exempted, seems most beneficial for Russia. With a tax of 50(sic) per cubic meter, its forest industry would not develop much stronger than in the 15(sic) case, but forestry would suffer from a drastic harvest decrease caused by a nearly complete stop in the Russian roundwood exports, and negligible tax income would be generated. Outside Russia, the main importers of Russian roundwood would experience significant wood price increases and decreased forest industry production. The decline in the forest industry output would be largest in Asia, due to scarce supply there of raw material substitutes for wood imported from Russia, whereas the highest relative increase in roundwood prices would take place in the EU.

However, their rates are too low, with the notable exception of the United States where high fertility among immigrants and unwed mothers contributes significantly. After documenting the situation, this article considers social responses to this problem, both moderate and radical, finding them less than satisfactory.

We design a system of tradeable fuel economy credits that allows trading across vehicle classes and manufacturers with and without considering market power in the credit market. We perform numerical simulations to measure the potential cost savings from moving from the current CAFE system to one with stricter standards, but that allows vehicle manufacturers various levels of increased flexibility. We find that the ability for each manufacturer to average credits between its cars and trucks provides a large percentage of the potential savings. As expected, the greatest savings come from the greatest flexibility in the credit system. Market power lowers the potential cost savings to the industry as a whole, but only modestly.

The environmental effectiveness of forest certification is oftentimes evaluated by indicators such as stringency of standards, degree of participation by key stakeholders, certified area, etc. In political science, forest certification as an NSMD governance arrangement is usually evaluated in terms of the quality of the decision-making procedures (input legitimacy) rather than for its problem solving capacity, i.e. its environmental performance or effectiveness. We conceptualize environmental effectiveness as a function of a standard's environmental stringency and the area covered by the standard, the latter dependent on the degree of social acceptance. Accordingly, the environmental effectiveness of different certification schemes ought to be evaluated taking both the standard stringency and the area certified into account. The forest certification process in Sweden illustrates how forestry history and regional differences affect the development, acceptance and adoption of different certification schemes. Industrial and Northern forestry owners favour the NGO led Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards whereas Southern small-scale private forest owners preferred to develop an alternative scheme the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). We demonstrate that there is a bifurcated geographical coverage of the two certification schemes along a north-south divide coupled with a similarity in standard stringency and a high degree of acceptance in their different areas of dominance. Both forest certification schemes display a similar degree of environmental effectiveness - but in different parts of the country and for different types of ownership. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mexico's social model has thus been reduced to a system that is almost exclusively concerned with protection for those living in extreme poverty.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Social Res, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Bayón, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Social Res, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",cristina.bayon@servidor.unam.mx,,"Bayon, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9123-9572",,,,,31,10,12,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

The manufacturing sector generates cross-border pollution which reduces cross-sectoral productivity of agricultural goods, and lowers local income. We derive a demand-reducing effect that discourages firms to move to the country with laxer environmental regulations, in the absence of any comparative advantage. Our analysis also demonstrates that manufacturing agglomeration forces can alleviate the pollution-haven effect: a pollution haven may not arise if environmental regulation is slightly more stringent in the larger country.

This is known as a test of scope, a measure of internal validity of the contingent valuation method (CVM). The scope test is conducted separately for White households and Hispanic households to determine if cultural differences influences whether the scope test is passed. The public program to reduce acres burned involved prescribed burning and a mechanical fuel reduction program. The results of CVM logit regressions show that the acreage reduction variable is statistically significant at the 1% level for the two proposed fuel reduction programs. and the two types of households. The positive sign of this variable means that the more acreage reduction proposed in the survey the more likely people would pay for the fuel reduction program. Because of the significance of the acreage reduction variable in the willingness to pay function, this function can be used to evaluate the incremental benefits of different forest fire management plans that reduce acres burned by wildfires. These benefits would be part of the justification for prescribed burning and mechanical fire fuel reduction programs to protect forests from wildfires. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We first develop a model of university behaviour which indicates how the decisions made by university officials Would be chosen in order to maximize their respective reputations. In doing so, we assume that reputation is enhanced by the quality of students produced, the caliber of research and the service provided to the community in terms of the provision of publicly funded education services. We argue that the relative weights placed on these intermediate outputs may vary by university type as well as the means of producing them. Using the results of the reputational survey - a ranking of the institution in terms of reputation - conducted as part of the Canadian magazine Maclean's overall ranking exercise, we then estimate an Error Correction-Ordered Probit Model of the rankings of Canadian universities to determine the factors that influence the change in reputation or prestige of the university as viewed by the external community. We find evidence that the change in reputation of a university is based on what might be considered the appropriate signals that one might use in estimating the respective quality of the institution given the respective differences in mission.

The SST approach seems especially promising in areas of technology where visions are manifold, societal interests conflicting, and applications and markets are non-existing or still under construction. The emerging high technology areas and several areas of more sustainable development like organic food production and renewable energy are examples of this kind, where techno-economic networks are unstable or under construction and social and environmental potentials and risks difficult, if not impossible to assess. The paper explores the potential of a social shaping of technology approach to technology foresight within such technology areas and presents the methodological aspects herein: structure versus contingency, actor-network approach, laboratory programmes, techno-economic networks, actor worlds, development arenas.

The article explains how the interrelationship between national and local welfare policies has been firstly established and subsequently evolved in a different manner in the two countries.","Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Scarpa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",scarpa.simone@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,12,12,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

A virtual experiment combines insights from virtual reality in computer science, naturalistic decision-making from psychology, and field experiments from economics. The environmental policy applications of interest to us are the valuation of wild fire management policies such as prescribed burn. The methodological objective of virtual experiments is to bridge the gap between the artefactual controls of laboratory experiments and the naturalistic domain of field experiments or direct field studies. This should provide tools for policy analysis that combine the inferential power of replicable experimental treatments with the natural look and feel of a field domain. We present data from an experiment comparing valuations elicited by virtual experiments to those elicited by instruments that have some of the characteristics of standard survey instruments, and conclude that responses in the former reflect beliefs that are closer to the truth.

We also present a relevant example regarding the EVA calculation and give a special attention of the way of calculation of the three main components of EVA: net operating profit after taxes, weighted average cost of capital and economic asset (or invested capital).

At the macro level, the paper analyzes whether trade and industrial liberalization in India led to an increase in subcontracted work, of the home-based variety. The results show a historically high share of women in home-based work, which implies that female participation in such work was more likely to be determined by their cultural milieu than by the recent liberalization process. Further, while the micro model of social determinants appears to fit the female home-based work equation, the macro model is found to be insignificant. The lower but increasing share of male home-based work and the statistical significance of the macro model as a determinant of such work lead us to conclude that the economic reforms in India had a statistically significant impact on this form of production organization among men.","[Rani, Uma] Int Labor Org, Int Inst Labor Studies, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Unni, Jeemol] Gujarat Inst Dev Res, Ahmadabad 380060, Gujarat, India",,"Rani, U (通讯作者)，Int Labor Org, Int Inst Labor Studies, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",ums_69@yahoo.com; jeemol_unni@yahoo.com,"UNNI, JEEMOL/AAC-6544-2019","UNNI, JEEMOL/0000-0003-0391-7781",,,,,45,10,11,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

However, because the first set of high stakes exams are taken in the UK at age 16, the reform affected the proportion with qualifications, as well as schooling length. In order to shed light on whether the returns reflect the extra length of schooling or the increase in qualifications, we exploit another institutional rule - the Easter Leaving Rule - which we argue only affected the probability of obtaining qualifications (and not the length of schooling). We find sizeable returns to academic qualifications - increasing the probability of employment by 40% points - and our results suggest that qualifications drive most of the returns to education.

But we do find anomalies in this pattern, particularly when the manager-employee match violates traditional racial hierarchies (for example, nonwhites managing whites).","[Giuliano, Laura] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Levine, David I.; Leonard, Jonathan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Miami; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Giuliano, L (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,,,,,,,25,58,85,0,21,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

This approach allows us to examine the differences in rates of return to education both across and within groups. Similar to previous studies we find that on average blacks have higher returns to education than whites, natives have higher returns than immigrants and younger workers have higher returns than older workers. Contrary to previous studies we find that the average gap of the rate of return between white and black workers is larger than previously thought and the gap is smaller between immigrants and natives. We also uncover significant heterogeneity, the extent of which differs both across and within groups.

Prolonged drinking of such water risks development of diseases and therefore has implications for children's cognitive and psychological development. This study examines the effect of arsenic contamination of tubewells, the primary source of drinking water at home, on the learning outcome of school-going children in rural Bangladesh using recent nationally representative data on secondary school children. We unambiguously find a negative and statistically significant correlation between mathematics scores and arsenic-contaminated drinking tubewells at home, net of the child's socio-economic status, parental background and school specific unobserved correlates of learning. Similar correlations are found for an alternative measure of student achievement and subjective well-being (i.e. self-reported measure of life satisfaction), of the student.

This policy brief aims to fill this void by providing national and state-level statistics on participation rates, funding appropriations, and policies on gifted education. Sincemany of the operational details of these programs are determined by local education agencies, data on a nationally representative sample of schools are then used to provide information on gifted curricula, instructor training and experience, and the selection process for admission. Finally, a review of the research on gifted education is provided.

The provision seeks to prevent protectionist use of domestic policy instruments, requesting that when an imported product is sufficiently similar to a domestic product, they are treated identically. WTO adjudicators will often face severe informational problems in environmental disputes. Important for the practical implementation of NT is therefore the allocation of the burden of proof (BoP). This paper highlights basic implications of the BoP for the occurrence of judicial errors, for the environment and for welfare, using a setting where NT serves its intended role of supporting negotiated tariff liberalization. The paper suggests that NT may indeed constrain environmental policies, but that this may be desirable from an efficiency point of view. Also, BoP rules that benefit the environment may not benefit global welfare, and conversely. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The advantage of the valuation approach is that it permits the estimation of people's values for many potential goods, allows one to decompose people's values for a good into its sub-components, and permits the study of preference heterogeneity without distributional assumptions. We apply the method to an important and increasingly controversial topic: animal welfare. The method is used to determine people's preferences for eggs and pork produced from different production systems. Data from experiments conducted in three diverse U.S. locations (Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; and Wilmington, NC) indicates that people are, on average, willing to pay $0.95 more for a dozen eggs raised in an aviary, pasture system vs. a cage system, and are willing to pay $2.02 more for two-pounds of pork chops raised in a pasture system as opposed to a crate system.

On the one hand, an FTA may increase a country's AD activities to protect its domestic industries from the increased import flows from other parties. On the other hand, an FTA supposedly helps reduce the use of AD measures to accomplish the purpose of free trade. Which effects prevail can shed important lights on the question of whether an FTA can be a stumbling block or a building block. This article examines the effects of FTAs on AD activities based on comprehensive empirical analysis. Using longitudinal data of major AD user countries from 1995 to 2009, we found that there is clearly an inverse relationship between an FTA and AD activities. This finding represents the user's tendency to trigger less AD filings against FTA membership, regardless of facing more imports from FTA partners. This article also captured dynamic FTA effects based on a series of distribution of time dummies. The estimation results from the dynamic model show that the FTA enactment year clearly has significant effect, suggesting substantial reduction Of AD investigations in that year.","[Ahn, Dukgeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Shin, Wonkyu] Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Int Commerce & Finance, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 151, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Ahn, D (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 151, South Korea.",dahn@snu.ac.kr; wkshin@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,11,13,0,15,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper analyzed factors influencing local people's participation in forest management program in Sissili and Ziro provinces, southern Burkina Faso based on data collected through a household survey of 165 members of forest management groups using factor analysis and multiple regression. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor solution, which accounted for 64.82% of the total variance. Participation in decision-making, followed by participation in forest conservation and economic benefits were found to be the main factors influencing participation in the forest management program. Gender, household size, income source, land tenure status and technical assistance also appeared to influence members' participation in the program. The results indicate that participatory management program can be enhanced by changing the administrative structure of forest management groups in order to empower members in decision-making processes. In addition, increasing women's participation and more equitable benefit-sharing among user groups are essential in improving the success of the participatory forest management program. Thus, policies reforms to improve the structure of the forest management groups and to establish equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms are essential to improve the participation of local people in the forest management program and, hence, require immediate attention.

J,"Mitchell, AD; Salonidis, C",,,,"Mitchell, Andrew D.; Salonidis, Constantine",,,David's Sling: Cross-Agreement Retaliation in International Trade Disputes,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SETTLEMENT SYSTEM; WTO; ENFORCEMENT; TRIPS; IMPLEMENTATION; MEMBERS; RULES,"Cross-retaliation, where a World Trade Organization (WTO) member whose rights have been infringed under one WTO Agreement retaliates against the offending member under another WTO Agreement, is seen by some commentators as a way to counteract the deficiencies of conventional trade retaliation and mitigate the asymmetry of power in the WTO dispute settlement system. However, the potential of cross-retaliation as an effective remedy remains unclear. This article argues that a credible and probable threat of cross-agreement retaliation could provide a powerful incentive for ex ante compliance. The credibility of the threat is established by reference to the WTO Agreement that is targeted. 7 lie suspension of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) obligations, in particular, holds great promise. The probability of the threat depends on the likelihood of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) authorization to suspend concessions, the outcomes of previous threats, and actions to operationalize cross-retaliation. WTO jurisprudence has fleshed out the requirements of Article 22.3 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), allowing relatively safe assumptions as to the likelihood of DSB authorization to suspend concessions across agreements where significant economic disparities exist between the disputing parties. Previous cases featuring the threat of cross-retaliation reveal a modest influence on the policies of disputing parties. Finally, the operationalization of cross-agreement retaliation pursuant to the TRIPS Agreement is riddled with legal and policy problems, mainly in connection with the personal and territorial scopes of the suspension, the justiciable nature of intellectual property (IF,) rights, the quantification of the suspension, the continuous supply of IF-dependent goods, and the consistency of the suspension with other, non-WTO international obligations. However, these problems do not prohibit developing countries from reaping the benefits of asymmetric information, so long as they create the impression of carefully structured retaliation plans that are ready to be triggered in the event of DSB authorization. A reasonable probability is the only certainty.

Instead, I find that learning disabled students graduate from high school at higher rates than youth with the same cognitive abilities because of high school graduation policies that make it easier for learning disabled youth to obtain a high school diploma. The effects of these graduation policies are even more remarkable given that I find evidence that learning disabled youth have less unmeasured human capital than observationally equivalent youth as after high school they are less likely to be employed or continue on to college and earn less than their observationally equivalent non-learning disabled peers.

In order to achieve growth and to create value from an international food supply chain, it needs to be managed as an interconnected system which is held together by a number of complex relationships. Active food chain coordination aims to effectively manage such systems. One of the current discussions in the literature is who assumes the coordination function in these chains and with which capabilities and resources. The effectiveness of chain coordination is believed to be a function of the coordinators' innate or acquired ability, their management style, tangible resources, and the efforts they make to effectively utilize resources. Effective coordination builds trust, motivation and contributes to improved supply chain performance and competitiveness. This paper presents a two-stage conceptual supply chain coordination/performance model and posits hypotheses that will be tested in future empirical research.","[Akhtar, P.; Fischer, C.; Marr, N.

Using classroom clickers to communicate pricing decisions, students explore first-hand the strategic nature of decision-making in an oligopoly market. Students see the diversity of equilibrium outcomes that can be supported in an oligopoly setting and better understand the conditions that lead to one equilibrium over another. The game also illustrates different game theoretic concepts such as the Nash equilibrium (Nash 1950, 1951) and backward induction.

Women's share of paid and unpaid work has increased in both the farm and off-farm sectors, and migration is a critical determinant. Economic development is associated with a rise in absolute work time, although not an increase in the time-use gender gap. Measuring the feminization of labor with time use rather than labor force participation data may be relevant to feminist analyses in other regions and countries, since it enables a more nuanced evaluation of the impacts of economic development on changes in the well-being of women.","[Chang, Hongqin] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [MacPhail, Fiona] Univ No British Columbia, Dept Econ, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Northern British Columbia; University of Winnipeg,"Chang, HQ (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xianning W 28, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",changhongqin@yahoo.com.cn; macphail@unbc.ca; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca,,,,,,,58,32,41,0,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This paper indicates that, the enterprises engaging in trade of woody forest products mainly deal with processing trade in China, which lies in the manufacturing sector of the global value chain but not the whole value chain. Therefore, trade security issues of woody forest products in China are particularly special. It requires us not only to pay attention to trade security of timber, but also to focus on trade security of woody forest products, that is, security of production capacity. In this sense, we need pay close attention to the difficulties faced by the enterprises engaging in processing trade of woody forest products. Furthermore, based on a theoretical framework, this paper shows that, three different types of participation behavior in global value chain will affect enterprise earnings, thus the issues of their trade security are naturally different too.","[Li Jun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,,yangxueru2005@126.com,"Yang, Xueru/X-5391-2019","Yang, Xueru/0000-0002-8367-2552",,,,,4,0,0,0,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-55641-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,72,76,,,,,,5,Economics; Environmental Studies; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BBI15,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306935700012,0

This new knowledge can then take the graduates forward and develop their level of knowledge in an appropriate follow-up period. A secondary (but not minor) contribution to student education is a systematic effort to understand the natural field of study in a broader context, which is a crucial factor for the effectiveness of their own creative work. The educator, who himself educates students to give a critical opinion of the submitted facts, can sometimes be unpleasantly surprised. There is almost always a small group of students who confuse a critical position with an unprincipled position. Nevertheless, the effect that brings educators into cooperation with students (including pedagogy and science) more than outweighs the problems that are associated with this integration. New (unconsidered) areas are more difficult in lectures as they reduce the power in the flow of information - a teacher is able to teach a smaller range of the subject matter but he/she and also the students create new knowledge to tune the pilot concept of the foreground as the spontaneous brainstorming during their education. This leads to the mutual improvement of knowledge and skills capital with students and teachers. Both groups are becoming more partners than rivals and through this partnership they can create the output value of the university which carries the attribute Synergy thanks to a time concurrent optimization of science and education. This paper is focused on identifying the concept which allows to bring the synergistic effect of interaction between teaching and research activities.

Organizations focus on managing the explicit knowledge, but also on capturing the tacit knowledge embedded in the individuals' experiences. Through the interactions in social networks, community-based knowledge development has become a very effective tool. In this context, more and more organizations are developing communities of practice as a strategic tool for knowledge development and sharing within the organization and across organizational boundaries. We address new trends and challenges of knowledge dynamics within communities of practice and examine the formation of this type of communities. We propose a high performance genetic algorithm for community formation, the key concept in our algorithm being a new fitness index, a successful combination between intelligence and cooperation, that allows not only community formation, but also intelligence to be the driving principle in the community formation process.","[Maries, Iulia; Scarlat, Emil; Maracine, Virginia] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,iulia.maries@hotmail.com,"Maries, Iulia/D-3659-2011; MARACINE, VIRGINIA/J-2419-2012","MARACINE, VIRGINIA/0009-0005-0752-5568",,,,,5,0,0,0,3,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",2502-0226,2558-9652,978-973-598-940-8,PR INT C BUS EXCELL,,,2011,,,,,,,297,301,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH82,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000316634500073,0

At the same dine, the opportunities are obvious and should not be neglected; they refer to the necessary alignment of Romanian higher education to European and world standards, and also to meeting the demands of its domestic and international stakeholders. As there is a permanent exchange of both students and professors with European and world universities, the desire to update and modernise becomes inescapable. Personal and professional development have to be taken into consideration, as a determining part of organizational medium-term and long-term programmes.

A secondary goal is to try to find what consumers think about national brands. National brands lack respondents' respect and favourable attitude, due to low quality perception. Also, their consumption is not perceived as a support for local economy. Therefore the respondents are not particularly interested in purchasing and using them.

The squash cluster disintegrated, while the bitter gourd cluster decided to diversify into onion production and to adopt organic fertilizers as a more cost effective means of production. As a result of these setbacks, both the clusters and the MFI learned some valuable lessons including; the role of microfinance in production; the risks associated with loans; and the level of support received by the farmers. Sustainability of livelihoods is the key factor that keeps the MFI and the farmers together.

Risk permeates every aspect of event organization, which risk management becomes a high priority activity in this complex process. Effective risk management requires certain steps of identification, evaluation, managing, monitoring and eliminating the risky circumstances as key components in managing the risks related to event organization. With reference to the long-term global supply and demand, event tourism can clearly show its effectiveness in creation of added value to the tourist destination, but which success depends on effective risk management and avoidance of undesirable circumstances in the event's organization. The aim of this paper is to define risk management, and its theoretical framework, present phases and discuss methods in managing the risks in the detailed process of the event's organization. The purpose of the paper is to emphasize the key role of risk management in the strategic management of event tourism. The starting points of the paper are modern world theories and practices.","[Vizjak, Ana; Rudancic-Lugaric, Andreja; Milas, Martina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,,anav@fthm.hr; alugaric@fthm.hr; martina.milas@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Using resource-event-agent (REA) enterprise domain ontology as a foundation, decision-maker's requirements are defined and represented as an application ontology scheme, structured on operational and policy levels. Following the design guidelines proposed and illustrated by the paper, an initial dimensional model is generated from the application ontology scheme and then it is later refined through validation with system stakeholders and confrontation with available data sources.","[Zaharie, Dorin; Pugna, Irina Bogdana; Radulescu, Cristina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Zaharie, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",zaharied@ase.ro,"Radulescu, Cristina/J-3170-2016","Radulescu, Cristina/0000-0001-7553-0717",,,,,16,0,0,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

One symptom of this great shift is the increasing sense of crisis as our older dysfunctional forms of life and mind face a certain meltdown in this metamorphesis. Ironically, our entrenched patterns of minding and consciousness feed the crisis and eclipse the depth of the real crisis. The shift we now face has long been emerging since the dawn of civilizations, and is nothing less than an evolutionary shift, a maturation of our human form and technology of consciousness. Indeed, the essence of the global crises turns essentially on this crisis in consciousness a radical dimensional shift in our rational capacities and mind processing powers. And this shift has been long seen and anticipated in our hitherto dormant global wisdom tradition through the ages. This essay suggests that our future sustainability now turns on bringing forth this mindshift from egomental patterns to more mature holistic, integral and dialogical patterns of being human through our dilated global lens.

A worrying statistic shows that persistence in one of these majors is much lower for women and minorities, suggesting that this may be a leaky joint in the STEM pipeline for these two groups of students. This paper uses restricted-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF) and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) to examine which factors contribute to persistence of all students in STEM field majors, and in particular the persistence of women and minorities. Although descriptive statistics show that a smaller percentage of women and minorities persist in a STEM field major as compared to male and non-minority students, regression analysis shows that differences in preparation and the educational experiences of these students explains much of the differences in persistence rates. Students at selective institutions with a large graduate to undergraduate student ratio and that devote a significant amount of spending to research have lower rates of persistence in STEM fields. A higher percentage of female and minority STEM field graduate students positively impacts on the persistence of female and minority students. However, there is little evidence that having a larger percentage of STEM field faculty members that are female increases the likelihood of persistence for women in STEM majors. These results suggest that the sorting of women and minorities into different types of undergraduate programs, as well as differences in their backgrounds have a significant impact on persistence rates.

In the physical sciences, analyses using within-course, across-time variation show that ex-ante measures of peer quality in a student's introductory courses has a lasting impact on the probability of persisting in the major. This peer effect exhibits important non-linearities such that weak students benefit from exposure to stronger peers while strong students are not dragged down by weaker peers. In both the physical and the life sciences, I find evidence that students are pulled away by their high grades in non-science courses and pushed out by their low grades in their major field. In the physical sciences, females are found to be more responsive to grades than males, consistent with psychological theories of stereotype vulnerability. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using three nationally representative surveys spanning 1988-2004 and grades K-10, we find that an additional month of relative age decreases the likelihood of receiving special education services by 2-5 percent. Relative age effects are strong for learning disabilities but not for other disabilities. We measure them for boys starting in kindergarten but not for girls until 3rd grade. We also measure them for white and Hispanic students but not for black students or differentially by socioeconomic quartiles. Results are consistent with the interpretation that disability assessments do not screen for the possibility that relatively young students are over-referred for evaluation. Lastly, we present suggestive evidence that math achievement gains due to disability classification may differentially benefit relatively young students. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Results using community, school and child/household-level PROBE survey data from five north Indian states provide some support to this central hypothesis: even after controlling for all other factors, access to village infrastructural facilities is associated with a higher likelihood of having a private school in the community. This is also corroborated by an analysis of household demand for private schools. The paper concludes by examining the effect of private school presence on year 5 pass rates: while all-school pass rates are significantly higher in villages with a private school, private school presence fails to have significant effect on local state school pass rates.

For the collaborative exploration of future complexities and uncertainties, participatory scenario development has proven to be a powerful approach. A range of communication Strategies with benefits for conveying complexity, however, has not yet been adopted by scenario developers. We present a framework of criteria with which we structurally analyze the benefits of interactive media communication. First, we consider requirements of feasibility, flexibility and stakeholder contributions. Then, we synthesize criteria for the communication of Complex Adaptive Systems. Finally, we set criteria for communicatory clarity and engagement. Using this framework, we review several science communication fields, including landscape visualization, serious gaming and visual analytics. We then develop a strategy for interactive media communication in participatory scenario development, including two work-in-progress examples. This strategy employs mixed media, micro-games and accessible stakeholder contributions in a geo-web context, and is suitable for participatory work in live settings as well as on-line, from a local to a global scale.

In the European context, these ideas first emerged in the UK and Sweden, were subsequently diffused through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union and then internalized by critical epistemic communities, including the network of the heads of PESs and the World Association of PESs. Through the acceptance, diffusion and internalization of these new management ideas, common governance practices, including performance, quality and case management, have been widely adopted in Europe. Policy-makers have failed, however, to agree on a 'best-practice' model with respect to the local organization of labour-market policy delivery.

However, there are remaining barriers that impede a wider implementation of foresight. In particular, the necessities to deal with the future, anticipate change, enhance participation and reduce costs and complexity call for new methods to improve current foresight activities. In this paper, we introduce prediction markets to the field of foresight. Prediction markets are a structured approach to collect and aggregate information from groups and have recently gained attention in forecasting. Prediction markets go beyond simple forecasting and can contribute to foresight by providing advantages in terms of continuous and real-time information aggregation, motivation of participation and information revelation as well as cost-efficiency and scalability. We suggest four promising fields of application for prediction markets to enhance foresight: (1) continuous forecasting and environmental scanning, (2) combining with deliberative approaches, (3) continuous idea generation and (4) expert identification. We conclude by considering prediction markets as a nascent and promising method for foresight and advocate for further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since Weitzman's (1974) 131 study of prices vs. quantities, economic theory predicts that a price instrument is superior under uncertainty in the case of stock pollutants. Given the general belief in the political infeasibility of a carbon tax in the US, there has been recent interest in two other policy instrument designs: hybrid policies and intensity targets. We extend the Weitzman model to derive an analytical expression for the expected net benefits of a hybrid instrument under uncertainty. We compare this expression to one developed by Newell and Pizer (2006) [6] for an intensity target, and show the theoretical minimum correlation between GDP and emissions required for an intensity target to be preferred over a hybrid. In general, we show that unrealistically high correlations are required for the intensity target to be preferred to a hybrid, making a hybrid a more practical instrument in practice. We test the predictions by performing Monte Carlo simulation on a computable general equilibrium model of the US economy. The results are similar, and we show with the numerical model that when marginal abatement costs are non-linear, an even higher correlation is required for an intensity target to be preferred over a safety valve.

This has ramifications for providers of services to this population, thus necessitating a level of forward planning. Predictive models of remaining life expectancy for older age groups can assist long-term planning processes. This paper presents an extrapolative approach to forecasting remaining life expectancy. Based on logistic modelling of historic mortality and survivorship for the younger-old male population of England and Wales over the period 1970-2005, a parsimonious two-parameter model is derived. This model provides a close correspondence to published period life table data. Trends in these parameters are then fitted and extrapolated to enable projections of life expectancy up to 40 years into the future. Alternative assumptions are used to determine a range of future life expectancy trajectories for a 65-year-old male. Occupational pension scheme provision is identified as an area of particular concern in the context of increasing longevity. As an illustration, the life expectancy trajectories are combined with differing discount rate assumptions to generate a number of alternative pension liability scenarios for the extrapolation period.

The research question is developed in the context of normative literature which argues for the inclusion of civil society in international politics as a remedy for its democratic deficit. By addressing political equality as a core value of democracy, the question of the inclusiveness of global civil society emanates. Literature objects to the inclusiveness of global civil society contesting equal representation. Business interests and societal interests of developed countries are assumed to dominate non-governmental interest representation in the WTO. The article examines the extent to which these objections hold true by evaluating the regional and sectoral distribution of CSOs that participated in WTO's public outreach programmes between 1996 and 2007.","Univ Bremen, Collaborat Res Ctr Transformat State 597, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany",University of Bremen,"Piewitt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Collaborat Res Ctr Transformat State 597, D-2800 Bremen 33, Germany.",martina.piewitt@sfb597.uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,38,20,25,0,17,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper investigates whether returns of forty-one closed-end country funds share a common volatility process with three comparable return series: the underlying net asset value (NAV), U.S. stock market returns, and foreign stock market returns. Country funds are a natural setting to test for international market integration, as they are traded in the U.S. market, whereas their underlying assets are traded in foreign stock markets. Our results indicate that only a few emerging markets' country funds share common volatility processes with their comparable asset returns. This, in turn, suggests weak linkages through the second moment of related assets.","[Kim, Doseong] Sogang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Yoon-Goo] Chungju Natl Univ, Div Business Adm, Chungju, South Korea; [Ruiz, Isabel] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Econ, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA",Sogang University; Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.",doseong@sogang.ac.kr; lygphj@cjnu.ac.kr; isabel.ruiz@shsu.edu,"Cherkes, Martin/A-4726-2012",,,,,,33,2,2,0,6,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Their behavior in the classroom also affects their peers' behavior and achievement. There is limited prior evidence, however, concerning the impact of school resources on student behavior. Some elementary schools employ counselors whose primary purpose is to help improve students' behavior, mental health, and noncognitive skill acquisition. This article estimates regression discontinuity models exploiting Alabama's unique financing system for school counselors. Alabama fully subsidizes counselor appointments for all elementary schools, with the number of appointments based on schools' prior year enrollments using discrete enrollment cutoffs. The results suggest that greater counselor subsidies reduce the frequency of disciplinary incidents but do not strongly influence mean student achievement test scores. Increases in counselors moderate relatively severe behavioral problems without necessarily improving systemic behavior affecting classroom learning.","Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Reback, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rr2165@columbia.edu,,,,,,,51,16,30,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

In this paper we document that for a large cohort of California and Texas natives the school entry laws increased educational attainment of students who enter school early, but also lowered their academic performance while in school. However, we find no evidence that the age at which children enter school effects job market outcomes, such as wages or the probability of employment. This suggests that the net effect on adult labor market outcomes of the increased educational attainment and poorer academic performance is close to zero. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, the garment industry has been one of the top exporters, drawing on women as the main suppliers of informal labor for the industry through subcontracted and home-based piecework. Based on fieldwork, this paper examines the gender inequalities that underlie the export success of the garment industry, in which the organization of production and workplace relations embed and reproduce gender ideology and norms. Women's engagement in garment production is ensured through the articulation of women's subordinate position with the social organization of garment production and the mobilization of kinship relations. The continued expansion of garment exports and the ongoing informalization of nonagricultural employment, according to official estimates, suggest that these arrangements are becoming more extensive over time.","Mugla Univ, Dept Labor Econ & Ind Relat, TR-48000 Iibf Kotekli Mugla, Turkey",Mugla Sitki Kocman University,"Dedeoglu, S (通讯作者)，Mugla Univ, Dept Labor Econ & Ind Relat, TR-48000 Iibf Kotekli Mugla, Turkey.",saniye@mu.edu.tr,,,,,,,70,43,46,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

A new modelling approach is then formulated, with specifications estimated by classical or cointegration regression techniques accounting for possible switches in long-run equilibrium parameters and varying strengths of short-run readjustments. This approach is applied to marine fisheries in Indonesia (Java Sea) and Papua New Guinea, and results are compared with traditional model specifications.

Because of perceived problems with its ability to collect anti-dumping duties, the US amended its bonding requirements in 2004. Under the new rules, importers were required to secure a bond for an amount equal to the cash-deposit rate in effect on the date of entry of the merchandise multiplied by the importer's value of imports from the previous year, as well as pay cash deposits equal to the amount of anti-dumping duties per entry. The US claimed the additional deposit was reasonable and necessary to guarantee duty payment in case the anti-dumping duty increased during the administrative review. Thailand and India claimed that the additional deposit was unreasonable and an additional action against dumping and was therefore impermissible under GATT 1994 and the Anti-Dumping Agreement. The Appellate Body upheld the Panel's findings that while the Ad Note to Article VI:2 and 3 GATT 1994 authorizes the imposition of security requirements during the period following the imposition of an anti-dumping duty order, the additional security requirement resulting from the application of the EBR to shrimp was not 'reasonable' within the meaning of the Ad Note. The Appellate Body reversed the legal interpretation by the Panel that there is no obligation under the Ad Note to assess the risk of default by individual importers; however, the AB upheld the Panel's finding that the EBR is not 'necessary' within the meaning of Article XX(d) of the GATT 1994. As a result, the AB upheld the Panel's conclusion that the application of the EBR to shrimp was inconsistent with Article 18(1) of the Anti-Dumping Agreement because it was inconsistent with the Ad Note to Article VI :2 and 3 of the GATT 1994 and not justified by Article XX(d). We consider the AB's legal and economic reasoning to be largely correct. The US employed a sledgehammer to kill a mosquito and the AB used the concepts of 'reasonableness' in the Ad Note and 'necessity' in Article XX(d) to reject what fundamentally was a lack of proportionality, while leaving the door open for more reasonable application of bonding requirements.","[Prusa, Thomas J.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Prusa, Thomas J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Prusa, TJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",prusa@econ.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2010,9.0,1,,,,,59,84,,10.1017/S1474745609990231,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,586BO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276876100004,0

Therefore, introduction of a benefit distribution mechanism which could promote commercial banks to implement UDW self-consciously is urgently needed. Under this background, this paper introduces a benefit distribution mechanism called interchange fee. We find that this mechanism could strengthen UDW' s competition among banks with different sizes and lower the price of this business. Moreover, the optimal interchange-fee based on this mechanism reflects the conception of covering costs of correspondent bank but simultaneously not damaging interests of own-bank, so it increases the social welfare greatly.

To achieve this objective we use a multinomial choice model of engagement (or non-engagement) in forest management activities based on household data from 4 villages surrounding the National Kabore Tambi Park in Burkina Faso. The results show that the participation by household members in forest conservation activities is mainly determined by the three variables that are related to policy: membership in community based forest management associations, security of land use rights, and training. The current training programs focus only on forest conservation practices. To be more efficient it should focus on increasing people's knowledge about the benefits due to conservation and the threats resulting from the lack of forest management. Furthermore the results indicate that improving land use right security would increase farmer's willingness to participate in forest management activities such as community work and forest surveillance. Thus particular attention should be paid to the prevailing system of land rights and its incentives, or disincentives, for promoting sustainable management of the forest resource.

In the course of this search, technology has improved dramatically, and additional developments such as larger and more sensitive telescopes and increased computing power will accelerate the search and extend it into new areas. Speculative search strategies that are more firmly rooted in imagination and wish than present-day science may mature with the practical effect of further extending the search space. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), based on passive observation, has been joined by the controversial activity of messaging extraterrestrial intelligence (METI), the use of radio transmissions and space probes to proclaim our place in the universe. Potential wild cards that could fundamentally change the nature of the search include government intervention, the fruition of breakthrough technologies, and a confirmed detection. A rigorous search could confirm the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence tomorrow, within the lifetime of many people now alive, or in the distant future. All that is required for its continuation is a small number of scientists who have the skills and equipment to conduct a search that most scientists find credible. Since the search for life beyond Earth is motivated by cultural and psychological as well as scientific considerations, we may expect it to continue into the indefinite future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Longitudinal item-level data were analyzed with both student-and school-level identifiers for the entire state of Colorado between 2003 and 2006. Eight different vertical scales were established on the basis of choices made for three key variables: the item response theory modeling approach, the calibration approach, and the student proficiency estimation approach. Each scale represented a methodological approach that was psychometrically defensible. Longitudinal values from each scale were used as the outcome in a commonly used value-added model (the layered model popularized by William Sanders) as a means of estimating school effects. Our findings suggest that while the ordering of estimating school effects is insensitive to the underlying vertical scale, the precision of such value-added estimates can be quite sensitive to the combinations of choices made in the creation of the scale.","[Briggs, Derek C.; Weeks, Jonathan P.] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Briggs, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",derek.briggs@colorado.edu; weeksjp@gmail.com,"Briggs, Derek/R-6174-2019","Briggs, Derek/0000-0003-1628-4661",,,,,66,23,41,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

With global trading of carbon permits, the pollution haven effect emerges in equilibrium whenever the convex sulfur damage functions are nonlinear.

Recent research suggests that respondents may have difficulties evaluating data in this format. In the context of a CE eliciting preferences for changes in coastal land use, this study uses a split-sample experiment to compare standard presentations with virtual reality (VR) visualisations conveying objectively identical information. We find that compared to the standard presentation, preferences elicited in VR treatments are less variable and exhibit a significant reduction in asymmetry between willingness to pay (WTP) for gains and willingness to accept (WTA) for corresponding losses. We conjecture that the greater 'evaluability' of the VR presentation reduces respondent judgement error and moderates reliance on the loss-aversion heuristic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

What are the implications on these rules of allowing for a feedback between conversion decisions and the stochasticity of conservation benefits? We address this question using the well-known ecological mechanism of extinction debt as an illustration. This yields a model with a controlled-diffusion process at its core. We solve this model using a real-options approach, which leads to the conventional conversion rule as a special case. Calibrating the model to a specific case (Costa Rica), we demonstrate the presence of an augmented quasi-option value. The size of this value depends on the strength of the feedback.

The methodology used to build the various scenarios is prospective analysis. We first performed a structural analysis in order to identify the key driving forces that characterize the evolution of the sector in this region (agricultural production, demand for agricultural products and institutional framework). We then carried out a morphological analysis that generated a range of partial scenarios from which we finally built four global scenarios. These last scenarios characterize the possible trends in the variables of change previously identified. Lastly, the common key parameters of each global scenario were quantified by means of the Delphi method. The characterization of scenarios has a double practical interest. First of all, they can explain the cause-effect relationships of the processes of change that affect agriculture in this region of Spain. Secondly, they are a powerful tool to stimulate an in-depth reflection of how the design and implementation of current agricultural policies will affect the already fragile agricultural sector of Castilla y Leon. This study thus aims to support decision-making processes at regional level. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Who benefits academically?,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Educational economics; Human capital; Productivity,GRADE RETENTION; SCHOOL; DROPOUT,"We evaluate the impact of Florida's test-based promotion policy on the probability that low-performing students are retained using data on the universe of third-grade students in the state of Florida from 2001 to 2004. We also examine the effect of formal exemptions to the policy on student proficiency in reading two years later. In an evaluation of retention for third-grade students over time with a logit model we find that Florida's policy has increased the probability that minority students are retained to a greater extent than white students. Contrary to previous research, this differential retention occurs after controlling for student academic proficiency. However, in an evaluation of the academic performance of students who were in the first class subject to the retention policy, we find that retained students outperform students who received an exemption from the policy in reading two years after baseline, indicating that on average exemptions have not been granted to those individuals who would benefit from promotion.

This paper contributes to filling this gap by assessing the importance of gender inequality in education as a determinant of FDI. The authors estimate a standard gravity model on bilateral FDI flows that is augmented by educational variables, including different measures of gender inequality in education. The analysis covers an unprecedented number of both host and source countries of FDI, thereby reducing the risk of distorted results because of a sample selection bias. The results support the view that foreign investors are more likely to favor locations where education-related gender disparities are small. However, the discouraging effects of gender disparity on FDI are restricted to middle-income (rather than low-income) developing host countries and to investors from developed (rather than developing) countries.","[Busse, Matthias] Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24100 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Busse, M (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ HWWI, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",busse@hwwi.org; peter.nunnenkamp@ifw-kiel.de,,"Busse, Matthias/0000-0002-0471-9472",,,,,49,22,24,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Tree canopy volumes were measured and mapped in the grove using an ultrasonic array and DGPS receiver in order to describe spatial productivity. Fruit yield was mapped from harvester trucks equipped with DGPS receivers and data loggers. The grove was classified into five productivity zones representing very good, good, medium, poor, and very poor citrus growth areas based on the canopy volume. Soil samples were collected from 30 locations at four 15-cm depth increments to 60 cm and analyzed for their chemical and physical properties. Soil properties showed a continuous trend along the productivity gradient and depth. A greenhouse bioassay with radish as an indicator crop was used to compare the productivity of five zones at four depths. Overhead photographs of the potted radish plants were captured periodically with a SLR digital camera and leaf area was calculated by image processing. Shoot dry weights were also measured. Analysis of variance showed that differences between the productivity zones were pronounced at the lower two depths for leaf area and shoot dry weights. The growth curves for leaf area indicated the differences between productivity zones started appearing in the later stages of growth. Regression analysis showed that the amount of citrus canopy volume spatial variation explained by radish growth increased with soil depth. The results of the bioassay showed that citrus yield in poor areas of the grove were limited by the shallow depth of productive soil. The less productive portions of the grove that is unsuitable for deep-rooted perennial crops like citrus could be successfully mapped with soil samples taken at multiple depths. Topsoil sampling alone, as commonly practiced, proved to be unsuitable for defining the variable citrus productivity of these soils, but may be adequate for shallow-rooted annual crops.","[Mann, K.

There are many parts to the orchard system decision puzzle which must fit together in a complementary arrangement to gain maximum precision and profitability. The most immediate question that must be answered regarding the establishment of a new orchard is spacing. Extension agents and growers often need assistance in determining optimum tree density for sites. Trees planted too close cause excessive shading, and competition for resources results in inadequate light penetration, poor quality fruit, low cropping, excessive labor in pruning to reduce shading impact, etc. Excessive distance results in inefficient planting designs where the land surface is under utilized, and long-term profitability may be compromised. In 1989, we made an initial attempt at trying to simplify the decision making process by considering the most important variables and assigning them values (number codes in parentheses) in a formula. Assessments on vigor are derived from rootstock and cultivar trials and field observations. Our experience gained from working with the high-density orchards and with new cultivars and rootstocks has encouraged us to frequently update the model. The formula is available on the Michigan State University Department of Horticulture web site for general use by the public, students and extension field agents in an interactive mode (spacing calculator) http://www.hrt.msu.edu/department/Perry/Spacing_Fruit/mispacingPC.htm. More revision in the future will be necessary as we learn more of the technical intricacies of new rootstocks, cultivars, marketing demands, and management constraints. The primary factors affecting spacing include scion vigor, rootstock vigor, soil type, irrigation, management system, and the interactions that take place between them. This spacing recommendation is only relevant to Michigan sites and for single row arrangement of trees.","[Perry, R.

These national reports articulate a new concept, the public finance value of children, and argue for increased investment in preschool because of its positive impact on the long-term fiscal health of the nation. This paper analyzes the IIK reports from 2003-6 to assess their attention to the multidimensional aspects of early care and education (ECE) in the US. Although the reports evaluate increased investment in preschool, they fail to recognize the need for a comprehensive system of ECE that includes support for childcare and the unpaid care and education provided by parents. As a result, the reports undervalue the contributions of women and of the ECE sector itself. Feminist economics offers a broader perspective that would help the IIK authors avoid conceptual traps and recognize the need for more comprehensive reforms.","Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Warner, ME (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 215 W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mew15@cornell.edu,,"Warner, Mildred/0000-0002-0109-338X",,,,,87,15,17,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

We address this deficit by analysing the relationship between socio-economic status and child outcomes in university, based on a rich and unique dataset of university students. While large socio-economic differences in academic performance exist at the point of entry into university, these differences are substantially narrowed during the period of study. Importantly, the differences across socio-economic backgrounds in university grade attainment for female students is explained by intermediating variables such as personality, risk attitudes and time preferences, and subject/college choices. However, for male students, we explain less than half of the socio-economic gradient through these same pathways. Despite the weakening socioeconomic effect in grade attainment, a key finding is that large socio-economic differentials in the earnings expectations of university students persist, even when controlling for grades in addition to our rich set of controls. Our findings pose a sizable challenge for policy in this area as they suggest that equalising educational outcomes may not translate into equal labour market outcomes.

Methods Using patient level data for 3,754 patients in six vascular departments, we estimate fixed effect models for costs (linear) and quality (logistic). We consider two quality measures; mortality and wound complications. To assess whether the joint evaluation of costs and quality affects the ranking of departments, we construct joint confidence regions for each pair of departmental effects for costs and quality using a bootstrap method and rank departments according to their cost-effectiveness ratio. The findings are used to evaluate a theory of a U-shaped cost/quality relationship. Results The association between cost and quality differs depending on how quality is measured. Lower costs are associated with higher mortality, implying a cost/quality trade-off. In contrast, there is no clear association between costs and wound complications among vascular departments. Conclusions Compared to benchmarking of departments based solely on their costs, we show that the ranking of departments may be altered considerably when quality is taken into account. Consequently, it is important to have a well-rounded view of departmental objectives when undertaking performance evaluation. The results for mortality may lend some support to the theory of a U-shaped cost/quality relationship. However, the results for wound complications do not support the theory of a U-shaped cost/quality relationship.","[Hvenegaard, Anne; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte] Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Arendt, Jacob Nielsen] Univ So Denmark, Hlth Econ Unit, Inst Publ Hlth, Odense, Denmark; [Street, Andrew] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Southern Denmark; University of York - UK,"Hvenegaard, A (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Hlth Serv Res, 27-29 Dampfaergevej, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ah@dsi.dk,"Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/A-3161-2011; Arendt, Jacob Nielsen/ISS-2184-2023","Arendt, Jacob Nielsen/0000-0001-5675-8564; Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364; Gyrd-Hansen, Dorte/0000-0003-1137-2304",,,,,35,26,28,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Intervention costs ranging over a two-year period were compared by intervention category (foster care placement, institutional placement, mentorship services, individual support services and structured support services), estimation method (price, micro costing, average cost) and treatment group (intervention, control). Analyses are based upon 2007 costs for 156 individuals receiving 404 interventions. Overall, both approaches were found to produce reliable estimates of intervention costs at the group level but not at the individual level. As choice of approach can greatly impact the estimate of mean difference, adjustment based on estimation approach should be incorporated into sensitivity analyses.

This article summarizes the process and results of that project. It constitutes a case study in the evaluation of a large organization's plans from a strategic foresight perspective. Findings from this investigation suggest that many large-scale trends in the U.S., including urban sprawl, rising energy costs, climate change, and fiscal challenges are likely to work against efforts to make communities more livable. On the basis of these findings, IAF recommended that the association take a broad approach to livability, developing strategies that counter these negative trends while also improving the lives of older people.

This study developed a simulation-optimization system in which all these elements were incorporated. The simulation model consisted of a typical tree stand growth simulator augmented with a decomposition model for calculating carbon releases from the decomposition of deadwood, cutting residues, and products. The model allows managers and policy makers to analyze the effects of carbon pricing, substitution rates and assortment distributions, among others, on the optimal stand management, and estimate the carbon balances of alternative management systems. The case study calculations showed that the long-term carbon balance of a managed forest is negative without substitution effects. Substitution effects may convert the balance from negative to positive. The carbon balance of pine forest is clearly better than that of spruce forest, which is mainly because of the poor carbon balance of spruce pulpwood. If there are no substitution effects, forest management is a carbon source with 0.1 t ha(-1) a(-1) of carbon releases from pine forestry, and 0.5 t ha(-1) a(-1) from spruce forestry. With low substitution rates (50% of carbon in biofuel and 33% of carbon in sawn wood replace fossil carbon), spruce is carbon-neutral and pine is a clear sink with 0.38 t ha(-1) a(-1) carbon sequestration. The same sink effect can be obtained in spruce forestry with a higher substitution rate (75% of carbon in biofuel and 67% of carbon in sawn wood replace fossil carbon). (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

Hence, now more than ever before such factors must be considered in forest management. As a contribution to this topic, this article presents a calculation model implemented in Excel frames, which supports decisions in forest production under changing conditions. Risk is integrated into the model by the Weibull function, which serves as an age-dependent survival function. In order to facilitate an intuitive interpretation of its coefficients, it was used in a reparametrised form. Furthermore, salvage price reductions and cost additions caused by calamities are considered. The target variable is the 'annuity under risk'. We demonstrate exemplarily how different parameters of the survival function influence the probability distribution and thus the expected value of the annuity of a spruce stand. The differences between the annuities with and without a consideration of risk are interpreted as current, annual risk costs. It can be shown that risk lowers the annuity, whereas scenarios with high risks in the young stand stages have a higher impact than those with high risks in mature stands. In the latter case, adaptation is possible by shortening the rotation period. This does not hold in the case of early risks, which cannot be avoided.

This research assessed the perceptions of socioeconomically heterogeneous forest users from eight community forests of Dhading district on environmental impacts of community forestry practice using group interviews and case studies. Two environmental impact-related concepts: forest products supply and local environmental conditions were assessed using rating scale based perception-indicators among three social groups: elite, women, and disadvantaged. Irrespective of social grouping, statistical analysis of the summated rating scores suggests that users perceived increased forest products supply and improved environmental conditions at the local level. Comparison of perceived environmental impacts among eight community forests indicates some differences due to variation in forest attributes in these community forests. Findings from this study are in agreement with the published literature that the community forestry practice has brought a positive change in the local environmental conditions and forest products supply situations in the hills of Nepal.

Consistent with prior double-dividend literature, there is a tax interaction effect that occurs between the development tax and the pre-existing property tax. However, there are two fundamental differences between the tax interaction effect identified here and that of prior literature. Ours one has two components: First, there is a cost-side tax interaction effect that is 'spatially' concentrated at the urban fringe, as only agents at the urban fringe alter their behavior in response to the development tax. Second, there is also a benefit-side tax interaction effect, as increases in open space at the urban fringe are capitalized into housing prices throughout the city. In contrast to prior literature, we find that the empirical importance of the combined tax interaction effect is of substantially less importance and, as a consequence, the likelihood of a 'double-dividend' is higher than in prior studies. Further, we show that the development tax should be part of the local tax system, even in the absence of open space benefits. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We apply an instrumental variable to estimate the effect of the share of non-certified teachers on student achievement (measured by grade point average, GPA). We find statistically significant negative effects on the GPA. The effect is stronger for students with highly educated parents. A one percentage point increase in the share of non-certified teachers is expected to decrease student's GPA by, on average, 1.8 standard deviations per year. This is a substantial effect considering the large differences in the shares of non-certified teachers across schools and municipalities. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Related previous studies on OECD countries have mostly excluded Turkey-itself an OECD country. The only study on Turkey examines the period 1984-1998. However, after 1998, major events and policy changes that had a substantial impact on income and health expenditures took place in Turkey, including a series of reforms to restructure the health and social security system. In contrast to earlier findings in the literature, we find that the income elasticity of total health expenditures is less than one, which indicates that health care is a necessity in Turkey during the period of analysis. According to our results, a 10% increase in per capita GDP is associated with an 8.7% increase in total per capita health expenditures, controlling for population growth. We find that the income elasticity of public health expenditures is less than one. But, in the case of private health care expenditures, the elasticity is greater than one, meaning that private health care is a luxury good in Turkey.","[Caner, Asena] TOBB Econ & Technol Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey; [Sulku, Seher Nur] Turkish Minist Hlth, TR-06434 Ankara, Turkey; [Sulku, Seher Nur] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Econometr Dept, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey",TOBB Ekonomi ve Teknoloji University; Ministry of Health - Turkey; Karadeniz Technical University,"Caner, A (通讯作者)，TOBB Econ & Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Sogutozu Cad 43, TR-06560 Ankara, Turkey.",sehernur.sulku@saglik.gov.tr; acaner@etu.edu.tr,"SÜLKÜ, SEHER NUR/JTT-9115-2023",,,,,,27,19,21,3,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Under the European Union's Generalized System of Preferences (EU's GSP), trade preferences of Myanmar in 1997 and Belarus in 2006 were withdrawn for the use of forced labour and for violations of the freedom of association. This paper highlights the EU's GSP scheme and idea of linking EU trade policy to core labour standards. Based on two case studies, we investigate the trade effects of the EU sanctions on the target country and analyse the effectiveness of the GSP sanctions. We find that using the EU's GSP regime to sanction countries which violate the core labour standards has very limited effectiveness. However, sanctions can be an effective way to demonstrate the political commitment to a particular set of values and norms such as core labour standards. Sanctions may also deter other countries from committing violations.","[Cuyvers, Ludo] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Int Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Cuyvers, Ludo] Ctr ASEAN Studies, Antwerp, Belgium; [Cuyvers, Ludo] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Cuyvers, Ludo] European Inst Asian Studies, Brussels, Belgium",University of Antwerp; North West University - South Africa,"Cuyvers, L (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Int Econ, Kipdorp 61, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",weifeng.zhou@ua.ac.be; ludo.cuyvers@ua.ac.be,"Cuyvers, Ludo/ABE-2557-2020",,,,,,24,18,19,0,29,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Such economy favors foreign companies and prejudices domestic ones, which has made domestic enterprises restrained. The processing trade emphasizes export which makes domestic market rely heavily on foreign trade with small profits, large consumptions of resources and degradation of environment. Solution includes adjusting investment strategy, maximizing export structure, supporting the cooperation between private enterprises and foreign companies, vigorously developing service industry, protecting intellectual property rights and implementing innovative economy.","[Chen Guangping] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Suzhou 215004, Peoples R China",Suzhou University of Science & Technology,,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-56777-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,58,62,,,,,,5,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BZX98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303279700009,0

At the same time, three models of developing regimen tourism, i.e. regimen garden, study course by traveling and volunteer of interest are put forward so as to put up a basic frame for the development of regimen tourism in China.","[Ma Runhua; Wei Jianguo] Ludong Univ, Sch Business, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China",Ludong University,,mrh209@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,DOCKLAND,"7 POINT PARK CRESCENT, DOCKLAND, VIC 3008, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-56777-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,63,69,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BZX98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303279700010,0

However, the growth is limited by lacking competition and inadequate airport infrastructure. In order to follow modern technologies and to meet the ever-increasing needs of its customers, the provision of an adequate and reliable physical infrastructure is important in the airport business. Due to the recession followed by the spread of the banking crisis and limited credit opportunities, alternative modes of financing are required. In that context, public private partnership (PPP) could be regarded as valuable means for successful development of airport infrastructure projects. Given the bank crisis has increased the price of loans, the number of projects that the private sector can finance has been significantly reduced. Therefore, hybrid PPPs are utilised in order to exploit EU funds combined with different PPP models. The main purpose of the paper is to analyse the examples of several European airports involved in financing and operating through various forms of private sector collaboration. The emphasis is put on the different models of private sector participation in the airport industry which ensures airports' sustained expansion. The paper uses case study methodology of selected European airports in order to determine the opportunities and the risks of implementing different models of private involvement in airports' development. It also aims to understand the motivation of both public and private sector to meet the interest of all parties. The findings suggest that PPPs with fair allocation of risks and rewards could provide a means to raise the necessary funds and know-how for successful development of airport capacity in order to meet future demands.","[Tolic, Meri Suman; Vojvodic, Katija; Martinovic, Marija] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Tolic, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia.",mstolic@unidu.hr; katija.vojvodic@unidu.hr; marija.martinovic@unidu.hr,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Such problems transcend disciplinary boundaries, are intertwined with sociopolitical context, and require participation of stakeholders to generate socially acceptable outcomes. A substantial barrier to transdisciplinary (TD) research is devising and applying evaluative criteria or schemas for an approach that is recognized as necessarily tailored, flexible and evolving. This paper addresses the challenge of shaping, supporting and evaluating transdisciplinary research. Firstly, we synthesise the literature on TD research characteristics, highlighting areas of emerging consensus and some implications of these for research design, execution and quality evaluation. Secondly, we present an adaptable heuristic called the TD Wheel (TDW). The TDW is a synthesis of the disparate insights available within the current literature, and is presented as an organizing graphic for TD research. We explain how the TDW has utility at three stages of the research process: shaping (planning and proposing research): supporting (guiding research in-train); and evaluating (planning for evaluation, periodically documenting/checking progress, and reporting on outcomes). The TDW is a provocative graphic geared to help researchers visualize and discuss the elements and process of TD research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, I extend and update earlier work on the en primeur market for Bordeaux wines, examining empirically the impact of the demonstrable globalization of the process of price formation on the institutional character of this most densely institutionalized of markets. I associate the process of globalization in this market with the influence of international wine critics, assessing the extent to which they might be seen to act in effect as agents of standardization in a market whose prices are more conventionally seen to be driven by the status and hierarchy bound up with long-standing systems of classification. I compare and contrast the 2005 en primeur campaign which took place in the midst of a global consumer boom which had seen so-called investment grade wines command unprecedented prices in international markets with the 2008 campaign which took place in a context of global recession, examining the role played by American wine critic Robert Parker in the process of price formation in each campaign. I show that Parker's impact has not waned, that he can be shown to exert a strong influence on both intra-vintage and inter-vintage reputational factors and that his role is analogous to that of a credit-rating agency in a more conventional futures market. Yet, I also show that the 'Parker effect' reinforces and works with the official classification schema, not against them. Parker, I show, has become part of the institutional embedding of this market-arguably as key to the process of both price and status formation today as the 1855 classification itself.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Hay, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",c.hay@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Hay, Colin/0000-0001-6327-6547",,,,,24,28,31,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

He described it as fictitious' and asserted the human aspect of labour necessitates 'protection'. In bringing Polanyi's mature works to bear on these claims, this article uses the fictitious commodity' concept to highlight the tension in neoclassical theory between concrete reality and its idealist construction of the economy. This contradiction directly challenges the veracity of the self-regulating market. The article develops two related themes. The first is Polanyi's critique of the neoclassical conception of 'the economy' as an ideal (market) construct which gave rise to the notion that labour could be regulated by the forces of supply and demand. The second is the lack of logic in the notion of a 'self regulating' market and Polanyi's appreciation of the concrete tendencies of capitalist economies to develop institutional arrangements that ensure the economy is always, and necessarily, more than 'the market'.","Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Paton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",joy.paton@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,20,12,13,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This hypothetical situation of serious risks and high uncertainties requires governance arrangements with high potentials for rapid and radical change. Using the metaphor of the flocking of birds, we characterize these arrangements as 'institutional flocking'. Main features of institutional flocking are: (1) flexible opportunities for actors to swiftly respond to change through creative forms of collaboration and participation; (2) rapid and pervasive processes of learning and institutionalization of new knowledge among actors; (3) strong and institutionalized care for coherence and solidarity, to bind the various parts of the 'flock'.

One of the criticisms of the current subsidy system, however, is that it overemphasizes work and does little to encourage parents to purchase high-quality child care. Consequently, there are reasons to be concerned about the implications of child care subsidies for child development. In this paper, we provide a systematic assessment of the association between subsidy receipt and a wide range of child outcomes. Drawing on rich data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, we document a negative relationship between child care subsidies and child development. In particular, our results suggest that subsidy receipt in the year before kindergarten is associated with lower reading and math test scores and greater behavior problems at kindergarten entry. Some of these negative effects persist until the end of kindergarten. A potential explanation for the poorer outcomes is that subsidized children are more likely to receive intense exposure to low-quality child care. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability to cope with these challenges rests on their capability to relate future problems to current behavior. Our approach investigates this capability and consists in comparing mental models of the present and future. The approach moreover enables us to explore whether and how farmers are able to imagine a future differing from the perceived present. Data from previous studies investigating present and future pesticide application were used. In the datasets the mental models of farmers' livelihood were structured into livelihood capitals (human, health, natural and financial capital), causal relations among the livelihood capitals were derived, and present and future causal relations were compared. The comparison of these causal relations led to six cases, each representing a different degree of dependence of future on present causal relations. The dependence was found to vary among farmers and analyzed livelihood capital. Three types of farmers with differing dependence patterns were identified. The differences found lead to new insights for policy recommendations, depending on farmers focus in their causal relations. We therefore expect that interventions focusing either more on the causes or effects of causal relations will result in a better uptake of knowledge by farmers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Colorado provides one example of a region that has been heavily affected. The Colorado State Forest Service estimates that 769,000 ha of Colorado's forests, of all jurisdictions, have been infested with MPB since the outbreak began in 1996 (Leatherman, 2009). An important consequence of this damage is declining utility (i.e. a reduction in the level of satisfaction derived from goods and services, both market and nonmarket) for residents of the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Specifically, beetle infestations lower utility by reducing the value of forest amenities and increasing the risk of wildfire. We use a hedonic pricing model to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) to prevent MPB damage in Grand County, Colorado. The hedonic model establishes a statistical relationship between property prices and various characteristics. In this case, the characteristic of interest is the number of trees killed by MPB infestations. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to determine the number of these trees within 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 kilometer buffers of each property. Marginal implicit prices for MPB damage are calculated, after controlling for structural and spatial characteristics. Results indicate that property values decline by $648, $43, and $17 for every tree killed by MPB infestations within a 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 km buffer, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Following an examination of the origins and impact of this principle on ILO and United Nations (UN) conventions relating to migrant workers, the paper examines how Australia has responded to such conventions. In this regard, the paper highlights the counterveiling influence of the neoclassical economic perspective on the way migrant workers in Australia have been treated and represented from the post-war period until recent times as either 'factory fodder' and/or 'business assets'. Both representations, we argue, treat migrants as commodities. To challenge this approach the paper identifies how migrant workers have distinguished themselves from commodities through resistance to poor working conditions and also management strategies that treat them as if they were commodities.","[Taksa, Lucy] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Groutsis, Dimitria] Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Discipline Work & Org Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Taksa, Lucy] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Dept Business, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Sydney; Macquarie University,"Taksa, L (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",lucy.taksa@efs.mq.edu.au; dimitria.groutsis@sydney.edu.au,,"Taksa, Lucy/0000-0002-0532-2573",,,,,86,4,4,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Recently, scenario planning has enjoyed a revival, apparent in the 'boom' in published research on the matter. Consequently, a major issue that needs to be addressed is how to organize the literature along precise lines. A number of reviews that describe the current status of the body of literature and knowledge on scenario planning have made attempts to respond to such requirements. These studies agree that systematizing the existing literature is a necessary step in developing the field. This paper aims to contribute to this purpose. The review of the academic literature here conducted is thought to be useful for both academics and practitioners. For researchers, this systematic overview will be constructive not only in providing an analysis of the directions of published research but also in setting up a research agenda for the future. For managers and practitioners, it provides a clear outline of firm-related articles and discusses their contribution from a managerial point of view. It also raises awareness with regard to future analytical methods, and in particular, to scenario planning and its potential contribution to the competitiveness of firms.

The Randomized EValuation of Intravenous Levosimendan Efficacy (REVIVE II) trial compared patients randomly assigned to a single infusion of levosimendan (levo) or placebo (SOC), each in addition to local standard treatments for AHF. We report an economic analysis of REVIVE II from the hospital perspective. REVIVE II enrolled patients (N = 600) hospitalized for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who remained dyspneic at rest despite treatment with intravenous diuretics. Case report forms documented index hospital treatment (drug administration, procedures, days of treatment by care unit), as well as subsequent hospital and emergency department admissions during follow-up ending 90 days from date of randomization. These data were used to impute cost of admission based on an econometric cost function derived from > 100,000 ADHF hospital billing records selected per REVIVE II inclusion criteria. Index admission mean length of stay (LOS) was shorter for the levo group compared with standard of care (SOC) (7.03 vs 8.96 days, P = 0.008) although intensive care unit (ICU)/cardiac care unit (CCU) days were similar (levo 2.88, SOC 3.22, P = 0.63). Excluding cost for levo, predicted mean (median) cost for the index admission was levo US $13,590 (9,458), SOC $19,021 (10,692) with a difference of $5,431 (1,234) favoring levo (P = 0.04). During follow-up through end of study day 90, no significant differences were observed in numbers of hospital admissions (P = 0.67), inpatient days (P = 0.81) or emergency department visits (P = 0.41). Cost-effectiveness was performed with a REVIVE-II sub-set conforming to current labeling, which excluded patients with low baseline blood pressure. Assuming an average price for levo in countries where currently approved, there was better than 50% likelihood that levo was both cost-saving and improved survival. Likelihood that levo would be cost-effective for willingness-to-pay below $50,000 per year of life gained was about 65%. In the REVIVE II trial, patients treated with levo had shorter LOS and lower cost for the initial hospital admission relative to patients treated with SOC. Based on sub-group analysis of patients administered per the current label, levo appears cost-effective relative to SOC.","[de Lissovoy, Greg; Fraeman, Kathy] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Teerlink, John R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiol Sect, San Francisco Vet Affairs Med Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Teerlink, John R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA USA; [Mullahy, John] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Salon, Jeff; Sterz, Raimund; Durtschi, Amy; Padley, Robert J.] Abbott Labs, Abbott Pk, IL 60064 USA",United Biosource Corporation; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); San Francisco VA Medical Center; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Abbott Laboratories,"de Lissovoy, G (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",greg.delissovoy@unitedbiosource.com,"Teerlink, John R/D-2986-2012",,,,,,17,31,33,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Emitters that qualify as being 'emissions-intensive trade-exposed' (EITE) entities are eligible to receive free emissions permits under a component of the CPRS known as the EITE Assistance Program (EAP). The objective of this article is to examine whether the allocation of free emissions permits under the EAP is policy measure that constitutes a breach of Australia's international obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (hereinafter 'SCM Agreement') and the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter 'Kyoto Protocol'). The EAP is explained and subsequently examined in relation to Australia's commitments under the WTO SCM Agreement to determine whether the EAP constitutes either a prohibited export or an actionable subsidy. A further question considered is whether an affirmative subsidization finding under the SCM Agreement is evidence of a breach of Article 2.1(a)(v) of the Kyoto Protocol.

Suitable demand-side cost-sharing can induce consumer behavior that avoids over-treatment when there are information asymmetries between providers and consumers, leading to the efficient recommendations and provision of treatment by providers. If under-treatment can be penalized, then a full insurance model that pays providers a fixed salary and fee-for-service or one that requires patients to present a referral letter before specialist care is delivered also achieves provision efficiency.

Potential savings are calculated by comparing treatment costs with the cost of a prevention program. When survivors' subsequent unrelated health care costs are included in the calculation, however, the overall cost of disease prevention rises. What have not been studied to date are the secondary effects of fatal disease prevention measures on social security systems. From the perspective of a policy maker responsible for a social security system budget, it is not only future healthcare costs that are relevant for budgeting, but also changes in the contributions to, and expenditures from, statutory pension insurance and health insurance systems. An examination of the effect of longer life expectancies on these insurance systems can be justified by the fact that European social security systems are regulated by the state, and there is no clear separation between the financing of individual insurance systems due to cross-subsidisation. This paper looks at how the results of cost-comparison analyses vary depending on the inclusion or exclusion of future healthcare and non-healthcare costs, using the example of colorectal cancer screening in the German general population. In contrast to previous studies, not only are future unrelated medical costs considered, but also the effects on the social security system. If a German colorectal cancer screening program were implemented, and unrelated future medical care were excluded from the cost-benefit analysis, savings of up to a,not sign548 million per year would be expected. The screening program would, at the same time, generate costs in the healthcare sector as well as in the social security system of a,not sign2,037 million per year. Because the amount of future contributions and expenditures in the social security system depends on the age and gender of the recipients of the screening program (i.e. survivors of a typically fatal condition), the impact of age and gender on the results of a cost-comparison analysis of colorectal cancer screening are presented and discussed. Our study shows that colorectal cancer screening generates individual cost savings in the social security system up to a life expectancy of 60 years. Beyond that age, the balance between a recipient's social security contributions and insurance system expenditure is negative. The paper clarifies the relevance of healthcare costs not related to the prevented disease to the economic evaluation of prevention programs, particularly in the case of fatal diseases such as colorectal cancer.

Some literature describes resilience as a return to conditions before a shock. Other resilience writing embraces a complex systems perspective. For other fields, resilience describes the ability of people, regions or ecosystems to thrive despite adversity. We conclude that although the resilience metaphor poses the danger of fuzziness and necessitates careful specification of space and time boundaries in studying resilience phenomena, it proves useful for illuminating regional change and linking different types of regional stresses to alternative resilience frameworks.","[Pendall, Rolf; Cowell, Margaret] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Foster, Kathryn A.] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA",Cornell University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Pendall, R (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 214 W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",rjp17@cornell.edu; kafoster@buffalo.edu; mmc75@cornell.edu,,"Pendall, Rolf/0000-0001-8516-495X",,,,,37,455,529,31,213,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The Trade Organization (WTO) is thus required to interact with other international institutions in order to come to an arrangement for dealing with these 'trade and ...' linkage areas. The relationship between the WTO and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) could in many respects serve as a model. The picture that emerges when the various forms of interaction of the two organizations are assessed is that they benefit most from complementarity. Thus,for example, the WIPO offers detailed intellectual property rules, whilst the WTO supplements this with effective dispute settlement This advantage may largely be due to the fact that the WTO has incorporated many of the WIPO rules into its own law. One of the recommendations put forward here is for other 'trade and ...' spheres to do the same. On the other hand, the analysis highlights a number of problems that occur when two institutions cross paths. One such difficulty is a potential conflict of lain To help to resolve it, the WTO dispute settlement system should give greater consideration to the provisions of non-WTO law. Sonic hope for this is given in the US-Copyright case, but it is questioned whether this still holds in view of more recent caselaw.

One of the problems when developing a new product is a high-risk of investment return that prevents many companies from innovation and development of new products. In order to reduce the risk, a model of innovation diffusion should be included in a new product development. There are few theories in literature that examine diffusion of new products, but they focus on specific segments of diffusion process. Within the scope of this work, we propose a model of product diffusion in the market based on the concepts of systems thinking and the methodology of system dynamics. The model focuses on comprehensiveness, and it helps the management to understand the diffusion process. Using the model, one can simulate how the market will accept a product depending on its specific characteristics. Based on the predictions, it is possible to choose the optimal characteristics of a product for the predefined market. Furthermore, we discuss an application to the development of a new e-learning product.","[Kalinic, Hrvoje; Kostanjcar, Zvonko; Jeren, Branko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Kalinic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",hrvoje.kalinic@fer.hr,"Kalinic, Hrvoje/E-9532-2017","Kalinic, Hrvoje/0000-0002-8567-851X",,,,,47,0,0,0,15,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Private expenditure, consists mostly of out-of-pocket and under-the-table payments. Such payments strongly suggest dissatisfaction with the public system, due to under financing during the last 25 years. This gap has been filled rapidly by the private sector. From this point of view, one might suggest that the flourishing development of private provision may lead in turn to a corresponding growth in private health insurance (PHI). This paper aims to examine the role of PHI in Greece, to identify the factors influencing its development, and to make some suggestions about future policies and trends. In the decade of 1985-1995 PHI show increasing activity, reflecting the intention of some citizens to seek health insurance solutions in the form of supplementary cover in order to ensure faster access, better quality of services, and increased consumer choice. The benefits include programs covering hospital expenses, cash benefits, outpatient care expenses, disability income insurance, as well as limited managed care programs. However, despite recent interest, PHI coverage remains low in Greece compared to other EU countries. Economic, social and cultural factors such as low average household income, high unemployment, obligatory and full coverage by social insurance, lead to reluctance to pay for second-tier insurance. Instead, there is a preference to pay a doctor or hospital directly even in the form of under-the-table payments (which are remarkably high in Greece), when the need arises. There are also factors endogenous to the PHI industry, related to market policies, low organisational capacity, cream skimming, and the absence of insurance products meeting consumer requirements, which explain the relatively low state of development of PHI in Greece.","[Siskou, Olga; Kaitelidou, Daphne; Liaropoulos, Lycourgos] Univ Athens, Dept Nursing, Ctr Hlth Serv Management & Evaluat, Athens 11527, Greece; [Economou, Charalampos] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, Athens 17671, Greece; [Kostagiolas, Peter] Ionian Univ, Dept Arch & Lib Sci, Corfu 49100, Greece; [Siskou, Olga; Kaitelidou, Daphne; Economou, Charalampos] Cyprus Open Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Panteion University; Ionian University; Open University of Cyprus,"Siskou, O (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Nursing, Ctr Hlth Serv Management & Evaluat, 123 Papadiamantopoulou Str, Athens 11527, Greece.",olsiskou@nurs.uoa.gr; dkaitelid@nurs.uoa.gr; chaecono@otenet.gr; pkostagiolas@ionio.gr; lliaropo@nurs.uoa.gr,"Kaitelidou, Dafni/AAA-2599-2020; Kostagiolas, Petros/U-1556-2018; Economou, Charalampos/AAZ-9275-2021","Kostagiolas, Petros/0000-0001-8974-1128; Kaitelidou, Daphne/0000-0002-4881-3567; Economou, Charalampos/0000-0003-4511-9470",,,,,33,19,23,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Several methods for modelling such data have been suggested in the literature to cope with these problems. This paper compares the performance of several alternative estimators, including two-part models and generalised linear models. The dependent variable is household expenditure on health care in Greece, a country where out-of-pocket health expenditure is higher than anywhere else in the European Union, whether as a proportion of GDP, as a share of all health spending, or in per capita terms. To facilitate comparison of model performance, household health expenditure is examined in two different specifications: expenditure on all health care (where zero values are rare) and expenditure on hospital services alone (where zero values are common). In the case of expenditure on all health care, three of the estimators performed almost equally well in terms of three alternative model performance indicators: a modified two-part model with non-linear least squares in the second part, a constant-variance generalised linear model and a variance-proportional-to-mean generalised linear model. In the case of expenditure on hospital services, the constant-variance generalised linear model out-performed the rest. The findings suggest that no estimator is best under all circumstances, while most alternative estimators are likely to produce relatively similar results. The paper concludes by discussing implications for further research.","[Matsaganis, Manos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ, Athens 10434, Greece; [Mitrakos, Theodore] Bank Greece, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Matsaganis, M (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ, Patiss 76, Athens 10434, Greece.",matsaganis@aueb.gr,"Tsakloglou, Panos/AAF-2099-2020","MATSAGANIS, EMMANUEL/0000-0002-0369-6280",,,,,18,12,12,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It involves building out a beach with sand dredged from another location. This paper develops a positive model of beach nourishment and generates testable hypotheses about how the frequency of nourishment responds to property values, project costs, erosion rates, and discounting. By treating the decision to nourish as a dynamic capital accumulation problem, the model produces new insights about coupled economic geomorphological systems. in particular, determining whether the frequency of nourishment increases in response to physical and economic forces depends on whether the decay rate of nourishment sand exceeds the discount rate.

But, the development of supply contracts does not mean that private or public auction procedures should be abandoned. Similarly, by supplementing forest area development schemes, it would be possible to increase the mobilisation of timber produced on small (I to 10 ha) and medium (10 to 25 ha) forest estates: more forestry cooperatives or local forest agencies and a new timber pre-sale mode adapted to small forest estates are necessary (sales subject to the buyer's choice of purchasing standing timber or cut wood delivered to a depot by the seller).

It examines why the risk-constructivism neglects questions of the material production of risks in favor of questions of their communicative construction, while the risk-realism does it the other way round. Subsequently the possibilities of a synthesis of both approaches are being considered. The societal functions of risk-constructions are accordingly not limited to their efficacy in the sphere of social communication processes. They lie as well in the field of regulation of the metabolism of societies and their ecological environment. The validity of risk-constructions is consequently not only bound to their cultural weightiness, whether one believes in them or not, but to their capacity to manage realities, measured by their ability to bring expectations in accordance with events. Risk-constructions are not only transformed in the milieu of discourses, but also in the context of social practices which give the opportunity to acquire experiences and to perform learning processes in order to optimize risk-constructions as regulative instruments.

In this paper, I will discuss some advantages and disadvantages of engaging with CIS networks emanating from federal government agencies and North American Indian communities. However, in both cases there are concerns among American Indians about the Security of proprietary knowledge and information held in digital repositories. Digital technologies like CIS must be considered in relation to the future of indigenous knowledge systems. Indigital is a neologism that describes the emerging relationship between indigenous knowledges and digital technologies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For the study of the asymmetry, the Johansen cointegration analysis was used while at the same time two dynamic models were estimated: The Error Correction Model (ECM Model), and the LSE-Henry general to specific model (GETS model). With the assistance of the cointegration technique, we surveyed the existence of a long-run relationship between the producers and the consumers in the Greek round wood market, while the application of the Granger causality test has shown that the consumer price Granger causes the producer price whereas the reverse is not valid. Furthermore, the application of the GETS model confirmed the existence of asymmetry in the price transmission mechanism within the round wood market. Finally, the role of imports in the determination of the producer prices is vital and is confirmed by the findings of the cointegration technique and the Granger causality test.

This vegetable did not gain much popularity until it was discovered to have a high nutritional and medicinal value. An experiment was conducted to identify growth characteristics including propagation methods, best time of planting, productivity and the economics of cultivation. The experiment consisted of 18 genotypes collected from various naturally growing forest areas. These were planted during July-August 2006. Growth and yield attributes and their correlations were observed. Growth parameters like the number of fruit/plant and fruit yield/plant exhibited high heritability, which coupled with high genetic advance as a percent of mean, indicated criteria for selection of suitable genotypes. The genotypes AAI/S-1 and AAI/S-4 were found to be high yielding with an average yield of 606 g and 649 g/plant, respectively. All the genotypes were tested for nutritional value, but there were no significant difference among the genotypes. The average nutritional value per 100 g edible fruit was found to contain 84.1% moisture, 7.7 g carbohydrate, 3.1 g protein, 3.1 g fat, 3.0 g fibre and 1.1 g minerals. It also contained small quantities of essential vitamins like ascorbic acid, carotene, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin. It was concluded that this crop can be successfully cultivated in the plains and urban areas, as well as in countries where sub-tropical and tropical conditions prevail. This crop can provide additional nutrients and help the body develop natural immunity from many common ailments.","[Singh, D.; Bahadur, V.; Singh, D.

These opportunities are more plentiful considering perennial crops and the traceability of agricultural products. Precision Agriculture has been developed more intensively for grains, which gives more opportunity for the development of technological tools for site-specific management of perennial crops, like citrus. Besides, the traceability of fruits is an immediate and strategic necessity in order to face non-economical issues for exporting, like phytosanitary measures. Therefore, for developing countries like Brazil, it is very important to development technologies to identify the origin and history of fruit in the market chain for its major exporting products. For the last five years, at the Embrapa Agricultural Instrumentation Center in Brazil, some of these opportunities have been explored in order to start the development of an information system and associated tools to make possible the integration of traceability and the site-specific management system for perennial crops. The use of sensors, fixed and on-board instrumentation, wired and wireless networks, and advanced methodologies have been applied for precision agriculture and traceability for citrus.

This paper analyzes the gendered employment outcomes of various investment options in Kenya using Social Accounting Matrix multiplier analysis. Results reveal that Kenya's agriculture sector accounts for the highest increase in employee compensation (mainly benefiting skilled labor and disproportionately benefiting men), while its manufacturing sector accounts for the largest share of job creation. Although women stand to benefit more from employment creation, most of these new jobs are informal with low wages. Kenya's gender disparities are a reflection of existing disparities in its labor market and socioeconomic structure. Therefore, policies aimed at addressing the constraints that limit women's effective participation in the Kenyan labor market, including increasing productivity and raising women's skills, are important for allowing men and women to benefit equally from employment and growth-promoting opportunities.","[Wanjala, Bernadette Mukhwana] Kenya Inst Publ Policy Res & Anal, Macroecon Div, Nairobi 00200, Kenya; [Were, Maureen] Cent Bank Kenya, Nairobi 00200, Kenya",,"Wanjala, BM (通讯作者)，Kenya Inst Publ Policy Res & Anal, Macroecon Div, POB 56445, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.",bwanjala@yahoo.com; sikalimw@centralbank.go.ke,"Wanjala, Bernadette/AAV-1497-2021","Wanjala, Bernadette/0000-0002-9443-5341",,,,,45,12,17,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Methods CW scales were elaborated according to various methodologies in order to isolate the scale allowing the most adequate financing system, i.e. approaching the real costs as much as possible. Twelve scales were created. They vary according to the type of data used, according to DRGs and severities of illness included within the scale, and according to the variable used in order to isolate outliers. Results For a similar case-mix, Hospitals H2 and H5 would see their financing increased through a prospective system based on the selected CW scale (No. 6). This modification would generate a reduction in financing going from -1 to -9% according to hospitals. Conclusions The cost database created made it possible to create a CW scale according to a technique which could constitute the first step of a PPS if advantages of a such financing system were established. In the Belgian context, it would be probably judicious to envisage regional databases allowing diversified methodological approaches whose results would be confronted, discussed, and coordinated at the federal level.","[Pirson, M.; Delo, C.; Martins, D.; Leclercq, P.] Univ Libre Brussels, Dept Econ Sante, Ecole Sante Publ, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Pirson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Brussels, Dept Econ Sante, Ecole Sante Publ, CP592,806 Route Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",magali.pirson@ulb.ac.be,,"Pirson, Magali/0000-0001-8468-3184",,,,,6,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Few non-experimental empirical studies shed light on contextual circumstances driving the extent of rent dissipation and overexploitation. We utilize a high-resolution data set to estimate a behavioral model of fishermen's spatial choices. A unique policy setting allows us to measure the degree to which individual fishermen's choices appear aimed at mitigating the tragedy of the commons in a small numbers setting. We find evidence of partial mitigation in excess of what we would expect under pure self-interest but short of what would occur under group-maximizing behavior. We also examine how contextual factors in the fishery shape the degree of cooperation within the fishing season and find evidence that competition for the common pool resource distorts fishermen's implicit cost of distance creating a form of common property inertia.

The role of the threshold value for a QALY has been given little consideration in these checklists, even though the importance of a factor as a cause of between country differences in CE depends on this threshold. In this paper, we study the impact of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY on the importance of transferability factors in the case of smoking cessation support (SCS). We investigated, for several values of the WTP, how differences between six countries affect the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of SCS. The investigated factors were demography, smoking prevalence, mortality, epidemiology and costs of smoking-related diseases, resource use and unit costs of SCS, utility weights and discount rates. We found that when the WTP decreased, factors that mainly affect health outcomes became less important and factors that mainly effect costs became more important. With a WTP below a,not sign1,000, the factors most responsible for between country differences in INMB were resource use and unit costs of SCS and the costs of smoking-related diseases. Utility values had little impact. At a threshold above a,not sign10,000, between country differences were primarily due to different discount rates, utility weights and epidemiology of smoking-related diseases. Costs of smoking-related diseases had little impact. At all thresholds, demography had little impact. We concluded that, when judging the transferability of a CE study, we should consider the between country differences in WTP threshold values.","[Vemer, Pepijn; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

In this research, cluster analysis is used to group 180 countries contained within the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM), using cross-sectional data for per capita gross domestic product (GDP), forest coverage, and per capita consumption of forest products, for forest products including plywood, particleboard, fiberboard, newsprint, printing and writing paper, and other paper and paperboard. The application of cluster analysis prior to estimating the elasticities of demand solves the problem of data availability in estimating elasticities by grouping countries based on variables identified from economics theory and enabling the extension of elasticity estimates to countries that are similar to others in a cluster, but without data for directly estimating elasticties. Mean absolute deviation is used for data standardization, and the k-medoids approach and silhouette technique are used in cluster analysis. Statistics of clusters for every forest product show various combinations of countries with similar levels of per capita GDP, forest coverage, and consumption, such as a cluster with high per capita GDP, low forest coverage, and high consumption of the discussed forest product. The results of the cluster analysis are validated by a one-way analysis of means and multiple comparisons. Countries for panel analysis are selected based on time series data availability and quality. As implied by cluster analysis, some of the countries in the cluster can be used to represent the whole cluster. In this research, long-run static models, short-run dynamic models, and long-run dynamic models of demand are estimated using panel data analysis for countries in each cluster using data from 1992 to 2007 and 9 to 44 countries in each cluster. We found that long-run dynamic elasticities are higher than short-run dynamic estimations, and dynamic model estimations outperform static model estimations as shown in RMSE statistics.

Three different approaches are studied: worry, indifference and competitiveness and by use of unique longitudinal data individuals are followed from childhood to middle age. Worry and indifference about the future is positively linked to economic hardship and social problems in the family of origin. Indifference towards the future in adolescence is also related to adverse adult living conditions, such as economic hardship and low educational attainment. A competitive outlook of the future finally, is not linked to living conditions in childhood, but shows a strong and positive relationship to mortality risk up to age 48. Although the mechanism behind this relationship cannot be determined by the present study, type-A-personality is suggested as factor of possible relevance. The study demonstrates how social factors forming young individuals' life chances also impact the future outlooks of these individuals, and how these outlooks in their turn independently affect adult living conditions.

We conclude that salary differentials are a far less effective tool for retaining teachers with strong preservice qualifications than for retaining other teachers in schools with high proportions of minority students. Consequently large salary differences would be needed to level the playing field when schools are segregated. This conclusion reflects our finding that teachers with stronger qualifications are both more responsive to the racial and socioeconomic mix of a school's students and less responsive to salary than are their less-qualified counterparts when making decisions about remaining in their current school, moving to another school or district, or leaving the teaching profession.","[Clotfelter, Charles T.; Ladd, Helen F.; Vigdor, Jacob L.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Ladd, HF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",charles.clotfelter@duke.edu; hladd@duke.edu; jacob.vigdor@duke.edu,,,,,,,46,68,124,2,36,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The Regulation also introduces as of 2017 a new administration of rules of origin whereby origin declarations are made upon registered exporters designation of the certifying authorities. The aim of this article is twofold. The first is to analyse the EC reform to assess the major changes from previous rules of origin; the second aim is to briefly analyse the foundation, evidence, and studies that have underpinned such reform.

J,"Evans, SK",,,,"Evans, Sandra K.",,,Connecting adaptation and strategy: The role of evolutionary theory in scenario planning,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this study, evolutionary theory is used to analyze and critique the strategic process of scenario planning. We argue that scenario planning can be strengthened as a theory- and practice-oriented process through the incorporation of evolutionary theory in the scenario narrative process, and in the subsequent implementation phases in response to environmental change. First, this paper addresses scenario planning in relation to theoretical perspectives on strategic planning and forecasting. Then, the concepts of variation, selection, retention, organizational learning and inertia are used to analyze scenario planning as a strategic process. This study argues that because scenario planning mirrors modes of variation and selection at the organizational level, evolutionary theory is a useful approach for assessing the plausibility of scenario narratives and strengthening the theoretical foundation of scenario planning as a process. By utilizing an evolutionary framework throughout the scenario planning process, this method has a better chance of encouraging exploratory strategic thinking without reinforcing non-blind variation or inertial practices. Concepts including inertia can also be used to better address bias and myopia in the scenario planning process. Additionally, evolutionary theory can be used to assess how entities learn from the outcomes of scenario planning as the environment changes over time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is oriented to supporting the functioning and development of innovation systems, and involves mutual learning processes, involving stakeholders and experts of many kinds. Such FTA calls for crossing the boundaries of disciplines, research traditions, and professional activities FTA then necessarily involves knowledge management (whether this be formal or implicit); and this knowledge management has to confront the challenges created by FTA's call for engagement across different - and across potentially competing - corporate, sectoral, and public interests. This paper explores the consequences of this view of FA and how the roles of various FTA methods and tools are seen in terms of knowledge management. It goes on to discuss the implications that follow for FTA design, and the methodological challenges, and requirements for development of tools, techniques and principles, for FTA.

This article examines the scope of CSR amongst a test case of transnational food manufacturing corporations. It focuses on the determinants of CSR that stem from the financialization of business strategies and how these define and prioritize social commitments and roles within such firms' internal organization. CSR policies, shareholder-value strategies and the rationalization of UK operations amongst four of the biggest global firms show a bias towards 'external' and brand-related priorities rather than 'internal' ones of job security and the social capital of workplace communities. The negotiated closure of two specific plants confirms an incompatibility between treating employees as stakeholders and, on the other hand, CSR as a business strategy. The 'financialized' approach to shareholder value shapes business strategy to prioritize corporate brand image and reputation rather than attempting sustainable operations and stakeholder partnerships.","[Jones, Bryn] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Nisbet, Peter] Univ W England, Sch Business, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bristol; University of West England,"Jones, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",hssbj@bath.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,26,27,1,75,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The article starts with an evaluation of the different rival taxonomies and definitions for futures studies, and proceeds to discuss the very concept of paradigm. Are there paradigms in this discipline? If we think there are, what kind of arguments can we use to define those? I argue that there have been two paradigms in the evolution of futures studies so far, and there are signs of emergence of a new one. Both of the existing paradigms have had many rival macro-level methodological approaches, ontological and epistemological branches, and phases of evolution. The first paradigm is the age-old prediction tradition that combines thinking about the future into mystic explanations. This line of thinking bases its argument on the deterministic future and effects of the world of spirits. The second paradigm was basically started in the U.S. military after World War II. This modern line of thinking bases its argument on indeterministic futures, probabilities, aim to control and plan, modelling and systems thinking, and the effects of external trends. The new emerging paradigm may base its line of thinking on disconnecting from the western control based technical thinking, and accepting internal dynamic fluctuations, paradoxes and dialectic thinking.

Despite the role consumer preferences have played in WTO disputes, in association with the 'like' products concept, there has not been enough focused examination of their specific influence, particularly in disputes on ethical public policy issues, such as environmental or health regulations. To this end, this paper examines key GATT Article III disputes, pointing out that they included attempts both to measure, and also to interpret, consumer preferences. The latter approach becomes more tempting when consumer preferences are difficult to measure; import bans or restrictions associated with ethical public policy regulations can bring about such a situation. A hypothetical dispute about EC biofuels sustainability criteria demonstrates this problem. Options to make the concept of consumer preferences more coherent include limitations on how they can be invoked, and an increased commitment to capturing them through measurement.","Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Lydgate, EB (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London, England.",emily.lydgate@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,18,9,10,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2011,10.0,2,,,,,165,188,,10.1017/S1474745610000492,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,763UC,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290584200001,0

Whereas there is no concrete selection of areas added in the group of strictly protected forests, the impact on annual lost income due to forest management not carried out in protected forests was assessed according to two different assumptions: 1. changing the status of forests without management restrictions (formal commercial forests) into the strictly protected ones; 2. changing the status of forests with management restrictions (formal protection forests) into the strictly protected ones. Achieving the target set by the Estonian Forest Development Programme, increasing the share of strictly protected forests up to 10%, an additional 39,000 ha of forest land will be out of management. Increasing the conservation area by 1.8% by forests without management restrictions, the reduction in potential net revenue will be 2% per year. Achieving the goal by conserving the forests with management restrictions, the total income will decrease by 0.76-1.9% per year. To realize the goal set by the Estonian Forestry Development Programme until 2010 and 2020 to enlarge the protected forest area up to 10% from one side, and the current economic recession on the other side, the economic solution could be enlarging the conservation on forests with management restrictions.

The main findings of the paper are: i) Comovement between Slovenian and European stock markets is time-varying; ii) There are significant return spillovers between the Slovenian and European stock markets; iii) Return spillovers are not just time-varying, but also scale dependent; iv) The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 has increased comovement between the Slovenian and European stock markets; v) As the scale (frequency) increases, we can observe larger discrepancies between DCC-GARCH and wavelet correlation estimates suggesting one should resort to rolling wavelet correlation estimates when making longer horizon international portfolio decisions.","[Dajcman, Silvo; Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,48,4,4,2,12,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We study the relative efficacy of state sales tax waivers, income tax credits, and non-tax incentives and find that the type of tax incentive offered is as important as the generosity of the incentive. Conditional on value, sales tax waivers are associated with more than a ten-fold increase in hybrid sales relative to income tax credits. In addition, we examine how adoption varies with fuel prices. Rising gasoline prices are associated with greater hybrid vehicle sales, but this effect operates almost entirely through high fuel-economy vehicles. By comparing consumer response to sales tax waivers and estimated future fuel savings, we estimate an implicit discount rate of 14.6% on future fuel savings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

While the overall share of agriculture on national gross domestic product has also been falling, the need for qualified people in agriculture is still eminent as the shift to sustainable agriculture appears to be one of the key priorities of governments in the US and Canada. One of the ways how to facilitate interest of prospective students to study agriculture is to diversify the programs through offering of more major options. It is important to study the motivation and other stimuli for the choice of major in order to adapt the educational programs and attract more students. In the paper, factors influencing the choice of major are studied by analyzing survey data from the only agricultural college in Atlantic Canada. The results show significant differences in the socioeconomic background among the prospective students based on the choice of major. For example, students interested in social sciences much more appraise more choices of major than students in biophysical fields. Based on the findings from the analysis, several recommendations are made. It is suggested, for example, that for students interested in biophysical sciences, sport plays an important role and thus, appropriate promotional campaign about recreation and sport facilities of a post-secondary agricultural educational institutions should be conducted. Analysis in this paper may serve many educational institutions in agriculture as a guide how to deal with existing or potential decline in enrollment by diversifying their major portfolio using appropriate promotional campaigns.","[Prochazka, Petr; Smutka, Lubos; Steininger, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,,pprochazka@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Steininger, Michal/H-3191-2018; Prochazka, Petr/H-6918-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Steininger, Michal/0000-0002-8121-8567; Prochazka, Petr/0000-0002-3292-7930",,,,,16,2,2,0,13,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2183-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,230,240,,,,,,11,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BYZ55,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799300026,0

The paper identifies major fresh food cases where supply chains have faced a variety of challenges. Drawing upon the supply chain literature, a framework is developed that can be adopted to formulate a range of strategies for the fresh produce industry. The responsive supply chain framework encompasses integrated upstream and downstream supply chain technologies, lean practices and sustainable strategies for fresh food producers. The framework is flexible and holistic in its application, accommodating supply chain innovation, technology, logistics competencies, risk management, carbon cost reduction and benchmarking, and is supported externally by appropriate industry bodies, government policies and regulation.

Already one of the fastest growing waste streams, e-waste is a sustainability challenge that shadows the pervasive uses of electronic devices in contemporary society. Previous studies have not only shown the toxicity and risks inherent in the hazardous waste but also economic value generated from its reuse and recycling and the environment justice implications of the existing transboundary movement of e-waste to developing countries. Responding to this multifaceted issue requires a transdisciplinary attempt at synthesis understandings, if not solutions. This paper reflects on an educational experiment to encourage disciplinary boundary crossing in the e-waste community through a summer school. The NVMP-StEP E-waste Summer School housed young researchers from diverse disciplines with a common research interest in e-waste. The event is evaluated against three sets of criteria that underpin successful transdisciplinary ventures: (i) clear, problem-oriented goals, (ii) careful preparation, institutional support and competent management, and (iii) communication and collaboration. Based on understandings and insights gained from the participation in the Summer School, participant surveys, and communications with organizers, six recommendations are outlined to help making similar events a better ground for transdisciplinarity in the future.

In this paper, we synthesize lessons front two comparative case studies of decentralized forest management in Mesoamerica and East Africa in order to examine the institutional factors that contribute to successful tropical forest management in developing countries and, draw insights for policymakers regarding how national policy initiatives. including REDD+, might better embed local level institutions for forest management within broader state institutions and promote more positive local livelihoods and forest conservation outcomes. The case studies presented in this synthesis used a consistent research framework to gather data on forestry reforms, governance processes, local forest institutions, household forest uses and forest conservation outcomes. Our synthesis suggests that successful sustained forest management depends on institutional arrangements that (1) establish local resident rulemaking autonomy, (2) facilitate the flow of external financial and institutional assistance for monitoring and enforcement of local rules, and (3) buffer residents and their respective local institutions from more powerful, and at times corrupt, actors and agencies involved in forest exploitation. The results particularly suggest a role for external, independent non-governmental organizations to help mediate demands on local forest governance systems in nested contexts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

What is the role of multiple images in complex sustainable development issues, and what are promising approaches to deal with their associated problems? We report current insights from selected cases from TransForum, a large-scale innovation programme toward transition of Dutch agriculture. Our preliminary results show that that simple images can cause a disregard of complexity and that a negative societal image can stifle a project's innovative potential. Images need to me monitored and managed to increase the future potential of innovation projects. Visualisation techniques may foster taking complexity into account in an innovation project. Furthermore, increasing image awareness can help a project to adapt more effectively to existing societal discourses and the images embedded in them.

Based on a national survey of urban foresters, arborists, and other officials responsible for urban forest management within U.S. municipal governments, results indicate that local governments are interested in selling carbon offsets. An estimated Probit discrete choice model shows that the chance of a city participating in carbon trading is positively influenced by a number of factors including: (1) level of urbanization, (2) management's knowledge of carbon sequestration, (3) revenue generation from offset sales, (4) population education level, and (5) familiarity with carbon market institutions such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The cost of living, as reflected by median home prices, appears to be inversely related to the probability of participation. Currently, a number of cities have the technical and managerial capacity to establish quality carbon offset criteria such as enforceability, additionality, verifiability, and baseline establishment. However, many cities are still unaware of carbon sequestration opportunities, and there appears to be a fundamental disconnect to market participation. The results also suggest that municipal governments would gain from a better understanding of the costs and benefits associated with urban forest carbon storage. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Villagers, foresters, park employees, entrepreneurs and environmentalists were surveyed. The survey applied a multi-group social choice method, following six steps: (i) identification of all relevant social states for sustainable forest management; (ii) elicitation of preferences, for different social states, of forest user groups' members; (iii) determination of attributes of users and social states; (iv) aggregation of individual forest value preferences into social value preferences; (v) inter-group comparison of preferences; and (vi) estimation of predictors of social forest value preferences. A distinction is made between the household-perspective and the citizen-perspective of evaluations. As well, socio-economic and institutional-legal attributes of stakeholders were tested as predictors of stakeholder preferences. The major findings include the following. First, non-consumptive forest uses, including ecosystem services, were given highest priority by all stakeholders. Second, consumptive values were weighted more discriminately, while non-consumptive values were viewed more holistically. Third, forest dependence and environmental-resource-entitlements lead to more household consumption-based valuations; whereas, the appreciation of diverse forest values increases with the education of people. Fourth. the stakeholders exercise higher consensus on the importance of non-consumptive uses when such values are evaluated in the context of societal needs but not as household needs; consumptive uses registered the opposite effect. This finding signifies the separation between individual-conscience and social-conscience corresponding with the evaluation of consumer needs and societal needs, respectively. Thus, societal allocations, such as biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services, must be based on valuations specifically formulated in the context of eliciting collective social judgments.

More parents are delaying their child's entry, and U. S. states are moving school entry cutoffs earlier, mainly because older students outperform younger ones on many educational outcomes. Much of the literature interprets advantages held by older students as benefits to entering school older, but because entering older means being older when students take tests, it is unknown if performance differences are attributable to entry age or test age. Policy and parent behavior depend on which age effect matters more. Using a natural experiment from the province of British Columbia, Canada, that temporarily altered entry dates, I estimate an upper bound of the test age effect and a lower bound of the entry age effect.

Exogenous course assignment does affect the composition of students' classroom peer groups in subsequent years.

This article contributes to that goal by presenting a detailed study of the emergence of small-scale wood energy production practices in Finland. Given the distinctive and institutionally strong orientation of Finnish forestry towards raw material production for the pulp and paper industry, such innovative ways of using forest resources seem somewhat improbable and surprising. Despite this, we argue that the development of these new production practices can be understood as a process of institutional renewal that combines elements of continuity and novelty. In our empirical analysis, we follow the emergence of a new forest management category of young forest and explore how its naturalization as part of various institutional rules, identities and practices enabled the birth of local wood energy production within the forestry sector. In order to elucidate this multidimensional change, we analyze the new forest category as a boundary object. a socio-technical category with multiple functions and identities, within the large technological system of forestry. These analytical concepts help us illuminate how various material and discursive practices-both in the forestry and energy sectors and at the local and national levels-were able to interact for innovation and institutional change.

In particular, the important role of school principals in hiring teachers is rarely considered. Using interviews of school principals in a midsized Florida school district, we provide an exploratory mixed methods analysis of the teacher characteristics principals prefer. Our findings contradict the conventional wisdom that principals undervalue content knowledge and intelligence. Principals in our study ranked content knowledge third among a list of twelve characteristics. Intelligence does appear less important at first glance, but this is apparently because principals believe all applicants who meet certification requirements meet a minimum threshold on intelligence and because some intelligent teachers have difficulty connecting with students. More generally, we find that principals prefer an individual mix of personal and professional qualities. They also create an organizational mix, hiring teachers who differ from those already in the school in terms of race, gender, experience, and skills, and an organizational match, in which teachers have similar work habits and a high propensity to remain with the school over time. Because of tenure rules, many principals also prefer less experienced (untenured) teachers, even though research suggests that they are less effective.","[Harris, Douglas N.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Rutledge, Stacey A.; Thompson, Cynthia C.] Florida State Univ, Coll Educ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Ingle, William K.] Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Harris, DN (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, 213 Educ,1000 Bascom Mall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dnharris3@wisc.edu; rutledge@coe.fsu.edu; wingle@bgsu.edu; ctto3@garnet.acns.fsu.edu,"Ingle, William Kyle/K-9313-2019","Ingle, William Kyle/0000-0001-7299-1403",,,,,34,67,140,1,20,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The possibility to defer tracking to age 12 does not attenuate school-entry age's effect on track attendance.

For this purpose an approach is developed that includes a linear programming model to estimate the Positive Mathematical Programming production cost function coefficients of current agricultural-forestry activities. It further includes a heuristic - simulated annealing - to generate solutions for each policy scenario. This model base approach is integrated within a decision support system (DSS) for testing purposes. The DSS further encompasses a relational database that stores agricultural-forestry technical and economic data and a geographic information system that stores topological data of regional farm-type land units. The DSS Graphical User Interface provides tabular and geographical reporting capabilities. Results are discussed for an application to the Alentejo region in Southern Portugal. Results demonstrate the usefulness and relevance of the proposed approach to assess the impact of changes in prices and in agricultural policy on land use patterns and on forestry.

Analyses were performed with a panel data set of biennial observations from 1972 to 2002 on a cross section of sixteen western Washington counties. Production structure was examined using Allen and Morishima partial elasticities of substitution, own- and cross-price factor demand elasticities, and total factor productivity decomposed into scale effects and technical change effects. Allen and Morishima substitution elasticities agreed that capital and labor were most easily substituted inputs. Own-price elasticity at the regional level showed that capital demand was the most responsive to changes in own-price while log demand was least. Demand for logs was virtually unresponsive to changes in capital and labor price, suggesting that producers had little flexibility to reduce total costs by substituting away from log inputs. Total factor productivity increased by 1.54% every two years on average: productivity gains in the industry were dominated by scale effects. Hicks-neutral technological change was rejected; technical change bias was sawlog-saving, capital-using, and labor-neutral Results suggest that policies influencing log costs had the greatest impact on sawmill viability.

A standard cost analysis methodology was used as the initial base, similar to the evaluation method currently being applied to telemedicine, and to which we suggest adding subsequent stages that enhance the scope and sophistication of the analytical methodology. We completed the methodology with a longitudinal and stakeholder analysis, followed by the calculation of a break-even threshold, a calculation of the economic outcome based on net present value (NPV), an estimate of the social gain through external effects, and an assessment of the probability of social benefits. In order to illustrate the advantages, constraints and limitations of the proposed framework, we tested it in a paediatric cardiology tele-expertise network. The results demonstrate that the project threshold was not reached after the 4 years of the study. Also, the calculation of the project's NPV remained negative. However, the additional analytical steps of the proposed framework allowed us to highlight alternatives that can make this service economically viable. These included: use over an extended period of time, extending the network to other telemedicine specialties, or including it in the services offered by other community hospitals. In sum, the results presented here demonstrate the usefulness of an economic evaluation framework as a way of offering decision makers the tools they need to make comprehensive evaluations of telemedicine networks.","[Le Goff-Pronost, Myriam] Telecom Bretagne, Ecole Super Telecommun Bretagne, LUSSI MARSOUIN CREM,GET ENST Bretagne, Dept LUSSI Log Usages Sci Sociales & Sci Informat, F-29238 Brest 3, France; [Sicotte, Claude] Univ Montreal, Dept Hlth Adm, Stn Downtown, Montreal, PQ, Canada",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Atlantique; Universite de Montreal,"Le Goff-Pronost, M (通讯作者)，Telecom Bretagne, Ecole Super Telecommun Bretagne, LUSSI MARSOUIN CREM,GET ENST Bretagne, Dept LUSSI Log Usages Sci Sociales & Sci Informat, Technopole Brest Iroise,CS 83818, F-29238 Brest 3, France.",myriam.legoff@telecom-bretagne.eu,,,,,,,48,23,27,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper demonstrates the potential use of a highly participatory scenario development framework that involves a mix of qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. The assumption is that the use of semi-quantitative methods will structure the participatory output, which provides a solid base for quantification. It should further facilitate the communication between stakeholders and modellers. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps is the main semi-quantitative method and has a central place in the proposed framework. The paper provides a detailed description of its implementation in participatory workshops, also because of a lack of documented testing of its implementation. We tested Fuzzy Cognitive Maps as part of the framework in two training sessions; both gave encouraging results. Results show that the tool provides a structured, semi-quantitative understanding of the system perceptions of a group of participants. Participants perceived the method as easy to understand and easy to use in a short period of time. This supports the hypothesis that Fuzzy Cognitive Maps can be used as part of a scenario development framework and that the new framework can help to bridge the gap between storylines and models.

For financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, the market risk plays a significant role. The market risk arises from unexpected changes of market prices of equities, interest rates, foreign currencies, and commodities. In this paper, we estimate the market risk of internationally diversified equity portfolio on the basis of the Value at Risk methodology. In order to model the particular risk factors (stock indices and related currencies) Levy models are utilized. These estimated marginal distributions are then coupled together by elliptical ordinary copula functions (Student and Gaussian copula). Parameters of the models are estimated by means of canonical maximum likelihood method. In order to assess the quality of models, basic descriptive statistics of portfolio returns distribution along with the Value at Risk and the Conditional Value at Risk are measured.","[Kresta, Ales] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kresta, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",ales.kresta@vsb.cz,"Kresta, Aleš/L-1251-2019; Kresta, Aleš/J-8603-2013","Kresta, Aleš/0000-0001-8621-3493; Kresta, Aleš/0000-0001-8621-3493",GACR (Czech Science Foundation) [402/08/1237]; SGS project of VSB-TU Ostrava [SP/20104],GACR (Czech Science Foundation)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); SGS project of VSB-TU Ostrava,The support of GACR (Czech Science Foundation) under the project No. 402/08/1237 and the SGS project of VSB-TU Ostrava SP/20104 is acknowledged.,,24,1,1,0,2,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Stated preference choice experiment data from each survey are analyzed using repeated, rank ordered random parameters logit models, and welfare estimates are calculated and compared for each baseline for a variety of possible improvements. The willingness to pay (WTP) results reflect positive, but diminishing, marginal utility for improvements in the western stock population, regardless of baseline future: WTP increases for population improvements until the population greatly exceeds the current population, at which point the WTP for additional improvements levels off Similarly, as would be expected, WTP for improvements to the western stock population decreases as the future baseline population forecast improves.","[Layton, David F.] Univ Washington, Daniel J Evans Sch Publ Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rowe, Robert D.] Stratus Consulting, Boulder, CO 80306 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lew, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",Dan.Lew@noaa.gov; dflayton@u.washington.edu; browe@stratusconsulting.com,"Lew, Daniel K./AAL-3013-2021","Lew, Daniel/0000-0002-3394-138X",Alaska Fisheries Science Center; Northwest Fisheries Science Center; Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission,Alaska Fisheries Science Center; Northwest Fisheries Science Center; Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission,"The authors thank Lowell Fritz, Ron Felthoven, Pat Livingston, Doug DeMaster, Rich Ferrero, Alan Haynie, and others at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center; Todd Lee at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center; and Dave Colpo at the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission for their support of this research.

An increased demand for ecological, social and cultural services derived from forests is observed. This paper is based on the study on development and marketing of non-market forest goods and services (FORVALUE Study). It presents some of the key issues concerning the non-market forest goods and services, including: the importance of non-market forest goods and services in the EU; the challenge of marketability; and the role of new governance principles in the development and marketing of non-market forest goods and services. It shows that non-market forest goods and services are considered important in the EU. It discusses different policy and institutional strategies to address the challenge of their marketability. Finally, it shows that development and marketing of non-market forest goods and services call for new governance principles, such as stakeholder participation, cooperation, cross-sectoral coordination and institutional arrangements.","[Ramcilovic, Sabaheta] European Forest Inst, Joensuu, Finland",,"Ramcilovic, S (通讯作者)，European Forest Inst, Joensuu, Finland.",,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,3,EUROPEAN FOREST INSTITUTE,JOENSUU,"TORIKATU 34, FIN-80100 JOENSUU, FINLAND",1237-8801,,978-952-5453-35-5,EUR FOREST INST PROC,,,2010,58.0,,,,,,81,91,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Forestry,BUJ82,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289533100011,0

The findings, using the 2002-3 Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS; Spanish Statistical Office 2003), support the doing-gender hypothesis in the case of housework: a woman's relative share of housework fails to decrease with her relative earnings beyond the point where her earnings are the same as her husband's. In contrast, a woman's share of childcare time displays a flat pattern over the distribution of her spouse's relative earnings. This last result is neither consistent with traditional theories of the household, nor with the doing-gender hypothesis. It can, however, still be interpreted in light of social norms, whereby women specialize in this type of caring activity regardless of their relative productivity or bargaining power.","[Sevilla-Sanz, Almudena] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Sevilla-Sanz, Almudena] Univ Oxford, Ctr Time Use Res, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Ignacio Gimenez-Nadal, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Fac Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Fernandez, Cristina] Bank Spain, Res Dept, Madrid 28014, Spain",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Zaragoza; Banco de Espana,"Sevilla-Sanz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",almudena.sevilla@economics.ox.ac.uk; ngimenez@unizar.es; cfvidaurreta@gmail.com,"Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/H-4276-2015","Gimenez-Nadal, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-1610-5451",,,,,61,97,103,3,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The aim of the study was to identify the most pronounced forest related conflicts in south-eastern Europe (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia) at the policy and management levels in terms of types, conflicts dimensions, actors and their attitudes. Data were collected on policy level by semi-structured mail questionnaire with multiple-choice, ranking, and a few open-ended questions and on management level by face-to-face interviews in chosen case study areas. All collected data were assembled in a joint database consisting of 505 questionnaires and 111 interviews from case studies. Results revealed forestry related conflicts with significant differences between countries. The most often mentioned were: forestry vs. nature protection, forestry vs. wood processing industry, forestry vs. grazing and overgrazing, forestry vs. building and construction and forestry vs. water management. For case studies areas the Nature and National parks were chosen. In most cases conflicts appears between public forestry and environmental sectors. They were manifested in wide range of actions, from silent conflict far away from public, over disputes, argues and discussions on meeting and public forums up to intensive lobbying and political influence. Overlapping legislation, struggle for competencies, different interests, values and attitudes of forestry and nature conservation sector is likely source of these conflicts. The conflict management was introduced either at the beginning of the conflict or when the conflict escalated, carried out by relevant governmental and public institutions which are at the same time stakeholders of the protected areas.

The latter scenario reflects actual industry trends between 2004 and 2008. Impacts on endogenous output, employment, factor income, and household income are assessed. We also estimate changes in a measure of household welfare and compare model results against actual change in pollock and seafood prices. Few examples of CGE studies addressing fisheries issues appear in the literature. This study is unique in that it includes more disaggregated industry sectors and examines supply-side shocks that are difficult to address using fired-price models. This study also overcomes a serious deficiency in models that use unadjusted seafood sector data in IMPLAN (IMpact analysis for PLANning) by developing the fish harvesting and processing sectors independently from available data, supplemented by interviews with key informants to ground-truth industry cost estimates.","[Waters, Edward C.] EC Waters Consulting, Beaverton, OR 97008 USA; [Seung, Chang K.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Waters, EC (通讯作者)，EC Waters Consulting, Beaverton, OR 97008 USA.",edwaters@hotmail.com; Chang.Seung@noaa.gov,,,"National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Fisheries Science Center","National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Fisheries Science Center","The authors acknowledge funding and support from the National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Fisheries Science Center.",,26,16,21,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Using data on New York City public schools from. 996 to 2002 and exploiting within-school variations, we examine relationships among grade span, spending, and size. We find that school grade span is associated with differences in school size, class size, and grade size, though generally not with spending and other resources. In addition, we find class size and grade size differences in the same grade level at schools with different configurations, suggesting that school grade span affects not only school size but also class size and grade size. We find few relationships, though, between grade span and school-level performance, pointing to the need to augment these analyses with pupil-level data.

Because direct measures of legal capacity are elusive, these studies have had to use indirect proxies, such as per capita income or number of delegates in Geneva. Yet, the reliability of these measures is questionable. To gauge legal capacity more directly, we surveyed all WTO Members, posing questions concerning their professional staff, bureaucratic organization at home, bureaucratic organization in Geneva, experience handling general WTO matters, and involvement in WTO litigation. Using responses from this survey, we constructed an index of Members' WTO legal capacity that speaks more fully to the challenges of dispute settlement than do commonly used proxies, none of which are strongly correlated with our measure. We supplemented this survey with over three dozen semi-structured interviews with Members' representatives in Geneva, the results of which bear out the importance of properly measuring legal capacity.","[Busch, Marc L.] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Reinhardt, Eric] Emory Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Shaffer, Gregory] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Georgetown University; Emory University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Busch, ML (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mlb66@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,15,99,113,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2009,8.0,4,,,,,559,577,,10.1017/S1474745609990085,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,507TG,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270877200004,0

This outcome is explained by combining insights into the politics and political economy of taxation with a theoretical approach to understanding institutional change which takes conflict seriously. Institutional arrangements typically emerge as settlements of inherently contradictory goals, and their foundational contradictions are not necessarily eliminated through processes of reproduction. Our case study illustrates how conflicting interests generate susceptibility to institutional change and shape its trajectories. While recent extensions to path-dependency theory suggest that institutions become vulnerable when returns decrease, we find that change may result from unbalanced returns (increasing for some while decreasing for others) or altered conditions which unleash repressed conflicts of interest. Further, in contrast to the expectation that institutional evolution follows a unidirectional path in which reversals are unlikely, we identify a dialectical trajectory which potentially includes the revival of seemingly foregone alternatives.","[Koreh, Michal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Social Work, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shalev, Michael] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shalev, Michael] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Koreh, M (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Social Work, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",korehm@mscc.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,103,14,16,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

These new mechanisms of environmental governance were an intersection point of three significant discourses in global politics: those of participatory democracy, private governance, and sustainable development. By analysing these three discourses around partnerships for sustainable development, this paper aims at revealing the larger frames of reference and the meta-narratives that explain why and how institutions like partnerships for sustainable development have emerged and how they have actualised. Using key concepts from and discourse theoretical approaches of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, the paper focuses on the negotiations of formal international organisations as a practice of discourse institutionalisation. By recognising that the international negotiations can result in these institutions to carry contestations and conflicts, it traces the dilemmas inherent in partnerships, that reflect shifts in the discourses of environment and development.

The model specifies interactions between teacher effects and students' predicted scores on a test, estimating both average effects of individual teachers and interaction terms indicating whether individual teachers are differentially effective with students of different predicted scores. Using various longitudinal data sources, we find evidence of these interactions that is of relatively consistent but modest magnitude across different contexts, accounting for about 10 percent of the total variation in teacher effects across all students. However, the amount that the interactions matter in practice depends on the heterogeneity of the groups of students taught by different teachers. Using empirical estimates of the heterogeneity of students across teachers, we find that the interactions account for about 3-4 percent of total variation in teacher effects on different classes, with somewhat larger values in middle school mathematics. Our findings suggest that ignoring these interactions is not likely to introduce appreciable bias in estimated teacher effects for most teachers in most settings. The results of this study should be of interest to policy makers concerned about the validity of value-added teacher effect estimates.","[Lockwood, J.

Addressing the regulatory challenges of globalization, the so-called 'Basel Process' provides policy makers with a unique institutional arrangement that straddles the gap between the old and the new geographies of financial markets.

Two contrasting arguments are examined: the relative skill specificity thesis advanced by Iversen and Soskice [Iversen, I and Soskice, D.

Numbers, Narratives, and the integration of Research and Theory, New York, Oxford University Press]. Both arguments are based on the concept of asset specificity from transaction cost economics. However, they offer conflicting expectations. Iversen and Soskice expect employees with relatively specific skills to demand more job security regulations so as to increase the likelihood that there will be a return on investment. In contrast, Goldthorpe's reasoning implies that employees with very specific skills are difficult to replace. Consequently, they are less concerned about their job security than employees with few specific skills. Analysis of survey data lends support to Goldthorpe's replaceability thesis.","Univ So Denmark, Ctr Welf State Res, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Emmenegger, P (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Ctr Welf State Res, Odense, Denmark.",emm@sam.sdu.dk,,,,,,,59,27,29,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Simulations reveal that CEP generally provides a higher expected benefit for districts where students who take the course attend private colleges or universities (including public institutions out of state) and perform on the AP exam around national norms. AP favors high schools where students taking the course either face inexpensive costs for study at institutions of higher education or perform exceptionally well on the AP exam.

The direct benefit results from the disclosure of previously private information which is valuable to potentially harmed parties. Previous theoretical and empirical analyses of such programs restrict attention to the former benefit while the stated motivation for such programs highlights the latter benefit. When disclosure yields both direct and indirect benefits, policymakers face a tradeoff between inducing truthful self-reporting and deterring emissions.

In Such utopias, individual needs are described as unrestricted, and economic and technological change is said to be unlimited - as if the society were to have a perpetuum mobile at its command. The two examples connected With Such expectations are the atomic/nuclear society and the hydrogen economy. Although these two utopias do differ, their many similarities are the focus of this article. They are similar in that they both invoke the dream of controlling a virtual perpetuum mobile, propose an expert/lay knowledge gap, downplay any risks involved, and rely on a public relations campaign to ensure the public's collaboration with companies and politicians. I thus connect these two different utopias, discussing them as a part of the modern history of energy production and consumption. Making this connection clarifies some lessons for future energy planning, such as the need for reflection on and critical engagement with utopias, awareness of how a more participatory democratic process may be secured regarding energy issues, and the negative consequences if risk is described in solely economic terms.

A probit model was used to analyze the data. In Israel, the significant HBM categories affecting nurses' decision to get a flu shot are the perceived benefits from vaccination and Cues to action. In addition, nurses who are vaccinated have higher levels of (1) knowledge regarding the vaccine and influenza, (2) perceived seriousness of the illness, (3) perceived susceptibility, and (4) health motivation than do those who do not get the vaccine. Immunization of healthcare workers may reduce the risk of flu outbreaks in all types of healthcare facilities and reduce morbidity and mortality among high-risk patients.

Overeducation is found to be more common among recent labor market entrants. while undereducation is more likely among older workers. Among immigrants, greater pre-immigration labor market experience is associated with poorer job matches, presumably due to the less-than-perfect international transferability offoreign experience. A longer duration in the US, however, is associated with a lower probability of being overeducated and a greater probability of being undereducated. This is consistent with immigrants being favorably selected for occupational advancement but this effect becomes realized only after overcoming the disadvantages of the less-than-perfect international transferability of their pre-immigration skills.

Forestry professionals and other forest users in Central Labrador were shown simulation results of three alternative forest management scenarios illustrating possible long term effects on various indicators. Forest values and attitudes towards forestry were measured before and after the presentation. Our conception of values and attitudes is based on the cognitive hierarchy model of human behaviour which states that values are more enduring and more difficult to change than attitudes. It was thus hypothesized that attitudes would change but not values and that change in forestry professionals would be less than in other forest users since foresters are trained to think about long-term effects and large-scale processes of forest management scenarios. We also hypothesized that a greater number of people would have an opinion on forest management after the presentation. All three hypotheses were partially supported by the results. The results indicated that some attitude change occurred. but that values also changed somewhat. Most of the significant changes occurred when persons with no clear opinion on several forest-related questions formed an opinion. Long-term, landscape simulation results provide valuable information and enhance understanding of both forestry professionals and other forest users. However, being provided the same information, the two groups learned different things. While forest users gained more confidence in the current forest management plan and were motivated to further participate, professionals learned more specific things. This reflects differences between technical and local knowledge. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Second, the territorial structure of the state has indeed been in question but largely as a result of bottom-up forces contesting it, in part, on distributional grounds.

The industry is situated on the high-rainfall north Queensland coast adjacent to two natural icons: the Great Barrier Reef to the east and World Heritage-listed rainforest areas to the west. The main environmental concern is agricultural industry pollutants harming the Great Barrier Reef. In addition to environmental issues the banana industry also suffers financial pressure from declining margins and production loss from tropical cyclones. As part of a broader government strategy to reduce land-based pollutants affecting the Great Barrier Reef, we facilitated formation of a pilot banana producers group to address these environmental and economic pressures. Using an integrated farming systems approach we worked collaboratively with these producers to conduct an environmental risk assessment of their businesses, and then to develop best management practices BMP) to address environmental concerns. We also sought input from technical experts to provide increased rigour for the environmental risk assessment and BMP development. The producers' commercial experience ensured new ideas for improved sustainable practices were constantly assessed through their profit-driven 'filter' thus ensuring economic sustainability was also considered. Relying heavily on the producers' knowledge and experience meant the agreed sustainable practices were practical, relevant and financially feasible for the average-sized banana business in the region. Expert input and review also ensured that practices were technically sound. The pilot group producers then implemented and adapted selected key practices on their farms. High priority practices addressed by the producers group included optimising nitrogen fertiliser management to reduce runoff water nitrification, developing practical ground cover management to reduce soil erosion and improving integrated pest management systems to reduce pesticide use. To facilitate wider banana industry understanding and adoption of the BMP's developed by the pilot group, we conducted field days at the farms of the pilot group members. Information generated by the pilot group has had wider application to Australian horticulture, and the process has been subsequently used with the north Queensland sugar industry. Our experiences have shown that integrated farming systems methodologies are useful in addressing complex issues like environmental and economic sustainability. We have also found that individual horticulture businesses need on-going technical support for change to more sustainable practices. One-off interventions have little impact, as farm improvement is usually an on-going incremental process.

The local farmers fail to compete with the high quality and low priced imported vegetables. The problems in disposing off the horticultural produce depress the farmers and this negatively affects local horticultural production and farm income. Commercialization of the small horticultural sector requires the development of market-oriented production, as opposed to the occasional sale of subsistence surplus. Success in commercializing this sector depends on the orientation of production to meet market demand and on the removal, or reduction, of a broad range of production and marketing constraints. A survey based study was conducted in Botswana in the year 2007-08 focusing on the identification of the problems associated with small scale horticultural production and marketing, their causes and possible suggestions thereof. Pareto analysis was used to prioritize (ranking) the problems and their causes. A total of ten problems in horticultural production were identified and, poor access to inputs, high fuel costs, pests and diseases, high input costs, insufficient infrastructure, lack of finance, shortage of skilled labour, and breakdown of irrigation systems were found to be the major production problems (85.23% contribution). Out of the seven problems identified in horticultural marketing; insufficient production and inconsistent supply of local produce, high transportation costs, poor marketing infrastructure, high competition with imports, and lack of marketing skills were the major marketing problems (84.36% contribution). The causes of each of the marketing problems were also identified and ranked. Subsidized fuel price, increase area under cultivation, effective implementation of efficient cropping plan, easy access to finance, building new market places, proper dissemination of market information, establishment of Agro Service Centers and revision of existing import policy were among the suggestions to minimize the marketing problems in Botswana.",,,,,,"Baliyan, Som Pal/0000-0003-0789-883X",,,,,5,2,2,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,31,40,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700003,0

A study was conducted in the Southern blocks of the South 24 Parganas district to assess the extent of a farmer-led innovation - the practice of cultivating vegetables on ail (bund). In the early 1990s, Nimpith Krishi Vigyan Kendra provided technical support to cultivate vegetables in the upland regions during post-monsoon to winter, but as only 10% of the available land was upland, farmers started growing vegetables on the ail of paddy fields after raising and broadening the earthen boundary of the fields previously used to demarcate an area, conserve soil and water and provide easy access to the fields. On average, 5-10% of the field was available for vegetable cultivation. The farmers who first received training from the KVK developed the practice of ail cultivation. They modified and developed some practices including crop and varietal choice, spacing, nutrient use, intercropping and multi-tier cropping systems, according to their individual situations. Some of these farmers formed farmer extension groups and undertook across group exposure visits. As a result, farmers in neighbouring villages and onlookers also adopted the practice. An income of Rs 15,000/bund (1x400 m) per annum is reported. Both agricultural research and extension can draw lessons from the case by experimenting with this model for scaling up the extension service and mainstreaming the extension service delivery mechanism.","[Basu, D.; Banerjee, S.] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Nadia, W Bengal, India; [Goswami, R.] Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Univ, Kolkata 700103, W Bengal, India",Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University,"Basu, D (通讯作者)，Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Nadia, W Bengal, India.",,"Goswami, Rupak/E-1030-2013","Goswami, Rupak/0000-0002-5998-4396",,,,,8,2,3,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,155,159,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300013,0

During 1998-2004, we conducted an annual survey of households in the two villages, Baka and Daka, which represent different stages in the shift from a subsistence agroecosystem to a rubber plantation-dominated system in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Significant negative correlations were observed between gross income and dependence on NTFPs-generated income in both Baka and Daka villages (P=0.029 in Baka and P=0.028 in Daka), which is supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy households. When the rubber price dropped during 1998-2001. the NTFPs income of Baka increased greatly from US$59.10 to US$145 per household, or from 6.4% to 26.6% of household gross income. In contrast, in Daka village, NTFPs income increased by insignificant amounts of US$1.6 per household in 1998 to US$23.8 in 2001, but this was compensated by an increase in income from off-farm work of US$11 to US$147 (an increase from 1.8% to 16.2% of gross income per household) from 1998 to 2001 in Daka. NTFPs retained important roles both in alleviating risk associated with monoculture price fluctuations and in generating income for relatively poor people.

Rebalancing decisions are manifested in the revision of holdings through sales and purchases of assets. We assume that the assets are sufficiently liquid that market impacts can be neglected. We propose to solve the portfolio optimization problem in two steps: first, the phase of stock selection and second, the asset allocation phase. For the stock selection, we use principal component analysis to reduce the number of characteristics that will be taken into account. After that, applying clustering techniques, we find the similarities between the assets and we obtain a partition of the set of assets in clusters. Taking one element from each class, we get the set of assets that will be used to build the optimal portfolio. Once the stock selection completed, the optimal portfolio is obtained using an algorithm that combines the specific features of the convex programming with approximation techniques. The unique nature of our work is the combination of the classification theory with the portfolio optimization techniques and the study of this approach. To illustrate the behaviour of the proposed method, we consider the case of a portfolio of assets from Bucharest Stock Exchange.","[Fulga, Cristinca; Dedu, Silvia; Serban, Florentin] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Math, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Fulga, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Math, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Serban, Florentin/C-7105-2012; Fulga, Cristinca/A-8726-2011; Dedu, Silvia/C-6923-2012; Dedu, Silvia/AFP-3662-2022","Dedu, Silvia/0000-0001-7195-0941; FULGA, Cristinca/0000-0002-6880-2697",,,,,20,15,16,0,31,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We begin by defining the spurious regression and the notion of nonstationary, the departure point for cointegrated series. We explain the meaningful core of cointegration, as equilibrium process, as well as the connection with the error correction model and with the Granger Representation Theorem. As the proof of the mentioned theorem offers a deeper understanding of the mechanisms lying behind the presented phenomena,, we decided to also provide a sketch of the proof The article continues with procedures used to test for the existence of cointegration and to estimate the cointegration vectorial space. In order to support this, we will revise, as methodology and as well as logical deduction. the Engle Granger two stage procedure, mainly utilized in bivariate systems, and the Johansen procedure, utilized in multivariate systems. As an applicative study, we have chosen to set up a study on the stock market. The capital market having the stock exchange series evolving as Random Walk processes proves itself being an excellent candidate in testing the cointegrated systems. We have chosen three series of stock exchange indexes, from Romania, France and US, series with daily frequencies. Using unit root tests Dickey Fuller, we find that the three series are nonstationary, moreover each of the series is integrated of first order. Afterwards we test the existence of cointegration with the Engle Granger procedure. We find that the series BET and CAC40 are cointegrated, thus we can estimate an error correction model, and we find that about 2% of the distance between the two series is corrected daily, as we have daily observations. Eventually we run the Johanses procedure - the three series form a cointegrated system, the dimension of the cointeration space is one.","[Ruxanda, Gheorghe; Stoenescu, Smaranda] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ruxanda, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,2,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Overall, children in schools with a high immigrant concentration score lower on reading and math test scores. The negative effects associated with attending a school with a high immigrant concentration are fairly robust across estimation methods. IV estimates, taking into consideration that parental sorting across neighborhoods might bias the OLS estimates, indicate that immigrant concentration in schools is still important in determining children's math test scores. The estimates are less precise regarding the effect of immigrant concentration on reading test scores. The immigrant concentration in the school has a stronger effect for native children than for immigrant children, but the differences are more pronounced for the math test. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, recent research questions the validity of the value-added approach by showing that it does not mitigate student-teacher sorting bias (its presumed primary benefit). Our study explores this critique in more detail. Although we find that estimated teacher effects from some value-added models are severely biased, we also show that a sufficiently complex value-added model that evaluates teachers over multiple years reduces the sorting bias problem to statistical insignificance. One implication of our findings is that data from the first year or two of classroom teaching for novice teachers may be insufficient to make reliable judgments about quality. Overall, our results suggest that in some cases value-added modeling will continue to provide useful information about the effectiveness of educational inputs.","[Koedel, Cory] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Betts, Julian R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Betts, Julian R.] NBER, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Koedel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 118 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",koedelc@missouri.edu; jbetts@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,22,78,131,0,25,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

A clean and secure energy future, where renewable energy accounts for between 50% and 80% of total energy demand, is the most favorable scenario for the future of renewable energy but also the scenario that takes the greatest amount of commitment, in terms of time and money from businesses, individuals, governments, and policy makers.

The specific component that needs to be replaced during the lifetime of the final good creates a secondary market where independent remanufacturers enter the competition. An environmental regulation imposing a minimum level of remanufacturability is also introduced. The main results establish that, while collusion of the firms on the level of remanufacturability increases both profit and consumer surplus, a social planner could use collusion as a substitute for an environmental regulation. However, if an environmental regulation is to be implemented, collusion should be repressed since competition supports the public intervention better. Under certain circumstances, the environmental regulation can increase both profit and consumer surplus. Part of this result supports the Porter Hypothesis, which stipulates that industries respecting environmental regulations can see their profits increase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Secondly, even if this is the case we argue that universities attracting more students with a vulnerable socioeconomic background will not be rewarded for raising their teaching effort in the same way as other universities.

The case study looks at the industrial city of Steyr which is located in a highly dynamic region in Upper Austria and has to compete with other regional industrial centres and on the global market with internationally acting companies in the automotive sector. For finding local strategies to cope with globally induced pressures and changes several foresight techniques and transdisciplinary approaches have been applied such as interviews, photo elicitation, workshops and scenario building. The transdisciplinary case study is reflected by exploring three major research questions: first, how does transdisciplinarity work in practice, second, what are the benefits and limitations of transdisciplinary research in regional foresight processes and third, how can transdisciplinary research contribute to initiating a long-term process for building sustainable networks and structures in the region. Some answers can be given from the empirical example of Steyr. The case study shows that particularly in regions with a long industrial history and tradition and where existing paradigms cannot easily be overcome, a transdisciplinary procedure provides clear advantages over sole expert solutions.

Although the different strands of institutionalism offer distinct ontological pathways for understanding the dynamics of change in social-ecological systems, none can independently account for the inherent complexity of such transformations. Using the struggle to achieve sustainable forest resource governance within the Canadian context as a backdrop for further investigation, this paper provides a succinct overview of the strengths and limitations of neo-institutional theories applicable to the study of change in public property regimes. We argue that in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of change, analysts require a meta-theoretical approach that not only provides complementary insights into how rules change over time, but also pushes the boundaries of conventional analysis to consider the constitutional arrangements that structure collective action and the subsequent performance of forest governance structures.

On the need and impossibility of a sustainability science,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POST-NORMAL SCIENCE; CLIMATE; ENVIRONMENT; POLITICS,"In this article, I develop a constructive critique of 'post-normal science' by challenging the underlying conception of 'normal science'. Invoking Bruno Latour's constructivist approach, I change focus from a representationalist understanding to a practice-inspired account of science in which the composition of a matter of fact necessarily implies a politically significant differentiation between internalities and externalities. Contending that science has never been normal in that it has always already been political, I further elaborate on this political dimension by connecting Latour's concepts of matters of fact and matters of concern with Rudolf Boehm's distinction between logical and topical truth. Whereas logical truth is a measure of the validity of matters of fact, topical truth is a measure of the relevance and adequacy of scientific knowledge regarding a particular matter of concern. This allows me to argue that any attempt to install a new 'post-normal science' with a higher topical truth visa-vis sustainability issues neglects the irreducible political moment situated at the point of determining who and what we should be concerned about. Finally, I draw on the notion of 'forms of life' to suggest a 'politics of the imaginable' that takes socio-material practices as primary matters of a concern for sustainability.

We analysed an anonymised administrative data set for inpatients treated in hospitals in Victoria, Australia 2003-2004. The data set included patient-level cost, clinical markers, demographic and episode variables. The data set was analysed to identify codes, which indicated the presence of malnutrition or its treatment. Linear regression was used to ascertain to what extent malnutrition affected the cost of admission. Controlling for the underlying condition and any treatment administered, recorded malnutrition is estimated to add AU $1,745 per admission. The total cost of coded malnutrition to the Victorian public hospital system in 2003-2004 was estimated to be least AU $10.7 million. Only 1.87% of inpatients were coded as malnourished. As administrative data are known to underreport the prevalence of malnutrition, our estimate represents a credible lower boundary on the true cost of inpatient malnutrition.","[Rowell, D.

Nominal rates of assistance or producer support estimates are incomplete indicators, especially when (as in many developing countries) some commodities are taxed and others are subsidized, in which case positive contributions can offset negative contributions. This paper develops and estimates a new set of more-satisfactory partial equilibrium indicators of the relative contribution of different farm policy instruments to reductions in agricultural trade and welfare. It does so by drawing on the trade restrictiveness index literature and a recently compiled database on distortions to agricultural prices for 75 developing and high-income countries over the period 1960 to 2004. Results confirm earlier findings that border taxes are the dominant instrument affecting global trade and welfare, but they also suggest declines in export taxes contributed nearly as much as cuts in import protection to the trade and welfare effects of agricultural policy reforms since the 1980s.","[Croser, Johanna; Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Croser, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",johlou@gmail.com; kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,28,12,12,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2011,10.0,3,,,,,297,323,,10.1017/S1474745611000176,0.0,,,27,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,783XB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000292116700001,0

However, despite some success stories, conservation of natural resources (particularly forests) in conjunction with socio-economic development - which is the precondition for sustainable development - remained a challenge in most of the developing countries. In Pakistan, too, natural forests in the Northwestern highlands continue to be depleted in spite of numerous interventions, by the international donors, to conserve the remaining forests. This paper uses a sustainable development perspective, and attempts to study the quest by the forest conservation and development interventions - initiated by the overseas development aid - regarding operationalisation of sustainable development as conceived by the projects' implementing agencies and thereby comparing it with local implementation context in terms of perceived impact/usefulness, and participation of stakeholders in the projects. This paper argues that, without considering socio-economic realities at micro (village) level, one cannot envisage the success of conservation and development interventions by considering only structural and meso (national/regional) levels. Forestry should be seen in a multi-stakeholder scenario where various actors have different claims and entitlements over forest resources. Major challenge for international development donors is to ensure a balance of power between stakeholders. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, Harding and Pagan (2002, 2006) have provided an econometric toolkit for the analysis of these cycles, and this has resulted in a recent surge in researchers using these methods to analyze developing country business cycles. However, the existing literature consists of diminutive samples, and the majority of the studies fail to consider the statistical significance of the concordance statistics. To address this shortfall, this paper examines the business cycle characteristics and synchronicity for thirty-two developing countries. Furthermore, the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan are included. This provides benchmarks upon which to compare the characteristics of the developing country cycles and also to examine the degree of synchronization between developed and developing countries. Significantly, this research reveals that business cycles of developing countries are not, as previously believed, significantly shorter than those of the developed countries. However, the amplitude of both expansion and contraction phases tends to be greater in the developing countries. Furthermore, a clear relationship is exhibited between the timing of business cycle fluctuations and periods of significant regional crises, such as the Asian financial crisis. However, the more specific timing of the onset of these fluctuations appears to be determined by country-specific factors. Moreover, there are no clear patterns of concordance either within regions or between developed and developing country business cycles.","Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England",University of London,"Male, R (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.",r.male@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,23,24,2,16,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

They are being subjected to dramatic physical deterioration and rapid social and economical decline. Enriching relationships between local tradesmen associations, local authorities and non-governmental organisations through a structured engagement process can deliver innovative new revitalisation approaches and design options towards sustainable futures of historical commercial districts both in Turkey and in the world. This paper presents a community engagement model, which can be seen as the revival of a guild system (Lonca), which is unique to Ottoman Turkish culture, for the sustainable future of a historical commercial district in a Turkish city, Bursa. One of the main objectives of this study is to discuss and evaluate successes and failures of this community engagement model. Other objective of the paper is to discuss the effectiveness of this civil organisation for creating scenarios about sustainable future of a historical commercial district. The key finding of this study shows community engagement models should support public decision making by developing a coherent framework to identify the sustainable future scenarios with multi- or interdisciplinary collaborations.

Healthy pine trees in low density stands offer the best defense against the SPB, helping to ensure that timber resources and other benefits of forests are protected against infestations. This study evaluates the preferences of forestland owners for selected forest management treatment practices (e.g., thinning) offered under this program. An attribute-based choice experiment approach was used to achieve the task. Results indicate that replanting is the option most favored by forestland owners, while prescribed burning is observed to produce disutility.

Policy-makers and other actors traditionally involved in forestry-related decision-making have to tackle and apply new concepts and tools, like public participation, networking and governance mechanisms. These issues are taken into consideration in the paper, using a research approach based on six explicatory-exploratory case studies in Italy. New ideas and tools are slowly entering the Italian forest policy arena as a result of international driving forces like the global dialogue on forests and the growing demand for responsible behaviour and transparency. Case studies are analyzed considering two main types of decision-making processes (one based on conventional-hierarchical/government approach and the other on innovative-networking/governance approach), the position and role of different stakeholders, the special role of public authorities, the efficacy and efficiency of (eventual) negotiation and adaptation processes. Policy change processes and policy learning processes, and their relationships, are considered. Three case studies have been selected to represent 'unsuccessful examples' of governance as a collective learning process, at three different scales (national, regional, local). These include the FLEGT Action Plan implementation at national level; the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 developed by Veneto Region; and a forest camping site in the Dolomites at local level. Three other case studies have been selected as 'encouraging examples'. These include the Strategic Framework Programme for Forests at national level, the afforestation/reforestation programme to create forests in plain areas in Lombardy at regional level and, finally, the creation of a peri-urban forest close to Venice at local level. Two main scenarios are likely in terms of changes possibly deriving from a collective learning process due to adoption of new governance approaches in the Italian forestry context: i) 'no real changes', which mainly occurs when national level policies and actors are involved and when a conservative approach prevails (limited or no interactions among different actors, with a dominant 'government learning' approach); and ii) 'slight changes', which usually occurs when local level policies and actors are involved, and when a tentative-innovative approach prevails, sometimes with the specific goal of improving governance, mainly based on a 'lesson-drawing learning' approach. Key-factors to establish more favourable conditions for starting-up or consolidating positive examples for governance as a collective learning process in Italy are presented and discussed in the final recommendations.

Need for achievement and locus of control had a significant relationship with normative commitment.","[Cetin, Emre Ipekci] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm Sci, Dept Econometr, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,,ecetin@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Ipekci Cetin, Emre/C-4615-2016",,,,,,30,0,0,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7248-710-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,23,30,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BFL06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000320340400003,0

Findings suggest that obstacles to progress in using time-use data to inform policy include: an overemphasis on accounting for women's unpaid work within the framework of the United Nations System of National Accounts; a neglect of a clear distributive justice agenda tied to measuring and valuing unpaid work; and inadequate design of some TUS. However, there are now signs of emerging new analytical frameworks and agendas that link time-use data collection more directly to policy. These agendas are likely to be more fruitful in promoting the use of time-use data in policymaking.","Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Inst Ciencias, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Esquivel, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Inst Ciencias, JM Gutierrez 1150,B1613GSX, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",vesquive@ungs.edu.ar,,"Esquivel, Valeria/0009-0003-2296-4388",,,,,91,17,18,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Evidence From Vietnamese SMEs,FEMINIST ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender; fringe benefits; Vietnam,SMALL BUSINESSES; INEQUALITY; WAGES,"This contribution studies the provision of fringe benefits using a unique survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam. Analysis of the survey reveals that women who own SMEs are more likely than men who own similar firms to provide employees with fringe benefits such as annual leave, social benefits, and health insurance. This gender effect exists especially with regard to mandatory social insurance and is robust to the inclusion of standard determinants of wage compensation. The study also explores whether this finding is linked to gender differences in social networks and workforce structure, worker recruitment mechanisms, and the degree of unionization. However, these factors cannot fully account for the observed differences in fringe benefits along the ogender of ownero dimension.

Also we want to test how many students know the concepts of volunteering and non-governmental organization. It is considered that the majority of the students know what volunteering is, but the number of those familiar with the concept of non-governmental organization is smaller. A very important aspect of our research concerns the way in which students perceive the benefits of performing a voluntary work activity. It is supposed that those involved or willing to be involved in volunteering activities consider as potential benefits: the experience for a future job or the opportunity to know other people.

It is currently one of the key objectives of the board. Taking the lead over IT by the board and chief executive officer prevents security breaches, project failure, the company's reputation damage. Fraud scandals at the beginning of 21st century did raise the bar for audit standards worldwide. The management is required to report on the quality of the internal control over financial reporting. The transparency of running the business increases the interest of potential investors. The information becomes the most important asset of the company and very often determines the market position and that is why the security of the organization's information is extremely important. Modern IT solutions not only make the operational side of the business easier but also help to make the strategic decisions faster based on the accurate data from the IT system. The most typical benefits of it are greater competitiveness and better shareholder returns. The article attempts to present the idea of IT Governance. The main aim is to highlight the importance of the IT solutions and their impact on the business. The paper is composed of four parts. The first part presents the background of the IT Governance. It explores latest fraud scandals as results of failures in the corporate governance and IT systems. The second presents definitions of IT Governance and attempts to explain the idea of it. There are also presented the most typical and most obvious benefits of IT Governance implementation and its positive impact on the whole organization. The third part focuses on the description of the main areas of the organization where the IT Governance is present and the last part shows the main functions, some benefits and impacts on the business performance.","[Urbanczyk, Agnieszka] Cracow Univ Econ, PhD Program, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Urbanczyk, A (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, PhD Program, Krakow, Poland.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,WYZSZA SZKOLA BIZNESUNATL-LOUIS UNIV,NOWY SACZ,"ZIELONA 27, NOWY SACZ, 33-300, POLAND",2543-540X,2543-5388,978-83-88421-79-2,BUS NON-PROFIT ORGAN,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,253,264,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE4CM,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000371503100017,0

This argument is particularly true as the basic idea of REH maintains that expectations in an uncertain world are formed under assumptions where no systematic errors and information are fully utilized. However, empirical findings from the present study showed diverse evidence of rationality in business operational forecasts formed by Malaysian agriculture firms, as capital expenditure expectations were found to be irrational but gross revenue expectations were supportive of the REH proposition. This implies that the survey of business forecasts may not work well in reflecting the true business outlook, specifically in value-related operational forecasts, which in turn would directly influence investment decisions as well as the capital budgeting process.","[Wong, Shirly Siew-Ling; Puah, Chin-Hong; Abu Mansor, Shazali] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Kuching, Malaysia",University of Malaysia Sarawak,"Wong, SSL (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Kuching, Malaysia.",shirlywong87@hotmail.com; chpuah@feb.unimas.my; mshazali@feb.unimas.my,"Puah, Chin-Hong/O-9658-2018",,University Malaysia Sarawak; Fundamental Research Grant [FRGS/05(27)781/2010(62)],University Malaysia Sarawak; Fundamental Research Grant,The authors acknowledge the financial support of the University Malaysia Sarawak and Fundamental Research Grant No. FRGS/05(27)781/2010(62).

The strategy uses market prices, thereby avoiding some of the measurement problems associated with the constructed or prosy prices used in common valuation methods. A charter fee hedonic equation is estimated using data from the market for offshore charter fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The marginal value of,sportfishing harvest is identified using spatial variation in harvest rates and fish sizes. A two-stage minimum distance estimator is used to address potential omitted variables and cluster-sampling issues. Our results demonstrate that valid estimates of the marginal value of sportfishing harvest can be derived directly using market prices. The estimated marginal value per fish is consistent with published estimates using alternative methods. Thus, the hedonic approach suggested in this article offers promise as an independent validation of the typical methods used to value sportfishing harvest.","[Carter, David W.; Liese, Christopher] NOAA, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Carter, David W.; Liese, Christopher] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Admn NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Carter, DW (通讯作者)，NOAA, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",david.w.carter@noaa.gov; christopher.liese@noaa.gov,"Carter, David W/G-7472-2016","Carter, David W/0000-0001-8960-7236",,,,,32,0,0,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Our paper uses institutional level panel data and a variety of econometric approaches, including unconditional quantile regression methods, to analyze whether these non-instructional expenditure categories influence graduation and first-year persistence rates of undergraduate students. Our most important finding is that student service expenditures influence graduation and persistence rates and their marginal effects are higher for students at institutions with lower entrance test scores and higher Pell Grant expenditures per student. Put another way, their effects are largest at institutions that have lower current graduation and first-year persistence rates. Simulations suggest that reallocating some funding from instruction to student services may enhance persistence and graduation rates at those institutions whose rates are currently below the medians in the sample.

Three different carbon crediting schemes are considered, which are based on different accounting rules. The schemes are different with respect to the question whether and how to account for carbon emissions. The forest valuation method used for calculation is based on the land expectation value (LEV). which was adjusted for the value of carbon sequestration services. Changes in the LEV and optimal rotation are expected lobe induced by the amount and interactions of carbon and timber prices, harvesting and regeneration costs, and interest rates. The optimal economic rotation period is calculated for single stands as well as for whole forest enterprises (fully regulated normal forests). Crediting the carbon sequestration of single stands starting from the time of regeneration is comparable to rewarding afforestation projects. When crediting forest enterprises with existing timber and carbon stocks, additional carbon sequestration compared to a reference is rewarded. The findings reveal that, depending on the carbon price level, the optimal rotation period is increased in all considered crediting schemes, but with different intensity. If wood removals have to be accounted as carbon emissions this has the most significant effect on the optimal rotation period for forest stands and enterprises. In this case the increase of the optimal rotation period by rising carbon prices is boosted additionally by rising interest rates. Different thinning regimes, however, have only little impact on the time of maximum I.EV under carbon crediting schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Teacher pensions, in particular, pose two challenges. The first is that political incentives invite irresponsible fiscal stewardship, as public officials make outsized short-term commitments to employees. The second is that incentives hinder modernization, as policy makers avoid the politically perilous task of altering plans ill suited to attracting talent in the contemporary labor market. The alignment of the political stars has helped some states and localities to address the first challenge, but far too few have demonstrated a willingness to tackle the second, We illustrate the political dynamics through discussions of pension plans in New Jersey, Oregon, and San Diego, California, and suggest several political strategies that could make pension challenges more tractable and encourage public officials to be responsible fiscal stewards or to revisit anachronistic retirement systems.","[Hess, Frederick M.; Squire, Juliet R.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Squire, JR (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1150 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",rhess@aei.org; juliet.squire@gmail.com,,,,,,,107,4,4,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

However, it is not yet defined how the integration of the visions of the public should be carried out. Notably in regions with poor participatory culture and in rural landscapes abandoned by people and consequently by their activities, dealing with the future does not seem a straightforward task. In these marginal rural landscapes the role of agriculture is being altered under the influence of the new rationale of the Common Agriculture Policy, so it may have to assume different functions in the future. Thus, this paper aims at showing how the development of 'exploratory landscape scenarios' can be a useful tool, firstly to find plausible landscape futures, and secondly to trigger discussions with the public regarding their aspirations for their landscape. The development procedure for 'exploratory landscape scenarios' builds on the 'intuitive logics' approach that focuses on the production of a variety of scenarios as starting point for discussion about the future rather than on finding an optimal one, which can limit the options unnecessarily from the beginning. The methodological approach is illustrated at a local scale by using the case study of Mertola in southeast Portugal. The results of the scenario exercise point out the adequateness of the methodology in the development of futures that are perceived as plausible by local stakeholders and, thereby, able to bring out their desires and threats towards the future of their landscape.

The development of multicultural societies has certainly not been without its problems. The re-emergence of extremist political parties, the segregation of cultures and ethnic conflict, illustrate the problematic side of sociocultural integration at the local level. We argue that socio-cultural factors not only change as a result of globalisation, but also can be causes, as well as challenges to the process of globalisation itself. We describe how the recent introduction of the MGI and KOF globalisation indices can be used to empirically address to what extent globalisation affects social phenomena. Overall, while the rigidity of national boarders slackens, to speak about a global community is misleading. National borders still exist and the nation-state still matters. The fact is that they have to co-exist with civil society. The institutions of-global civil society place limits upon the government and function as a sort of check on various forms of government, especially the authoritarian and absolutist varieties.

As a result, new directions have emerged in the reform of Public Administration together with the introduction of innovative models. The aim is to achieve a type of management that focusses on results as well as on effort and efficiency. We intend to analyse to what extent the adoption of business management models by hospital healthcare units can improve their performance, mainly in terms of standards of efficiency. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to investigate the efficiency of a set of public Portuguese hospitals. The aim was to evaluate the impact of business management in Portuguese public hospitals with regards to efficiency, specifically taking into account the fact that lack of resources and increased health care needs are a present and future reality. From a total of 83 public hospitals, a sample of 59 hospitals was chosen, of which 21 are state-owned hospital enterprises (SA) and 38 are traditional public administration sector hospitals (SPA). This study evaluates hospital performance by calculating two efficiency measures associated with two categories of inputs. The first efficiency measures the costs associated with hospital production lines and the number of beds (representing fixed capacity) as inputs. The annual costs generated by the hospitals in the consumption of capital and work (direct and indirect costs) are used. A second measure of efficiency is calculated separately. This measure includes in the inputs the number of beds as well as the human resources available (number of doctors, number of nurses and other personnel) in each hospital. With regard to output, the variables that best reflect the hospital services rendered were considered: number of inpatient days, patients discharged, outpatient visits, emergencies services, sessions in hospital day care services and the number of surgeries. The results seem to suggest that the introduction of market processes and changes in organisational structure-such as managerial autonomy and corporatisation of public hospitals-have had a positive impact on Portuguese public hospitals. This positive evolution was particularly evident in SA hospitals, but further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.","[Rego, Guilhermina; Nunes, Rui] Univ Porto, Fac Med, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal; [Costa, Jose] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Rego, G (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Med, Alameda Prof Hernani Monteiro, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal.",egsaude@med.up.pt; ruinunes@med.up.pt,"Nunes, Rui/L-8044-2013; Rego, Guilhermina/GRR-2433-2022; Rego, Guilhermina/L-8030-2013","Rego, Guilhermina/0000-0002-8590-9832; Nunes, Rui/0000-0002-1377-9899",,,,,57,54,60,4,64,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We develop a positive theory that treats both of these aspects as endogenous outcomes of special-interest and electoral politics. We consider the choice among three (endogenous) refunding rules: income tax cuts, extra public spending and tax burden compensation to polluters. We show that a polluter lobby group may lobby for the ecotax revenue to be refunded to voters rather than to its members. The reason is that the price that the lobby group must pay for a reduction in the green tax can be reduced by supporting a refunding rule that pleases voters.

Paradoxically, this 'employacurity' discourse has taken root in the Netherlands, a country in which the employment system is firmly based on the norm of job security, the total opposite of Silicon Valley's employment system. Although management gurus have built an attractive discourse on employability, an associated collective action problem detracts from its realism. The Dutch case exhibits mechanisms that may alleviate such a collective action problem. These mechanisms are explored via an examination of policy documents, a quantitative analysis of collective labour agreements and two cases, one of a large bank and one of an industrial company. A craving among Dutch employers for flexibility, fuelled by the norm of security that impacts their perception of potential benefits of investments in employability, is crucial to our understanding of employacurity in the Netherlands.","[Pruijt, Hans; Derogee, Pascal] Erasmus Univ, FSW Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Pruijt, H (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, FSW Sociol, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",pruijt@fsw.eur.nl,"Pruijt, Hans/F-4897-2013","Pruijt, Hans/0000-0002-9802-9455",,,,,56,18,20,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

A Cobb-Douglas production function was estimated based on six cost input categories using fixed and random effects estimation procedures for testing panel data. A Hausman specification test indicated that the fixed effects model was the preferred estimation procedure. The results of the F-test suggested that at best there were constant returns to scale, and at worst these logging operations were characterized by decreasing returns to scale.

J,"Tattersall, PJ",,,,"Tattersall, Philip J.",,,What is Community Based Auditing and how does it work?,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SCIENCE,"Community Based Auditing (CBA) has arisen in response to the ongoing conflict over the management of Tasmania's natural resources and in particular publically owned forests and water resource. The origins, philosophy and central methodology of Community Based Auditing are described and discussed. The author discusses how melding the principles of Post-Normal Science with methods of action research and environmental auditing has led to an innovative form of community engagement where empowered citizens undertake disciplined inquiry into issues relating to natural resource planning and management. Of particular concern are the notions of certainty embedded in present frameworks underpinning government legislation, natural resource planning and management. It is believed that this has led to a pattern of decision-making that is inappropriate, unfair and ultimately counterproductive. Case examples are presented where citizens have applied the CBA methodology in dealing with contentious issues within the Tasmanian forestry industry. The author concludes that the CBA innovation has helped to improve the depth and quality of citizen involvement in natural resource management and at the same time provides the impetus for greater accountability on the part of those charged with managing Tasmania's natural resources. It is felt that the methodology may be able to be applied to other contexts where the need for greater inclusiveness in decision-making relating to natural resource management has been demonstrated. The consequences for the evolution of environmental activism are also thought to be significant as a new form of community-based activism is now possible. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The US - Upland Cotton rulings have not only shown that such disciplines are actually in place, yet they are also in line with - and even go beyond - the obligations imposed on direct export subsidies for agricultural products. Even negotiators seemed surprised by this jurisprudence as they were unintentionally drafting more flexible rules instead of more rigid ones on export credit support for agricultural products in the Doha Round. This contribution explains that the latest draft on the table would, however, impose additional disciplines that are clearly stricter than those imposed on direct export subsidies but, at the same time,fails to equalize the level playing field among World Trade Organization (WTO) Members and is hard to read in a coherent way.","[Coppens, Dominic] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Int Law, Louvain, Belgium; [Coppens, Dominic] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Ctr Global Governance Studies, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Coppens, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Int Law, Louvain, Belgium.",dominic.coppens@law.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

With this foundation, all costs and their corresponding utility-terms should be included. A key question, though, is whether these utility-terms are consistent with quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (utility) theory or not. The results show that health care costs and changes in the utility of health should be included. However, as QALYs do not capture the utility of changes in consumption (as this utility must be independent of health, according to QALY theory), the corresponding changes in consumption costs should be excluded. Regarding the costs for changes in absence from work, these should only be included if the utility of changes in the amount of leisure is included. As no QALY theory has been developed that includes this utility, it is unclear how to handle these costs (even if there are arguments for excluding them). For changes in productivity at work, though, there are robust arguments for the inclusion of these costs. Overall, it seems difficult to provide a clear basis for CEA in economic welfare theory when also including non-medical goods such as consumption and leisure.","[Liljas, Bengt] AstraZeneca, S-43183 Molndal, Sweden; [Liljas, Bengt] Lund Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Liljas, Bengt] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",AstraZeneca; Lund University; Lund University,"Liljas, B (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca, S-43183 Molndal, Sweden.",bengt.liljas@astrazeneca.com,,,,,,,43,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These benefits may affect incentives for landowners to cooperate in their forest management decisions. Landowner survey data is used to examine incentives to cooperate concerning joint forest management and coordination of harvesting. We find spatial factors to be particularly important to these incentives. The percentage of neighboring land employed in agriculture or crop uses and the number of bordering landowners are important positive predictors of willingness to cooperate concerning joint forest management, while the latter has a negative effect on willingness to coordinate timing of harvest. We also find that the non-timber values an individual receives from adjacent land are important positive predictors of cooperation incentives in general. Our results confirm, first, that cross parcel externalities modeled in theoretical work do in fact exist, and, second, that there is merit to formulating future policies with the incentives of landowners to participate in cooperative agreements with neighbors in mind.

The size of the SE is estimated to be decreasing over the last two decades. In order to evaluate the nature of the relationship between the two variables, we have estimated the most used non-parametric regression models, loess and lowess, and a global linear fit using least squares. The results reveal a very little difference between the two nonparametric fits. Finally, we have compared loess fit with a globally linear fit in order to determine if there is a significant amount of nonlinearity between the two variables, using an F-test.

In this survey. we attempt to remedy this defect by investigating the scope and focus of the research done during 1998-2007, and identifying the gaps and areas for future research. The main avenues of econometric market analysis are methodologically and thematically found to be focused on the following five themes: 1) modelling of product demand and supply, 2) price analysis and testing of market integration, 3) market demand and price forecasting, 4) modelling industry location and 5) production technology and factor demand. Within forest sector modelling, studies on Europe can be classified into three categories: those studying the effects on the future development of the forest sector of assumptions concerning GDP growth. forest growth and technological changes: those studying the effects of forest conservation; and finally, those that are concerned with forest bio-energy. in conclusion, the application of time series econometrics in the forestry sector has in the recent years become less common in Europe in general, and little or no research has been carried out in many important fields, e.g., modelling the linkages between different market levels and multi-country market studies. This also casts some doubt on the structure and parameters of the currently more actively applied numerical partial equilibrium models, which must consider multi-level, multi-region market issues.

The study of land-use patterns mainly focuses on understanding the practices and values of individuals involved, and no debate of this issue would be complete without taking into account non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership as a key component in most rural areas worldwide. This paper empirically explores and assesses NIPF owners' management in terms of analysing dynamics in farming and forestry practices (past conversions from forestland to meadow and from marginal meadow to woodland, and intentions to change the current productive forest species and to extend the area of woodland) and landholding attributes (size and degree of parcellation in productive forestland). Logistic regression models were also used to investigate the probabilities and influencing factors involved in transforming marginal meadows to woodland, and attempts on the part of NIPF owners to change the current productive forest species and increase productive forestland. For this, a total of 103 NIPF owners in Northern Spain were interviewed in person, in March 2004, about their commitment to and involvement in land management during 1999-2003. The models correctly explained 73.3%, 83.7% and 73.3% of the variability in having converted marginal meadow in woodland and of future intentions to change the productive forest species and increase the area of productive forestland, respectively. The results of the study indicate that forest management mainly responds to investment and increasing the productivity of the land as a capital asset, which is directly influenced by the size and degree of parcellation of the holding, and directly or indirectly related to the owner's interest in timber production. The results may be used by forest professionals, researchers and policymakers in order to design and execute successful forest policies related to land management and planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However. relatively little research has looked at factors important in the college application process, and in particular, how these factors differ for low-income students. This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) to analyze factors influencing students' college application decisions, with a focus on the decision to apply to a selective 4-year college. We hypothesize that distance from a student's home to selective colleges may play a role in the application decision and differentially impact low-income students.

The paper begins with Burkart and Medlik's 1974 predictions about the future of global tourism, one of the first attempts to do so [A.J. Burkart, S. Medlik, Tourism: Past, Present, and Future, Heinemann, London, 1974]. When each of their predictions is evaluated in the current context, it is proposed that just over half of their predictions have come true. Given the vast number of knowns and unknowns affecting global tourism, their attempt was quite bold and instructive. A set of predictions concerning the future of Caribbean tourism is then presented, in an effort to demonstrate that predicting the future of tourism is akin to predicting the future of a mess.

Financial globalization has not made geography immaterial: instead, spatial location, informed by each area's historical and institutional background, continues to demarcate who has access to which financial services at what price.

The Argentinian, Brazilian, and Peruvian stock markets are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices the same day. Venezuela's stock market, however, does not react to changes in commodity prices, even including energy prices.

When dependent and independent variable (like pollution and income) are both time related, separating the effect of the independent variable from time effects brings about a fundamental identification dilemma: the imposition of restrictions on the controls might drive the shape of the relationship between the dependent (pollution) and independent (income) variables. Our solution consists of imposing the very weak constraint that arbitrary cross-sectional units have the same relationship. We apply our methodology to two widely studied cases, namely, SO(2) and CO(2) emissions. Interestingly, our estimates are insensitive to the required subjective choices, but also strongly differ from the literature so far. We find consistent positive income effects for both cases and time effect estimates with a clear U-shaped trend for SO(2)-emissions but only slightly so for CO(2)-emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Little work has been done on its effect on interest articulation. The literature on policy communities treats them as sectoral in scope. We propose the concept of 'territorial policy communities' to designate territorially bounded constellations of actors within and across policy sectors, emerging in response to the rescaling of government. Devolution may leave existing systems of interest articulation unchanged, leaving 'regions without regionalism'; it may confine some groups within territorial boundaries while allowing others the freedom to choose' between levels of government; or it might promote a general territorialization of interest representation and the emergence of territorial policy communities. The UK's four models of devolution help test the effects of stronger and weaker forms of devolution on the territorialization of groups.","[Keating, Michael] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, I-50014 Florence, Italy; [Cairney, Paul] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland; [Hepburn, Eve] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",European University Institute; University of Aberdeen; University of Edinburgh,"Keating, M (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Badia Fiesolana via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Florence, Italy.",michael.keating@eui.eu; paul.cairney@abdn.ac.uk; eve.hepburn@ed.ac.uk,"Hepburn, Eve/A-5418-2010; Cairney, Paul/AAU-1648-2020","Cairney, Paul/0000-0002-9956-832X",,,,,63,52,53,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The discrete factor method (DFM) allows for correlation across demand equations and incorporates unobserved heterogeneity. Our model is a generalized negative binomial with random effects; the random effect is composed of a discrete representation of unobserved heterogeneity and a factor loading that translates the heterogeneity measure into a demand effect. Our empirical application is to beach recreation demand in North Carolina. Statistical evidence supports our DFM specification, which imposes less restriction on model dispersion and incorporates unobserved heterogeneity in a flexible manner. Elasticity estimates are smaller than those derived from models with parametric specifications for unobserved heterogeneity, and welfare estimates are slightly larger (and less precise). While parametric models clearly dominate if the specification of unobserved heterogeneity is correct, the semi-parametric DFMI provides a flexible alternative in cases where mis-specification is a potential problem.

Knowledge, space and power in indigenous politics",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LAND; MAPS; IDENTITY; PLACE,"This paper considers the relationship between knowledge and power as it pertains to the political mobilization of indigenous identity. To illustrate this relationship, the paper reviews concepts used to map indigenous territories for the purposes of claiming land. Mapping requires any number of decisions about what to map and how to map in order to create certain political effects. Indigenous maps have been used as a means for advancing a variety of anti-colonial politics. However, mapping, like indigenous knowledge more broadly, is rapidly being assimilated into development policy by institutions like the World Bank. This paper considers how the very concepts used to identify certain kinds of knowledge as indigenous remain steeped in colonial power relations. That perspective informs my reconsideration of concepts of indigeneity, resistance, and territory in this paper. Without disavowing the tactical importance of mapping in advancing indigenous land rights, this paper concludes by raising a number of points aimed at advancing debates to develop a more critically informed cartographic practice.

There is tremendous potential for Indian pomegranates in the global markets. Karnataka and Maharashtra states are the leading producers of pomegranates in India. The role of Karnataka State Agricultural Produce Processing and Export Corporation (KAPPEC) in equipping the pomegranate farmers from Karnataka to be competitive in the global markets is crucial. The present study is aimed at understanding the growth of pomegranate exports from India. It also examines the various activities undertaken by KAPPEC for the development of pomegranate exports from Karnataka and the effectiveness of the means used by KAPPEC to communicate its role to the farmers. The study revealed that the growth of pomegranate exports from India is moderate in comparison to the potential for its exports. It also revealed that though the right activities have been undertaken by KAPPEC to support the growth of exports from the state of Karnataka the corporation has not been effective in reaching and educating a large proportion of the target horticulture farmers about its activities.

Improving urban agricultural production is constrained by limited access to fertile land, but the introduction of low cost hydroponic gardens may be a sustainable way to launch horticultural production on roofs, terraces and courtyards. Gardens also perform a social function, restoring the associative mentality lost when emigrants leave their communities. In this study, we propose the adoption of community hydroponic gardens as a tool to overtake poverty, improve nutrition and increase associative attitude. A democratic organization of women farming groups, together with the role of a technical assistance centre is described. Agricultural production is managed by the groups, where both intercropping patterns for home consumption and commercial leafy vegetable production are conducted. Fresh produce for the market is washed and packaged and sold to supermarkets and restaurants in the city. The technical assistance centre provides tutoring, agricultural inputs and manages commercial relations. Its sustainability is assured by a percent of the vegetable marketing income. It also offers training to students of local agricultural schools. A socioeconomic overview of the advantages created by the installation of community gardens is considered.","[Orsini, F.; Michelon, N.; Scocozza, F.; Gianquinto, G.] Univ Bologna, I-40127 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Orsini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Viale Fanin 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",,"Orsini, Francesco/B-5184-2019","Orsini, Francesco/0000-0001-6956-7054; MICHELON, NICOLA/0000-0001-6240-9520",,,,,14,8,8,1,18,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,209,220,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300021,0

Over 16,500 ha of tomato were grown in 2006, with a production value exceeding $US 550 million. All commercial tomato growers rely upon a raised-bed polyethylene mulch production system to grow their crops. The use of perennial grasses in rotation with tomatoes has largely been overlooked, but has the potential to reduce soil-borne pest and weed problems. Methods for managing the growth of bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum, Flugge), sod and fertilizer application were evaluated to optimize the yield of strip-tillage tomato produced in bahiagrass pasture. Sod growth was managed by mowing, herbicides, and the width of tilled strip. Fertilizer (N, P and K) were applied at different rates and with different schedules. The highest yields were obtained using a combination of mowing and herbicides to manage sod growth. The application of N, using 1/3 at transplanting, 1/3 three weeks after transplanting and 1/3 6 weeks after transplanting gave the highest yield response. A nitrogen rate of 200 kg/ha, a typical rate in conventional growing systems, was adequate with minimum sod competition. Adequate tomato growth was obtained by mixing other nutrients and dolomite in the tilled strip according to soil test recommendations. Plant resistance is another pest and disease management practice that has been under used in conventional tomato production in Florida. Many highly productive tomato varieties now have resistance to Verticillium (race 1) and Fusarium (races 1, 2, 3) wilts, Tomato spotted wilt and root-knot disease. Proper use of disease resistant tomato in strip-tilled perennial grass rotations could eliminate soil fumigation and polyethylene mulch in most production scenarios. Plant resistance tests in bahiagrass sod containing 1,3-dichloropropene + 35% chloropicrin (1,3-D + 35%Pic) or no 1,3-D + 35% Pic were examined. No significant difference in yield or percent marketable fruit were found between 1,3-D + 35% Pic treatment or the non-treated control in either the spring or fall field trials. Soil-borne fungal diseases were not detected in tomatoes in either the spring or fall trials, and root galling caused by nematodes was not detected or at very low levels in the 1,3-D + 35% Pic or non-treated control plots. Where root-gall was found, it was present only in tomato varieties without Mi-gene resistance.","[Rich, J. R.; Rhoads, F. M.; Olson, S.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have the potential to deliver significant economic, social and environmental benefits. In this context constraints for ICT adoption in agriculture and horticulture are reviewed. Past surveys of the European Federation for Information Technology in Agriculture (EFITA) indicate that despite potential ICT benefits adoption of ICT in agriculture remains a significant problem. The EFITA surveys in the form of questionnaires were conducted every two years since 1999 and provide a baseline for two comparative surveys in horticulture, one in 2004 at the symposium on horticultural economics and management, organised in Berlin by the International Society for Horticultural Sciences (ISHS) and another one in 2005 organised by the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO) on a sample of 208 horticultural businesses in Flanders. Comparing their results provides insights which suggest remedial steps to expedite ICT adoption and prioritize the necessary research. The ISHS survey results identified the following comparable ICT adoption constraints: end user (ICT) proficiency, lack of training, ICT benefit awareness, time, cost of technology, system integration and software availability. Participants from developed countries stressed as constraints : no perceived economic benefits, do not understand the value of ICT, not enough time to spend on technology and how to get a benefit from the use of ICT. Respondents from developing countries stressed the importance of cost of technology and lack of technological infrastructure. The results of the ILVO questionnaire are in line with the ISHS survey and the EFITA surveys over time, indicating a shift from ICT technical proficiency as a limiting factor towards the lack of understanding how to get a benefit from the various ICT options.","[Taragola, N.; Van Lierde, D.] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Social Sci Unit, Merelbeke, Belgium",Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research,"Taragola, N (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Social Sci Unit, Merelbeke, Belgium.",,,"Taragola, Nicole/0000-0002-7234-8300",,,,,9,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,73,82,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700008,0

All the rest of the territory of Latvia is at the efficiency-driven stage; consequently its competitiveness on the global market is relatively low. The Latvian forest cluster which has been identified using the clustering algorithm is situated in one Latvian region - Riga region - with only several cluster participants being situated out of it. Taking into consideration that the economic significance of Riga region is approximately the same as the one of all other Latvian territories all together, it is possible to say that Latvia gets the competitiveness rating owing to Riga region. It is Riga region that has reached the threshold level of competitiveness and where Latvian economic clusters are formed, including the forest cluster which serves as the index and, to a certain degree, the factor of competitiveness of Riga region, i.e., development of forest and other clusters in Riga region encourages the transition of this region to the innovation-driven stage, thus raising competitiveness of Riga region. As to other Latvian regions which are at the efficiency-driven stage and are far behind Riga, they have to find other instruments which would raise their competitiveness, thus creating the background for the formation and development of clusters which in their turn would encourage further improvement of the territory.

In 2005, the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system received $832 million from Minnesota's state government to support educational programs. These subsidies allow these institutions to offer lower tuition rates, increasing the number of Minnesotans with bachelor and graduate degrees. We calculate that removing these subsidies would eventually lead to 14,000 fewer graduate degree holders in Minnesota, and reduce those with bachelor's degrees or some college by 42,000. The annual economic cost of these subsidies is about $326 million: this is less than annual state appropriations because most of those appropriations are income transfers from taxpayers to students, not an economic cost. We estimate that the annual value of the benefits of these subsidies is between $531 and $786 million ($381 and $570 million) when a 3% (5%) discount rate is used. We also discuss some of the income distribution consequences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses a framework encompassing both the neoclassical and endogenous growth model. The impact of education is assessed through a quality adjusted human capital stock measure. The returns to investment in education are positive but significantly lower than those found for other developing economies. Unlike the case of most developed economies, higher returns from investment in physical capital cannot produce any sizable positive externalities. The war has had the expected negative effect on output, and the results on economic policy changes are inconclusive.

The growing awareness that an increasing percentage of the world's population now lives in urban areas makes the organization of this space a crucial issue for global sustainable development. In order to acquire this challenge, urban studies need to overcome conceptual oppositions, seeking new integrated responses to implement the principle of sustainability at urban scale. This effort requires a new managerial approach of science and policy, which can be based on a transdisciplinary vision to knowledge production. The paper is divided into four different sections. The first and second sections review the theoretical literature on urban sustainability and explore the conceptual relations between knowledge and knowledge production in urban governance processes. The third section presents a comparative empirical analysis based on a survey of 2213 questionnaires carried out in four different urban contexts. The fourth and last section outlines the conclusion, suggesting a new approach to manage knowledge in urban governance, in a trans-disciplinary perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
