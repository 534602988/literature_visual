It might be important to understand how these outcomes are correlated to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments in decision models. Methods: The probabilities are estimated that both, one, or neither outcome occurs, given estimates of the marginal probability for each outcome and information about the correlation between them. Methods are shown for different measures of association. Lower and upper bounds for the correlation coefficient are calculated for given values of the marginal probabilities. The approach is illustrated using a simplified decision model based on a recent evaluation of adalimumab, a biologic drug for psoriatic arthritis. Results: Assuming the outcomes are positively correlated, the probability of both a skin and arthritis response after adalimumab was estimated to be 0.387 (95% confidence interval 0.210-0.570). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adalimumab versus no biologic is 18,500 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The ICER increases to 19,500 pound per QALY if the responses are independent. Conclusion: Estimates of ICERs can be sensitive to assumptions about how multiple outcomes are correlated. These assumptions should be explored in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.","[Epstein, David] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Epstein, David] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Sutton, Alex] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of York - UK; University of Granada; University of Leicester,"Epstein, D (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",david.epstein@york.ac.uk,"Epstein, David/I-2839-2019","Epstein, David/0000-0002-2275-0916; Sutton, Alexander/0000-0002-8934-9940",NIHR HTA [HTA 08/42/01]; Medical Research Council [G0900770]; Medical Research Council [G0800770] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800770] Funding Source: UKRI,NIHR HTA; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This work has been supported by funding from the NIHR HTA Programme on behalf of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence as project number HTA 08/42/01 and from the Medical Research Council as MRC Award G0900770.,,26,5,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2011,14.0,6,,,,,793,799,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.04.007,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BJ,21914498.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081600001,0

We explore the effects of commuting time on the psychological health of men and women. We use data from the British Household Panel Survey in a fixed effects framework that includes variables known to determine psychological health, as well as factors which may provide compensation for commuting such as income, job satisfaction and housing quality. Our results show that, even after these variables are considered, commuting has an important detrimental effect on the psychological health of women, but not men, and this result is robust to numerous different specifications. We explore explanations for this gender difference and can find no evidence that it is due to women's shorter working hours or weaker occupational position. Rather women's greater sensitivity to commuting time seems to be a result of their larger responsibility for day-to-day household tasks, including childcare and housework. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This class is indexed by the choice of a reference density g, which need not coincide with the unknown actual innovation density f. The validity of these tests, in terms of exact finite-sample size, is guaranteed, irrespective of the actual underlying density, by distribution-freeness. Those tests are locally and asymptotically optimal under a particular asymptotic scheme, for which we provide a complete analysis of asymptotic relative efficiencies. Rather than stressing asymptotic optimality, however, we emphasize finite-sample performances, which also depend, quite heavily, on initial values. It appears that our rank-based tests significantly outperform the traditional Dickey-Fuller tests, as well as the more recent procedures proposed by Elliott et al. (1996), Ng and Perron (2001), and Elliott and Muller (2006), for a broad range of initial values and for heavy-tailed innovation densities. Thus, they provide a useful complement to existing techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the Brazilian Study on Diabetes Costs (ESCUDI study) was to estimate direct and indirect costs of type 2 diabetes outpatient care in the Brazilian Public Health Care System. Methods: Data were collected from different levels of health care in eight Brazilian cities in 2007. A total of 1000 outpatients were interviewed and had their medical records data analyzed. Direct medical costs included expenses with medications, diagnostic tests, procedures, blood glucose test strips, and office visits. Nonmedical direct costs included expenses with diet products, transportation, and caregivers. Absenteeism, sick leave, and early retirement were classified as indirect costs. Results: Total annual cost for outpatient care was US$2108 per patient, out of which US$1335 per patient of direct costs (63.3%) and US$773 per patient of indirect costs (36.7%). Costs escalated as duration of diabetes and level of health care increased. Patients with both microvascular and macrovascular complications had higher costs (US$3199 per patient) compared to those with either microvascular (US$2062 per patient) or macrovascular (US$2517 per patient) complications only. The greatest portion of direct costs was attributed to medication (48.2%). Conclusions: Diabetes treatment leads to elevated costs both to Brazilian Public Health Care System and society. Costs increased along with duration of disease, level of care and presence of chronic complications, which suggested a need to reallocate health resources focusing on primary prevention of diabetes and its complications.","[Bahia, Luciana R.; Araujo, Denizar Vianna; Gomes, Marilia B.] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, BR-20550011 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Schaan, Beatriz D.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, HCPA, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Dib, Sergio A.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Negrato, Carlos Antonio] Associacao Diabet Bauru, Bauru, Brazil; [Leao, Marluce P.

LASIK surgery has precise measures of presurgical condition and postsurgical outcomes. Unlike other types of surgery, the impact of unobservable underlying patient conditions on outcomes is minimal. Individual learning by doing is identified through observations of surgical outcomes over time, based on the cumulative number of surgeries performed. Collective learning is identified separately, through changes in a group adjustment rule determined jointly by all the surgeons in a structured internal review process. Our unique data set overcomes some of the measurement problems in patient outcomes encountered in other studies and improves the possibility of identifying and separating the impact of learning by doing from other effects. We cannot conclude that the outcome of LASIK surgery improves as an individual surgeon's experience increases, but we find strong evidence that experience accumulated by surgeons as a group in a clinic significantly improves outcomes.

This study offers generalizable and condition-specific insight into why (rather than if) there are discrepancies between two widely used measures, the EQ-5D and SF-6D. Methods: Comparisons focused on practical considerations and the respective descriptive and valuation components of the measures, addressing empirical and conceptual issues. More specifically, we addressed instrument-completion, item-completion, contextual framing of questions, dimension-to-dimension correlations, floor and ceiling effects, and construct validity. Data came from randomized controlled trial participants with nonspecific neck pain (n = 346). Results: The descriptive classification systems do not permit respondents to describe their health state in the same manner, due, primarily, to contextual differences and the number of available response options. Specific to neck pain populations, vitality was a unique contributor to the SF-6D, although both measures identified the same significant linear trends across theoretical constructs. Rates of instrument completion were significantly better for the EQ-5D over the course of the randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: The EQ-5D and SF-6D do not provide interchangeable utility estimates for patients with nonspecific neck pain-a finding that is common to other clinical areas. However, this result, and the results from previous studies, should not be surprising given the extent of between-measure differences relating to the descriptive content of health dimensions across the two measures. Given the consistent messages emerging from method comparison studies for the EQ-5D and SF-6D, new and/or novel approaches are necessary to drive this research area forward.","[Whitehurst, David G.

In particular, we first outline a simple simulation-based framework for constructing predictive densities for one-factor and stochastic volatility models. We then construct tests that are in the spirit of Diebold and Mariano (1995) and White (2000). In order to establish the asymptotic properties of our tests, we also develop a recursive variant of the nonparametric simulated maximum likelihood estimator of Fermanian and Salanie (2004). In an empirical illustration, the predictive densities from several models of the one-month federal funds rates are compared. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It introduces a general framework where error cross-section dependence may arise because of unobserved common effects and/or error spill-over effects due to spatial or other forms of local dependencies. Initially, this paper focuses on a panel regression model where the idiosyncratic errors are spatially dependent and possibly serially correlated, and derives the asymptotic distributions of the mean group and pooled estimators under heterogeneous and homogeneous slope coefficients, and for these estimators proposes non-parametric variance matrix estimators. The paper then considers the more general case of a panel data model with a multifactor error structure and spatial error correlations. Under this framework, the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimator, recently advanced by Pesaran (2006), continues to yield estimates of the slope coefficients that are consistent and asymptotically normal. Small sample properties of the estimators under various patterns of cross-section dependence, including spatial forms, are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments. Results show that the CCE approach works well in the presence of weak and/or strong cross-sectionally correlated errors. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.","[Pesaran, M.

Methods: Pair-wise meta-analysis and more complex evidence syntheses, incorporating an MTC component, are applied to three examples: 1) clinical effectiveness of interventions for preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation; 2) clinical and cost-effectiveness of using drug-eluting stents in percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with coronary artery disease; and 3) clinical and cost-effectiveness of using neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment of influenza. We compare the two synthesis approaches with respect to the assumptions made, empirical estimates produced, and conclusions drawn. Results: The difference between point estimates of effectiveness produced by the pair-wise and MTC approaches was generally unpredictable-sometimes agreeing closely whereas in other instances differing considerably. In all three examples, the MTC approach allowed the inclusion of randomized controlled trial evidence ignored in the pair-wise meta-analysis approach. This generally increased the precision of the effectiveness estimates from the MTC model. Conclusions: The MTC approach to synthesis allows the evidence base on clinical effectiveness to be treated as a coherent whole, include more data, and sometimes relax the assumptions made in the pair-wise approaches. However, MTC models are necessarily more complex than those developed for pair-wise meta-analysis and thus could be seen as less transparent. Therefore, it is important that model details and the assumptions made are carefully reported alongside the results.

As talk of raising retirement ages in pensions and social security schemes continues around the world, it is important to know both the costs and benefits for the individual, as well as the governments' budgets. In this paper we use the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset to address this question in a multi-country setting. We use country-specific early and full retirement ages as instruments for retirement behavior. These statutory retirement ages clearly induce retirement, but are not related to an individual's health. Exploiting the discontinuities in retirement behavior across countries, we find significant evidence that retirement has a health-preserving effect on overall general health. Our estimates indicate that retirement leads to a 35 percent decrease in the probability of reporting to be in fair, bad, or very bad health, and an almost one standard deviation improvement in the health index. While the self-reported health seems to be a temporary impact, the health index indicates there are long-lasting health differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One of the possible explanations for this finding is the fact the skewness of the log transformed statistic is smaller than that of the raw statistic. Simulation evidence presented here shows that this is the case. It also shows that the log transform does not completely eliminate skewness in finite samples. This suggests that there may exist other nonlinear transformations that are more effective at reducing the finite sample skewness. The main goal of this paper is to study the accuracy of a new class of transformations for realized volatility based on the Box-Cox transformation. This transformation is indexed by a parameter beta and contains as special cases the log (when beta = 0) and the raw (when beta = 1) versions of realized volatility. Based on the theory of Edgeworth expansions, we study the accuracy of the Box-Cox transforms across different values of beta. We derive an optimal value of beta that approximately eliminates skewness. We then show that the corresponding Box-Cox transformed statistic outperforms other choices of beta, including beta = 0 (the log transformation). We provide extensive Monte Carlo simulation results to compare the finite sample properties of different Box-Cox transforms. Across the models considered in this paper, one of our conclusions is that beta = -1 (i.e. relying on the inverse of realized volatility also known as realized precision) is the best choice if we want to control the coverage probability of 95% level confidence intervals for integrated volatility.

Then weights will be set and various multi-criteria decision methods will be applied. The first used treatment is one of the most widely known multi-criteria decision method - Saaty's AHP method. Then, as a basic approach pair-wise comparison is used and other methods are applied. At the end of the paper the possible application of uncertainty will be discussed.

Objectives: To assess the effect of subcutaneous (SC) methylnaltrexone injection on patient-reported constipation symptoms and pain scores. Methods: A total of 469 subjects on opioids for chronic non-malignant pain with opioid-induced constipation were randomized to methylnaltrexone SC with once daily (QD) or every other day (QOD) dosing or placebo for 4 weeks. Constipation symptoms and pain were assessed using the patient assessment of constipation-symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaire and a 11-point scale, respectively, at baseline, Day 14 and Day 28. Change from baseline in PAC-SYM and pain scores were compared between methylnaltrexone and placebo arms at Day 28 using analysis of covariance, with treatment group as factor and baseline score as covariate. Results: A majority of patients were women (60%), average age was 49 years old, and back pain (60%) was the primary pain condition. At Day 28, the methylnaltrexone SC QD group showed a significant improvement over placebo for rectal symptoms (-0.56 vs. -0.30; P < 0.05), stool symptoms (-0.76 vs. -0.43; P < 0.001) and global scores (-0.62 vs. -0.37; P < 0.001). Improvement in stool symptoms (-0.69 vs. -0.43; P < 0.05) and the global scores (-0.52 vs. -0.37; P < 0.05) were significantly greater than placebo in the methylnaltrexone QOD group. Differences in change from baseline in abdominal symptoms and pain scores between the methylnaltrexone SC QD or QOD dosing arms and placebo were not significant. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate significant improvement in constipation symptoms with methylnaltrexone QD or QOD dosing compared to placebo without a significant effect on pain scores.

There are five real possibilities of RES building-up in the Czech Republic. They are wind power stations for wind energy production, photovoltaic power stations based on obtaining of sun energy, the geothermal power stations deal with thermal energy of the Earth, places with large water areas or swift rivers are suitable for hydro-electric power stations and the last but not least possibility is to gain biomass energy from biomass. Each of the mentioned energy sources has its advantages and also disadvantages that can be evaluated by investor from the multicriteria point of view. Evaluation of investments into RES is a multiple criteria decision making problem with the evaluated units (energy sources) and with the multiple inputs (investments, recovery, etc.) and multiple outputs (expected output, profit, etc.). This problem can be solved by several modeling techniques. In this paper data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are used and methodology for evaluation of projects for RES building is introduced.","[Kalcevova, Jana] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,kalcevov@vse.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHING,PRUHONICE,"NA SIDLISTI 152, PRUHONICE, PRAGUE 252 43, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7431-058-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,321,326,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BBZ07,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000309074600054,0

In contrast to the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) model, the FHG model includes targeted fee increases, extended hours, performance-based initiatives, and patient enrolment. Using a long panel of claims data, we find that the FHG model significantly increases physician productivity relative to the FFS model, as measured by the number of services, patient visits, and distinct patients seen. We also find that the FHG physicians have lower referral rates and treat slightly more complex patients than the comparable FFS physicians. These results suggest that the FHG model offers a promising alternative to the FFS model for increasing physician productivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

If they are heterogeneous in other aspects (like productivity) too, some consumers try to parasitize on others and the others try to escape from the parasites. A system with small relocation cost does not reach an equilibrium. If the relocation cost is high enough, the system finds an equilibrium, but the equilibrium does not separate the consumers according to their taste for public goods. The aggregate quantity of public goods is lower than the optimal one and public goods and the tax burden are distributed among the inhabitants in an inefficient way.

The goal is to find a consensus - an overall ranking of alternatives by a group. The fuzzy permutation model is proposed both for single and multiple criteria problems, and it can handle different weights of decision makers as well. Therefore, it provides a generalization of classic methods for ordinal consensus ranking problem solution such as Borda-Kendall's method of marks (BAK), maximize agreement heuristic (MAH) or consensus ranking model (CRM). Moreover, the proposed method is numerically simple and time-saving, and its use is demonstrated by examples.

Furthermore, the results were compared between soils collected under tufts of Festuea ovma, as a representative of the original species in situ, and under the Calamagrostts eptgetos, which is an expansive species in this region. The obtained results pointed out to minor differences between the dry and wet incubation regimes.

The supply chain links all companies, which became members of this process. However, many relationships of the underlying system and the complexity of interactions within prevent from gather comprehensive and complete information's. These conditions under vagueness claim to fuzzy approach application that proposes a more robust and computational capable way of measurement in supply chains. The main aim of the paper is modification model of supply chain by adding new companies with capability of bind to chain. The purpose of verification is to analyzing measures changes, which are obtained by evaluation of logistic indicators dimensions and non-probabilistic entropy. Joined companies that are potentially able to connect to hubs are chosen by cluster analysis results. Comparing is oriented to examination of differences between original supply chain model and modification.

An ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including genus Enterococcus (proved BA producers), to form tyramine and histamine was evaluated in the present experiment. Two methods for testing an ability of the isolates to form tyramine/histamine were used: liquid decarboxylating medium (LDM) and confirmation of BA formation by the HPLC method. Regarding Enterococcus spp., all tested isolates were positive using both methods. As far as LAB are concerned however, only 10.5% of the isolates was identified as positive in LDM, while 41.7% positive isolates was confirmed by the HPLC. In the HPLC-positive isolates, only tyramine was detected, histamine was not present in any of the tested samples. Members of the genus Enterococcus were confirmed by the PYRA-test, species identification was consequently performed using the ENCOCCUS-test.

The observation was realised by form of small plot of the field experiment with six varietes of malting barley. Three varieties of the Czech beer Aksamit, Radegast, Bojos and free varieties for export Jersey, Prestige and Sebastian. Sulfur was applied as foliar elementary micronized sulfur with bentonite in the DC 31 and DC 57. Nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate with limestone was applied together with sulfur. Effect of sulfur on the grain yield did not show significantly. Nitrogen substances content in grain was significantly reduced after application of sulfur. This offers a posibility of solving the problem of nitrogen fertilization of barley for malting purposes. Percentage values of sulfur in the above grain (2,5 mm) statistically insignificant. Sulfur was not accumulated in the grain even the later date applications. Content of dimethylsulfide precursors (PDMS) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) in malt rises in various terms of sulfur applications, but the differences were not statistically significant. Higher content was observed in the varieties for productinon of Czech beer. Higher DMS and PDMS content in these varieties is not a problem, because the type of end product. Export varieties reached lower value. The limiting value of PDMS content in malt (6mg/kg) were not exceeded for any variety. The contents of the nitrogen substances in grain, PDMS and DMS content in the malt were markedly influenced by the variability of varieties.","[Syrova, H.; Ryant, P.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Syrová, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",hana.syrova@mendelu.cz,"Ryant, Pavel/I-9294-2018","Ryant, Pavel/0000-0002-4975-7405",[1G58038]; [1M0570],;,"Grant No. 1G58038 Innovation of growing technologies of malting barley for development of diagnostic methods to evaluation stand structure, health and nutritional status and No. 1M0570 Research Center for the Study of substances contained in the barley and hops.",,9,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,158,169,,,,,,12,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400016,0

The experiment was grown in two locations (Zelesice, Hrubcice) and harvested in 2008 - 2010. The effects of genotypes and environments were estimated by analysis of variance. The results showed that the vigour was influenced mostly by environment (51 %, i.e 32% by locations and 19% by years), less by the lines (8%) and by their interaction (37%) of the total variation. Average seed vigour of DHL was 94% from Zelesice and 95% from Hrubcice, i.e. relatively high. Parental variety Derkado as the better parent showed higher vigour in worse location Zelesice.

The attractiveness of these DC models is that they are embedded in a strong theoretical measurement framework and are based on relatively simple judgmental tasks. The aim of our study was to determine whether the values derived from a DC experiment are comparable to those obtained using other valuation techniques, in particular the time trade-off (TTO). Methods: Two hundred nine students completed several tasks in which we collected DC, rank, visual analog scale, and TTO responses. DC data were also collected in a general population sample (N = 444). The DC experiment was designed using a Bayesian approach, and involved 60 choices between two health states and a comparison of all health states to being dead. The DC data were analyzed using a conditional logit and a rank-ordered logit model, relying, respectively, on TTO values and the value for being dead to anchor the DC-derived values to the 0 to 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) scale. Results: Although modeled DC data broadly replicated the pattern found in TTO responses, the DC consistently produced higher values. The two methods for anchoring DC-derived values on the QALY scale produced similar results. Conclusions: On the basis of the high level of comparability between DC-derived values and TTO values, future valuation studies based on a combination of these two techniques may be considered. The results further suggest that DC can potentially be used as a substitute for TTO.","[Krabbe, Paul F.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey based on the National Health Interview Survey performed in 2001. Subjects greater than 20 years old who lived in Taiwan, as corroborated by National Health Insurance (NHI), during 2001, were included. Overall, the data set included 15,461 subjects with age of 20-85 years old. After excluding those subjects with incomplete or missing data or who refused to link their data with the NHI data, 12,283 subjects were used for analyses. Results: In general, obesity-related disorders, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular diseases have increasing prevalence with greater body mass index (BMI; P < 0.001). Obese subjects (BMI 27 kg/m2 ) had the highest prevalence of hypertension (31.9%), after DM (26.9%). After adjusting for age, smoking, drinking and obesity-related disorders, it was found that medical utilization in outpatient increases from 1.33 to 4.04 visits/year (P < 0.001) and in-hospital increases from 0.05 to 0.07 admissions/year (P > 0.05) with higher BMI. Average outpatient expenditure (including physician fee, laboratory test and drug costs) per year is NT$1201, 1857, 3960, and 5118 (at an exchange rate of NT$32 to US$1) for underweight, normal, overweight, and obese subjects, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Medical utilization and outpatient medical expenditure was found to increase with higher BMI status. However, there was a J-shaped (in female) or even negative (in male) relationship between BMI and in-hospital medical expenditures. Further studies are needed to resolve this major public health problem, even in a developing country such as Taiwan.","[Chu, Nain-Feng] Taipei Med Univ, Dept Med, Natl Def Med Ctr, Shuang Ho Hosp,Sch Publ Hlth, Taipei 114, Taiwan; [Chu, Nain-Feng] Taipei Med Univ, Shuang Ho Hosp, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Hsin-Yi] Natl Hlth Res Inst, Dept Publ Policy, Miaoli, Taiwan",National Defense Medical Center; Taipei Medical University; Shuang Ho Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Shuang Ho Hospital; National Health Research Institutes - Taiwan,"Chu, NF (通讯作者)，Taipei Med Univ, Dept Med, Natl Def Med Ctr, Shuang Ho Hosp,Sch Publ Hlth, 161,Sect 6,Min Chuan E Rd, Taipei 114, Taiwan.",chuepi@ndmctsgh.edu.tw,"Chang, Hsing-Yi/E-3973-2010; Chu, Nain-Feng/HNB-4015-2023","Chu, Nain-Feng/0000-0003-1513-4995","NSC, Taiwan; Sanofi-Aventis Taiwan Co., Ltd.","NSC, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Sanofi-Aventis Taiwan Co., Ltd.","NSC, Taiwan and Sanofi-Aventis Taiwan Co., Ltd.",,27,10,11,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2010,13.0,6,,,,,829,836,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00776.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,648BZ,20825625.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281666700018,0

The question addressed in the present study on reimbursement drugs and addictive drugs is whether increased competition among GPs, which is part of a declared health policy to improve efficiency, contributes to more prescriptions for the elderly. The dataset comprises registered data of all prescribed drugs dispensed at pharmacies from the Norwegian Prescription Database merged with data on GPs. In choosing a method, particular attention is given to the fact that patients tend to be attracted to GPs who fit their preferences. Hence, we treat the composition of the patient list as endogenous. The results indicate that the stronger competition a GP faces, the more drugs are prescribed, which implies that GPs' prescription style may conflict with their role as gatekeepers, and even worse, it may be a hazard to patients' health.

Methods: In interviews, the suitability, content coverage, and relevance of the COS were tested on participants in a lung cancer screening program. The results were thematically analyzed to identify the key consequences of abnormal and false-positive screening results. Item Response Theory and Classical Test Theory were used to analyze data. Dimensionality, objectivity, and reliability were established by item analysis, examining the fit between item responses and Rasch models. Results: Eight themes specifically relevant for participants in lung cancer screening results were identified: self-blame, focus on symptoms, stigmatization, introvert, harm of smoking, impulsivity, empathy, and regretful of still smoking. Altogether, 26 new items for part I and 16 new items for part II were generated. These themes were confirmed to fit a partial-credit Rasch model measuring different constructs including several of the new items. Conclusion: In conclusion, the reliability and the dimensionality of a condition-specific measure with high content validity for persons having abnormal or false-positive lung cancer screening results have been demonstrated. This new questionnaire called Consequences of Screening in Lung Cancer (COS-LC) covers in two parts the psychosocial experience in lung cancer screening. Part I: anxiety, behavior, dejection, sleep, self-blame, focus on airway symptoms, stigmatization, introvert, and harm of smoking. Part II: calm/relax, social network, existential values, impulsivity, empathy, and regretful of still smoking..","[Brodersen, John; Thorsen, Hanne; Kreiner, Svend] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept & Res Unit Gen Practice, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Brodersen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept & Res Unit Gen Practice, Oester Farimagsgade 5,24Q, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",John.Brodersen@sund.ku.dk,,"Brodersen, John Brandt/0000-0001-9369-3376","Foundation for General Practice, Denmark; Foundation for Psychosocial Research, the Danish Cancer Society","Foundation for General Practice, Denmark; Foundation for Psychosocial Research, the Danish Cancer Society(Danish Cancer Society)","The Foundation for General Practice, Denmark, and the Foundation for Psychosocial Research, the Danish Cancer Society.",,61,47,47,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,601,612,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00697.x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20345552.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200013,0

We find that the health state viewed as equivalent to dead will depend on an individual's health prognosis, probability of survival, and rate of time preference. Our work on maximum endurable time shows that using QALY scores based on long-run preferences to value health states that last for shorter periods can alter cardinal and ordinal valuations. Simulations show that errors of substantial magnitude in QALY scores can consequently result. We describe situations where biases are likely and identify possible corrections. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Choices arc made, if not explicitly, implicitly as some health services are funded and others are not. But what are the primary influences on those choices? We sought to test whether funding decisions are linked to cost effectiveness and to quantify the influence of funding arrangements and community values arguments. We tested this via empirical analysis of 245 Australian health-care interventions for which cost-effectiveness estimates had been published. The likelihood of government funding was modelled as a function of cost effectiveness, patient/target group characteristics, intervention characteristics and publication characteristics, using multiple regression analysis. We found that higher cost effectiveness ratios were a significant predictor of funding rejection, but that cost effectiveness was not related to the level of funding. Intervention characteristics linked to funding and delivery arrangements and community values arguments were significant predictors of funding outcomes. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that funding and delivery arrangements influence both whether an intervention is funded and funding level; even after controlling for community values and cost effectiveness. It suggests that adopting partial priority setting processes without regard to opportunity cost can have the perverse effect of compounding allocative inefficiencies.

Methods: Medical entities listed in national product information sources and their subsidy statuses were compared. The number and overlap of entities available and subsidized were determined. Differences in the age of subsidized medicines were compared using the date of first registration. Differences in licensing delays were compared using a selection of new innovative medicines that provide health gain. Results: Within the inclusion criteria, 779/763 entities were available and 495/471 subsidized in Finland/New Zealand, of which around 30% (30.9% Finland, 29.5% New Zealand) were not available and approximately 40% (41.4% Finland, 38.4% New Zealand) not subsidized in the other country. The proportion of fully subsidized entities was higher in New Zealand (86.2%/29.1%). The entities only subsidized in New Zealand were significantly older than those only subsidized in Finland and the share of licensed and launched innovative medicines was significantly smaller in New Zealand. The differences were equally distributed across the therapeutic groups but clinically relevant differences were rarely found. Conclusions: In New Zealand, medicines are heavily subsidized across therapy groups, but those uniquely subsidized were older entities. In Finland, more newer medicines are subsidized and available, but the level and coverage of subsidy is lower and thus, the patient cost burden is higher. The cost containment policies adopted seem to affect patients' access to medicines mainly by availability in New Zealand and by affordability in Finland.","[Aaltonen, Katri] Univ Kuopio, Dept Social Pharm, Fac Pharm, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Aaltonen, Katri; Ragupathy, Rajan; Tordoff, June; Norris, Pauline] Univ Otago, Sch Pharm, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Reith, David] Univ Otago, Dunedin Sch Med, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of Eastern Finland; University of Otago; University of Otago,"Aaltonen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Kuopio, Dept Social Pharm, Fac Pharm, POB 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",katri.aaltonen@uku.fi,"Norris, Pippa/G-7931-2018; Aaltonen, Katri/GSO-2466-2022; Norris, Pauline/I-1526-2017","Norris, Pippa/0000-0001-8632-4636; Tordoff, June/0000-0001-5571-7592; Norris, Pauline/0000-0003-1656-871X; Aaltonen, Katri/0000-0002-1737-264X",Finnish Cultural Foundation,Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science),Personal research grant from the Finnish Cultural Foundation (K.

However, preserving the heritage significance of historical buildings means also to maximize the preservation of their tangible and intangible heritage dimensions as a whole. To maximize the preservation of a building is also to maximize the reuse of materials, to minimize waste flow and resources consumption, and to extend the lifetime of a building as a whole. The application of building deconstruction practices to historical buildings is addressed here, by discussing its contribution to preserve both tangible and intangible heritage, and the environmental aspects related, such as the reduction of the construction and demolition waste and the consumption of non-renewable resources. Therefore, conservation of a historical building located at the historical centre of Porto, Portugal, is here presented and analyzed as a case study. The flows of materials' mass and embodied energy related to the rehabilitation process were accounted, analyzed, and compared, as a way to measure the environmental benefits of materials reuse, and the preservation of their historical value. The overall results showed that in general selected dismantling highly contributes to minimize the waste flow, as well to reduce the loss of the embodied energy, especially when compared with scenarios of only facade retention.",,,,,,"Amoeda, Rogerio/0000-0002-1965-2979",,,,,13,0,0,1,9,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,461,470,,,,,,10,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400051,0

The Sema Ceremony is a religious ritual central to the Mevlevi Sufi order founded in Konya (Turkey) in the 13(th) century. Due to the secularization reforms that outlawed the Sufi orders in 1925, Sema performances were prohibited in Turkey for about thirty years. Although the Sufi lodges and their activities are still illegal in Turkey, the ceremony was revitalized as a tourist spectacle after the 1950s. While the ceremony is widely popular and frequently performed at present, concerns over the gradual loss of its initial religious meaning led to its proclamation as intangible heritage by UNESCO in 2005. Claiming that the issues concerning the sustainability of cultural practices are intimately tied up with national political processes, this study examines the ways in which the sustainability of the Mevlevi Sema Ceremony is influenced by Turkey's secularization policies.","[Aykan, B.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,,,"bentahar, bahar aykan/K-3226-2015",,,,,,17,1,1,1,5,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,725,732,,,,,,8,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400079,0

Quite apart from the tourist value of heritage, the trade in antiquities and the role of heritage in promoting development strategies, heritage objects and practice are increasingly subject to valuation in economic terms. The debate continues as to whether heritage can be treated as an economic phenomenon: whether heritage goods and assets are inevitably economic in nature because they generate wellbeing that can be measured in economic terms; whether they are non-economic entities that exist in a realm of 'culture' that can be distinguished from the economic; or whether they can be both or either depending upon the specifics of context. This paper will outline an approach to thinking about the value of heritage objects that draws upon both economics and culture. Although inspired by the belief that the heritage is fundamentally non-economic in nature, it offers an opportunity to resolve these debates in a way that benefits both our understanding of 'heritage' as a phenomenon, and that offers economists a new perspective on the valuation of 'public' goods.","[Carman, J.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,,,"Carman, John/AAA-4174-2020",,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,361,364,,,,,,4,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400040,0

In contrast, the effect of employment status on willingness to undertake informal care has been less well explored. This paper concentrates on this less-studied direction of causality using the data provided by 15 waves of the British Household Panel Survey. We find that employment participation and earnings both impact negatively on willingness to supply informal care. This evidence has implications for health and social care policy since informal care has been shown to be a significant substitute for formal long-term care. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is for two reasons. Firstly when cost changes are large the income effect can be significant. This means the change in consumer surplus is no longer a good estimate of the compensating variation-the true measure of welfare benefit. Secondly, in the presence of large cost changes estimating the change in consumer surplus using the Rule of Half can lead to large errors. The paper uses a novel approach based on stated choice and contingent valuation data to estimate the size of this error for the situation of the provision of fixed links to islands in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.","[Laird, James] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Laird, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,399,420,,,,,,22,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200019,0

The management of cultural heritage has become more important in the governance agenda of the State after the 1980s, and serves various purposes and needs of different stakeholders. This paper discusses the governance of archaeological heritage in Guangzhou, South China, which is one of the earliest cities enjoying rapid economic development after the Opening Policy. Based on the management of two archaeological sites, it is argued that the conservation of archaeological sites fits into the government's long-term plan for economic transformation and modernization, and that the local government uses heritage to construct the city's identity, to emphasize the long history of the South against the barbarian image as constructed by the advanced Central. In this process, a senior archaeologist also played a significant role as an active agent. Thus the governance and management of archaeological heritage in Guangzhou is not only a process of a historically marginalized city to glorify itself after being empowered by the economic achievement since the late 1970s, but also Dart of another big economic transformation in South China.","[Lu, T.

This paper examines the possible explanation that the difference could be due to a selection effect. The result is an inability to measure the effect of a mode difference, e.g., comfort, among transport modes. We specify a model that captures the mode difference through a mode dummy and use econometric techniques that allow treatment of the mode dummy as the result of an individual choice and hence endogenous. Using first a standard logit model we find a large and significant difference between the VTT for bus and car. When we control for endogeneity using instruments, the mode dummy becomes smaller and just significant. Our investigation is novel in that it allows for endogeneity in the estimation of VTT but like other applications using instruments the results indicate that we have difficulty in finding good instrumental variables.",,,,,"Fosgerau, Mogens/B-1455-2018","Fosgerau, Mogens/0000-0002-6452-5215; Mabit, Stefan Eriksen/0000-0002-3675-6884",,,,,12,2,2,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,319,330,,,,,,12,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200015,0

These coloured grain wheat was obtained through wide hybridization among common wheat (Triticum L., 2n=42) and other related genotypes, such as Agropyron elongatum, purple-grained tetraploid wheats from Ethiopia etc. The grown common wheat has red coloured grain. The different coloured grains can be used in food industry for a production of new products which could be not only attractive for consumers but they would be also good for their health. The purple and blue forms content different anthocynanins, compounds well known as antioxidants. Our objective based on flavonoid biochemical pathway was to find genes responsible for different grain coloration in a group of 5 genotypes. The first procedure of the analyses was the RNA isolation, a very important step to manage the whole experiment. The isolation of intact, functional total RNA from coloured-grained wheat containing high levels of starches, polysaccharides, and flavonoids was extremely difficult, that is why were used 3 comercional isolation kits (NucleoSpin RNA Plant - Macherey-Nagel, RNeasy Plant Mini Kit - Qiagen, UltraClean Plant RNA Isolation Sample Kit - MO BIO). There is very important to obtain enough RNA of good quality by the isolation, because there is requested at least 125 eta g.mu l(-1) of RNA for RT PCR (Reverse Transcripthase Polymerase Chain Reaction). The range of isolated RNA number is optimal from 125-150 eta g.mu l(-1). According to the results from 3 different isolations 1 kit was chosen.

However, recently opposite effects of CK action, namely promotion of programmed cell death, and cytotoxic effects of over-expression of the CK-biosynthetic gene ipt in tobacco, were recognized. Here we investigated effects of ipt expression in tobacco in detail. We show that hypersensitive response like cell death in expanded tobacco leaves proceeds shortly after ipt induction - the first lesions accompanied with huge wilting being observed in app. 60 hours after induction of ipt expression, and lesions can spread over the entire leaf area within 4 days after induction. Formation of visible lesions was preceded by increase in reactive oxygen species and membrane damage. Further, we demonstrate that lesion formation is a light-dependent process as it is prevented by shading. The level of key redox regulator glutathione was also diminished after ipt expression. Futhermore we show that expression of ipt is followed by stomata closure but resulting decrease in pore conductivity couldn't fully explain extent of damage to leaves as revealed by application of lanolin on surface of the leaves.","[Novak, J.; Pavlu, J.; Brzobohaty, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Brno, Czech Republic; [Novak, J.; Pavlu, J.; Brzobohaty, B.] AS CR, Inst Biophys, Brno, Czech Republic; [Novak, O.] Palacky Univ, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Novak, O.] Inst Expt Bot, Olomouc, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Palacky University Olomouc; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Experimental Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Novák, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Brno, Czech Republic.",jan.novak@mendelu.cz,"Novak, Jan/I-3635-2014; Brzobohaty, Bretislav/D-7212-2012; NOVAK, Ondrej/F-7031-2014","Novak, Jan/0000-0001-6248-5355; Brzobohaty, Bretislav/0000-0002-1552-1314; NOVAK, Ondrej/0000-0003-3452-0154","Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [1M06030]","Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","Work was supported by grant 1M06030 from the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports.",,1,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,836,840,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800110,0

Standard theory, based on instability theorems, predicts that a group employing this method will almost always fail to reach a stable conclusion. But empirical observations do not support the gloomy predictions of the instability theorems. We show that the instability theorems are themselves unstable in the following sense: if the model of voter behavior is altered however slightly to incorporate any of the several plausible characteristics of decision making, then the instability theorems do not hold and in fact the probability of stability converges to 1 as the population increases, when the population is sampled from a centered distribution. The assumptions considered include: a cost of change; bounded rationality; perceptual thresholds; a discrete proposal space, and others. Evidence from a variety of fields justifies these assumptions in all or most circumstances. One consequence of this work is to render precise and rigorous, the solution proposed by Tullock to the impossibility problem. All of the stability results given here hold for an arbitrary dimension. We generalize the results to establish stability with probability converging to 1 subject to trade-offs between the assumptions and the degree of non-centeredness of the population. We also extend the results from Euclidean preferences to the more general class of intermediate preferences. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores the extent to which these services are substitutes. A small area analysis was used with both care home and (tariff cost-weighted) hospital utilisation for older people aggregated to electoral wards in England. Health and social-care structural equations were specified using a theoretical model. The estimation accounted for the skewed and censored nature of the data. For health utilisation, both a fixed effects instrumental variables GMM model and a generalised estimating equations (GEE) model were fitted, the later oil a log dependent variable with predicted values of social care utilisation used to account for endogeneity (bootstrapping was used to derive standard errors). In addition to a GMM model, the social-care estimation used both two-part and tobit models (also with predicted health utilisation and bootstrapping). The results indicate that for each additional 1 pound spent on care homes, hospital expenditure falls by 0.35 pound. Also, 1 pound additional hospital spend corresponds to just over 0.35 reduction on care home spend. With these cost substitution effects offsetting, a transfer of resources to care homes is efficient if the resultant outcome gain is greater than the outcome loss from reduced hospital use.

Methods: All claim records of women aged :50 years and diagnosed with hip fracture from 2002 to 2004 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance. The first 6 months were considered a window period during which patients with fractures were defined as incident cases if their initial records of visit or admission were observed after June 30, 2002. We included only those with claim records showing diagnosis of osteoporosis or prescription for anti osteoporosis drugs. For each patient, we calculated the cumulative claims amount related to the initial and follow-up treatment for 2 years after fracture. Results: A total of 22,247 patients were identified during 2.5 years. During the first year of fracture, an average of 3.28 visits and 0.97 admissions were recorded; during the second year, 0.35 visits and 0.02 admissions were recorded.

This heterogeneity will be masked by estimating the effects at BW mean but can be evaluated by estimating the effects at BW quantiles as fetal health endowment is a strong correlate with the BW quantile order. We estimated the effects of prenatal care visits and delay before prenatal care initiation, on BW mean and quantiles using a sample of infants from Argentina. Self-selection into prenatal care was modeled using 2SLS and instrumental variable quantile regression. Results suggest that the 'mean' effect of prenatal care utilization largely underestimates the effects at lower BW quantiles. About 35 and 77 g increase in BW mean and 0.1 quantile respectively, per visit and about 30 and 139g decrease in BW mean and 0.1 quantile respectively, per week delayed, were estimated. Ignoring self-selection into prenatal care resulted in underestimation of mean and quantile effects. Results highlight the limitation of analyses focused on 'mean effects' in the presence of treatment heterogeneity and emphasize the importance of identifying women at risk for having infants at lower BW quantiles as they may benefit most from earlier and more intensive prenatal care.

Methods: HL was measured by the rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine (REALM) and was characterized as low or adequate. HRQoL and utility scores were assessed using the SF-36, SF-6D, and EQ-5D. Comparisons of sociodemographics and HRQoL in patients with low or adequate HL were made using t test, chi-square, or Mann-Whitney U tests. Spearman's correlation and partial correlations were used to study the relationship between HL, HRQoL, and utility scores, with significant correlations further explored using multiple linear regression models. Results: Data were analyzed from 199 subjects. Patients with adequate HL had significantly higher education levels, better dwelling status, lower disease activity, and better physical functioning (PF). There was a significant although weak correlation between HL level and PF After adjustment, HL level was shown to independently explain 3.7% of the variance in the PF score. Nevertheless, there was no impact of HL on utility assessment or other HRQoL domains. Conclusion: HL did not impact HRQoL in general, but was found to have a weak impact on the PF of patients with rheumatic diseases.","[Fong, Kok-Yong; Thumboo, Julian] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Singapore 169608, Singapore; [Li, Shu-Chuen] Univ Newcastle, Sch Biomed Sci, Discipline Pharm & Expt Pharmacol, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia; [Zhang, Xu-Hao] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Pharm, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Fong, Kok-Yong] Singapore Gen Hosp, Div Med, Singapore 169608, Singapore; [Fong, Kok-Yong; Thumboo, Julian] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Dept Med, Singapore 117548, Singapore",Singapore General Hospital; University of Newcastle; National University of Singapore; Singapore General Hospital; National University of Singapore,"Thumboo, J (通讯作者)，Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Outram Rd, Singapore 169608, Singapore.",julian.thumboo@sgh.com.sg,"LI, SHU CHUEN/G-7911-2013",,,,,,1,33,37,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV-DEC,2009,12.0,,,3,2,,S106,S109,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00640.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,524KG,20586970.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000272141600023,0

We introduce a nonparametric estimator of the stable index that achieves the parametric root n rate of convergence. For the volatility function, due to the heavy-tailedness, the classical least-squares method is not applicable. We then propose a nonparametric least-absolute-deviation or median-quantile estimator and study its asymptotic behavior, including asymptotic normality and maximal deviations, by establishing a representation of Bahadur-Kiefer type.

In particular, similarity relations on time and outcomes, exponential, quasi-hyperbolic and hyperbolic discounting are special cases of the theorems. This approach identifies certain factors that are common to time preference structures which look so different.

Using a proprietary eight-year panel dataset (1987-1994) that catalogues application-level automation for the complete census of the 3000 U.S. hospitals with more than 100 beds, this study finds that both financial/administrative and clinical IT systems at the most thoroughly automated hospitals are associated with declining costs three and five years after adoption. At the application level, declining costs are associated with the adoption of some of the newest technologies, including systems designed for cost management, the administration of managed care contracts, and for both financial and clinical decision support. The association of cost declines with lagged IT as well as the cost patterns at the less automated hospitals both provide some evidence of learning effects.

Combining a computable general equilibrium analysis with abundant empirical data on heterogenous household types, we investigate both the distributional and allocative impact of such a reform proposal. Our results indicate efficiency gains in terms of GDP and employment. This is because employed households of all skill types would increase their labour supply. Yet, while these household types would benefit from introducing health premia, others, such as those including pensioners or unemployed individuals, may suffer in terms of equivalent variations, despite tax-financed compensating transfers to these low-income households. Nonetheless, such transfers are an essential part of the reform proposal in order to mitigate redistributional effects. By comparing two different compensation schemes, we find that higher transfers go along with higher GDP and employment. This result may indicate that more redistribution comes at no efficiency costs.

We consider both the logical possibility of coalitional manipulation, and the number of voters who must be recruited to form a manipulating coalition. It is shown that the manipulation problem may be well approximated by a very simple linear program in two variables. This permits a comparative analysis of the asymptotic (large-population) manipulability of the various rules. It is seen that the manipulation resistance of positional rules with 5 or 6 (or more) candidates is quite different from the more commonly analyzed three- and four-candidate cases.

EU-SOHO is an observational study of outcomes associated with antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia in an outpatient setting. HRQL was assessed at study entry and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D). UK population time trade-off (TTO) tariffs were applied to the self-rated EQ-5D health states to calculate HRQL ratings (0 = death, 1 = best). An epoch analysis approach was used as a conceptual framework to analyze the longitudinal data. Follow-up was divided into epochs or periods of continuous treatment. When a patient changed antipsychotic treatment, he or she was considered to have a new observation. Multilevel models were employed to evaluate the association of HRQL with medication and other clinical and sociodemographic variables for each epoch. A total of 9340 patients were analyzed (42.1% women; mean age 40 years). Mean EQ-5D scores increased over time; the largest improvement occurred in the first 6 months (mean increase of 0.19). Longer duration of illness and older age at first treatment were associated with worse baseline EQ-5D scores. Improvements in EQ-5D scores were greater for more socially active patients or those in paid employment. Few significant differences were found between antipsychotic medications. Olanzapine and clozapine were associated with higher HRQL increases. Continuous antipsychotic treatment is associated with important HRQL benefits at 3 years, most of which occurs during the first 6 months. Although some medications are associated with better HRQL outcomes, differences are small.","[Alonso, Jordi] Inst Municipal Invest Med, Hlth Serv Res Unit, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Alonso, Jordi] CIBERESP, Barcelona, Spain; Eli Lilly & Co, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [Croudace, Tim] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Brown, Jacqueline] Eli Lilly & Co, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [Gasquet, Isabelle] Hop Paul Brousse, Dept Publ Hlth, AP HP, Villejuif, France; [Knapp, Martin R.

We find that brand- and packaging-specific beer sales are highly price elastic. Cross-price elasticity estimates Suggest that individuals are more likely to buy a higher-volume package of the same brand of beer than they are to switch brands. Policy simulations suggest that regulation of volume-based price discounts is potentially more effective than a tax increase at reducing beer consumption. Our results suggest that volume-based price discounting induces people to buy larger-volume packages of beer and may lead to an increased overall beer consumption.

A local linear fitting scheme is developed to estimate the coefficient functions. The asymptotic distributions of the estimators are obtained, showing different convergence rates for the stationary and nonstationary covariates. A two-stage approach is proposed to achieve estimation optimality in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic mean squared error. When the coefficient function is a function of a nonstationary variable, the new findings are that the asymptotic bias of its nonparametric estimator is the same as the stationary covariate case but convergence rate differs, and further, the asymptotic distribution is a mixed normal, associated with the local time of a standard Brownian motion. The asymptotic behavior at boundaries is also investigated.

We focus on two types of formal home care that are the most likely to interact with informal care: paid domestic help and nursing care. Using recent European data emerging from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we build a two-part utilization model analyzing both the decision to use each type of formal care or not and the amount of formal care received by the elderly. Instrumental variables estimations are used to control for the potential endogeneity existing between formal and informal care. We find endogeneity of informal care in the decision to receive paid domestic help. Estimation results indicate that informal care substitutes for this type of formal home care. However, we find that this Substitution effect tends to disappear as the level of disability of the elderly pet-son increases. Finally, informal care is a weak complement to nursing care, independently of the level of disability, These results highlight the heterogeneous effects of informal care on formal care use and suggest that informal care is an effective substitute for long-term care as long as the needs of the elderly are low and require unskilled type of care. Any policy encouraging informal care to decrease long-term Care expenditures should take it into account to assess its effectiveness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Constructed water reservoirs have impact on the tailwaters. There are 83 hydroelectric power stations (HPS) and more than 1000 water reservoirs in Lithuania presently. The intention is to install HPS on the existing water reservoirs because water energy is an important renewable energy source. The task of investigation is to describe the changes of hydrological regime in rivers due to construction of water reservoirs. The differences of the hydrological regime are determinated in tailwaters when the water reservoirs are installed with and without HPS. Expected changes of hydrological regime are water level variations, changes of the annual, maximal and low flow, redistribution of river runoff in a year period. Tailwater flow regimes and their changes have been described according to hydrological data of 12 water reservoirs with HPS and 13 reservoirs without HPS. Changes of the river hydrological regime due to construction of water reservoirs were evaluated by statistical and modelling methods (hydrological model RiverWare). The statistical analysis of river runoff changes confirmed that the annual and maximum discharges have decreased and low flow has increased in the tailwaters. Modelling results of water balance of the reservoirs have indicated that the reservoirs without HPS have decreased the low flow discharge more than the reservoirs with the HPS. Influence on the maximum discharges of tailwater is more significant if the reservoir has the installed HPS.","[Gailiuis, Brunonas; Kriauciuniene, Jurate] Lithuanian Energy Inst, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Energy Institute,,hydro@mail.lei.lt; hydro@mail.lei.lt,,,,,,,4,3,3,0,9,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,24,28,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274845700003,0

In this study, initial online trust is composed of two aspects: trusting beliefs and trusting intentions; trusting beliefs is conceptually clustered into three related yet distinct dimensions: ability, benevolence, and integrity. Predictors of initial online trust include perceived website quality, perceived corporate image, and perceived security. The model is empirically tested through a questionnaire-based field study conducted in China. The results indicate that perceived corporate image and perceived security significantly affect all three dimensions of trusting beliefs and hence they are significant antecedents of initial online trust, while no support is found for the hypothesized effect of perceived website quality on initial online trust. Meanwhile, among all three dimensions of trusting beliefs only integrity is found to be a significant antecedent of trusting intentions.

However, it is negatively related to total factor productivity while at a relatively high level.","[Zou, Yi; Li, Kai; Ai, Baojun; Huo, Miao] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang 110004, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China,,zou.yi@163.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,ALFRED UNIV,ALFRED,"ONE SAXON DR, ALFRED, NY 14802 USA",,,978-0-9800510-2-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2183,2188,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BJZ06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267479301027,0

Methods: Vaccination was simulated in populations of 100,000 people at 10 different entomological inoculation rates (EIRs), using an existing stochastic model and a 10-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and EVPI were computed from weighted averages of outputs using two different assignments of the EIR distribution in 2007. Uncertainty was evaluated by resampling of epidemiological, vaccination, and health systems model parameters. Results: Health benefits were predicted consistently only at low transmission, and program costs always substantially exceeded case management savings. Optimal cost-effectiveness was at EIR of about 10 infectious bites per annum (ibpa). Main contributors to ICER uncertainty were uncertainty in transmission intensity, price per vaccine dose, decay rate of the vaccine effect, degree of homogeneity in host response, and some epidemiological model parameters. Other health system costs were unimportant. With a ceiling ratio of 207 international dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted, 52.4% of parameterizations predicted cost-effectiveness in the primary analysis. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness of RTS, S will be maximal in low endemicity settings (EIR 2-20 ibpa). Widespread deployment of other transmission-reducing interventions will thus improve cost-effectiveness, suggesting a selective introduction strategy. EVPI is substantial. Accrual of up-to-date information on local endemicity to guide deployment decisions would be highly efficient.","[Maire, Nicolas; Smith, Thomas A.] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Maire, Nicolas; Smith, Thomas A.] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Shillcutt, Samuel D.; Walker, Damian G.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Walker, Damian G.] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA; [Tediosi, Fabrizio] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy",University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute; University of Basel; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Bocconi University,"Smith, TA (通讯作者)，Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Socinstr 57, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",Thomas-A.Smith@unibas.ch,"Tediosi, Fabrizio/ABC-7880-2020; Smith, Thomas A./B-5569-2015; Tediosi, Fabrizio/AAD-4805-2022; Shillcutt, Samuel/AAV-3189-2020","Smith, Thomas A./0000-0002-3650-9381; Tediosi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-8671-9400; Shillcutt, Samuel/0000-0001-9255-1309; Walker, Damian/0000-0003-4568-0970",Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [39777.01]; DfID,Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); DfID,"Source of financial support: This study was supported by the Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, grant 39777.01.

When the contest is optimally designed, we establish a structural equivalence between this family of noisy-ranking contests and contests built upon Tullock contest success functions. Our result also shows that in this class of noisy-contests, the profit-maximization problem of the planner can be turned into a stochastic choice problem for a planner who has some deterministic preferences over the contestants' win probabilities.

The model is a generalization of the smoothly mixing regressions framework of Geweke and Keane (J Econometrics 2007; 138: 257-290) to the case of a Tobit-type limited dependent variable. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with data augmentation is developed to obtain the posterior distribution of model parameters. The model is applied to the US Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data on total medical expenditure. The results suggest that the model can capture the overall shape of the expenditure distribution very well, and also provide a good fit to a number of characteristics of the conditional (on covariates) distribution of expenditure, such as the conditional mean, variance and probability of extreme outcomes, as well as the 50th, 90th, and 95th, percentiles. We find that healthier individuals face an expenditure distribution with lower mean, variance and probability of extreme outcomes, compared with their counterparts in a worse state of health. Males have an expenditure distribution with higher mean, variance and probability of an extreme outcome, compared with their female counterparts. The results also suggest that heart and cardiovascular diseases affect the expenditure of males more than that of females.

Methods: SEC-QOL was developed following a standardized procedure including review of the literature, interviews with contraception users, and the administration of a pilot questionnaire to 187 women. SEC-QOL consists of 19 items and includes five dimensions. To validate the questionnaire, a multicenter, observational, prospective study was conducted in Spain. The following three study groups were defined: group A (n = 129) comprised women using effective contraceptive methods; group B (n = 251), comprised women about to start using an effective method; and group C (n = 73) comprised women using no or poorly effective contraception. All women attended baseline and final visits (4 + 1 months). Participants completed the SEC-QOL, psychological well-being index, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, and perceived health state questionnaires. Results: At baseline, women from group A had a better HRQOL in all SEC-QOL dimensions, except for breast symptoms. Heavier menstrual bleeding, more androgenic and breast symptoms, menstrual pain, and not using hormonal contraceptive methods were associated with lower HRQOL. SEC-QOL scores showed moderate correlations to psychological well-being index and slightly lower correlation to EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire scores. At follow-up, HRQOL had improved in all groups; most markedly in group B, which obtained an average effect size of 0.59. The minimum important difference was established as a 3.4-point change in the global SEC-QOL score. SEC-QOL obtained a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.82. Conclusions: SEC-QOL is a valid, reliable, and sensitive to change questionnaire for use in daily clinical practice and future research projects on contraception.","[Ignacio Lete, Luis] Hosp Santiago Apostol, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, E-01004 Vitoria, Spain; [Perez-Campos, Ezequiel] Hosp Gen Requena, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Valencia, Spain; [Luis Duenas, Jose] Hosp Univ Virgen Macarena, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Seville, Spain; [de la Viuda, Esther] Hosp Univ Guadalajara, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Guadalajara, Spain; [Angeles Gomez, Maria] Ctr Salud Sexual & Reprod Alicante 3, Alicante, Spain; [Lertxundi, Roberto] Clin Euskalduna, Bilbao, Spain; [Sanchez-Borrego, Rafael] Clin Diatros, Barcelona, Spain; [Canals, Ignaci; Bermejo, Rafael; Arbat, Agnes] Bayer Schering Pharma, Dept Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Badia, Xavier; Perulero, Nuria] IMS Hlth, Barcelona, Spain",Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Lete, LI (通讯作者)，Hosp Santiago Apostol, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, E-01004 Vitoria, Spain.",luisignacio.letelasa@osakidetza.net,"Sánchez-Borrego, Rafael/AAT-4437-2021; Duenas-Diez, Jose-Luis/E-6320-2010","Sánchez-Borrego, Rafael/0000-0001-6583-7440; Canals, Ignasi/0000-0002-3910-3897; Duenas-Diez, Jose-Luis/0000-0001-7596-6289; Arbat, Agnes/0009-0001-5322-9234",Bayer,Bayer(Bayer AG),"This study was promoted by the Spanish Society of Contraception (SEC, Sociedad Espanola de Contracepcion) and funded by Bayer.

It also investigated how well an Australian condition-specific health-related quality of life self-report measure for children with CP, the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children (CP QOL-Child), mapped to the views of UK children and parents. Methods: UK children with CP aged 8 to 13 years and their parents participated in qualitative interviews about their perspectives on the child's quality of life. Results: The interviews with 28 children and 35 parents showed considerable overlap but also some divergence. For example, both parties considered social relationships to be important, but children described how they enjoyed being on their own at times whereas parents tended not to value time spent alone for children. The CP QOL-Child covered most themes considered to be important to the children's quality of life. Omissions included relationships with extended family members, restful recreational activities and associated possessions, relaxing, tiredness, negative emotions, and safety. Conclusions: Both children's and parents' views are required for the development of child health-related quality of life instruments. The CP QOL-Child has good coverage of many aspects discussed in the interviews. Cultural differences may account for its omission of some topics considered important by UK children and parents. Rewording of many of the CP QOL-Child's items and further work on item content would optimize its suitability for UK children and possibly for children elsewhere.","[Parkinson, Kathryn N.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Human Nutr Res Ctr, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Young, Bridget] Univ Liverpool, Inst Psychol Hlth & Soc, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Liverpool,"Parkinson, KN (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Human Nutr Res Ctr, Inst Hlth & Soc, Room M1-151 William Leech Bldg,Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",kathryn.parkinson@ncl.ac.uk,"Young, Bridget/A-2184-2014","Young, Bridget/0000-0001-6041-9901",Economic and Social Science Research Council [RES-000-22-0755]; Medical Research Council [G0800792] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800792] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Source of financial support: This study was funded by an Economic and Social Science Research Council grant, reference No. RES-000-22-0755.",,30,11,13,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,705,711,,10.1016/j.jval.2010.12.003,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839409.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300012,0

A preference-based algorithm for the EXACT would allow utilities to be reported from patients during an exacerbation when EQ-5D data are not available. Objective: To develop the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool-utility (EXACT-U), a condition-specific preference-based measure to report utilities from the EXACT for use in cost-effectiveness studies. Methods: Five items with three to five levels comprise the EXACT-U. Two groups of health states and respondents were constructed to allow for model development (Development group) and predictive validity testing (Validation group) using independent samples. Members of the UK general public each valued 11 randomized health states using time trade-offs (TTOs) scaled from full health/dead with 10-year durations. Regression models estimated from the Development group using individual data, mean data, and panel designs. Models assessed by number of inconsistent coefficients estimated and R(2) and tested against observed utilities from the Validation group using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Results: A total of 55 health states, including the best and worst states, were valued in TTO interviews conducted with 400 respondents. Ten models were developed. The final preferred model contained no logical inconsistencies and found MAE = 0.04 and RMSE = 0.05 with a predicted utility range from 0.09 to 0.95. Conclusions: The EXACT-U is a condition-specific preference-based measure with strong predictive validity to report daily utilities during an exacerbation.","[Petrillo, Jennifer] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, London WC1H 9SY, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Petrillo, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SY, England.",Jennifer.Petrillo@lshtm.ac.uk,"Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020",,Forest Research Institute,Forest Research Institute,"None.

We empirically document the presence of these shifts for a broad list of medical conditions and assess the implications for price indexes. Following the earlier literature, we compare the growth of two price measures: one that tracks expenditures for the services actually provided to treat conditions and another that holds the mix of those services fixed over time. Using retrospective claims data for a sample of commercially insured patients, we find that, on average, expenditures to treat diseases rose 11% from 2003Q1 to 2005Q4 and would have risen even faster, 18%, had the mix of services remained fixed at the 2003Q1 levels. This suggests that fixed-basket price indexes, as are used in the official statistics, could overstate true price growth significantly.

A potential drawback is the high attrition rate of items. The usual solution to handle this problem, high-frequency chaining, can create drift in the index series due to price and quantity bouncing arising from sales. Ivancic, Diewert and Fox (2009) have recently proposed an approach that provides drift free, superlative-type indexes through adapting multilateral index number theory. In this paper we apply their proposal to seven product groups and find promising results. We compare the results with those obtained by using the Dutch method to deal with supermarket scanner data.

Methods: The study included 153 women with clinical preterm labor, who were randomly allocated to either a GTN or placebo arm. All randomized cases were included in the final economic analysis. Differences between the two arms in gestational age at delivery, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, length of NICU stay, and NICU cost were assessed. Costs for non-NICU cases were calculated using Ottawa Hospital data through the Ontario Case Costing Initiative (OCCI). Cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses using a hospital perspective were both conducted. Results: In the 153 randomized cases, 55 babies were admitted to NICU (GTN = 24; placebo = 31). We found no significant differences between the two arms in gestational age at delivery, NICU admission rate (32.4% vs. 39.2%), NICU length of stay (42.7 days vs. 52.8 days), or NICU cost (CAN $34,306 vs. CAN $44,326). Overall, (based on all randomized cases) the cost-effectiveness analyses showed that the GTN arm was the dominant strategy, with both lower cost (CAN $13,397 vs. CAN $18,427) and higher NICU admission avoided rate (67.6% vs. 60.8%) compared to the placebo arm. This dominance persisted in all sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: The use of GTN patch for preterm labor could reduce NICU costs, while improving important neonatal outcomes.

In contrast to the previous literature (e.g., Tao and Wang (1997)) where large delays lead to instability, we show that the relationship between information lags and the stability of equilibria is not monotonic.

However, it is unclear whether the effect of abstinence extends to male students. Here we identify exogenous variation in the timing of first intercourse using a physical development index available for both females and males. Two-stage least squares estimates suggest that abstaining from sexual intercourse increases the probability that females graduate from high school, but has little effect on the educational attainment of males. This pattern of results is consistent with evidence from previous studies that males are less likely than females to suffer adverse psychological consequences from engaging in sexual intercourse at an early age.

This contribution shows and compares different tools, which can be used to ensure incomes during retirement. We stated five categories of investment instruments - retirement income insurance, capital life insurance, investment life insurance, building savings and special investment programs. The solution procedure has two steps. In first step we choose the options that will be further analyzed. We apply multiple criteria decision making methods in terms of each group to choose effective products which will participate in potential client portfolio. Second step is devoted to create a suitable structure of investment instruments. We outline possible portfolio scenarios within the scope of time period representing approximately productive investor's age. A portfolio composition is primarily influenced by claims on costs, rate of profit and risk rate.

The marker of prostate cancer is called prostate specific antigen, PSA, whose small amount is normally secreted by prostatic epithelial cells into the bloodstream. However, increased level of PSA in the blood does not indicate only the presence of prostate cancer, but any abnormality of this gland; it is also very individual and variable. Therefore, many patients are needlessly indicated on other tests that are reliable, but unpleasant. On the other hand, 20% of men with prostate cancer nave PSA level in normal. In addition, the PSA level does not identify the degree of tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, particularly in recent years, when the incidence is increasing more and more, science needs to find a reliable marker of prostate cancer and thereby increase the chances for successful treatment. In 2009, scientists examined 1126 substances, which could serve in the future as reliable markers of this disease. The most excelled substance was sarcosine. Its amount increased in many samples proportionally with the disease stage. Another reason, why this substance could be a marker of prostate cancer, is the fact that in urine samples taken from men without prostate cancer did not occur. The main objective of this study was to optimize the method for rapid and reliable determination of sarcosine in various samples, such as lysates of cultivated prostate cells or urine samples and interaction effect on sarcosine. Furthermore, using this method to confirm or refute the possibility of using sarcosine in the diagnostics of prostate cancer.","[Cernei, N.; Zitka, O.; Sochor, J.; Adam, V; Kizek, R.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Cernei, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",natalia.cernei3@gmail.com,"Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Zitka, Ondrej/L-5588-2019; Cernei, Natalia/M-7505-2019; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Sochor, Jiri/E-1135-2012","Zitka, Ondrej/0000-0001-7607-5058; Cernei, Natalia/0000-0002-8259-1566; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Sochor, Jiri/0000-0001-7823-1544",,,,,9,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,994,1002,,,,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400122,0

The hazardous pollutants (PAHs) represent important group of environmental contaminants and FLT belongs to the most frequent ones. Obtained results demonstrated that pea seedlings were able to take up the FLT via roots from the nutrient solution already after 2 hours of exposure period and transport it into plant shoots. After 30 hours of exposure the highest content of C-14-activity in shoots was found in basal part of stem and the lowest in its apical part. This study showed that toxic organic compounds like PAHs are taken up by plant roots very quickly, transported from roots to shoot, accumulated in plant tissues and therefore they can affect various biochemical and physiological processes in plants.","[Krizova, B.; Zezulka, S.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Plant Physiol & Anat, Inst Expt Biol, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Krízová, B (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Plant Physiol & Anat, Inst Expt Biol, Kotlarska 2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",bara.kri-zova@seznam.cz,"Zezulka, Štěpán/F-2938-2013","Zezulka, Štěpán/0000-0003-2850-7068",,,,,3,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,663,666,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400079,0

Public intervention can be here justified on three grounds: corrections for misperceptions of the survival process and for externalities related to individual preventive behaviour, and redistribution across both earnings and genetic dimensions. The optimal subsidy on preventive expenditures is shown to depend on the combined impacts of misperception, externalities and self-selection. It is generally optimal to subsidize preventive efforts to an extent depending on the degree of individual myopia, on how productivity and genes are correlated, and on the complementarity of genes and preventive efforts in the survival function.

It is known that light induces de-etiolation of seedlings while low light irradiance or dark leads to etiolation and produces yellowish seedlings with long hypocotyls and unopened cotyledons. We were interested whether light applied to roots have any impact on hypocotyl elongation and thus whether the shoot is influenced by irradiance of roots. Plants cultivated on MS are ordinarily exposed to light with all their surface including roots so we performed our experiments with roots exposed to low light and/or covered. We have found roots to play an important role in hypocotyl elongation in a light dependent manner comparable to the role of hormones in this process. Analysis of Arabidopsis mutants in hormone signalling reveal a potential role for cytokinins and ethylene in root-dependent hypocotyl elogation. The double mutant ahk3ahk4 showed that cytokinins could support effects of roots while etr1 mutant indicates that ethylene is more likely an inhibitor of this effect. We show that hypocotyl elongation correlates with elongation of cells in the hypocotyl. Moreover, we would like to highlight the importance of light quality applied to roots. Response of the hypocotyl is colour dependent. These results indicate the importance of light falling on roots on shoot development and open questions about other processes which could be influenced in a similar way. Thus, we could probably begin to re-consider the experimental conditions routinely used in investigating early plant development.","[Novak, J.; Brzobohaty, B.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Novák, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Mol Biol & Radiobiol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jan.novak@mendelu.cz,"Brzobohaty, Bretislav/D-7212-2012; Novak, Jan/I-3635-2014","Brzobohaty, Bretislav/0000-0002-1552-1314; Novak, Jan/0000-0001-6248-5355",,,,,0,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-563-8,,,,2011,,,,,,,687,687,,,,,,1,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2HX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341783400083,0

Methods: Adecision-analytic model with lifelong time horizon was populated with event risks and resource use parameters derived from the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial raw data. In a parallel analysis, key comparator strategy inputs came from Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) patients enrolled in the United Kingdom. Upstream and catheter laboratory-initiated GPI were assumed to be tirofiban and abciximab, respectively. Life expectancy of first-year survivors, unit costs, and health-state utilities came from United Kingdom sources. Costs and effects were discounted at 3.5%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: Higher acquisition costs for bivalirudin were partially offset by lower hospitalization and bleeding costs. In the ACUITY-based analysis, per-patient lifetime costs in the bivalirudin and heparin plus GPI strategies were 10,903 pound and 10,653 pound, respectively. Patients survived 10.87 and 10.82 years on average, corresponding to 5.96 and 5.93 QALYs and resulting in an ICER of 9,906 pound per QALY gained. The GRACE-based ICER was 12,276 pound per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 72.1% and 67.0% of simulation results were more cost-effective than 20,000 pound per QALY gained, in the ACUITY-based and GRACE-based analyses, respectively. Additional scenario analyses implied that greater cost-effectiveness may be achieved in actual clinical practice. Conclusions: Treating NSTE-ACS patients undergoing invasive management with bivalirudin is likely to represent a cost-effective option for the United Kingdom, when compared with the current practice of using heparin and a GPI.

Most occurring of PC's is phytochelatin(2) (PC-2) which is synthesized by phytochelatin synthase (PCS). We focused on developing of the method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detector (HPLC-ED) for determination of PC-2 because it might serve as suitable tool for determination of phytochelatin synthase activity. PCS is the best activated by cadmium ions. We used a model with BY-2 tobacco cells. We conducted the in vivo 3 day cultivation experiment where BY-2 cells were treated by various concentrations of cadmium. We then homogenized the cells and immediately analyzed the extracts by optimized HPLC-ED method.

We employ this approach to value stockpiling of antiviral drugs as a precautionary measure against a possible influenza pandemic. Modifications of the real options approach to include risk attitude and deviations from expected utility are presented. We show that risk aversion counteracts the tendency to delay investment for this case of precautionary investment, which is in contrast to earlier applications of risk aversion to real options analysis. Moreover, we provide a numerical example using real world data and discuss the implications of real options analysis for health policy.

Proposed methods: The panel recommended that IQWiG inform German decision makers of the net costs and value of additional benefits of an intervention in the context of relevant other interventions in that indication. To facilitate guidance regarding maximum reimbursement, this information is presented in an efficiency plot with costs on the horizontal axis and value of benefits on the vertical. The efficiency frontier links the interventions that are not dominated and provides guidance. A technology that places on the frontier or to the left is reasonably efficient, while one falling to the right requires further justification for reimbursement at that price. This information does not automatically give the maximum reimbursement, as other considerations may be relevant. Given that the estimates are for a specific indication, they do not address priority setting across the health-care system. Conclusion: This approach informs decision makers about efficiency of interventions, conforms to the mandate and is consistent with basic economic principles. Empirical testing of its feasibility and usefulness is required. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Caro, J. Jaime] United Biosource Corp, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Caro, J.

To cope with the difficulty of types obtaining reservation utilities being endogenously determined, we first solve a minimax version of the seller's problem by generalizing Myerson's characterization techniques for the non-regular case. The solution is then shown to solve the seller's original maximin problem as well in our setting. We find that the seller's optimal mechanism normally features bunching even in the regular case and the type with the lowest expected payoff is typically not an extreme type. As an important illustration of our characterization procedures, we apply our results to the problem of selling retaliation rights in the WTO. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates whether exposure to a nutritional shock in early life negatively affects survival at older ages, using individual data. Nutritional conditions are captured by exposure to the Potato famine in the Netherlands in 1846-1847, and by regional and temporal variation in market prices of potato and rye. The data cover the lifetimes of a random sample of Dutch individuals born between 1812 and 1902 and provide individual information on life events and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. First we non-parametrically compare the total and residual lifetimes of individuals exposed and not exposed to the famine in utero and/or until age 1. Next, we estimate survival models in which we control for individual characteristics and additional (early life) determinants of mortality. We find strong evidence for long-run effects of exposure to the Potato famine. The results are stronger for boys than for girls. Boys and girls lose on average 4, respectively 2.5 years of life after age 50 after exposure at birth to the Potato famine. Lower social classes appear to be more affected by early life exposure to the Potato famine than higher social classes. These results confirm the mechanism linking early life (nutritional) conditions to old-age mortality. Finally, higher food prices at birth appear to reduce later life mortality of children of farmers from higher social classes. We interpret this as an income effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Employing program evaluation methods, we find that the administrative units participating in the Project have exhibited greater improvements in both maternal and infant health compared to the control ones. Among the infant health characteristics, the MIHP impact is most pronounced for stillbirths and infant mortality resulting from deviations in perinatal period. As for the maternal health, the MIHP is the most effective at combating anemia, blood circulation, and urinary-genital system complications, and late toxicosis. The analysis suggests that the effects are due to early attendance of antenatal clinics, lower share of C-sections, and greater share of normal deliveries. Preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis shows enormous benefit per dollar spent on the project: the cost to benefit ratio is one to 97 taking into account both maternal and infant lives saved as well as cost savings due to the changes in labor and delivery practices.

We estimate the effects of the program on mortality and on household behavior related to child labor and schooling, employment of adults, and fertility. We find consistent effects of the program on reductions in mortality throughout the age distribution, but mainly at earlier ages. Municipalities in the poorest regions of the country benefit particularly from the program. For these regions, implementation of the program is also robustly associated with increased labor supply of adults, reduced fertility, and increased school enrollment.

Even though inpatient days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments are frequently the main drivers of total treatment costs, their unit costs often lack generalizability. Therefore, we aimed to determine the unit costs of inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments specifically for oncological and hematological diseases in The Netherlands from the hospital's perspective. Methods: Unit costs were collected from 30 oncological and hematological departments of 6 university and 24 general hospitals. Costs included direct labor and indirect labor, hotel and nutrition, overheads and capital. Ordinary least squares regression models were constructed to examine the degree of association between unit costs and hospital and hospital department characteristics. All costs were based on Euro 2007 cost data. Results: At university hospitals, the unit costs per inpatient day were determined at 633 in oncological and 680 in hematological departments. At general hospitals, the mean costs per inpatient day were 400. Unit costs for inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits. and daycare treatments equalled the relative ratio 100:21:44. Direct labor costs were the major cost driver and the type of hospital (university, yes/no) was a strong predictor of unit costs. Conclusions: The present study provided unit costs for inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments in the fields of oncology and hematology. The results may be used as Dutch reference unit prices in economic evaluations assessing oncological and hematological diseases.","[Tan, Siok Swan; van Gils, Chantal W.

In particular, it focuses on current smoking intensity of the British individuals sampled in the 29-year follow-up survey of the 1970 British Cohort Study. We estimate endogenous dummy ordinal response models for cigarette consumption and show that HE is endogenous with respect to smoking intensity and that even when endogeneity is accounted for, HE is found to have a strong negative effect on smoking intensity. Moreover, pecuniary channels, such as occupation and income, mediate only a minor part of the effect of HE. Our results are robust to modelling individual self-selection into current smoking participation (at age 29) and to estimating a dynamic model in which past smoking levels affect current smoking levels.

In this paper we compare the responses of SCHIP recipients in a state (Kentucky) that introduced SCHIP premiums for the first time at the end of 2003 with the responses of recipients in a state (Georgia) that increased existing SCHIP premiums in mid-2004. We start with a theoretical examination of how these different policies create different changes to family budget constraints and produce somewhat different financial incentives for recipients. Next we empirically model the impact of these policies using a competing risk approach to differentiate exits due to transfers to other eligibility categories of public coverage from exiting the public health insurance system. In both states we find a short-run increase in the likelihood that children transfer to lower- income eligibility/lower-premium categories of SCHIP. We also find a short-run increase in the rate at which children transfer from SCHIP to Medicaid in Kentucky, which is consistent with our theoretical model. These findings have important financial implications for state budgets, as the matching rates and premium levels are different for different eligibility categories of public coverage.

The test generalizes the nonlinear IV unit root test of Chang (2002) to the case where there exist some common factors in panels. The main idea is to eliminate the cross-sectional dependence through the method of principal components as in Bai and Ng (2004) and then apply Chang's test to the treated data. Under certain conditions, the proposed test is consistent and has a standard normal limiting distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulation results show that the proposed test compares favorably to other alternative tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A cost-utility analysis of treatments for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was conducted using a Markov model, in which patients' yearly transitions between different health states were tracked. Patients were tracked as they moved between the following health states: CHB, HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg-positive CHB patients can have this special health state), virologic resistance, virologic response, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. The transition parameters were derived either from systematic reviews of the literature or from previous economic studies. Cost and utility data came from studies based on a Chinese CHB cohort. One-way sensitivity analyses as well as second-order Monte Carlo and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The entecavir strategy yielded the most quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients when compared with the no treatment, the lamivudine, the adefovir, and the telbivudine strategies. The risks of complications and mortality also decreased. In the economic analysis, the no treatment strategy was the least effective, whereas the entecavir strategy was both the least expensive and the most cost-effective option, followed by telbivudine and lamivudine. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the entecavir strategy would result in improved cost-effectiveness in > 90% of cases at a threshold of $20,000 per QALY. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, the most influential parameters impacting the model's robustness were the utilities of the CHB and virologic response health states. Conclusions: In China, when treating both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB populations, entecavir is the most cost-effective option when compared with lamivudine, adefovir, and telbivudine.","[Wu, Bin; Chen, Huafeng; Shen, Jinfang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Pharm, Renji Hosp, Sch Med, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China; [Li, Te] Yuxi Peoples Hosp, Dept Pharm, Yuxi, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Shen, JF (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Pharm, Renji Hosp, Sch Med, Dongfang Rd 1600, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China.",sjfsjtu@yahoo.com.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2008ZX09312-007],"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",This work was supported by the grant from Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (NO. 2008ZX09312-007).,,29,48,55,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2010,13.0,5,,,,,592,600,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00733.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,635RQ,20561341.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280674200012,0

Usually, the price index is selected first and its cofactor is consequently adopted as the (implicit) quantity index. Unfortunately, even if the price index has good axiomatic properties, its cofactor need not, so the implicit quantity comparison may be axiomatically inconsistent. In this paper, we give a comprehensive study of a family of price indices sharing good axiomatic properties (proportionality, commensurability, and homogeneity) together with their cofactors. This family, called geo-logarithmic, is relevant also because of the empirical circumstance that all known price indices sharing such properties with their cofactors belong to it or can be obtained from geo-logarithmic index numbers through simple transformations. Thus, the geo-logarithmic family seems to play a central role when the joint consistency of price and quantity comparisons is concerned. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we account for the pattern of changes in wage inequality, for the increased relative wage and employment of women, for the emergence of the college wage premium and for the shift in employment from the goods to the service-producing sector. The underlying theory we adopt is neoclassical, a two-sector competitive labor market economy in which the supply of and demand for labor of heterogeneous skill determines spot market skill rental prices. The empirical approach is structural. The model embeds many of the features that have been posited in the literature to have contributed to the changing US wage and employment structure including skill-biased technical change, capital-skill complementarity, changes in relative product-market prices, changes in the productivity of labor in home production and demographics such as changing cohort size and fertility.

J,"Lipman, BL",,,,"Lipman, Barton L.",,,Finite order implications of common priors in infinite models,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Common priors,,"Lipman [Lipman, B., 2003. Finite order implications of common priors, Econometrica, 71 (July), 1255-1267] shows that in a finite model, the common prior assumption has weak implications for finite orders of beliefs about beliefs. In particular, the only such implications are those stemming from the weaker assumption of a common support. To explore the role of the finite model assumption in generating this conclusion, this paper considers the finite order implications of common priors in the simplest possible infinite model, namely, a countable model. I show that in countable models, the common prior assumption also implies a tail consistency condition regarding beliefs. More specifically, I show that in a countable model, the finite order implications of the common prior assumption are the same as those stemming from the assumption that priors have a common support and have tail probabilities converging to zero at the same rate.

Besides, it is one of the few cities with two UNESCO World Heritage declarations (UWH): the site Palmeral de Elche (included in the World Heritage List as ref. n degrees 930 in 2000) and the Mister d'Elx (included among the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2001). The Palmeral is a landscape of groves of date palms, formally laid out, with elaborate irrigation systems, during the Muslim period in the Peninsula. The Misteri is a sacred musical drama of the death, the passage into heaven and the crowning of the Virgin Mary. Since mid-eighteenth century it has been performed in the Basilica of Santa Maria and the surrounding streets. Despite these UWH declarations, the most highly considered identity symbol for the citizens of Elche is the Iberian bust known as the Dama de Elche, exposed in the Archaeological National Museum of Madrid. The authors trace a brief history of these three cultural elements and their relation with the construction of an identidad ilicitana (identity of the inhabitants of Elche) in three different historical periods marked by the economic flourishing and decay and of the city: since the discovery of the Dama in 1897 until the industrialisation and the flows of Spanish immigrants during the sixties; after the industrial crisis in mid-nineties and the political shift towards a cultural tourism development strategy. Combining historical and survey analyses, it is shown how these three cultural elements have been appropriated (and used) by different actors and social groups both in daily practices and in policy-making.","[Carmona-Zubiri, D.; Nogues-Pedregal, Antonio-Miguel] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Elche, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,,,"Nogués-Pedregal, Antonio-Miguel/A-3156-2009","Nogués-Pedregal, Antonio-Miguel/0000-0002-8352-4488",,,,,23,3,3,0,8,GREEN LINES INST SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BARCELOS,"AV ALCAIDES DE FARIA 377 S 12, BARCELOS, 00000, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-95671-3-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,769,+,,,,,,3,Cultural Studies; Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Cultural Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BVJ43,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291664400084,0

Notwithstanding much effort have been made into research of these important molecules, several outstanding issues connected with them have still remained. Undoubtedly, one of them is the exact function of cytokinin-binding proteins. One of the most examined members of this protein family is wheat cytokinin-binding factor 1 (CBF-1). CBF-1 was published to be embryo-specific trimeric protein having remarkable affinity for aromatic cytokinins. Based on its behaviour during embryogenesis and germination, CBF-1 has been assumed to act as a regulator of N-6-benzlyadenin-type cytokinin levels. The main aim of our work was to revise CBF-1 dynamics upon cereal seed germination using advanced proteomic methods. For this purpose, target proteomic approach utilizing mass spectrometry and selected reaction monitoring was used. Then, classical two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by imunodetection of CBF-1 was applied as an independent proteomic tool suitable for verifying of achieved results. Simultaneously, cytokinin-binding activity was monitored employing equilibrium dialysis. Surprisingly, data obtained from initial experiments indicate that CBF-1 remains at the same level within first four days of germination. This finding is in sharp contrast to information published earlier and sheds brand new light on this interesting protein.","[Klaskova, J.; Simersky, R.; Spichal, L.; Lenobel, R.; Strnad, M.] Palacky Univ, Lab Growth Regulators, Slechtitelu 11, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Klaskova, J.; Simersky, R.; Spichal, L.; Lenobel, R.; Strnad, M.] AS CR, Inst Expt Bot, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic; [Svehlova, L.; Sebela, M.] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Experimental Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Palacky University Olomouc,"Klásková, J (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ, Lab Growth Regulators, Slechtitelu 11, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.;Klásková, J (通讯作者)，AS CR, Inst Expt Bot, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.",jana.klaskova@upol.cz,"CHAMRÁD, Ivo/AAT-2972-2021; Sebela, Marek/AAL-2747-2020; Šebela, Marek/GRX-0634-2022; Spichal, Lukas/H-6873-2014","CHAMRÁD, Ivo/0000-0003-3812-6314; Sebela, Marek/0000-0001-9835-1375; Šebela, Marek/0000-0001-9835-1375; Spichal, Lukas/0000-0001-6483-8628",Agency of the Czech Republic [522/09/1576]; Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic [MSM 6198959216],"Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)",This work was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic ( No. 522/09/1576) and by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic ( No. MSM 6198959216).,,16,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7375-453-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,984,991,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BB2IA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000341786800129,0

It is demonstrated that neoclassical theory makes clear and economically testable predictions about these price gaps. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It also shows that a continuous-time formulation can make it simpler (relative to its discrete-time version) to compute and estimate the deep parameters using the likelihood function when non-linearities and/or non-normalities are considered. We illustrate our approach by solving and estimating the stochastic AK and the neoclassical growth models. Our Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that non-normalities can be detected for this class of models. Moreover, we provide strong empirical evidence for jumps in aggregate US data.

Method: This study involved three components. The first was to identify existing population-level EQ-5D TTO studies. The second was to illustrate and discuss the key areas of divergence between studies, including the international comparison of tariffs. The third was to portray the relative merits of each of the approaches and to compare the results of studies across countries. Results: While most articles report use of the protocol developed in the original UK study, we identified three key areas of divergence in the construction and analysis of surveys. These are the number of health states valued to determine the algorithm for estimating all health states, the approach to valuing states worse than immediate death, and the choice of algorithm. The evidence on international comparisons suggests differences between countries although it is difficult to disentangle differences in cultural attitudes with random error and differences as a result of methodological divergence. Conclusions: Differences in methods may obscure true differences in values between countries. Nevertheless, population-specific valuation sets for countries engaging in economic evaluation would better reflect cultural differences and are therefore more likely to accurately represent societal attitudes.","[Norman, Richard; Cronin, Paula; Viney, Rosalie; Street, Deborah] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Fac Business, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [King, Madeleine] Univ Sydney, PoCoG, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Street, Deborah] Univ Technol Sydney, CenSoc, Fac Business, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Street, Deborah] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Dept Math Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Clin Effectiveness, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; Flinders University South Australia,"Norman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Fac Business, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",richard.norman@chere.uts.edu.au,"Norman, Richard P/B-4290-2009; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Norman, Richard/0000-0002-3112-3893; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635",NHMRC [403303],NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"Financial support for this study was provided entirely by NHMRC Project Grant (403303).

Identifying the causal impacts is problematic, however, given endogenous selection into food security status and potential mismeasurement of true food security status. Using recently developed nonparametric bounding methods and data from the 2001-2006 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), we assess what can be identified about the effects of food insecurity on child health outcomes in the presence of nonrandom selection and nonclassical measurement error. Under relatively weak monotonicity assumptions, we can identify that food security has a statistically significant positive impact on favorable general health and being a healthy weight. Our work suggests that previous research has more likely underestimated than overestimated the causal impacts of food insecurity on health. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Responding to this research recommendation, we explore the distributive preferences of the general public using a set of generic social value judgments. We report on a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey, using face-to-face interviews, in a sample of the general population (n = 259). The context for the survey was resource allocation decisions in the UK National Health Service, using the process of health technology appraisal as an example. The attributes used covered health improvement, value for money, severity of health, and availability of other treatments, and it is the first Such survey to use cost-effectiveness in scenarios described to the general public. Results support the feasibility and acceptability of the DCE approach for the elicitation of public preferences. Choice data are used to consider the relative importance of changes across attribute levels, and to model utility scores and relative probabilities for the full set of combinations of attributes and levels in the experimental design used (n = 64). Results allow the relative social value of health technology scenarios to be explored. Findings add to a sparse literature on 'social' preferences, and show that DCE data can be used to consider the strength of preference over alternative scenarios in a priority-setting context.

The term patient-reported outcome (PRO) is used to reflect the patient perceptions of disease and its consequences as well as of treatment and health-care provision. The development of PRO measures has advanced rapidly, and implementation in clinical research and practice is now underway. From an evaluation perspective, recommendations for the choice of PRO measures and an appraisal of the potential benefits of PRO data collection within specific health conditions are needed. Methods: Hemophilia is a rare and clinically well-defined health condition with established and cost-intensive treatment strategies, in which PRO assessment is increasingly recognized as important. For this reason, measurement of PROs in hemophilia focusing on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient preferences were reviewed to identify appropriate measures, to make recommendations for their choice, and to critically examine their impact in international hemophilia research and practice. Results: Using literature searches and expert discussion strategies, generic and targeted measures for HRQoL and patient preferences in adults and children with hemophilia were screened, and 20 were reviewed on the basis of their psychometric properties and international availability. Only a few of the 20 measures have been used in clinical settings or research related to persons with hemophilia. Conclusion: Consequently, an increased use of these measures is recommended to understand patient views on disease and treatment and to judge the impact of PROs for improvements in health care.","[Bullinger, Monika] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Psychosocial Med, Inst Med Psychol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Globe, Denise] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Hlth Sci, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Wasserman, Joan] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Nursing, Ctr Aging, Houston, TX USA; [Young, Nancy L.] Laurentian Univ, Sch Med, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; California State University System; California State University Northridge; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; Laurentian University,"Bullinger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Psychosocial Med, Inst Med Psychol, Martinistr 52,Haus S 35, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",bullinger@uke.uni-hamburg.de,"Young, Nancy/G-3934-2011","Young, Nancy/0000-0002-1739-3299","Bayer HealthCare LLC; Biological Products Division, Baxter BioScience; CSL Behring; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals","Bayer HealthCare LLC(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals); Biological Products Division, Baxter BioScience; CSL Behring; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals(Wyeth)","Source of financial support: The work of the IPSG group is supported by external funding from Bayer HealthCare LLC, Biological Products Division, Baxter BioScience, CSL Behring, and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals administered through the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation, Toronto, Canada.

State-level longitudinal data from 1990 to 2005 are analyzed to determine how various alcohol and traffic policies impact motorcycle safety and whether there are differential effects by type of injury. The results consistently show that universal helmet laws have the most significant effect on both non-fatal and fatal injuries.

A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,bleeding peptic ulcer; cost-effectiveness; Helicobacter pylori; prevention; treatment,HEMORRHAGE; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION,"Background: Clinical trials provide evidence of the high effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication for preventing recurrent ulcer-related gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The best strategy for curing the infection in this setting is, however, still under debate. Objective: To evaluate four different strategies for prevention of rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer hemorrhage: 1) test for H. pylori and treatment, if positive; 2) proton pump inhibitor maintenance; 3) no preventive treatment; 4) empirical H. pylori eradication immediately after bleeding. Methods: A decision analysis model was used, with a time horizon of 2 years and a third-party payer perspective. Costs were estimated for two different settings: a low-cost-for-care area (Spain) and a high-cost area (USA). Main outcome measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage avoided. Results: Empirical H. pylori eradication was the dominant strategy: its estimated rate of recurrent bleeding was lower (6.1%) than those of strategies 1 (7.4%), 2 (11.1%), and 3 (18.4%) and it was the least expensive strategy. The results remained stable when variables were changed inside a wide range of plausible values. Sensitivity analysis also showed that the prevalence of H. pylori in bleeding ulcer was the variable that most influenced the results: when it was below 45% in Spain or below 51% in the United States, empirical eradication was not a dominant strategy although it remained cost-effective. Conclusion: In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, empirical treatment of H. pylori infection immediately after feeding is restarted is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing recurrent hemorrhage.","[Gene, Emili] Inst Univ Parc Tauli UAB, Hosp Sabadell, Serv Urgencies, Corporacio Parc Tauli, Barcelona 08208, Spain; [Gene, Emili; Sanchez-Delgado, Jordi; Calvet, Xavier; Gisbert, Javier P.] Inst Salud Carlos III, CIBEREHD, Madrid, Spain; [Gene, Emili; Sanchez-Delgado, Jordi; Calvet, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Med, Inst Univ Parc Tauli, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez-Delgado, Jordi; Calvet, Xavier] Corporacio Parc Tauli, Hosp Sabadell, Unitat Malaties Digest, Barcelona 08208, Spain; [Gisbert, Javier P.] Hosp Princesa, Serv Aparato Digest, Madrid, Spain; [Azagra, Rafel] ABS Badia Valles DAP Cerdanyola, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEREHD; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Parc Tauli Hospital Universitari; Hospital de La Princesa,"Gené, E (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Parc Tauli UAB, Hosp Sabadell, Serv Urgencies, Corporacio Parc Tauli, Parc Tauli S-N, Barcelona 08208, Spain.",29833egt@comb.es,"Calvet, Xavier/H-3288-2019; Gisbert, Javier P/GRY-2719-2022; Gisbert, Javier P/ABB-7531-2021; Azagra, Rafael/ABG-6900-2020","Calvet, Xavier/0000-0002-6278-9663; Gisbert, Javier P/0000-0003-2090-3445; Gene Tous, Emili/0000-0001-8916-2919; Calvet, Xavier/0000-0002-4413-4209",Instituto de Salud Carlos III,Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),Source of financial support: CIBEREHD is funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III,,10,8,10,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2009,12.0,5,,,,,759,762,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00524.x,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,459SR,19490560.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000267130200017,0

Using a longitudinal sample drawn from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we employed Multiple estimation strategies (individual fixed-effect models, instrumental variable estimation, and difference-in-differences estimation with propensity score matching) to correct the potential selection bias. We find that participating in the NCMS significantly decreases the use of traditional Chinese folk doctors and increases the utilization of preventive care, particularly general physical examinations. However, we do not find that the NCMS decreases out-of-pocket expenditure nor do we find that it increases utilization of formal medical service or improves health status, as measured by self-reported health status and by sickness or injury in the past four weeks. Our study indicates that despite the wide expansion of coverage, the impact of the NCMS is still limited.

This study presents the first economic analysis of URBMI, following a national household survey in nine representative Chinese cities. The survey aimed to answer three questions: Who is covered by the plan? Who gains from the plan? Who is most satisfied with the plan? We have found that there is a U-shaped relationship between URBMI participation rate and income. That is, the extremely rich or poor are the most likely to participate. Those with any inpatient treatment last year or with any chronic disease are also more likely to enroll in URBMI, indicating adverse selection into participation. We have also found that in reducing financial barriers to care, URBMI most significantly benefits the poor and those with previous inpatient care. Finally, those participants ill the bottom 20% of family incomes are happier with URBMI than are their more affluent counterparts.

These studies typically use a classical approach to estimation or have specified normal distributions for the attributes. Specifying normal distributions Call lead to erroneous interpretation: non-normal distributions may cause problems with convergence to the global maximum of the simulated log-likelihood function. Hierarchical Bayes (HB) of MXL is an alternative estimation approach that may alleviate problems of convergence. We investigated Bayesian and classical approaches to MXL estimation using a DCE that elicited preferences for a genetic technology. The classical approach produced Unrealistic results in one of the econometric specifications, which led to an erroneous willingness to pay estimate. The HB procedure produced reasonable results for both specifications and helped ascertain that the classical procedures were converging at a local maximum. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Canonical cointegrating regressions. Econometrica 60, 119-143] canonical cointegrating regression estimator, and Saikkonen's [Saikkonen, P., 1991. Asymptotically efficient estimation of cointegration regressions. Econometric Theory 7,1-21] dynamic OLS estimator. We consider the case where the regression errors are moderately serially correlated and the AR coefficient in the regression errors approaches I at a rate slower than 1/T, where T represents the sample size. We derive the limiting distributions of the efficient estimators under this system and find that they depend on the approaching rate of the AR coefficient. If the rate is slow enough, efficiency is established for the three estimators; however, if the approaching rate is relatively faster, the estimators will have the same limiting distribution as the OLS estimator. For the intermediate case, the second-order bias of the OLS estimator is partially eliminated by the efficient methods. This result explains why, in finite samples, the effect of the efficient methods diminishes as the serial correlation in the regression errors becomes stronger. We also propose to modify the existing efficient estimators in order to eliminate the second-order bias, which possibly remains in the efficient estimators. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that our modification is effective when the regression errors are moderately serially correlated and the simultaneous correlation is relatively strong.

It is specifically concerned with relationships between health and income, especially the extent to which inequality and deprivation in the former is driven by changes in the latter. The paper reports increasing disparity in child mortality among country groups since the mid-1970s. It also reports decreased inequality in life expectancy among countries from the early 1960s until the late 1980s and increased inequality thereafter. Similar patterns in life expectancy deprivation are reported. The paper finds that this is partly due to a changing behavioural relationship between life expectancy and income per capita among countries with low achievement in the former variable. The paper also introduces and provides an overview of the papers that follow in this Supplement.

A decision tree was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam at different time points after introduction of treatment. Development of resistance was incorporated using a compartment model. Resistance was a function of the eradication rate of pathogens and antibiotic prescription. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct costs and cost per QALY saved. Microbiological eradication rate, clinical success, and costs were derived from literature. The analyses included pathogens with intrinsic or acquired resistance. The model suggested overall savings of 355 (95% uncertainty interval 480; 1205) per patient when abdominal infections are treated with ertapenem instead of piperacillin/tazobactam. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found a 94% probability of the incremental cost per QALY saved being within the generally accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness (20,000). After 5 years, it is expected that antibiotic resistance with piperacillin/tazobactam has increased with a greater rate compared to ertapenem, and cost-savings with ertapenem are expected to increase to 672 (-232; 1617). Ertapenem will, in addition, result in greater success rates and in QALY savings (0.17; 0.07-0.30). Alternative scenarios, with lower levels of initial resistance confirm the cost savings with ertapenem. Given the underlying assumptions and data used, this evaluation demonstrated that ertapenem is a cost saving and possibly an economically dominant therapy over piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of community-acquired intraabdominal infections in The Netherlands.","[Jansen, Jeroen P.] Mapi Values, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Kumar, Ritesh] Merck & Co Inc, Outcome Res, Whitehouse Stn, NJ USA; [Carmeli, Yehuda] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Div Epidemiol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Merck & Company; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center,"Jansen, JP (通讯作者)，Mapi Values, 15 Court Sq,Suite 620, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",jeroen.jansen@mapivalues.com,,"Jansen, Jeroen Paul/0000-0003-2686-9217",Merck Co,Merck Co(Merck & Company),This study was supported by Merck & Co.

By using data obtained from Taiwan and focusing on diabetic patients, Our empirical results provide several consistent findings in Support of the hypothesis that profit incentives do affect the physician's prescribing decision, suggesting that physicians act as imperfect agents. An important implication of our findings is that rent seeking for profit margin between the reimbursement and the acquisition price instead of reducing Costs is the major driving force behind generic substitution. As a result, the providers instead of the payers or Consumers reap the financial benefits of generic substitution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Public health officials have consequently become alarmed because recent research indicates that societal costs of obesity now exceed those of cigarette smoking and alcoholism. Cigarette taxes may have exacerbated the prevalence of obesity. In 1964, the US Surgeon General issued its first report relating smoking and health, and since that time, federal and state governments have increased cigarette taxes in a successful effort to reduce cigarette smoking. However, because cigarette smoking and obesity seem inversely related, cigarette taxes may have Simultaneously increased obesity. This paper examines the effects of cigarette costs on BMI and obesity and finds that they have significant positive effects. This paper attempts to reconcile conflicting evidence in the literature by controlling more carefully for correlation with state-specific time trends using panel data. Results indicate that the net benefit to society of increasing cigarette taxes may not be as large as previously thought, though this research in no way concludes that they, should be decreased to prompt weight loss.

Based on Prospect Theory, this difference can be explained by adaptation processes resulting in differences in individual reference points. Using tinnitus as a case in point, our objective is to analyze empirically to what extent differences in risk attitudes (as a proxy to reference points) mediate differences in health valuations. Two hundred ten tinnitus patients and a similar number of unaffected persons indicated their willingness to undergo, hypothetically, an intervention (surgery or treatment) that would either improve or worsen the condition, thus revealing their risk attitudes. Utilities were elicited using three different methods: visual analogue scale (VAS), time trade-off (TTO), and standard gamble (SG). Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to test for mediation of utility differences by reference points. Health status (affected-unaffected) has a significant effect on tinnitus utilities and risk attitude; at the same time, the latter is significantly associated with utilities. Adjusting for risk attitude, differences by health status disappear for SG and TTO, and are alleviated for VAS. Reference points in terms of risk attitudes are a potential confounder in the valuation of health states. Taking into account theoretical predictions and issues in measuring SG, TTO, and risk attitudes, these results cast doubt on the construct validity of SG and TTO, and point to the need to recognize and further clarify the role of reference points in health valuation research.","[Moock, Joern] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Community Med, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany; [Happich, Michael; von Lengerke, Thomas] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen German Res Ctr Environm, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management IGM, Munich, Germany; [von Lengerke, Thomas] Hannover Med Sch MHH, Med Psychol Unit OE 5430, Hannover, Germany",Universitat Greifswald; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Hannover Medical School,"Moock, J (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Walther Rathenau Str 48, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany.",joern.moock@uni-greifswald.de,,"von Lengerke, Thomas/0000-0002-1269-3479","DFG-Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), Kennedyallee 40, 53175 Bonn, Germany.","DFG-Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), Kennedyallee 40, 53175 Bonn, Germany.(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Source of financial support: This study was funded by the DFG-Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), Kennedyallee 40, 53175 Bonn, Germany.",,36,13,14,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2009,12.0,1,,,,,88,95,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00397.x,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,397XX,19911443.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000262696800013,0

Nevertheless, one knows that the growth processes of pigs can be very different. Pigs with the same live weight are put together at the beginning of fattening, but, nevertheless, different weights are to be ascertained at the end of fattening. For the present study a mathematical growth function should be used. The aim is to interpret the different growth courses of pigs better. The study was executed in a barnstable with barrows. In the present study must be separated between results which were ascertained with a comparison by animal groups (1) on the one hand and a comparison of single animals (11), on the other hand. (I) Groups of barrows with high end weight have small growth intensity. Goups of barrows with small end weight show high growth intensity. Live weight curves of a barrow group with small end weight display a explicit curvature. By contrast a barrow group with high end weight and small growth intensity show a streched shape of curve. (II) Is the end weight of two barrows the same there are various growth intensities. At the same growth intensity various end weights appear. The application of the growth function can be recommended for breeding, for the verification and coordination of dates during the period of husbandry as well as feeding.

This new production mode combines those two contradictory modes (customization and mass production) together so that to provide products with mass production quality, speed and price, meanwhile it can realize the delivery of unique product with very small lot size to any individual requirement. In order to compare the Enterprise Mass Customization Ability (EMCA) of different enterprises, certain kinds of evaluating method can be used. By using fuzzy mathematical calculating rules, users can easily translate evaluators' qualitative judgments into quantitative result, so that to provide substantial evidence to decision makers. Therefore, we choose fuzzy synthetic method to do the evaluation. With regard to the real-life case, a theoretic evaluation model based on fuzzy synthetic method is constructed. The fundamental estimating factors and relevant criteria for evaluating enterprise MC ability have been put forward. Furthermore, as an example, the course of fuzzy synthetic evaluation of EMCA is simulated on a certain manufacturer as well.

Removal of dissolved natural organic matter before disinfection of potable water is recommended for the production of potable water in water treatment facilities.

That is because measures to reduce GHG emissions interfere with the heart of the economy and the market: energy (in a broader sense than the energy sector as defined by statistics) and economical growth. Analyzing the environmental policy responses to climate change the conclusion is that GHG emission reduction can only be achieved through intensive environmental policy. While extensive environmental protection complements production horizontally, intensive environmental protection integrates into production and the environment vertically. The latter eliminates the source of the pollution, preventing damage. It utilizes the biochemical processes and self-purification of the natural environment as well as technical development which not only aims to produce state-of-the-art goods, but to make production more environmentally friendly, securing a desired environmental state. While in extensive environmental protection the intervention comes from the outside for creating environmental balance, in intensive environmental protection the system recreates this balance itself. Instead of dealing with the consequences and the polluter pays principle, the emphasis is on prevention. It is important to emphasize that climate strategy decisions have complex effects regarding the aspects of sustainability (economical, social, ecological). Therefore, all decisions are political. At present, and in the near future, market economy decisions have little to do with sustainability values under normal circumstances. Taking social and ecological interests into consideration can only be successful through strategic political aims.","[Szlavik, Janos; Fule, Miklos] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ & Law, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,,szlavikj@eik.bme.hu; fulem@eik.bme.hu,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,8,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,1157.0,,,,,,73,82,,,,,,10,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000270167600010,0

To increase the effectiveness, this paper proposes to shift the deductible range to [s(i),s(i)+d], with starting point s(i) depending on relevant risk characteristics of individual i. In an empirical illustration we assume the optimal shift to be such that the variance in out-of-pocket expenditures is maximized. Results indicate that for the 10-percent highest risks in our data the optimal starting point of a (sic) 1000-deductible is to be found (far) beyond (sic) 1200, which corresponds with a deductible range of [1200,2200] or further. We conclude that, compared to traditional deductibles, shifted deductibles with a risk-adjusted starting point lower out-of-pocket expenditures and may further reduce moral hazard.

We find a significant positive relation between the degree of firm-specific information capitalized into price and the level of initial underpricing for bookbuilding IPOs. Additionally, there is no such significant relation for non-bookbuilding IPOs. The clear preponderance of the evidence suggests that bookbuilding makes the pricing of IPOs more informative, and the participation of institutional investors plays an important role in value discovery.

We find that only primary care performance in stroke care is associated with lower hospital costs. Our results suggest that the 10% improvement in the general practice quality of stroke care between 2004/5 and 2007/8 reduced 2007/8 hospital expenditure by about 130 pound million in England. The cost savings are due mainly to reductions in emergency admissions and outpatient visits, rather than to lower costs for patients treated in hospital or to reductions in elective admissions.

Of these, 25% may be eligible for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) due to low left ventricular ejection fraction. Given the high costs of implantation, the purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ICDs compared to conventional therapy in patients with an ejection fraction 30% or less after MI in Germany. Methods: The economic evaluation was performed from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. To simulate costs and effectiveness over lifetime, a Markov model was constructed with seven health states. The model was based on 8-year follow-up data for ICD implantation after myocardial infarction (MADIT II), which was published recently. Results: The analysis shows that ICD implantation compared to conventional therapy in patients fulfilling MADIT-II criteria has a cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)44,736 per quality-adjusted life year gained. If every patient insured by the statutory health insurance and fulfilling the MADIT-II criteria would receive an ICD, the model suggests expenditures between (sic)173 million and (sic)1.7 billion per year. Conclusions: ICD therapy cannot be considered clearly cost-effective when compared to many well-accepted interventions.

Non-severe hypoglycemic events (NSHEs) occur more frequently than severe events and account for the majority of total events. The objective of this multi-country study was to identify how NSHEs in a working population affect productivity, costs, and self-management behaviors. Methods: A 20-minute survey assessing the impact of NSHEs was administered via the Internet to individuals (>= 18 years of age) with self-reported diabetes in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France. The analysis sample consisted of all respondents who reported an NSHE in the past month. Topics included: reasons for, duration of, and impact of NSHE(s) on productivity and diabetes self-management. Results: A total of 1404 respondents were included in this analysis. Lost productivity was estimated to range from $15.26 to $93.47 (USD) per NSHE, representing 8.3 to 15.9 hours of lost work time per month. Among individuals reporting an NSHE at work (n = 972), 18.3% missed work for an average of 9.9 hours (SD 8.4). Among respondents experiencing an NSHE outside working hours (including nocturnal), 22.7% arrived late for work or missed a full day. Productivity loss was highest for NSHEs occurring during sleep, with an average of 14.7 (SD 11.6) working hours lost. In the week following the NSHE, respondents required an average of 5.6 extra blood glucose test strips. Among respondents using insulin, 25% decreased their insulin dose following the NSHE. Conclusions: NSHEs are associated with substantial economic consequences for employers and patients. Greater attention to treatments that reduce NSHEs could have a major, positive impact on lost work productivity and overall diabetes management.","[Brod, Meryl] Brod Grp, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA; [Christensen, Torsten; Thomsen, Trine L.] Novo Nordisk AS, Virum, Denmark; [Bushnell, Donald M.] Hlth Res Associates, Mountlake Terrace, WA USA",The Brod Group; Novo Nordisk,"Brod, M (通讯作者)，Brod Grp, 219 Julia Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA.",mbrod@thebrodgroup.net,,"Pilgaard, Trine/0000-0002-1771-956X",Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),Source of financial support: This study was funded by Novo Nordisk.,,27,203,216,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2011,14.0,5,,,,,665,671,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.02.001,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,876BG,21839404.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299081300007,0

The infinitesimal operator based identification of the diffusion process is equivalent to a martingale hypothesis for the processes obtained by a transformation of the original diffusion model. My test procedure is then constructed by checking the martingale hypothesis via a multivariate generalized spectral derivative based approach that delivers a N (0, 1) asymptotical null distribution for the test statistic. The infinitesimal operator of the diffusion process is a closed-form function of drift and diffusion terms. Consequently, my test procedure covers both univariate and multivariate diffusion models in a unified framework and is particularly convenient for the multivariate case. Moreover, different transformed martingale processes contain separate information about the drift and diffusion specifications. This motivates me to propose a separate inferential test procedure to explore the sources of rejection when a parametric form is rejected. Simulation studies show that the proposed tests have reasonable size and excellent power performance. An empirical application of my test procedure using Eurodollar interest rates finds that most popular short-rate models are rejected and the drift misspecification plays an important role in such rejections.

It shows that, when health care providers face an identical distribution of patient illness severities, the multidimensional measures in the existing report cards render them a mechanism that reveals the providers' qualities without causing them to select patients. However, non-identical patient type distributions between providers, attributed to the referring physician, may force the high-quality provider to shun patients in order to signal himself. Despite this imperfection, the existing report cards cause the minimum provider selection compared with alternative report mechanisms. Since the report cards not only may cause providers to select patients, but also cause patients to select providers, the single difference-in-differences estimates used in previous studies are not sufficient to indicate providers' selection behavior. In an updated empirical framework, a treatment effect shall be estimated once every period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A few studies have considered the possibility that the impact of cigarette taxes and prices might differ by gender or race/ethnicity. In this paper, we address the role of cigarette taxes and prices on youth smoking initiation using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort and discrete-time survival methods. We present results overall and by gender, race/ethnicity, and gender by race/ethnicity. We examine initiation over the age range during which youth are most at risk of initiation and over a period in which substantial changes have occurred in tax and price. The result for cigarette excise taxes is small and mixed across alternative specifications, with the effect strongest for black youth. Cigarette prices are more consistently a significant determinant of youth smoking initiation, especially for black youth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is known as the 'red herring' hypothesis. In this article, we investigate whether this is also the case regarding disease-specific hospital expenditures. Longitudinal data samples from the Dutch hospital register (n = 11 253 455) were used to estimate 94 disease-specific two-part models. Based on these models, Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the predictive value of proximity to death and age on disease-specific expenditures. Results revealed that there was a clear effect of proximity of death on health care expenditures. This effect was present for most diseases and was strongest for most cancers. However, even for some less fatal diseases, proximity to death was found to be an important predictor of expenditures. Controlling for proximity to death, age was found to be a significant predictor of expenditures for most diseases. However, its impact is modest when compared to proximity to death. Considering the large variation in the degree to which proximity to death and age matter for each specific disease, we may speak not only of age as a 'red herring' but also of a 'carpaccio of red herrings'.

Unlike any other local labor market series produced in the US or the rest of the world, QWI measure employment flows for workers (accession and separations), jobs (creations and destructions) and earnings for demographic subgroups (age and gender), economic industry (NAICS industry groups), detailed geography (block (experimental), county, Core-Based Statistical Area, and Workforce Investment Area), and ownership (private, all) with fully interacted publication tables. The current QWI data cover 47 states, about 98% of the private workforce in those states, and about 92% of all private employment in the entire economy. State participation is sufficiently extensive to permit us to present the first national estimates constructed from these data. We focus on worker, job, and excess (churning) reallocation rates, rather than on levels of the basic variables. This permits a comparison to existing series from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and the Business Employment Dynamics Series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The national estimates from the QWI are an important enhancement to existing series because they include demographic and industry detail for both worker and job flow data compiled from underlying micro-data that have been integrated at the job and establishment levels by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program at the Census Bureau. The estimates presented herein were compiled exclusively from public-use data series and are available for download. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The firm has a vintage capital technology with two complementary factors, capital and a resource input subject to quota, the latter being increasingly scarce through an exogenously rising price. The firm can scrap obsolete capital and invest in adoptive and/or innovative R&D resource-saving activities. Within this realistic framework, we first characterize long-term growth regimes driven by scarcity (induced-innovation) vs. long-term growth regimes driven by quota regulation (Porter-like innovation). More importantly, we study the interaction between scarcity and quota regulation. In particular, we show that there exists a threshold level for the growth rate of the resource price above which the Porter mechanism is killed while the scarcity-induced growth regime may emerge. Symmetrically, we also find that there must exist a threshold value for the environmental quota under which the growth regime induced by scarcity vanishes while the Porter-like growth regime may survive.

We suggest that the ambiguous findings in the extant literature may be due in part to unobserved heterogeneity in response and in part due to an overly broad measure of job loss that is partially endogenous (e.g., layoffs). We improve upon this literature using: exogenously determined business closings, a sophisticated estimation approach (finite mixture models) to deal with complex heterogeneity, and national, longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study. For both alcohol consumption and BMI, we find evidence that individuals who are more likely to respond to job loss by increasing unhealthy behaviors are already in the problematic range for these behaviors before losing their jobs. These results suggest the health effects of job loss could be concentrated among at risk individuals and could lead to negative outcomes for the individuals, their families, and society at large.

We apply an instrumental variables approach using as natural experiments several changes in compulsory schooling laws between 1949 and 1969. These law changes generate exogenous variation in years of schooling both across states and over time. We find evidence for a strong and significant causal effect of years of schooling on long-term illness for men but not for women. Moreover, we provide somewhat weaker evidence of a causal effect of education on the likelihood of having weight problems for both sexes. On the other hand, we find little evidence for a causal effect of education on smoking behavior. Overall, our estimates suggest significant non-monetary returns to education with respect to health outcomes but not necessarily with respect to health-related behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Potentially, such work has practical implications for policy-makers and the courts. However, this article argues that we need to be careful in such work to use the appropriate statistical method. It goes beyond previous research and allows for heterogeneity in the subjective well-being scales. Using less restrictive models than the current literature, the article argues that standard linear or ordered response models seem consistently to overstate valuations. With data from the UK, it provides new monetary estimates of the well-being consequences of a number of health problems, social capital indicators, marital status changes and social relationships.

The objective of this analysis was to compare asthma control outcomes in matched cohorts of MF- and FP-treated asthma patients stratified by SABA claims. Methods: A retrospective pharmacy claims database analysis identified matched cohorts of asthma patients (aged 12-65 years) who initiated treatment with MF or FP. Patients with none, one to four, five to eight, or more than eight SABA preindex claims were stratified to categories A, B, C, and D, respectively. Bivariate analyses compared postindex SABA canister claims, adherence, and exacerbations; multivariate analyses compared postindex SABA canister claims. Results: Matched patients in categories A (n = 2517 per cohort) and B (n = 2329 per cohort) were analyzed; insufficient sample sizes were identified for categories C and D. Postindex bivariate analyses indicated that MF cohorts had fewer SABA claims compared to FP cohorts (category A, 0.80 vs. 1.17 [P < 0.0001]; category B, 1.39 vs. 1.58 [P < 0.0001]), better adherence to the index drug (category A, 24% vs. 15% [P < 0.0001]; category B, 27% vs. 15% [P < 0.0001]), and fewer exacerbations (category A, 0.17 vs. 0.19 [P = 0.011]; category B, 0.17 vs. 0.21 [P = 0.008]). Multivariate analyses indicated that MF cohorts had fewer postindex SABA claims compared to FP cohorts in categories A and B (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Data for SABA claims, treatment adherence, and exacerbations suggest that, compared to twice-daily FP, once-daily MF may provide better asthma control.

However, rankings of social states by attainment and shortfall inequality do not necessarily mirror one another. We propose a requirement, that attainment inequality and shortfall inequality be measured consistently, and we examine the performance of partial orderings and indices of inequality in this respect. For relative inequality and all currently documented intermediate inequality concepts, the orderings fail our consistency requirement, as do all indices which respect these orderings. However, the absolute inequality partial ordering satisfies consistency. We identify two classes of indices of absolute inequality, one containing rank-independent and the other rank-dependent indices, which measure attainment and shortfall inequality consistently (in fact identically). The only subgroup decomposable inequality index, of any type, which measures attainment and shortfall inequality consistently is the variance. We discuss implications for the study of pure health inequality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We compared published cost-effectiveness results (incremental cost, quality-adjusted life year, and cost-effectiveness ratio) of three models conforming to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines dealing with three interventions (statins, percutaneous coronary intervention, and clopidogrel) with a model developed in Southampton. Comparisons were made using three separate stages: 1) comparison of published results; 2) comparison of the results using the same data inputs wherever possible; and 3) an in-depth exploration of reasons for differences and the potential for consensus. Results: Although published results differed by up to 73% (for statins), standardization of inputs (stage 2) narrowed these gaps. Greater understanding of the reasons for differences was achieved, but a consensus on preferred values for all data inputs was not reached. Conclusions: We found that published guidance on methods was important to reduce variation in important model inputs. Although the comparison of models did not lead to consensus for all model inputs, it provided a better understanding of the reasons for these differences, and enhanced the transparency and credibility of all models. Similar comparisons would be aided by fuller publication of models, perhaps through detailed web appendices.

Evaluations in these areas are expressed by values of linguistic fuzzy scales. The presented model is based on a fuzzy rules base. On the left sides of the rules, there are combinations of scale values representing evaluation of workers in these three areas, on the right sides there are corresponding job types.

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relative efficacy of adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and nucleos(t)ide combinations in the treatment of CHB. Methods: A systematic review of MEDLINE and the Cochrane library was conducted to identify all studies evaluating these nucleos(t)ides in adults with CHB. Randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis if they reported the proportion of patients with undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss/seroconversion at 1 year. Bayesian mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses were conducted in WinBUGS to assess relative efficacy. Results: A random-effects meta-analysis of trials on treatment-naive patients with HBeAg-positive CHB demonstrated that 94% of patients will achieve HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml after 1 year with TDF, compared with 73% for entecavir, 50% for adefovir, and 38% for lamivudine. There was a 97.7% probability that TDF enabled a greater proportion of patients to achieve HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml at 1 year than all other treatments considered in the analysis. TDF was significantly superior to all nucleos(t)ides for this outcome at the 0.05 level. There were no statistically significant differences between nucleos(t)ides in HBeAg seroconversion at 1 year, based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis in the same population. More trials on HBeAg-negative and drug-resistant patients are required to facilitate meta-analyses for these subgroups. Conclusions: In nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with HBeAg-positive CHB, TDF is associated with the highest probability of achieving undetectable HBV DNA at 1 year of all nucleos(t)ides considered.","[Dakin, Helen; Fidler, Carrie; Harper, Christie] Abacus Int, Bicester OX26 6AA, Oxon, England; [Dakin, Helen] Univ Oxford, Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Dakin, H (通讯作者)，Abacus Int, 4 Market Sq, Bicester OX26 6AA, Oxon, England.",helen.dakin@abacusint.com,"Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018","Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X","Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge, UK","Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge, UK","Funded by Gilead Sciences Ltd, Cambridge, UK.",,77,30,35,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2010,13.0,8,,,,,934,945,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00777.x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,691FR,20825624.0,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285066200011,0

Methods: All reports evaluating diagnostic test via an economic decision model published by the NHS Research and Development Health Technology Assessment (HTA) program since 1997 were identified. The methods for evidence synthesis of diagnostic test accuracy data and its use in economic decision modeling in this sample were reviewed. Results: Forty-four HTA reports out of 474 concerned diagnostic accuracy, of which 11 did not do any economic evaluation. Of the remaining 33 HTAs, 14 conducted meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy in the clinical review but only 8 used such pooled estimates to inform the decision model. A number of meta-analysis methods ranging in complexity were applied to estimate diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, when it came to informing the economic decision model, the majority of reviews used independent meta-analytic estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Often, very simplistic methods to estimate diagnostic test accuracy were used for purposes of informing an economic decision model. The assumptions made by the simplistic methods are usually invalid which may lead to suboptimal decisions being made. It is desirable that decision modelers become aware of the rapid evolution of meta-analysis methods in this area; however, further research is still required to identify how the pooled results obtained from the different meta-analysis models should best be used to inform economic decision models.","[Novielli, Nicola; Cooper, Nicola J.; Abrams, Keith R.; Sutton, Alex J.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Cooper, NJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Adrian Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",njc21@le.ac.uk,"Abrams, Keith/AAA-2557-2020","Novielli, Nicola/0000-0001-9314-7092; Abrams, Keith/0000-0002-7557-1567; Sutton, Alexander/0000-0002-8934-9940",UK National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0508-10061],UK National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),No external funding was received for this research.

Not too surprisingly, we find no significant impact in the low- and middle-income country sample.

Each individual's preference ordering is assumed to admit a utility representation through an element of an exogenously given set of admissible utility functions. In addition, we assume that (i) the class of admissible utility functions allows fora smooth parametrization and only consists of strictly concave functions, (ii) the population is infinite, and (iii) the social welfare function satisfies Arrovian rationality axioms. We prove that there exists an admissible utility function r, called representative utility function, such that any alternative which maximizes r also maximizes the social welfare function. Given the structural similarities among the admissible utility functions (due to parametrization), we argue that the representative utility function can be interpreted as belonging to an - actual or invisible- individual. The existence proof for the representative utility function utilizes a special nonstandard model of the reals, viz, the ultrapower of the reals with respect to the ultrafilter of decisive coalitions; this construction explicitly determines the parameter vector of the representative utility function.

Applying this result to the problem of choice from competitive budget sets allows for a proof of the existence of a demand correspondence for a consumer who has preferences within this class that are also convex. Similarly to the textbook theory of utility maximization, this proof also uses the Maximum Theorem. With an additional mild convexity axiom that conceptually parallels uncertainty aversion, the correspondence reduces to a function that satisfies WARP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I examine referral patterns to cardiac surgeons to assess whether publication of the May 2002 edition of Pennsylvania's Guide to Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery added information to what referring physicians already knew. To do so, I developed a counterfactual scenario, including a simulated analogue report card, based on comparable data from Florida, a state without CABG report cards. My analysis failed to detect a significant change in referral patterns to either low-mortality or high-mortality cardiac surgeons. At the same time, referring physicians on average appear to have been knowledgeable about the relative performance of cardiac surgeons without report cards. Future report card efforts might benefit from incorporating the quality signals contained in referral patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the impact of such supplementary insurance on the utilisation of doctor consultations in Portugal, taking advantage of institutional features which make double coverage plausibly exogenous. The novelty is that the analysis is carried out for different points of the conditional distribution, not only for its mean location, within the context of count data modelling and without imposing restrictive parametric assumptions. Results indicate that double coverage creates additional utilisation of health care across the whole outcome distribution for both public and private second layers of health insurance coverage but with greater magnitude in the latter group. We unveil that this additional consumption effect is relatively smaller for more frequent users.

We applied a decision-analytic approach to assess the benefit of various strategies for functional MRI (fMRI) studies using intracranial aneurysms (IA) as a model. Methods: A decision tree and Markov model were created to simulate the impact on the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of four different strategies for review of scans for the presence of IA. To populate the decision model, we used current evidence from the literature and results from a survey of experts. Results: Review of the anatomical scans by a nonspecialist is not cost-effective in any of the subgroups of participants. Full clinical examination of women with a positive family history before enrollment in a study is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness of reviewing scans obtained from women without a family history and men with a positive family history of IA depends on the willingness-to-pay (lambda) for a QALY: at lambda of $50,000/QALY, review of scans by a specialist is cost-effective, whereas at lambda of $100,000/QALY, a full clinical workup is the best option. Compared with not reviewing any scans, a customized strategy for each subgroup of participants results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $12,503 for lambda = $50,000/QALY and $32,767 for lambda = $100,000/QALY. Conclusion: Tailored strategies based on the characteristics of research participants and lambda for one QALY are needed to address the problem of incidental findings in research fMRI studies.","[Sadatsafavi, Mohsen; Marra, Carlo] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Collaborat Outcome Res & Evaluat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Li, David] Univ British Columbia, Dept Radiol, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Li, David] Univ British Columbia, Div Neurol, Dept Med, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Marra, C (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Collaborat Outcome Res & Evaluat, 2146 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",carlo.marra@ubc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021; Sadatsafayi, Mohsen/AAZ-1593-2020; li, david/JXY-3562-2024; Kam, Grace/F-5364-2012","Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121; Sadatsafayi, Mohsen/0000-0002-0419-7862;",NIH/NIMH [9R01MH84282-04A1]; CIHR/INMHA CNE [85117]; Canada Research Chairs Program; Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute,NIH/NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); CIHR/INMHA CNE(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs); Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute,"This work is supported by NIH/NIMH #9R01MH84282-04A1 (JI), CIHR/INMHA CNE #85117 (JI), the Canada Research Chairs Program, and the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute.

The conceptual framework and empirical analysis focus on the likely effects of population density on the efficient production of EMS as a local public good subject to congestion, and on the need to control adequately for population density to avoid bias in testing for racial differences. Models that control for aggregate population density at the county-level indicate reverse disparities:faster estimated response times for African-Americans than for whites. When a refined county-level measure of population density is used that incorporates differences in African-American and white population density by Census tract, the reverse disparity in response times disappears. There also is little or no evidence of race-related differences in the certification level of EMS responders. However, there is evidence that, controlling for response time, African-Americans on average were significantly more likely to be deceased than whites upon EMS arrival at the scene. The overall results are germane to the debate over the scope of conditioning variables that should be included when testing for racial disparities in health care. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Cost and outcome data were taken from the Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment (SUIT) study, a 12-month, prospective, observational, naturalistic, multicenter, multicountry study. Costs were assessed in UK pound and outcomes in quality adjusted life years using responses to the EuroQol (EQ-5D); numbers of urine leaks were also estimated. Potential selection bias was countered using multivariate regression and propensity score analysis. Results: Duloxetine alone, duloxetine in combination with conservative treatment, and conservative treatment alone were associated with roughly two fewer leaks per week compared with no treatment. Duloxetine alone and with conservative treatment for SUI were associated with incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of about 0.03 over a year compared with no treatment or with conservative treatment alone. Conservative treatment alone did not show an effect on QALYs. None of the interventions appeared to have marked impacts on costs over a year. Depending on the form of matching, duloxetine either dominated or had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below 900 pound per QALY gained compared with no treatment and with conservative treatment alone. Duloxetine plus conservative therapy had an ICER below 5500 pound compared with no treatment or conservative treatment alone. Duloxetine compared with duloxetine plus conservative therapy showed similar outcomes but an additional cost for the combined intervention. Conclusions: Although the limitations of the use of SUIT's observational data for this purpose need to be acknowledged, the study suggests that initiating duloxetine therapy in SUI is a cost-effective treatment alternative.","[Mihaylova, Borislava] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Pitman, Richard; Sculpher, Mark] Oxford Outcomes Ltd, Oxford, England; [Tincello, Douglas] Univ Leicester, Reprod Sci Sect, Leicester Royal Infirm, Leicester, Leics, England; [van der Vaart, Huub] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Perinatol & Gynaecol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Tunn, Ralf] St Hedwig Hosp, German Pelv Floor Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Timlin, Louise; Quail, Deborah; Johns, Adam] Eli Lilly & Co Ltd, Lilly Res Ctr, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Oxford; University of Leicester; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Eli Lilly; University of York - UK,"Mihaylova, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",boby.mihaylova@dphpc.ox.ac.uk,,"Mihaylova, Borislava/0000-0002-0951-1304; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",Eli Lilly; Company Ltd,Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly); Company Ltd,"The authors are grateful to the patients and physicians who participated in the SUIT Study, and to Dr Christian Falconer, Source of financial support: This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company Ltd. and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.

It is shown that the asymptotic size of the two-stage test equals I for empirically relevant specifications of the parameter space.

The primary objective of this article is to report a study to test the assumption in a convenience sample of 30 respondents with use of the probability equivalence version of the standard gamble. The results indicate considerable risk aversion over life years, and therefore call into question the standard assumption of risk neutrality in practical cost-utility analyses (CUA). A secondary objective is to observe whether risk aversion can be reduced through the use of the lottery equivalents method, under the hypothesis that the gambling effect can be lessened with this instrument. In a separate convenience sample of 40 respondents, however, the observed level of risk aversion was at least that seen in the standard gamble. Further research is warranted to ascertain whether risk aversion over discounted life years is a generalisable concern.

Nevertheless, these benefits may come at the cost of reduced transparency, which may compromise the model's face validity and credibility.

Methods: Current evidence of associations between prognostic factors and disease progression in ocular hypertension and glaucoma was translated into DES model elements. The model was extended to simulate treatment decisions and effects. Utility and costs were linked to disease status and treatment, and clinical and health economic outcomes were defined. The model was validated at several levels. The soundness of design and the plausibility of input estimates were evaluated in interdisciplinary meetings (face validity). Individual patients were traced throughout the simulation under a multitude of model settings to debug the model, and the model was run with a variety of extreme scenarios to compare the outcomes with prior expectations (internal validity). Finally, several intermediate (clinical) outcomes of the model were compared with those observed in experimental or observational studies (external validity) and the feasibility of evaluating hypothetical treatment strategies was tested. Results: The model performed well in all validity tests. Analyses of hypothetical treatment strategies took about 30 minutes per cohort and lead to plausible health economic outcomes. Conclusion: There is added value of DES models in complex treatment strategies such as glaucoma. Achieving transparency in model structure and outcomes may require some effort in reporting and validating the model, but it is feasible.","[van Gestel, Aukje; Webers, Carroll A.

J,"del Portal, XR",,,,"Ruiz del Portal, X.",,,On the qualitative properties of the optimal income tax,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Optimal income tax; Intervals of singularity; Absolute continuity; Monotonicity constraint,EXISTENCE,"We explore the precise requirements for the qualitative results on optimum income taxation to hold, with the aim of extending their application to a larger space of solutions than that of continuous, piecewise differentiable functions assumed in the literature In particular, properties (R1)-(R8) in Ebert (1992) are shown to hold when the endogenous variables of the problem are defined by non-smooth or even discontinuous functions, provided consumption is supposed to be normal and leisure non-inferior. Moreover, the referred properties continue to hold, without assuming the normality of consumption, if it is supposed that the function descriptive of gross income becomes absolutely continuous. In addition, a characterization of the set of potential solutions stemming from Lebesgue's Decomposition Theorem has been used to analyze the relevance of properties (R1)-(R8), vis-a-vis other possible features of optimal tax schedules The conclusion is that, even assuming the normality of consumption, the case for regressivity should be viewed, on the lines suggested by Kaneko (1982) within a somehow different model, as an exceptional outcome versus other income tax structures that may arise at the optimum.

The test statistic is easily calculated without prior knowledge of the integration order of the data, the strength of the cointegrating relations, or the cointegration vector(s). The latter property makes it easier to implement than regression-based approaches, especially when examining relationships between several variables with possibly multiple cointegrating vectors. Since the test is nonparametric, it does not require the specification of a particular model and is invariant to short-run dynamics. Nor does it require the choice of any smoothing parameters that change the test statistic without being reflected in the asymptotic distribution. Furthermore, a consistent estimator of the cointegration space can be obtained from the procedure. The asymptotic distribution theory for the proposed test is non-standard but easily tabulated or simulated. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate excellent finite sample properties, even rivaling those of well-specified parametric tests. The proposed methodology is applied to the term structure of interest rates, where, contrary to both fractional- and integer-based parametric approaches, evidence in favor of the expectations hypothesis is found using the nonparametric approach.

The primary objective of this study was to elicit EQ-5D Polish values using the time trade-off (TTO) method. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with visitors of inpatients in eight medical centers in Warsaw, Skierniewice, and Pulawy were carried out by trained interviewers. Quota sampling was used to achieve a representative sample of the Polish population with regard to age and sex. Modified protocol from the Measurement and Value of Health study was used. Each respondent ranked 10 health states and valued 4 health states using the visual analog scale and 23 using the TTO. Mean and variance stability tests were performed to determine whether using a larger number of health states per respondent would yield credible results. Modeling included random effects and random parameters models. Results: Between February and May 2008, 321 interviews were performed. Modeling based on 6777 valuations resulted in an additive model with all coefficients statistically significant, R2 equal to 0.45, and value -0.523 for the worst possible health state. Means and variance did not differ significantly for states valued in the middle and at the end of the TTO exercise. Conclusions: This is the first EQ-5D value set based on TTO in Central and Eastern Europe so far. Because the values differ considerably from those elicited in Western European countries, its use should be recommended for studies in Poland. Increasing the number of health states that each respondent is asked to value using TTO seems feasible and justifiable.","[Golicki, Dominik; Jakubczyk, Michal; Wrona, Witold] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Pharmacoecon, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Jakubczyk, Michal] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland; Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Expt & Clin Pharmacol, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Busschbach, Jan J.

The method admits prospects involving infinite as well as finite dimensional unknown parameters, so that the variables are allowed to be residuals from nonparametric and semiparametric models. The proposed bootstrap tests have asymptotic sizes that are less than or equal to the nominal level uniformly over probabilities in the null hypothesis under regularity conditions. This paper also characterizes the set of probabilities so that the asymptotic size is exactly equal to the nominal level uniformly. As our simulation results show, these characteristics of our tests lead to an improved power property in general. The improvement stems from the design of the bootstrap test whose limiting behavior mimics the discontinuity of the original test's limiting distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These models can be applied directly to situations in which the choice set is constant across the market of interest or in which the choice set varies systematically across the market. In both of these applications, the models are used to determine the effects of different attribute levels on market shares among the available alternatives, given predetermined choice sets, or of varying the choice set in a straightforward way. Discrete choice models can also be used to identify the optimal'' configuration of a product or service in a given market. This can be computationally challenging when preferences vary with respect to the ordering of levels within an attribute as well the strengths of preferences across attributes. However, this type of optimization can be a relatively straightforward extension of the typical discrete choice model application. In this paper, we describe two applications that use discrete choice methods to provide a more robust metric for use in Total Unduplicated Reach and Frequency (TURF) applications: apparel and food products. Both applications involve products for which there is a high degree of heterogeneity in preferences among consumers. We further discuss a significant challenge in using TURF - that with multi-attributed products the method can become computationally intractable - and describe a heuristic approach to support food and apparel applications. We conclude with a summary of the challenges in these applications, which are yet to be addressed.","[Adler, Thomas J.] Resource Syst Grp Inc, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA; [Adler, Thomas J.] Dartmouth Coll, Grad Level Course Discrete Choice Modelling, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Adler, Thomas J.] Dartmouth Coll, Grad Level Course Operat Res, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Adler, Thomas J.] Dartmouth Coll, Grad Level Course Stat, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Adler, Thomas J.] Dartmouth Coll, Grad Level Course Transportat Modelling Methods, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Smith, Colin; Dumont, Jeffrey] Resource Syst Grp, White River Jct, VT USA",Resource Systems Group; Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College; Resource Systems Group,"Adler, TJ (通讯作者)，Resource Syst Grp Inc, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA.",,,,,,,,5,5,5,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,485,497,,,,,,13,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200023,0

The role of the state in such a model assumes that of a facilitator promoting localised partnerships and community participation. These developments have become central to policy implementation at a variety of levels, including the management of heritage sites. However, it is difficult to see how a governance model can succeed under current heritage management frameworks. This is particularly so where a site is an integral part of an active community, such as a historic town centre or an industrial landscape. Heritage management models have traditionally separated historic and contemporary identities. This weakens the link between people and place which is considered by many to be a fundamental contributor to a socially cohesive and sustainable community. This paper reviews some of the concepts surrounding sustainable development with a particular emphasis on social sustainability and governance.

However, there is evidence that the method may lead to incentive incompatible responses and be associated with starting point bias. While previous studies in health using BGs test for starting point bias, none have also investigated incentive incompatibility. Using a sample of respondents resident in Burkina Faso, West Africa, this paper examines whether the BG method is associated with both incentive incompatibility and starting point bias. We find evidence for both effects. However, average WTP values remained largely unaffected after accounting for both factors in multivariate analyses. The results suggest that the BG method is an acceptable technique in settings Where prices for goods are flexible.

In a stated choice experiment involving interdependent freight stakeholders in Sydney (see Hensher & Puckett, 2007; Puckett et al., 2007; Puckett & Hensher, 2008), one significant empirical constraint was difficult in recruiting unique decision-making groups to participate. The expected relatively small sample size led us to seek an alternative experimental design. That is, we decided to construct an optimal design that utilised extant information regarding the preferences and experiences of respondents, to achieve statistically significant parameter estimates under a relatively low sample size (see Bliemer & Rose, 2006). The D-efficient experimental design developed for the study is unique, in that it centred on the choices of interdependent respondents. Hence, the generation of the design had to account for the preferences of two distinct classes of decision makers: buyers and sellers of road freight transport. This paper discusses the process by which these (non-coincident) preferences were used to seed the generation of the experimental design, and then examines the relative power of the design through an extensive bootstrap analysis of increasingly restricted sample sizes for both decision-making classes in the sample. We demonstrate the strong potential for efficient designs to achieve empirical goals under sampling constraints, whilst identifying limitations to their power as sample size decreases.","[Puckett, Sean M.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Transport Management, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Puckett, Sean M.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Transport & Supply Chain Management, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Puckett, Sean M.] US Dept Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 USA; [Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Transport & Logist Management & Program, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rose, John M.] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Puckett, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Transport Management, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980",,,,,18,2,2,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84950-772-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,163,193,,,,,,31,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology, Mathematical; Transportation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Psychology; Transportation,BE0JU,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000366173200008,0

The interconnected impact relation between socioeconomic sustainable development and heritage conservation was increasing over the 1980s-1990s; but the significant impact started to take place by the end of 1990s-2009 as a result of mass urbanization-modernization process. The region of interest represents a series of socioeconomic highly interconnected-accumulative transition phases. In 2002, the mountain range was declared by the UNESCO as a world heritage site no. 954, concurrently with increasing interest of other international organizations (i.e. EU Commission, UNDP ... etc.). As a result of the shifting process between traditional rural household economies towards integrated cluster of centralized urban-rural nano-economies, the natural-cultural heritage of the mountain range is being subjected to a series of impacts due to massive involvement of local Bedouin community and multinational organizations in tourism-based mountainous economy, occupying a vital role among the flourishing tourism-belt of Sinai Peninsula.

The selected varieties were evaluated for the yield per hectare. Laboratory analysis determined quality parameters of wheat for bread-making, the measured parameters were as follows: volume weight of grain, sedimentation index according to Zeleny, grain protein content in dry matter and Hagberg falling number. On the site with high level of ground water, statistically significant differences were found in yields per variety. The average yield achieved 9.46 t.ha(-1) in the 2008 harvest year, and 9.44 t.ha(-1) in 2009.

Recoveries in range 96-100% were obtained, with LOQs 0.01-2.1 pg/inj and LODs 0.03-7.1 pg/inj, i.e. in the range of low mu m. The SPE enabled to avoid the evaporation step and preconcentrate the analytes directly. The applied method allowed a simultaneous determination of phenols in less than 5 minutes. Thus, the analysis of different plant species containing trace amounts of polar phenols became possible.

This method assumes a continuum of voters distributed according to a probability measure. Since infinite populations do not exist, the goal of distributional analysis is to give an insight into the behavior of large finite populations. However, the properties of finite populations do not necessarily converge to the properties of infinite populations. Thus the method of distributional analysis is flawed. In some cases (Arrow, 1969) it will predict that a point is in the core with probability 1, while the true probability converges to 0. In other cases it can be combined with probabilistic analysis to make accurate predictions about the asymptotic behavior of large populations, as in Caplin and Nalebuff (1988). Uniform convergence of empirical measures (Pollard, 1984) is employed here to yield a simpler, more general proof of a-majority convergence, a short proof of yolk shrinkage, and suggests a rule of thumb to determine the accuracy of distribution-based predictions. The results also help clarify the mathematical underpinnings of statistical analysis of empirical voting data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate the lifetime medical costs for patients with screen-detected versus undetected polyps and early-stage colorectal cancer. Typically, cost-effectiveness studies of screening account only for the direct costs of screening and cancer care. Our estimates include costs for unrelated conditions. We applied the Kaplan-Meier Smoothing Estimator to estimate lifetime costs for beneficiaries with screen-detected polyps and cancer. Phase-specific costs and survival probabilities were calculated from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database for Medicare beneficiaries aged >= 65. We estimate costs from the point of detection onward; therefore, our results do not include the costs associated with screening. We used a modified version of the model to estimate what lifetime costs for these patients would have been if the polyps or cancer remained undetected, based oil assumptions about the 'lead time' for polyps and early-stage cancer. For younger patients, polyp removal is cost saving. Treatment of early-stage cancer is cost increasing.

We compared utility-based preferences for alternative CRC screening tests from a stated-preference discrete-choice survey of the general population and physicians in Canada and the United States. Methods: General population respondents (Canada, n = 501; US, n = 1087) participated in a survey with 12 choice scenarios and 9 CRC screening test attributes. Physicians (n = 100, both Canada and US) reported expected patient preferences. We estimated relative importance of attributes using bivariate probit regression analysis and calculated willingness-to-pay for various CRC screening tests. Results: In 28 and 31% of scenarios, Canadian and US respondents,, respectively, chose no screening over a hypothetical test. Canadian (45%) and US (46%) physicians expected patients to choose no screening more often. For all groups the most important attribute was sensitivity, but physicians' perception of patients' preferences are significantly different from actual preferences. Other key attributes are those related to test performance or the testing process. Fecal DNA., colonoscopy, and virtual colonoscopy were the most preferred tests by all groups, but respondents were willing-to-pay more than physicians predicted. Conclusion: Physicians' perception of patients' preferences are quite different from those of the general population. However, among general population and physicians, Canadian and US preferences were similar.

Often, information from several data sets must be aggregated to derive an overall ranking. When using nonparametric procedures, Simpson-like paradoxes can occur in which the conclusion drawn from the aggregate ranked data set seems contradictory to the conclusions drawn from the individual data sets. Extending previous results found in the literature for the Kruskal-Wallis test, this paper presents a strict condition that ranked data must satisfy in order to avoid this type of inconsistency when using nonparametric pairwise procedures or Bhapkar's V procedure to extract an overall ranking. Aggregating ranked data poses further difficulties because there exist numerous ways to combine ranked data sets. This paper illustrates these difficulties and derives an upper bound for the number of possible ways that two ranked data sets can be combined. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Specific institutional factors are shown to be important to the uptake of these technologies. Health-care systems characterized as public contract systems and reimbursement systems have higher adoption rates than public-integrated health-care systems. Central control of funding of investments is negatively associated with adoption rates and the impact is of the same magnitude as the overall health-care system classification. GDP per capita also has a strong role in initial adoption. The impact of income and institutional characteristics on the utilization rates of the three procedures diminishes over time.

We study the identified features of these moment inequalities with respect to the regression parameters where we allow for covariate dependent censoring, endogenous censoring and endogenous regressors. These inequalities restrict the parameters to a set. We show regular point identification can be achieved under a set of interpretable sufficient conditions. We then provide a simple way to convert conditional moment inequalities into unconditional ones while preserving the informational content. Our method obviates the need for nonparametric estimation, which would require the selection of smoothing parameters and trimming procedures. Without the point identification conditions, our objective function can be used to do inference on the partially identified parameter. Maintaining the point identification conditions, we propose a quantile minimum distance estimator which converges at the parametric rate to the parameter vector of interest, and has an asymptotically normal distribution. A small scale simulation study and an application using drug relapse data demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A total of 395 consecutive patients with a need for a primary THR because of osteoarthritis and who were placed on the waiting list between August 2002 and November 2003. After placement on the waiting list, the patients were randomly assigned to a short WT (< 3 months) group (n = 174) or a nonfixed WT group (n = 221). The patients completed self-administered questionnaires at the time of placing on the waiting list and at hospital admission. Health-related quality of life was measured by the generic 15D instrument. Hip pain and function were measured by the patient self-report Harris hip score (HHS). Results: Of the 395 patients, 312 (79%) completed the follow-up (140 patients with short and 172 with nonfixed WT). At admission, the mean 15D scores for patients with short and nonfixed WT were 0.784 and 0.783, respectively. In the intention-to-treatment analysis, the difference between the groups (Delta 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.019 to 0.021) was not statistically significant or clinically important. The mean self-report HHS in patients with short WT was 43.5, and among those with nonfixed WT was 41.9. The difference (Delta 1.6, 95% CI: -1.77 to 4.87) was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Both generic and disease-specific measures revealed that longer WTs did not result in poorer health status at admission.","[Hirvonen, Johanna; Tuominen, Ulla] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Helsinki, Finland; [Tuominen, Ulla; Sintonen, Harri; Blom, Marja] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Seitsalo, Seppo; Paavolainen, Pekka] ORTON Orthoped Hosp, Helsinki, Finland; [Lehto, Matti] Med Res Fund Tampere Univ Hosp, Coxa Hosp Joint Replacement, Tampere, Finland; [Paavolainen, Pekka] HUCH, Surg Hosp, Helsinki, Finland; [Hietaniemi, Kalevi] HUCH, Jorvi Hosp, Espoo, Finland; [Rissanen, Pekka] Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare; University of Helsinki; Tampere University; Tampere University Hospital; Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement,"Hirvonen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",johanna.hirvonen@thl.fi,,,"Academy of Finland, HUCH, Jorvi Hospital; Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Medical Research Fund of Tampere University Hospital; HUCH, Surgical Hospital; ORTON Orthopaedic Hospital","Academy of Finland, HUCH, Jorvi Hospital(Research Council of Finland); Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Medical Research Fund of Tampere University Hospital; HUCH, Surgical Hospital; ORTON Orthopaedic Hospital","Academy of Finland, HUCH, Jorvi Hospital; Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Medical Research Fund of Tampere University Hospital; HUCH, Surgical Hospital, and ORTON Orthopaedic Hospital.",,25,17,18,0,11,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2009,12.0,6,,,,,942,947,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00544.x,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,474SP,19402851.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268304600012,0

Unlike most existing tests, our tests are asymptotically valid Under weak and/or partial identification and can accommodate discontinuities in the conditional moment functions. Our tests are moreover consistent provided that identification is not too weak. We do not require the availability of a consistent first step estimator. Like Robinson [Robinson, Peter M., 1987. Asymptotically efficient estimation in the presence of heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Econometrica 55, 875-891] and many others in similar problems subsequently, We use k-nearest neighbor (knn) weights instead of kernel weights. The advantage of using knn weights is that local power is invariant to transformations of the instruments and that under strong point identification Computation of the test statistic yields an efficient estimator of theta(0) as a byproduct.

This inactivity imposes costs on the collectively funded health insurance programs. In this paper, excess utilization of healthcare services due to physical inactivity is examined using count data models and the Canadian Community Health Survey. The aim of the paper is to estimate utilization of healthcare services associated with inactivity and to estimate its impact on the Canadian healthcare system. The results suggest that physical inactivity increases hospital stays, and use of physician and nurse services. On average, an inactive person spends 38% more days in hospital than an active person. S/he also uses 5.5% more family physician visits, 13% more specialist services, and 12% more nurse visits than an active individual. The subsequent social cost of inactivity for the healthcare system is substantial.

The first part examines the regional health expenditure inequality in China by testing two hypotheses on health expenditure convergence. Cross-section regressions and cluster analysis are used to study the health expenditure convergence and to identify convergence Clusters. We find no single nationwide convergence, only convergence by Cluster. In the second part of the paper, we investigate the long-run relationship between health expenditure inequality, income inequality, and provincial government budget deficits (1313) by using new panel cointegration tests with health expenditure data in China's urban and rural areas. We find that the income inequality and real provincial government BID are useful in explaining the disparity in health expenditure prevailing between urban and rural areas. In order to reduce health-spending inequality, one long-run policy suggestion from our findings is for the government to implement more rapid economic development and stronger financing schemes in poorer rural areas.

EVIDENCE FROM URBAN CHINA,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,community health services; cost-effectiveness; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; urban China,,"China has introduced a system of community health centers (CHCs) to provide primary care. To test whether services provided by such centers are more cost-effective than treatment at local higher-level hospitals, the study compared health outcomes and expenditures for patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus in three cities. We hypothesized that treating patients in stable condition at CHCs is less costly than providing treatment in higher-level hospitals with no differences in health outcomes. Results indicate that daily drug and other medical expenditures were consistently equal or lower for patients seeking treatment in CHCs than for those treated ill hospitals. Patients also saved time by visiting CHCs. Health outcomes, measured as mean arterial pressure for hypertension and plasma glucose for diabetes, Were similar for patients seeking treatment in CHCs and hospitals in most cases. Results suggest that CHCs are more cost-effective than hospitals in treating chronic diseases.

Econometric problems due to individuals choosing their own level of sports activities are tackled by combining informative data and flexible semiparametric estimation methods with a specific way to use the panel dimension of the data. The paper shows that sports activities have sizeable positive long-term labour market effects in terms of earnings and wages, as well as positive effects on health and Subjective well-being.

They offer a systematic way to capture the connectedness and opinion formations in the complex web of interpersonal influences. This paper studies price stability of a capital market, where the dynamics of participants' opinion formations is formalized using social network models. Stability condition is derived. It is also identified how network structures are important in communications and in determining market stability. it is found that factors or highly-connected networks and balanced weight allocation on information sources can in fact be stabilizing. In applications, this study supports the view that the key to reduce the volatility behaviour of emerging-market securities lies in the development of an efficient investor base. It is suggested that one way to achieve this is by broadening and diversifying both the international and domestic investor categories for the underlying market. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to determine the UK antihypertensive drug budget impact as the first ARB market launched in December 1994 and what proportion of the increase was directly attributable to ARBs. Prescriptions for oral antihypertensives were identified from The Health Improvement Network database. Drug prices were based on the Chemist & Druggist January 2005 pricelist estimating real expenditure growth. Expenditure increases were disaggregated into the number of patients receiving antihypertensive drug prescriptions, the number of antihypertensive prescriptions per patient treated, and the average drug expenditure per antihypertensive prescription. The annual ARB prescription frequency increased from 0.04% in 1995 to 6.57% in 2004. Expenditure for antihypertensive drugs was estimated at 465,862,416 pound in 1995 and 1,458,268,104 pound in 2004 (2005 values), reflecting a 213% real rate of increase. Use of ARBs accounted for only 9.3% (range: 5.8%-12.5%) of the average drug expenditure. Treatment prevalence rose from 11.30% in 1995 to 16.90% in 2004, while the average number of antihypertensive drug prescriptions per patient increased from 9.34 to 13.46 per year. The average expenditure per antihypertensive drug prescription increased over time reflecting a product shift toward more expensive therapies. ARBs accounted for only 9.3% of the 213% increase in antihypertensive drug expenditure after their introduction. A substantial portion of the impact reflected increases in treatment prevalence and in the number of prescriptions per patient.","[Blak, Betina T.] EPIC, London NW1 0QG, England; [Mullins, C.

Some modifications have been suggested, but these are only partial remedies.

The paper also shows how the corrected Concentration Index can be decomposed and generalized. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cost-effective preventive measures are available for women who test positive. The objective of this study was to determine at what risk of mutation it is cost-effective to test women for BRCA1/2 mutations. A semi-Markov model accrued costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) annually from the societal perspective. The estimates of health-care costs, life expectancy, likelihood of obtaining a mastectomy or oophorectomy, and patient preferences for treatment and certainty about their BRCA1/2 status were based on the literature. At a 10% probability of mutation (the current guideline), the test strategy generated 22.9 QALYs over the lifetime and cost $118k, while the no-test strategy generated 22.7 QALYs and cost $117k. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the test strategy was $9k and the differences between costs and effects were not substantial. The test strategy remained cost-effective to a probability of mutation of 0%, as long as utility gained from a negative test result was 0.006 or greater. These results were sensitive to the frequency of inconclusive test results and utility gain from a negative test result. The costs and effectiveness of both the test and no-test strategies are very similar even when there is a small probability of mutation.

Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) set in UK community settings. Participants: 367 patients (mean age 57.5) living in the community with a wide range of self-defined long-term conditions. Main outcome measures: the relative value that individuals place on four specific outcomes, namely, self-efficacy, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), access to General Practitioners, and level of isolation. Most responders completed their questionnaire in a consistent manner. Most valuations of outcomes were in the expected direction and were statistically significant. A substantial minority of responders exhibited counter-intuitive preferences. The existence of a significant constant in all models raised concerns about model misspecification. Nevertheless, all models showed that participants were willing to trade substantial reductions in their HRQoL for improvements in their self-efficacy. The majority of patients with chronic conditions were able to complete the DCE questionnaires. However, the existence of counter-intuitive preferences and evidence of model misspecification require further investigation. These issues are largely overlooked in the health economics literature. Self-efficacy is an important outcome for this group and is not included explicitly in conventional HRQoL measures. This is potentially important where decisions are made on the basis of cost-effectiveness using Quality Adjusted Life Years as the metric. Exclusion of these outcomes may lead to the cost-effectiveness of these interventions being understated.","[Richardson, Gerry] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Bojke, Chris] PharMerit, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Kennedy, Anne; Reeves, David; Bower, Peter; Lee, Victoria; Middleton, Elizabeth; Gardner, Caroline; Gately, Claire; Rogers, Anne] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of York - UK; University of Manchester,"Richardson, G (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",gar2@york.ac.uk,"Bower, Peter/A-1508-2011; Reeves, David/H-6203-2014","Bower, Peter/0000-0001-9558-3349; Gardner, Caroline/0000-0003-0487-3979; Reeves, David/0000-0001-6377-6859; Lee, Victoria/0000-0001-9578-3260",UK Department of Health,UK Department of Health(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),Gerry Richardson is funded by a Researcher Development award from the UK Department of Health.,,56,13,14,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2009,12.0,2,,,,,331,339,,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00419.x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,408WY,18647255.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000263467500020,0

The test is valid when the cross-sectional dimension of the panel is large relative to the time series dimension. Importantly, our approach allows one to examine whether any error cross section dependence remains after including time dummies (or after transforming the data in terms of deviations from time-specific averages), which will be the case under heterogeneous error cross section dependence. Finite sample simulation-based results suggest that our tests perform well, particularly the version based on the [Blundell, R., Bond, S., 1998. Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models. journal of Econometrics 87, 115-143] system GMM estimator. In addition, it is shown that the system GMM estimator. based only on partial instruments consisting of the regressors, can be a reliable alternative to the standard GMM estimators under heterogeneous error cross section dependence. The proposed tests are applied to employment equations using UK firm data and the results show little evidence of heterogeneous error cross section dependence. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As climate passes a tipping points conditions can flip to a new, perhaps unpredictable, semi-stable state. Paleoclimate records indicate that past climate change has regularly featured non-linear responses due to positive feedback mechanisms that lead to a tipping point from which a new path is initiated. While such change has served to bound past climate change, our enrichment of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, unparalleled in our present continental configuration, is leading us into novel territory.

The SAW sensor signal is considered to be narrowband in the presence of Gaussian noise induced by the receiver that makes the signal envelope Rician. The error probability for the coded SAW sensor is determined via the probability of the sum of errors caused by each of the reflectors on the sensor substrate. The error probability is minimized for the 0 signal envelopes having zero signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with the Rayleigh distributions and 1 signal envelopes with some given SNRs and the Rice distributions. It is shown that, for the derived probabilistic nonlinear integral equation, the optimal threshold cannot be found in simple functions and the computational analysis is required.

This intervention was shown to be cost-effective in the United States. This paper presents the Canadian adaptation. A discrete event simulation of the long-term cardiovascular implications of 1 year of phosphate binding in a prevalent hemodialysis population was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sevelamer use in Canada based on the demographics, comorbidities, physiological and renal characteristics. Initial calcification score and expected changes over 1 year were derived using regression equations developed from a clinical trial and translated to cardiovascular disease risk based on equations developed from a long-term cohort study. Direct medical costs from a Canadian Medicare perspective were taken from Ontario data. Ten replications of 10,000 patients over 13 years (discounting at 3%) were done for the base case and extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. The cardioprotective effect of sevelamer over 1 year is estimated to prevent 10 cardiovascular events and gain 18 life-years compared with calcium carbonate in 100 patients over a lifetime. These benefits are obtained at a net cost of CAD$2,096; an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CAD$12,384 per discounted life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the time horizon and efficacy were the most important factors.

Thus it is necessary to start growing new cultures, such as Camelina sativa, as an undersowing in the areas of corn and leguminous plants, as well as to use waste fat and oil. The biocatalyst transesterification is the most suitable for fatty waste of poor quality containing a lot of free fatty acids, when the immobilized lipases are used. The multistage transesterification was investigated using lipases at various ratios of triglycerides and methanol. It was determined that the process lasts for more than 20 hours although the transesterification degree of 96.5% specified in the standard is not reached. Contrary to the popular opinion, the immobilized lipases are inactivated by glycerol; therefore the researches were done, how to eliminate glycerol with the help of adsorbents. The adsorption capacity of 5 adsorbents (TRISYL, ENGELHARD F-105 SF, TONSIL-OPTIMUM 214 FF, silica gel of LIFOSA Ltd., JELTAR-100) was analyzed. It was determined that glycerol is best adsorbed by TRISYL in the following conditions: amount of adsorbent -45% of biodiesel fuel's weight, temperature -40 degrees C, time - 120 min. There was created the technology that allows supplying continuously methanol to the reaction mixture and eliminating glycerol with the-help of adsorbents. It was determined that the 89.4% transesterification degree may be achieved when 10-12% immobilized lipases in Lipozyme TL IM are used for 7 hours, although the transesterification degree increases only by 7% in the last 3 hours.","[Janulis, Prutenis Petras; Kazanceva, Irina; Gumbyte, Milda] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Inst Environm, Lab Chem & Biochem Res Environm Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,agrotech@lzuu.lt; irina.sartakova@lzuu.lt; milda.gumbyte@lzuu.lt,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,2,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,315,320,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Engineering, Environmental; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Engineering; Public Administration,BNL17,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000274845700056,0
