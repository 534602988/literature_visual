However, less attention has up to now been paid to the labour market and earnings situation among the grandchildren of immigrants, i.e. third-generation immigrants. Against this background, this paper studies intergenerational earnings mobility and the earnings position of three generations of immigrants in Sweden. The results indicate a regression towards the native earnings mean in immigrant earnings across the first two generations in the sense that immigrants earn more than natives in the first generation while there are small ethnic earnings in the second generation. Furthermore, immigrants earn less than natives in the third generation. Thus, the results suggest a downward trend in immigrants' relative earnings across generations. One conclusion of the study is that ethnic differences in earnings may occur beyond the second generation of immigrants and that the problem with integration of immigrants therefore may last for several generations.","Vaxjo Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden",Vaxjo University; Linnaeus University,"Hammarstedt, M (通讯作者)，Vaxjo Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",mats.hammarstedt@vxu.se,,,,,,,29,29,29,0,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,,2009,62.0,2,,,,,275,292,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00436.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,433FA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000265188500009,0

When a large number of agents play a game with strategic complementarity, information choices exhibit complementarity as well: if an agent wants to do what others do, they want to know what others know. This makes heterogeneous beliefs difficult to sustain and may generate multiple equilibria. In models with substitutability, agents prefer to differentiate their information choices. We use these theoretical results to examine the role of information choice in recent price-setting models and to propose modelling techniques that ensure equilibrium uniqueness.","[Hellwig, Christian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Veldkamp, Laura] New York Univ, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; New York University,"Hellwig, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA.",,"Hellwig, Christian/AAH-5572-2021",,,,,,41,140,171,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

However, once spurious correlation of firm location and the indirect effects through wages and multinational activity are accounted for, the total effects of telecommunications and schools on growth are found to be higher than direct estimates would suggest.

The framework assumes that the measure provides partners with a treatment (information, research support, etc.) that will not be transferred to non-partners. In this framework, a voluntary measure is said to be worthwhile if differences are significant between the behavior of partners and non-partners, correcting for the potential endogeneity of becoming a partner. However, voluntary measures take many different forms, some which are expected to have transfers to non-partners (spillovers). The Coal Combustion Products Partnership (C2P2) is a U.S. voluntary program with a structure that is likely to provide treatment spillovers to non-partners. This paper evaluates C2P2 and tests whether treatment spillovers are affecting non-partners' behavior. Results are consistent with a program that would traditionally be considered unsuccessful, but the consideration of treatment spillovers makes it consistent with a successful program.","Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Lange, I (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",i.a.lange@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Focusing on the Yeltsin-Putin regime shift in Russia, we find that the valuations of oligarch-controlled firms are significantly higher under the Putin regime than under the Yeltsin regime after controlling for industry and time effects. The findings suggest that the increasing cost of extracting private benefits outweighs the reduction in the value of political connections following the political regime change. The results are also consistent with changes in the risk of state expropriation. Our results indicate that effects driven by the political regime change complement the traditional view that increased ownership concentration improved the performance of Russian oligarch firms.","[Maury, Benjamin; Liljeblom, Eva] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Stat, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Hanken School of Economics,"Maury, B (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Stat, POB 479, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",benjamin.maury@hanken.fi,"Liljeblom, Eva/M-8099-2015","Liljeblom, Eva/0000-0003-4924-6426",,,,,43,6,6,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The article finds support for the sex-specialized theory of marital formation, with men valued more and women valued less for their economic contributions to the family. Socioeconomic status and ethnicity play an important role in marital formation with sex specialization less likely to occur among Africans than the more advantaged ethnic groups. One of the consistent findings is that family structure matters crucially in predicting both legal and common law marriages. For example, living in a large, multigenerational household tends to impact the likelihood of marriage, as compared to remaining single, in opposite ways for men and women, with men in large households more likely to be married but women less likely to be married.","Missouri State Univ, Dept Econ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA",Missouri State University,"Olsen, RN (通讯作者)，Missouri State Univ, Dept Econ, Springfield, MO 65897 USA.",ReedOlsen@missouristate.edu,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

New social risks emerge due to the transformation of labor markets and of family structures during the last tow decades or so. Among these risks are those of reconciling work and family, or of low education in a knowledge-based post- industrial economy. The literature on new social risks (NSRs) has, so far, been concerned with Western European countries. A number of authors have identified the principal factors for the emergence of NSRs as, the de-industrialization and tertiarization of employment, women's entry in the labour market, increasing instability of the family structure, and processes linked to the privatization of the welfare state. The politics of new social policies are different from those of old social policies. The most favourable conditions for growth of new social policies are given in nations with a large public sector. the political economy of skill formation that has characterized the postcommunist transition (the Post-communist skill production regime) has been characterized by an ambiguous mix of high social insurance, modest public investments in education, and increasing reliance of private investments in industry specific and occupation specific skills associated, however, to high distributive aspirations but growing levels of social inequality. A key risk factor in the post-industrial knowledge-based economies is low educating.","[Sorlescu, Mariana] Romanian Amer Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",,,madisorlescu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,323,329,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800048,0

A method of approximating conditional moments as the solution to a system of ordinary differential equations is applied to the pricing of bonds. Numerical experiments based on two illustrative models show that the second-order approximation is accurate for maturities of up to five years and the third-order approximation is effective for longer maturities. We also show the possibility of improving the second-order approximation without much increasing the computational burden. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We revisit this FDI-Growth relation by analyzing the components of FDI - greenfield investment and cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Our analysis contributes to the existing literature by focusing on potentially heterogeneous growth effects of different FDI entry modes. Using a sample of 84 countries from 1987 to 2001, we separately examine the growth effects of greenfield investment and M&As. We find that greenfield investment and M&As have different impacts on economic growth. Greenfield investment promotes economic growth while M&As can be beneficial only when the host country has an adequate level of human capital. Our results provide support for receiving M&As when policymakers allocate more resources for human capital accumulation.","[Wang, Miao] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Wong, M. C.

Using panel data regression techniques, the firms' leverage ratios move towards their optimal level, holding up the TO model. The results, however, show better support for the PO model, as leverage and profitability are negatively related, while financing deficit mostly explains the annual change in total liabilities. Furthermore, in joint tests, only the fitted values from the PO model equation continue to have additional explanatory power over fitted values from the TO model. Firms issued more equity than debt from 1990 to 1996 when stock market prices were increasing rapidly, but this still fits the more complex version of the PO model.","[Yu, Darwin D.] Ateneo Manila Univ, John Gokongwei Sch Management, Quezon City, Philippines; [Aquino, Rodolfo Q.] Univ Philippines, Coll Business Adm, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",Ateneo de Manila University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Yu, DD (通讯作者)，Ateneo Manila Univ, John Gokongwei Sch Management, Quezon City, Philippines.",dyu@ateneo.edu,"Eclevia, Marian/I-6486-2013",,,,,,36,11,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Research shows the spreading of this phenomenon in different sectors and economy activities. The growth of heterogeneity and variety as well as the variety itself, which we traditionally call a minority representative, increase the danger of conflicts between groups (cultural, racial, and national). The danger is hidden in negative attitude that can appear because of the society dominating traditions, stereotype thinking, and lack of tolerance to those who are different. Growing variety, the lack of tolerance, the aggressiveness of the society form is the mixture that explodes discrimination in the relations among employees. Discrimination in the relations among employees consists of the processes that take place inside the organization. The main signs of discrimination in the relations of the employees are: group isolation from the community because of differences, negative acceptance of the isolated persons, social isolation, and oppression. The creation of a variety or minority group is connected both with outer and psychological differences. The meaning of discrimination as a dysfunction of the employees' relations is marked by violence in order to get rid of the victim. At the same time taking to consideration the results of a long-lasting violence to the person, it should be understood as a physical violence the aim of which is to evoke pain, damage the individual. It is important that dysfunctional relations are identified taking to consideration objective and subjective criteria, because interpersonal relations among employees is a variety of communication ways and forms, which create an unfriendly, oppressive atmosphere. Negative aspect of the relations can appear even as a purposeful relation negation, in other words social isolation and the isolation of the oppressed one. That is why it is wise to listen to the evaluation of the oppressed one about the relations he has. In the article the researches of mobbing in Western countries and Lithuania are discussed Mobbing is analyzed from the aspect of discriminative relations among the employees, the features, which show the transformation of chicanery to mobbing is singled out. An instrumentation to diagnose mobbing as discriminative employee relations was created, the reliability of which was proved by the expert evaluation and high weights of Cronbach alpha With the help of questionnaire during the exploratory research there were questioned 351 respondents from public and private sector organizations. It was diagnosed that most frequently the actions of mobbing were experienced by the respondents who work in public sector - in the spheres of education and social work and in some business organizations.","[Zukauskas, Pranas; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Zukauskas, P (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",p.zukauskas@evf.vdu.lt; jolitaw@gmail.com,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402",,,,,47,6,7,0,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Their focus is on how to empirically identify a range in which a firm size variable follows a power-law distribution. On the one hand, as is well known a firm size variable follows a power-law distribution only beyond some threshold. On the other hand, in almost all empirical exercises, the right end part of a distribution deviates from a power-law due to finite size effects. The authors modify the method proposed by Malevergne et al. (2011). In this way they can identify both the lower and the upper thresholds and then estimate the power-law exponent using observations only in the range defined by the two thresholds. They apply this new method to various firm size variables, including annual sales, the number of workers, and tangible fixed assets for firms in more than thirty countries.","[Fujimoto, Shouji] Kanazawa Gakuin Univ, Dept Informat & Business, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Mizuno, Takayuki] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Watanabe, Tsutomu] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tokyo,"Fujimoto, S (通讯作者)，Kanazawa Gakuin Univ, Dept Informat & Business, 10 Sue Machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.",fujimoto@kanazawa-gu.ac.jp,,"Fujimoto, Shouji/0000-0001-7195-634X",,,,,20,9,9,0,11,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 7,2011,5.0,,,,,,,,201120,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-20,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865CF,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298287700001,0

Changes in the division of labour occur at three different levels: the level of the individual worker, the level of the industry and the spatial level. At each level the organisation of work is determined by an equilibrium of forces that glue tasks together or unbundle them. Communication costs are the main force for clustering or gluing together tasks; comparative advantage stimulates unbundling and specialisation. The estimates suggest that on average the Netherlands has witnessed unbundling in the period 1996-2005, which implies that advantages of specialisation have increased. These developments explain to a considerable extent changes in the structure of employment. Especially at the spatial level it explains a substantial part of the increase in offshoring tasks abroad.","[ter Weel, Bas] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Akcomak, I.

We explore a large firm level data set across several developing countries and assume that the rigidity of labor regulations affects more the investment decision of firms that faces a rigid enforcement of labor regulations. Our findings show that differences across countries in the enforcement of more rigid employment protection regulation are associated with very small differences in the investment in job training across firms.

J,"Antonelli, G",,,,"Antonelli, Gilberto",,,Global Economic Crisis and Systemic Failure,ECONOMIA POLITICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"About four years after the outburst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression the economics profession has not been yet able to work out some of its main features and the relevant exit strategies are still open-ended. Above all, it is amazing how little we learned from the long inventory of banking currency and sovereign crises experienced in the recent past. In contrast, when we consider how the political agenda is urging for stress tests for EU treaties in an effort to face the economic, geo-political and energetic crises experienced in the last four years, the need of a thorough reappraisal of the basic economic notions and tools is evident. For this reason the present crisis can be a valuable research laboratory, at least as important as the one that in the '30s brought John Maynard Keynes to revise his theoretical framework. Starting from a perspective of study which is mainly aiming at understanding the joint evolution of economic systems and institutions, in this paper I will focus my attention on three main research questions and, at least in a preliminary way, I will try to answer them The first research question is: after about four years from the materialization of the worst global economic crisis since the '30s, what do we know about its nature, determinants and exit guidelines? The second research question move off from the recurrent use of emblematic new concepts in the present economic debate. I will first investigate to what extent the notion of systemic failure can be relevant. Afterwards I will examine the notion of social goods. In order to better understand and manage the global crisis do we need a theory of systemic failure and social goods? The third research question deals with solutions. Legal global standards have been discussed even if in an erratic way in the international negotiations framework. To the extent that they represent a realistic device, can we find in them at least partial solutions to one of the most worrying features of the crisis: the governance deficit? My conjecture is that the actual victim of the present crisis is the approach to the new global economy governance underway after the Berlin Wall fall in 1989, which paved the way to the transition process in East and Central Europe, German reunification and dramatic changes in global interdependencies still in evolution. This approach has strongly influenced also the last stage of the EU enlargement, leaving unsettled or even unexplored some of the key institutional features of the subsequent stage of integration. The conclusions will stress how broad production factors accumulation turns out to be decisive and minimum threshold effects become more and more substantial. This is why theoretical models and economic evaluation tools have to be updated in order to take into consideration these evidence.",,,,,,,,,,,68,6,6,0,14,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In doing so, a stochastic frontier latent class model, which allows the existence of different technologies, is adopted to estimate production frontiers. This procedure not only enables the identification of different groups of Japanese airports but also permits the analysis of their production efficiency. The main result is that there are two groups of Japanese airports, both following completely different technologies to obtain passengers and cargo, suggesting that business strategies need to be adapted to the characteristics of the airports.

Such an approach based on an implicit re-ranking of individual incomes ignores income mobility by assuming that only post-growth income matters in social welfare. By contrast, this paper takes the view that status quo matters and that social welfare should logically be defined on both inital and terminal income. This leads to consider 'non-anonymous' Growth Incidence Curves that plot income growth rates against the various quantiles of the initial distribution. Dominance criteria that generalize those available for standard growth incidence curves are derived, which account for the inequality of individual income changes, conditional on initial income. An application to the cross-country distributional feature of global growth illustrates the analysis.","Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Bourguignon, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",francois.bourguignon@parisschoolofeconomics.eu,,,,,,,25,51,54,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

For the most part, backward-looking models are highly fault tolerant with respect to policies optimized for forward-looking representations, while forward-looking models have low fault tolerance with respect to policies optimized for backward-looking representations. In addition, backward-looking models often have lower posterior probabilities than forward-looking models.

However, reforms often imply accepting sacrifices in the short-run and bring about the risk of potential political opposition. Within this framework, the debate on whether to implement green tax reforms in one-step or gradually becomes of great interest. In this paper, we use a dynamic general equilibrium model, calibrated to the Spanish economy, to evaluate different reforms that consist in increasing energy taxes and adjusting capital taxation in a revenue-neutral framework. Our findings show that, although an environmental dividend is always granted, the existence of an efficiency dividend depends on the type of reform, its size and how gradually it is implemented. Thus, one-step reforms that produce an efficiency dividend would imply large efficiency costs in the short-run. In this case, the reform could only produce efficiency gains in the short-run if it is implemented gradually, although such gains would end up disappearing in the long-run. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These policies have a non-negligible cost, and therefore a careful assessment of their impacts seems necessary. In particular, one of the most-debated impacts is their effect on electricity prices, for which there have been some ex-ante studies, but few ex-post studies. This article presents a full ex-post empirical analysis, by looking at use of technologies and hourly electricity prices for 2005-2009 in Spain, to study the effects that the introduction of renewable electricity and cogeneration has had on wholesale electricity prices. It is particularly interesting to perform this study in Spain where an active system of public support to renewables and cogeneration has led to a considerable expansion of these energy sources and electricity pricing is at the center of intense debate. The paper reports that a marginal increase of 1 GWh of electricity production using renewables and cogeneration is associated with a reduction of almost 2(sic) per MWh in electricity prices (around 4% of the average price for the analyzed period).

A limit is imposed on how much the economy can borrow from foreign creditors and it is made endogenous by assuming that the debt-to-GDP ratio is procyclical. The steady state is locally indeterminate when the credit multiplier is larger than some threshold level, whereas saddle-point stability prevails when the credit multiplier is low enough. As a consequence, high levels of the credit multiplier lead to both booms followed by busts and sunspot-driven volatility near the steady state, while, in contrast, low levels ensure monotonic convergence. Compared with saddle-path equilibria, boom-bust and sunspot equilibria are associated with both lower welfare and debt overhang, that is, a crowding-out effect of credit: when the economy is highly leveraged, it uses savings to cut down foreign debt, at the expense of both human and physical investment. Numerical examples show that indeterminacy arises for debt-to-GDP ratios that fall within the range of available estimates. Finally, the effects of shocks to the world interest rate on output and consumption are amplified and persistent in the debt overhang regime.","[Pintus, Patrick A.] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Pintus, Patrick A.] Inst Univ France, GREQAM IDEP, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut Universitaire de France,"Pintus, PA (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.",pintus@univmed.fr,,,,,,,7,4,4,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1742-7355,,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

The empirical analysis suggests that the credit stagnation is mainly driven by the restricted credit supply amid tighter monetary policy conditions in Jordan relative to the United States, as evidenced by the widened interest differential between the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) re-discount and the U.S. Federal Reserve funds rates. Although it appears that demand side factors related to the slowdown of economic activity have also had an impact, their role has been relatively modest. The estimation results imply that economic policies targeted towards stimulating the supply of credit are likely to be a more effective tool for expanding credit flows relative to demand stimulating policies.

A static version of Ghironi and Melitz's (2005) industry model is used to show that firms with lower productivity endogenously choose to operate in the informal sector. I use cross-country data on taxes, measures of informality, and measures of regulation (entry and compliance costs, red tape, etc.) to back out how high the enforcement levels must be country by country to make the theory match the data. The welfare gains from policy reforms are on average 1.2% (measured in terms of consumption) for OECD countries. I also find that the welfare gains from reducing regulation are on average 2.1%. Finally, performing a similar decomposition to that of Hall and Jones (1999), I find that distortions associated with informality account for a factor of 1.5 of the output per capita difference between the richest and the poorest countries.

In this paper we develop a political-agency model in which voters are hindsight-biased and politicians differ in ability, defined as information concerning the optimal policy. When public information is not too accurate, low-ability politicians sometimes gamble on suboptimal policies: in an attempt to mimic the high-ability type, who has superior private information, they go against public information and choose a policy whose expected payoff to society is negative. We model hindsight bias as a memory imperfection that prevents voters from accessing their ex ante information about the state of the world. We show that the bias can act as a discipline device that reduces policy gambles and can therefore be welfare enhancing. Although it is well known that restrictions on information acquisition can be beneficial for a principal, our contribution is to show that a psychological bias can have such an effect.

In this paper we argue that this hybrid governance structure causes an over-conversion of farmland from the rural to the urban sector, as compared to a competitive market situation, and a welfare reallocation that discriminates against farmland owners. We develop a partial equilibrium model that can be used to examine the impact of the current hybrid governance structure on the over-conversion of farmland and to analyze the welfare changes for different groups of actors and the resulting net social welfare loss. Using a dataset with detailed information on farmland acquisitions and urban land transactions in Yingtan City in Jiangxi Province, we illustrate how this framework can be applied. Our results indicate an over-conversion of 33.5% of the total converted farmland in this city between 1999 and 2003. The welfare of farmland owners affected by the conversion decreased by 1.38 billion RMB, while the net social welfare loss equaled more than 270 million RMB during the same period. The local government obtained 380 million RMB of revenues by reselling farmland as urban land through competitive conveyance mechanisms between 2002 and 2005, while the manufacturing sector gained an estimated 280 million RMB from buying land use rights at relatively low prices. We conclude that the current policy of increasing urban land conveyance through competitive mechanisms does not address two major underlying causes of over-conversion, and that protection of farmland would be better served by replacing the current hybrid rural to urban land market structure by a competitive land market.

Using the case of health care in the UK, this article analyses the effects of choice and competition policies by using subjective well-being (SWB) as an indicator of welfare and equity. Existing literature on welfare effects is focused on measuring efficiency and quality and it is here that SWB offers an alternative perspective. In this article, I use SWB to assess the welfare effects of the choice of hospital policy in the English NHS. Choice preferences are then analysed with a particular focus on the views of different social groups and the results are related to the overall welfare effects of choice with the purpose of capturing equity effects. Results indicate overall positive welfare effects of choice and competition with marked differences between social groups. While it is groups with lower income and lower education that state a higher demand choice, the positive welfare effects I identify are felt most strongly by high income and high education groups. The results highlight the previously debated equity problem arising from choice and competition policies in health care.

We find evidence that the mechanism does not eliminate politically motivated targeting of the grants.

We use a unique dataset on India's industrial licensing regime to test whether industrial de-licensing during the 1980s and 1990s played a role in skill upgrading, as measured by the employment and wagebill shares of white-collar workers. In addition, we assess the relative contribution of industrial de-licensing and trade liberalization to skill upgrading. We identify two main channels through which industrial de-licensing affects skill upgrading: capital- and output-skill complementarities. Using both difference-in-differences as well as regression discontinuity techniques, we find two important results. First, after controlling for the size-based exemption rule that determined whether or not a plant faced licensing restrictions, industrial de-licensing during the 1980s appears to have increased the relative demand for skilled workers via capital- and output-skill complementarities. Capital- and output-skill complementarities exist for plants in both licensed and de-licensed industries but were stronger in de-licensed industries during the 1980s, prior to India's massive trade liberalization reforms in 1991. Second, regardless of de-licensing, capital- and output-skill complementarities are generally weaker after trade was liberalized during the early 1990s. Together, capital- and output-skill complementarities contributed 75% (57%) and 31% (29%), respectively, of the growth in the employment and wagebill shares of white-collar workers in de-licensed (licensed) industries before trade was liberalized. After trade liberalization, these contributions were smaller. This suggests that trade liberalization may not have played a major role in raising the relative demand for skilled labor during the early 1990s. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggest that sizable learning externalities exist, even in a conservative setup.

We theoretically derive the properties of the equilibria under different levels of noise and we experimentally test how behavior changes with noise. We obtain three main insights. First, if the amount of noise increases, high types aiming for separation (must) increase their signaling expenditures. This theoretical prediction is confirmed in our experiment. Second, for intermediate and high levels of noise, a separating and pooling equilibrium co-exist. In the experiment, subjects tend to shift from coordinating on a separating outcome to a pooling one as noise increases. Third, a surprising theoretical insight is that a separating equilibrium ceases to exist for low levels of noise (and an unfavorable prior). Yet in the experiment subjects then do coordinate on separation. A simple attraction learning model incorporating belief learning, imitation and reinforcement, explains this stable non-equilibrium behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A monetary policy rule allows the central bank to systematically manage the nominal interest rate in response to inflation, output, and money growth variations. The structural parameters of a small open-economy (SOE) and a closed-economy (CE) models are estimated using a maximum-likelihood procedure with a Kalman filter. Estimation results show that the SOE and CE models lead to qualitatively similar estimates for the Canadian economy. Also, the effects of monetary policy shocks, and of other domestic shocks, generated in the SOE model resemble to those generated in the CE model. In addition, the forecast-error decomposition shows that foreign shocks account for small fractions of the variability observed in Canadian macroeconomic variables.","Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Dib, A (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",ADib@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,32,12,14,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

To that end, the authors develop a methodology that circumvents this data hurdle and estimate returns to differential lengths of exposure using administrative data. Such data are generally collected as a by-product of the monitoring process of programme implementation but are rarely exploited to assess the effectiveness of the programme. The analysis finds that the returns to exposure are positive: communities exposed for an additional 1 (or 2) years of display on average lower malnutrition rates of around 7-9 percentage points. Moreover, the differential returns are decreasing over time, although they do not dissipate to zero. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the returns to the programme reflect learning effects from the intervention.","[Galasso, Emanuela] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Umapathi, Nithin] Human Dev E Asia & Pacific World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Yau, Jeffrey] Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Washington, DC 20580 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Galasso, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",egalasso@worldbank.org,,,,,,,14,3,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

A New Economic Geography model is presented that accounts for firm entry/ exit and international mobility of skilled labor employed in public R& D sectors. This raises the traditional agglomeration effects in a core-periphery setting as firms and mobile factors usually cluster within spatial agglomerations. With international technology diffusion, however, there is a counteracting effect on the traditional agglomeration effects as firms in the periphery also benefit from increasing R& D expenditures in the core lowering entry costs for firms. It is found that the catching-up of structurally backward countries is spurred not only as a result of trade integration but also because of technology diffusion.","Univ Heilbronn, Dept W2, Heilbronn, Germany",,"Hafner, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Heilbronn, Dept W2, Max Planck Str 39, Heilbronn, Germany.",kurt.hafner@hs-heilbronn.de,,,,,,,41,4,6,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Answering this question in a scientific way is of profound significance to the ongoing educational reform in China. Based on the unique thinking style of Chinese people and focusing on knowledge workers engaged in creative activities, our study explored the relationships among thinking style, organizational commitment and creativity of Chinese employees. We theorized that the thinking style of connection and change would influence employee creativity both directly and indirectly. Data analysis from a sample of 134 Chinese subordinates supported our hypothesis, indicating that connection was correlated positively to creativity, whereas change was correlated negatively. Furthermore, connection was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between organizational commitment and creativity; and the influence of change on employee creativity was partially mediated by organizational commitment.

This may not be so if the country with the larger output gap converges to full-employment equilibrium faster than the country with the smaller gap. We argue that common monetary policy can be destabilizing when countries' responses to non-monetary shocks are perfectly symmetric with a correlation of 1 but exhibit differing investment sensitivities to the real interest rate. We use Canada, Mexico and the United States to test the feasibility of a monetary union by documenting whether: 1) gross investments in Canada and Mexico are equally responsive to the real fund rate, and 2) Canada and Mexico's output growth and inflation respond differently to US monetary policy shocks and oil price shocks. This approach implicitly dictates whether the shocks themselves are symmetric or asymmetric. Using quarterly data and SVAR methodology, we conducted two layers of analysis. We estimated SVARs for the periods 1970-2008,1970-1990 and 1991-2008 to find that a monetary union is feasible between Canada and the US for the first two sample periods. For Canada and Mexico, we find similar responses of output growth to US monetary policy shocks. We conducted further robustness tests by estimating two identified VARs with common US variables and oil prices for Canada and Mexico to assess commonality in responses to shocks with the US. These results affirm that a monetary union is also feasible between Canada and the US. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

More generally, the article challenges the now widely held presumption, which underlies debates like these over rights, that there exists some set of universal human rights of which free movement is a member. A utilitarian theory of constitutional rights is offered instead. The article demonstrates that some constitutional rights, as those contained in the U. S.

Uncovering the Role of Democratic Reforms,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AFRICA; RATES; CHINA,"There is documented evidence that returns to education were low during the military rule of the 1990s in Nigeria. In this paper, I investigate the claim that after democracy in 1999, there have been increases in the returns to education. In addition, I examine the possible role of democratic reform in explaining this time difference in return. Following the sudden death of military general Sanni Abacha, Nigeria moved to democracy in 1999, ending a 15-year stretch of military rule. This move was followed by significant institutional and economic reforms, which could lead to changes in returns to education. The average return to education before and after 1999 is estimated using instrumental variables, and consistent estimates of the change in return are derived. The results provide evidence that returns to education have increased in Nigeria after 1999. More importantly, I show that reforms implemented after democracy in Nigeria can explain a significant part of this increase in returns to education although we cannot completely rule out other secondary factors. Further, evidence is provided that the wage reform implemented after democracy plays a significant role in explaining the higher increases in returns for government workers and those with tertiary education, in comparison to others.","[Oyelere, Ruth Uwaifo] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Oyelere, Ruth Uwaifo] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Oyelere, RU (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",ruth.uwaifo@econ.gatech.edu,,"Uwaifo, Ruth/0000-0001-8356-1695",,,,,53,5,6,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Using original data on expected wealth dynamics, social networks and informal loans among southern Ethiopian pastoralist households, we find that the threshold at which expected wealth dynamics bifurcate serves as a focal point at which lending is concentrated. Informal lending responds to recipients' losses but only so long as the recipients are not too poor. Our results suggest that when shocks can have long term effects, loans are best understood as providing a safety net rather than a scale-neutral insurance mechanism. Furthermore, the persistently poor are excluded from social networks that are necessary to obtain loans given in response to shocks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It compares several models of minimax regret, shows how to characterize the according choice correspondences in a unified setting, extends one of them to choice from convex (through randomization) sets, and connects them by defining a behavioral notion of perceived ambiguity. Substantively, a main idea is to behaviorally identify ambiguity with failures of independence of irrelevant alternatives. Regarding proof technique, the core contribution is to uncover a dualism between choice correspondences and preferences in an environment where this dualism is not obvious. This insight can be used to generate results by importing findings from the existing literature on preference orderings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

When this probability is proxied by local unemployment rates, we find a downward bias in typical estimated CWDs using cross-sectional data that span many local labor markets.

I give a simple example to show that even for arbitrarily small epsilon > 0, allocation and prices can be far away from exact equilibrium allocations and prices. That is, errors in market clearing or individuals' optimality conditions do not provide enough information to assess the quality of an approximation. I derive a sufficient condition for an epsilon-equilibrium to be close to an exact equilibrium. If the economic fundamentals are semi-algebraic, one can verify computationally whether this condition holds. The condition can be interpreted economically as a robustness requirement on the set of epsilon-equilibria which form a neighbourhood of the computed approximation.

However, multiple equilibria may also foster risk-taking behavior by some poor people. We illustrate this idea with a simple analytical model in which people with different wealth and ability endowments make investment and risky activity choices in the presence of known nonconvex asset dynamics. This model underscores a crucial distinction between familiar static concepts of risk aversion and forward-looking dynamic risk responses to nonconvex asset dynamics. Even when unobservable preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, observed behavior may suggest that risk aversion actually increases with wealth near perceived dynamic asset thresholds. Although high ability individuals are not immune from poverty traps, they can leverage their capital endowments more effectively than lower ability types and are therefore less likely to take seemingly excessive risks. In general, linkages between behavioral responses and wealth dynamics often seem to run in both directions. Both theoretical and empirical poverty trap research could benefit from making this two-way linkage more explicit.

For the same group of countries the difference between individual and average change in income has a significant impact on satisfaction. For all countries in the panel we find a significant impact from the change in the individual income situation over the last year.

In particular, we incorporate within-cohort heterogeneity in a two-period Overlapping-Generation model to capture the intra-generational redistributive effect of social security transfers. Political decision-making is represented by a probabilistic voting A la Lindbeck and Weibull (1987). We analytically characterize the Markov perfect equilibrium, in which social security tax rates are shown to be increasing in wealth inequality. A dynamic interaction between inequality and social security leads to larger social security programs. In a model calibrated to the U.S. economy, the dynamic interaction is shown to be quantitatively important: It accounts for more than half of the social security growth in the dynamics. We also perform some normative analysis, showing that the politico-economic equilibrium outcomes can be fundamentally different from the Ramsey allocation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It is expected that Norges Bank produces inflation forecasts that are on average better than other forecasts, both 'naive' forecasts, and forecasts from econometric models outside the central bank. We find that the superiority of the bank's forecast cannot be asserted, when compared with genuine ex-ante real time forecasts from an independent econometric model. The 1-step Monetary Policy Report forecasts are preferable to the 1-step forecasts from the outside model, but for the policy relevant horizons (e. g., 4 quarters ahead), the forecasts from the outsider model are preferred with a wider margin. An explanation in terms of too high speed of adjustment to the inflation target is supported by the evidence. Norges Bank's forecasts are better than the 'naive' forecasts.

In doing so, we make use of three different waves of the Bulgarian Integrated Household Survey, each reflecting remarkably different environmental conditions. The results suggest that standard theories of off-farm labor supply provide little guidance in situations characterized by chronic excess supply in the off-farm labor market and/or rapidly changing circumstances. In particular, the results show (1) that off-farm employment throughout the transition was predominantly determined by demand rather than by supply, and (2) that the magnitude and statistical significance of the various determinants are very sensitive to changing environmental conditions. As such, the results can be extremely relevant for both theory and policy for the many countries which may still need to go through privatization and painful restructuring as a result of financial crises and globalization.

In particular the prevailing view is that Marshall was unable to follow through on his declaration that biology is the Mecca of economics. This paper reconsiders Marshall's problem by focusing on the intellectual connections among Darwin, Babbage and Marshall: it explores the relationship between Marshall's view of complexity as a dialectical mixing of routine and variation and reconstructs the development of a powerful intellectual model that we call the evolutionary machine.

These industries are affected either by oil futures returns, oil futures return volatility or both. In general, excess returns of the oil-user industries are more likely to be affected by changes in the volatility of oil returns, than those of oil return itself. Volatilities of industry excess returns are time-varying, and return volatility for a number of sectors, appears to have long memory.

However, DSGE models were not considered as a forecasting tool until very recently. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we compare the forecasting ability of a canonical DSGE model for the Spanish economy with other standard econometric techniques. More precisely, we compare out-of-sample forecasts obtained from different estimation methods of the DSGE model with the forecasts produced by a VAR and a Bayesian VAR. Second, we propose a new method for combining DSGE and VAR models (in what we have called Augmented VAR-DSGE) through the expansion of the variable space where the VAR operates with artificial series obtained from a DSGE model. The results indicate that the out-of-sample forecasting performance of the proposed method is capable of competing with all the considered alternatives, and thus even a simple canonical RBC model contains useful information that can be used for forecasting purposes.","[Fernandez-de-Cordoba, Gonzalo; Torres, Jose L.] Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Torres, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido S-N, Malaga 29013, Spain.",jtorres@uma.es,"Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021","Torres, Jose L./0000-0002-7469-5656",,,,,36,3,3,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

All three treatments theoretically have the same equilibrium. I find, however, that the possibility of resale alters behavior significantly. In the two treatments with resale, subjects deviated from both the Nash prediction and the common results about bidding behavior in English auctions. Subjects tend to overbid, when they are certain they can reap the whole surplus in the resale market. I employ different models like QRE and levels of reasoning and conclude that overbidding can be explained as a rational response to the noisy environment in markets with human participants, that is, as rational decision making when anticipating others to make errors. When the outcome of the resale market is not certain, there is significant signaling behavior and auction prices tend to be lower than the Nash prediction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Initially, a general result to describe the conditions for the weighted-product model to be a Lorenz curve, created by using several component parametric Lorenz models, is given. We show that the key property for an ideal component model is that the ratio between its second derivative and its first derivative is increasing. Then, a set of Lorenz models, consisting of a basic group of models, along with their convex combinations, is proposed, and it is shown that any model in the set possesses this key property. We introduce the concept of balanced fit, which provides a means of assigning weights, according to the preferences of the practitioner, to two alternative objectives for developing Lorenz curves in practice. These objectives are generating an acceptable Lorenz curve and improving the accuracy of the density estimation. We apply the balanced fit approach to income survey data from China to illustrate the performance of our models. We first show that our models outperform other popular traditional Lorenz models in the literature. Second, we compare the results generated by the balanced fit approach applied to one of the Lorenz models that we develop with those generated by the kernel method to show that the approach proposed in the paper generates plausible density estimates.","[Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Wang, ZuXiang] Wuhan Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Monash University; Wuhan University,"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Russell.Smyth@BusEco.monash.edu.au,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021; Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019; LI, Wenhui/JCD-9947-2023","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883; Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462;",,,,,33,13,18,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We introduce the unfairness Lorenz curve and the unfairness Gini, which are generalizations of the standard versions of the Lorenz curve and the Gini. With this more general framework in place, we study the implications of responsibility-sensitive theories of justice for the evaluation of the income distribution in Norway from 1986 to 2005. We find that both the pre-tax and the post-tax income distributions have become less fair in Norway, even though the standard Gini for the pre-tax income distribution has decreased in the same period. Two trends explain this development: the increase in income share of the top percentile and the change in the situation of females in the labor market. The concentration of income at the top of the distribution contributes both to increased unfairness and increased inequality, whereas the increase in females' working hours and level of education primarily contributes to a reduction in inequality. Thus, the latter effect dominates for the standard Gini and the former effect for the unfairness Gini. Furthermore, we find that the increase in post-tax unfairness is even larger than the increase in pre-tax unfairness, which shows that the tax system in Norway contributes less to eliminating unfairness in 2005 than in 1986.

We discuss why these assumptions are likely to be violated in practice, and provide alternative measures that overcome these drawbacks. Our results, using plant level data for Ireland, clearly show that the choice of backward linkage measure and thus, the assumptions behind it, matters greatly in order to draw possible conclusions regarding the existence of foreign direct investment (FDI)-related spillovers. Using the standard measure employed in the literature we fail to find robust evidence for spillovers through backward linkages. However, when we use alternative measures of backward linkages that relax assumptions (i)-(iii), we find robust evidence for positive FDI backward spillover effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This may happen, for example, if there is a vast pool of workforce who may not have even the basic education to qualify as unskilled and excessive capital flows into the skilled sector.

The mean and Standard Deviation (SD) of country risk are adopted to classify 28 countries into Low Risk Low Volatility (LRLV) and High Risk High Volatility (HRHV) subgroups. Through the technique of error correction-based panel co-integration developed by Westerlund (2007), several results are obtained. First, LRLV countries can expand the capitalization of stock market to enhance long-term economic growth. Second, HRHV countries, on the other hand, use two distinct strategies to promote long-term economic growth. Initially they develop their equity markets, which promote economic growth directly. Strengthened equity markets, in turn, aid in the development of credit markets, which subsequently brings an economic boom. Finally, regardless of selected subgroups, the contribution of stock market capitalization to economic growth appears to be substantially larger than that of bank credit, highlighting the importance of stock markets.","[Hou, Han] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Tao Yuan, Taiwan; [Cheng, Su-Yin] Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Tao Yuan, Taiwan; [Ho, Chia-Cheng] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Westerlund, Joakim] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Law, Vasagatan, Sweden",Nan Kai University Technology; National Chung Cheng University; University of Gothenburg,"Hou, H (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Tao Yuan, Taiwan.",finhh@mail.lhu.edu.tw,,"Hou, Han/0000-0002-4091-3299",,,,,18,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The scale and speed of the surge of Chinese investment into Australia, largely from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), has raised the question of whether investments by SOEs require special scrutiny. In China, the question is about the treatment of Chinese investment compared with investment from other countries. Clearly, Australia has had a policy environment that is very open to foreign investment, including investment from China. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether measures recently introduced in Australia to review investment by SOEs will restrict Chinese access to the Australian market or encourage a change in the nature of investment projects. How will Chinese enterprises need to adjust to the disciplines and rules in foreign markets? Will the Chinese Government need to take the regulations of host countries like Australia into account in its supervision of SOEs? Australia remains more open to Chinese investment than any other country in the world. Although the issue of SOE investment raises important new questions for policy-makers in Australia and other countries, Chinese investment in Australian resources is very beneficial and, with appropriate institutional and policy initiatives, will continue its strong growth.","Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Drysdale, P (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",peter.drysdale@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,33,26,28,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2011,19.0,4,,,SI,,54,73,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01250.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,800XJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000293400700004,0

Specifically, I show that contributors give more than in standard models where status is not considered, their donation is increasing in the value they assign to status and, under certain conditions, in the value that their opponents assign to status (reflecting donors' competition to gain social status). Furthermore, I consider contributors' equilibrium strategies both in simultaneous and sequential contribution mechanisms. Then, I compare total contributions in both of these mechanisms. I find that the simultaneous contribution order generates higher total contributions than the sequential mechanism only when donors are sufficiently homogeneous in the value they assign to status.

The motivation behind this study is designing such a Decision Support System (DSS) that enables the energy decision makers to perform analysis using different methods of MCDA and different criteria from various application areas and test the applicability of the system through an application in Turkish Energy Sector. The system includes several methods of MCDA and common parameters from previous studies in order to provide different approaches of evaluating decision problems. With this feature, the system stands on the intersection of MCDA and E&E fields. Moreover, an application of MCDA in Turkish Energy Sector has been performed to test the applicability of the system and some conclusions about electricity distribution in Turkey are put forth.","[Atici, Kazim Baris; Ulucan, Aydin] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06532 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Ulucan, A (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06532 Ankara, Turkey.",kba@hacettepe.edu.tr; aulucan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"ATICI, KAZIM BARIS/E-9140-2013; ULUCAN, AYDIN/I-8482-2013","ATICI, KAZIM BARIS/0000-0003-0786-9641; ULUCAN, AYDIN/0000-0002-0439-2211",,,,,56,18,18,1,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The importance of LBD on export performance is accounted for at various levels of aggregation, such as LBD at the product level, LBD at the market level, and more specifically, LBD at the market-and-product level. Using panel data covering 130 countries and 1,003 products during the period between 1962 and 2000, this paper finds a positive but concave relationship between foreign trade and LBD at various export levels, even after controlling for country income effects, openness, and per-capita GDP growth rates. Such relationship is stronger and less bounded at the product-specific level. However, with more meaningful changes, LBD at the market-specific level becomes more important than that at the product-specific level over a longer period of time.","Korea Econ Res Inst, Seoul 150705, South Korea",,"Choi, N (通讯作者)，Korea Econ Res Inst, 8th Fl,Hana Daetoo Secur Bldg,27-3 Yeouido Dong, Seoul 150705, South Korea.",nchoi@keri.org,"Choi, Namsuk/AAC-2830-2019; Choi, Namsuk/HLW-8040-2023","Choi, Namsuk/0000-0002-2113-2833;",,,,,25,1,1,0,8,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

However, with the demise of national development strategies after the 1980s, external and internal efforts and measures stemming from big business and financial capital challenged the developmental state. During the 1990s countries in Latin and South America followed similar patterns toward financial integration.

Every call that is placed must be terminated by the network of the receiving party, thus the termination end has the characteristic of an economic bottleneck and is subject to regulation in many countries. This paper examines the impact of regulatory intervention to cut termination rates of calls to mobile phones. We argue that regulatory cuts should have a differential impact according to the type of tariff the mobile customer subscribes to. While all mobile customers may pay higher prices because of a waterbed effect, termination rates also affect competition among mobile operators. We show that the waterbed effect is diluted, but not eliminated, for customers with pre-paid cards, where regulation also acts as impediment to raise-each-other's-cost collusive strategies that mobile networks can adopt. The waterbed effect is instead strongest for consumers with post-paid subscription contracts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

What is the optimal capacity and how to calculate it in the best possible way by connecting parking supply and demand? This paper presents the application of the queuing theory to the planning of the optimal number of servers (ramps) in closed parking systems, since parking area can be defined as a queuing system. The illustrated model has been tested on the example of the Delta parking area in the City of Rijeka and the particular value of the model is its universal application.

It is an aggregation operator that uses probabilities and OWA operators in the same formulation considering the degree of importance of each concept in the analysis. Moreover, it also uses uncertain information assessed with interval numbers in the aggregation process. The main advantage of this aggregation operator is that it is able to use the attitudinal character of the decision maker and the available probabilistic information in an environment where the information is very imprecise and can be assessed with interval numbers. We study some of its main properties and particular cases such as the uncertain probabilistic aggregation (UPA) and the uncertain OWA (UOWA) operator. We also develop an application of the new approach in a multi-person decision-making problem in political management regarding the selection of monetary policies. Thus, we obtain the multi-person UPOWA (MP-UPOWA) operator. We see that this model gives more complete information of the decision problem because it is able to deal with decision making problems under uncertainty and under risk in the same formulation.","[Merigo, Jose M.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Business Adm, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Wei, Guiwu] Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Dept Econ & Management, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China",University of Barcelona; Chongqing University of Arts & Sciences,"Merigó, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Business Adm, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jmerigo@ub.edu; weiguiwu@163.com,"Merigó, José M./K-1500-2019; Wei, Guiwu/M-4177-2015","Merigó, José M./0000-0002-4672-6961; Wei, Guiwu/0000-0001-9074-2005",,,,,50,63,65,0,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The data are then aggregated to the team level for the period 1920-2009 in order to test whether teams built on a more even distribution of observed talent perform better than those teams with a mixture of highly able and less able players. The dependent variable used in the regressions is the percentage of games a team wins each season. We find that conditioning on average player ability, dispersion of both batting and pitching talent displays an optimal degree of inequality, in that teams with too high or too low a spread in player ability perform worse than teams with a more balanced distribution of offensive and defensive talent. These findings have potentially important applications both inside and outside the sporting world. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To answer that question, this article begins by reviewing bargaining models of intrafamily allocation and discussing the determinants of 'bargaining power'. It argues that wage rates rather than earnings are determinants of bargaining power, and that productivity in household production is also a determinant of bargaining power. In the absence of human capital effects, joint taxation does not appear to disadvantage women in bargaining. Hence, the claim that joint taxation disadvantages women, if correct, depends on effects that operate through incentives to accumulate human capital. But a satisfactory analysis of the effects of taxation on human capital awaits the further development of dynamic models of family bargaining.

We argue that it is necessary to account for interest payments on consumer debt when measuring income inequality and the size of the middle class, and then estimate the impact of doing this using the Survey of Consumer Finances datasets since the 1980s. We find that both greater income inequality and rising interest payments on past debt are squeezing the middle class, with interest becoming more important in the 2000s.

Using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of 2007, we find that taxes and transfers reduce income inequality in Korea by 13.8 percent. Contrary to the popular belief that direct taxes are the key tool for redistribution, in-kind benefits, direct taxes, and social security contributions all decrease the Gini coefficient by 6.7, 4.7, and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. The redistributive effect of consumption taxes is small and negative (-0.5 percentage point). Policy simulations indicate that education spending financed by the personal income tax has a positive redistributive effect and that the lower 70 percent of households enjoy positive net benefits. Spending targeting the poor has a strong redistributive effect, which implies low popularity because the majority of households face net losses.","[Park, Ki-Baeg] Univ Seoul, Dept Sci Taxat, Seoul 130743, South Korea; [Sung, Myung Jae] Korea Inst Publ Finance, Seoul, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Park, KB (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Dept Sci Taxat, 90 Jeonnong Dong, Seoul 130743, South Korea.",kbpark@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,5,6,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Indirect reciprocity based on reputation is one such mechanism. Assessing an individual's reputation requires first-order information, i.e. knowledge about its previous behavior, as it is utilized under image scoring. But there seems to be an agreement that in order to successfully stabilize cooperation, higher-order information is necessary, i.e. knowledge of others' previous reputations. We show here that such a conclusion might have been premature. Tolerant scoring, a first-order assessment rule with built-in tolerance against single defections, can lead a society to stable cooperation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We simulate such a market where the funds are being managed using the following three investment styles: fundamental, momentum and index.

Utilizing a model of heterogeneous firms, we find equilibria in which both pure exporters and multinationals coexist. We utilize this model to study the case of endogenously chosen tariffs. As is standard. Nash equilibrium tariffs are higher than the socially optimal tariffs. Unlike existing models with homogeneous firms, we find that non-cooperative tariffs promote the existence of low-productivity firms relative to the socially optimal tariffs. This highlights a new source of inefficiency from tariff competition not found in models of homogeneous firms. In addition, we find that in many cases the Nash equilibrium tariff when FDI is a potential firm structure is lower than when it is not. As a result, FDI improves welfare by mitigating tariff competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While some researchers confirm regional disparity in China's foreign direct investment, others attribute the widening regional income inequality to this regional disparity. This paper thus assesses the impacts of China's stock of foreign direct investment on its regional income inequality using simultaneous equation model and the Shapley value regression-based decomposition approach. Our results suggest that China's stock of foreign direct investment has accounted for merely 2% of its regional income inequality. Furthermore, the contribution ratio of per capita foreign direct investment stock to China's regional income inequality has relatively been on a steady decline since 2002. The decomposition results also reveal that provincial per capita physical assets account for over 50% of the nation's income inequality and 65% of the increases in income inequality since 1990. The other two important determinants of regional income inequality are province location and educational level. However, educational level is found to have a decreasing effect on regional income inequality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed framework can be used to measure long-term as well as short-term EOp, depending on whether we let permanent income or snapshots of income form the basis of the analysis. Furthermore, it allows for both an ex-ante and an ex-post approach to EOp. There is long-term ex-post inequality of opportunity if individuals who exert the same effort have different permanent incomes. In comparison, the ex-ante approach focuses on differences in the expected permanent income between groups of individuals with identical circumstances. To demonstrate the empirical relevance of a long-run perspective on EOp, we exploit a unique panel data from Norway on individuals' incomes over their working life span.

This paper investigates the growth of the service sector as an explanation for the increase in women's employment. It develops an economic model that can account for the increase in women's employment and the growth of the service sector at the same time. A growth model with two sectors and a home production technology is constructed in order to quantitatively assess the contribution of sectoral productivity differences to the change in women's employment decision. The sectoral productivities are taken from the data. This model demonstrates that a higher rate of productivity growth in market services compared to home services can account for a large fraction of the observed increase in women's labor supply from 1950 to 2005.","[Akbulut, Rahsan] Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"Akbulut, R (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, George L Argyros Sch Business & Econ, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",akbulut@chapman.edu,,,,,,,38,26,33,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Voters observe an incumbent's valence and policy choices but only know the challenger's party. Our model provides a rich set of novel results. In contrast to existing predictions from static models, we prove that dynamic considerations make higher-valence incumbents more likely to compromise and win re-election, even though they compromise to more extreme policies. Consequently, we find that the correlation between valence and extremist policies rises with office-holder seniority. This result may help explain previous empirical findings. Despite this result, we establish that the whole electorate gains from improvements in the distribution of valences. In contrast, fixing average valence, the greater dispersion in valence associated with a high-valence political elite always benefits the median voter but can harm a majority of voters when voters are sufficiently risk averse. We then consider interest groups (IGs) or activists who search for candidates with better skills. We derive a complete theoretical explanation for the intuitive conjectures that policies are more extreme when IGs and activists have more extreme ideologies, and that such extremism reduces the welfare of all voters.","[Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Camara, Odilon] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Squintani, Francesco] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Squintani, Francesco] Univ Brescia, I-25121 Brescia, Italy",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Southern California; University of Essex; University of Brescia,"Bernhardt, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA.",,"; Camara, Odilon/R-8202-2016","Squintani, Francesco/0000-0001-5632-5267; Camara, Odilon/0000-0003-0829-5061",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-538-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,43,47,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Equilibrium outcomes mismatch workers to firms, and will generally result in an inefficient number of both entrepreneurs and workers opting for the entrepreneurial sector.

The empirical analysis uses new data on a comprehensive sample of public U.S. firms that received FDI between 1979 and 2006. To account for the possibility that performance differences arise due to the selection of superior target firm rather than the change in ownership, I use propensity score matching to create similar comparison groups of target firms prior to acquisitions. The analysis reveals three major findings. First, acquiring firms from industrialized countries lead to labor productivity increases of 13% in the target firm three years after the acquisition compared to targets acquired by domestic firms. Firms that received developing country firm acquisitions, on the other hand, exhibit lower labor productivity gains four years after acquisition, compared to targets acquired by domestic firms. Second, targets receiving FDI by firms from industrial and developing countries also experience increases in profits, compared with firms receiving acquisition by domestic firms from the United States. Third, compared with domestic acquisitions, foreign industrial firm acquisition FDI tends to increase their targets' employment and sales, whereas targets acquired by firms located in developing countries experience a decrease in both revenues and total number of employees. These findings suggest that target firms are subject to significantly different restructuring processes depending on the origin of the acquiring firm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TERM-H2O is a dynamic multiregional computable general equilibrium model containing water accounts. Controversially, our results suggest that buyback would increase economic activity in SMDB. Although a scheme of environmentally useful size would sharply increase the price of irrigation water, there would be little effect on aggregate SMDB farm output. Instead, farm resources would be reallocated between activities. Because farmers are owners of water rights, they would benefit from the price increase induced by buyback.","[Dixon, Peter B.; Rimmer, Maureen T.; Wittwer, Glyn] Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Wittwer, G (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",glyn.wittwer@buseco.monash.edu.au,,"Rimmer, Maureen/0000-0002-7477-4565",,,,,9,50,53,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Rose (2004) reports a wide range of empirical specifications that produce no WTO effects. Tomz et al. (2007) use Rose's data but include de facto WTO membership, to find positive WTO trade effects. Rose (2005) also produced positive WTO trade effects after accounting for the diverse trade effects produced by individual preferential trade agreements (PTAs). When Subramanian and Wei (2007) emphasize general equilibrium trade effects by controlling for multilateral resistance, they find strong WTO trade effects only for industrialized countries. Subramanian and Wei (2007), however, account neither for unobserved heterogeneity among trading partners, nor for differences in trade effects across PTAs (which could inflate WTO estimates). We unify the Rose, Tomz et al., and Subramanian and Wei specifications in one comprehensive approach that minimizes omitted variable bias to show that all specifications produce one consistent result: WTO effects on trade flows are not statistically significant, while PTAs produce strong but uneven trade effects. Extending the gravity model to address specific avenues in which WTO may have affected trade flows, we find that WTO membership boosts trade prior to PTA formation and increases trade among proximate developing countries (at the expense of distant trade). An augmented gravity model that accounts for WTO terms-of-trade theory shows that countries with greater incentives to bargain for tariff reductions before WTO accession experience positive and significant subsequent WTO trade effects.

At the end of the 1970s it was assumed oil prices would continue to rise. Now a similar assumption pervades policy design. This article critiques the peak oil hypotheses which lie behind these forecasts and policy beliefs, and considers that, from a climate change perspective, the challenge is too much not too little fossil fuel reserves. The coming of shale gas, its fungibility with oil via the electrification of transport, along with technological advances in increasing the depletion rates of existing wells and new reserves, together undermine that assumption that rising oil prices will rapidly make renewable and other low-carbon technologies cost competitive without subsidies. The paper suggests indexing carbon prices to the oil price, infrastructure investment, strategic storage, and a focus on market failures provides a superior approach to energy policy rather than relying on forecasts of oil prices and picking winners.","[Helm, Dieter] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Helm, Dieter] New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk,,,,,,,37,23,25,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Lessons from 3G licensing,INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Spectrum auctions; Licensing fees; Consumer price; Investment; Market concentration,COMPETITION; SERVICE; FEES,"Although the auctioning spectrum is generally considered to be highly successful, many countries still rely on beauty contests to assign spectrums. This is often attributed to the negative perceptions about the potential problems that auctions may cause, such as high licensing fees, high consumer prices, a lower incentive to invest in infrastructure, and concerns about market concentration. To address these negative perceptions, this paper estimates the effects of the auctions and the licensing fees for the 3G spectrum on consumer prices, the timing of a new service launch, and the market structure using data from the mobile markets of 21 OECD countries. Although our study uses a relatively small sample and a simple methodology, the results are meaningful since it examines a single service (3G) in OECD countries. Some of these countries have adopted auctions while others have used the traditional beauty contest approach. This combination provides a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of auctions on the mobile telecommunications market. The estimation results show no evidence to support claims of negative effects of spectrum auctions in the mobile communications market. This study calls for more positive action toward spectrum auctions in many countries who seek to improve the efficiency and transparency of spectrum assignment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the model, the central government sells offices to low-level officials and demands ex-post payments enforced by the judiciary. Because an independent judiciary can rule against the central authority and accept bribes from stealing low-level officials, it reduces corruption at the higher level of government but promotes corruption at the lower level.

Hence, constitutions are subject to spontaneous ordering just as are ordinary market processes. All societies necessarily possess constitutional frameworks that frame the actions of participants; however, those frameworks are not fully settled prior to action but rather evolve through action, which means, in turn, that constitutions, like societies, are living entities and not background precepts against which societal life evolves.","[Runst, Petrik; Wagner, Richard E.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Runst, P (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",rwagner@gmu.edu,,,,,,,46,21,23,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Although firms have at their disposal various alternative strategies for dealing with their problems, in this paper we focus on two: making unofficial payments to officials and joining business associations. Choices between these strategies may be affected by both firm and industry characteristics and institutional conditions. This paper has two objectives: (1) to compare the effects of two alternative strategies (unofficial payments and association memberships) on various alternative measures of firm performance; and (2) in the case of association membership, to determine which particular functions lobbying, information, or other have the greatest effects on several different measures of firm performance. To accomplish these objectives, we make use of the 2002 and 2005 waves of the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys in twenty-eight transition economies. Estimates are obtained from both separate cross sections for 2002 and 2005 and a smaller panel of firms for which the information is available for both years. The estimates show that memberships in business associations, and especially access to their information functions, contribute more to firm performance than unofficial payments and lobbying, despite the fact that much of the literature asserts the opposite and assumes lobbying to be the primary function of business associations, especially in transition economies.","[Sukiassyan, Grigor] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Nursing, MECN Program, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Nugent, Jeffrey B.] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Southern California,"Sukiassyan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Nursing, MECN Program, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,,26,6,7,0,4,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

If the varieties and high-skilled labor are complements, the skill premium rises in both countries. This linking of imports of new foreign varieties-the extensive margin-to wage inequality is compatible with evidence.

It is estimated that, despite a high import content ranging between 40 and 50 percent, approximately one-third of Chinese growth before the global crisis was a result of exports, due to their phenomenal growth of some 25 percent per annum. This figure increases to 50 percent if spillovers to consumption and investment are allowed for. The main reason for excessive dependence on foreign markets is underconsumption. This is due not so much to a high share of household savings in GDP as to a low share of household income and a high share of profits. It is argued that China can no longer maintain such high growth rates for its exports, and, therefore, needs to turn to consumption-led growth by expanding the share of wages and household income in GDP and accelerating public spending in social infrastructure.","[Akyuez, Yilmaz] UNCTAD, South Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland; [Akyuez, Yilmaz] UNCTAD, Div Globalizat & Dev Strategies, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Akyüz, Y (通讯作者)，UNCTAD, South Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland.",yilmaz.akyuz@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,47,31,33,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2011,19.0,1,,,,,1,23,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01224.x,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,717IS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287037500001,0

However, our estimates imply that it would take 13 years for the cumulative positive effect of faster growth on the mean income of the bottom nine deciles to offset the negative effect of reducing their share of total income.","[Jencks, Christopher] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leigh, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Harvard University; Australian National University,,dan.andrews@oecd.org; christopher_jencks@harvard.edu; andrew_leigh@ksg02.harvard.edu,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,55,23,23,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Further investigations of the inter-relationships between FD and economic growth are timely given that government decentralization remains at the forefront of many Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) policy agendas. This study incorporates a range of measures of FD to better account for the direct impact of different levels of subnational fiscal autonomy on economic growth. The analysis also considers the impact of previously omitted public sector decentralization variables that provide further indication of the extent to which Subnational Governments (SNG) are 'closer to the people' and potentially better able to account for local preferences in fiscal decision-making. Whilst little evidence of a direct relationship between FD and output growth is found, some evidence is found to suggest that federal systems tend to have lower growth rates than do unitary states, independent of their degree of decentralization, and that countries with more elected tiers of government generally have lower economic growth.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Bodman, P (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.bodman@economics.uq.edu.au,,,,,,,65,35,40,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find evidence of a quadratic relationship between ownership concentration and diversification, and a cubic relationship between diversification and insider ownership. These results point towards the high probability of both expropriation and entrenchment phenomena, respectively, in this kind of scenario. We also find that concentrated ownership requires high levels of insider ownership, in order to prevent negative externalities of diversification. Another result shows that entrenchment externalities affect diversification before they erode firm value, which suggests that for low levels of diversification, firm value is still not negatively affected. Additionally, our results show that control mechanisms, such as debt, director remuneration and compliance with codes of good practice, are negatively related to the level of diversification. Overall, our results confirm the theoretical relevance of agency theory in explaining managerial attitudes towards corporate strategy, i.e. diversification. Furthermore, companies characterized by deficiencies in shareholder legal protection, concentrated ownership structures and a higher likelihood of managers being entrenched, should focus on the correct functioning of corporate governance mechanisms.","[Del Brio, Esther B.; Maia-Ramires, Elida L.; De Miguel, Alberto] Univ Salamanca, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Maia-Ramires, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel Unamuno,Edificio FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",elidamaia.ramires@ufjf.edu.br,"Maia Ramires, Elida/IQV-8502-2023",,,,,,58,8,9,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

An attempt is made in this article to depart from the earlier FDI policy perspective that considers technology as a public good that can normally be transferred to the host economy. Accordingly it is argued here that empirical evidences exist which indicate that significant technology spillover is most likely to occur among subsidiary firms that are technologically active as well as indigenous firms with absorptive capability while those that are not active are unlikely to do so. In providing a new approach, a policy priority framework for targeting technologically active firms is recommended which basically involve creating favourable condition for knowledge exchange, promoting selected technologies & products, supporting technological capabilities of active indigenous firms, and improvement of technical education of potential workforce. This is will encourage MNCs to transfer more valuable technologies to subsidiaries in Nigeria and also increase domestic firms' ability to absorb superior technology from MNCs.","[Dutse, A.

Since the pro-cyclical conditional expected marginal rate of substitution, implied from the US consumption data, is consistent with the proposition of loss aversion, we incorporate the loss averse behaviour of prospect theory into the consumption-based asset pricing model. Motivated by the similarity between habit formation and the prospect theory utility, habit formation is exploited to determine endogenously the reference point of this behavioural finance utility. The highly curved characteristic of the term structure of real interest rates can thus be captured by the additional consideration of loss aversion. This model also fits the downward sloping volatility of the real yield curve in the data of US Treasury Inflation-Protection Securities (TIPS). Moreover, depending on the effective risk attitude of the representative agent with the loss averse behaviour of prospect theory, our model is capable of generating a normal or an inverted yield curve.","[Hung, Mao-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Wang, Jr-Yan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Hung, MW (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",hung@management.ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,2,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Consumption, however, typically falls after an investment shock. This finding sits oddly with the observed business cycle comovement where consumption, along with hours-worked and investment, moves with economic activity. We show that this comovement problem is resolved in an estimated DSGE model when (i) the cost of capital utilization is specified in terms of increased depreciation of capital, as originally proposed by Greenwood et al. (1988) in a neoclassical setting, or (ii) there is no wealth effect on labor supply. The data, however, favors the first channel. Traditionally, the cost of utilization is specified in terms of forgone consumption following Christiano et al. (2005), who studied the effects of monetary policy shocks. The alternative specification we consider has two additional implications relative to the traditional one: (i) it has a substantially better fit with the data and (ii) the contribution of investment shocks to the variance of consumption is over three times larger. The contributions to output, investment, and hours, are also relatively higher, suggesting that these shocks may be quantitatively even more important than previous estimates based on the traditional specification.

Yet, whether, and to what extent, the introduction of secondary resale markets influences bidding behavior in sealed-bid first-price auctions remains under researched. This study begins by examining field data from a unique data set that includes nearly 3000 auctions (over 10,000 individual bids) for cutting rights of standing timber in British Columbia from 1996 to 2000. In comparing bidding patterns across agents who are likely to have resale opportunities with those who likely do not, we find evidence that is consistent with theory. Critical evaluation of the reduced-form bidding model, however, reveals that sharp tests of the theoretical predictions are not possible because several other differences may exist across these bidder types. We therefore use a laboratory experiment to examine if the resale opportunity by itself can have the predicted theoretical effect. We find that while it does have the predicted effect, a theoretical model based on risk-averse bidders explains the overall data patterns more accurately than a model based on risk-neutral bidders. Beyond testing theory, the paper highlights the inferential power of combining naturally occurring data with laboratory data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We employ an advanced panel threshold regression model to test whether there is a 'threshold' debt ratio which causes there to be asymmetrical relationships between debt ratio and firm value. We adopt Tobin's Q as proxy for firm value. We find that there are two threshold effects between debt ratio and firm value, and these are 9.86% and 33.33%. When the debt ratio is less than 9.86%, Tobin's Q (i.e. firm value) increases by 0.0546%, with an increase of 1% in the debt ratio. When the debt ratio is between 9.86% and 33.33%, we find Tobin's Q increases by only 0.0057%, with an increase of 1% in the debt ratio. But when the debt ratio is greater than 33.33%, there is no relationship between debt ratio and firm value. We therefore conclude that there must be a threshold debt ratio of less than 33.33% at which point firm value stops increasing. These results are consistent with the trade-off theory, which suggests that there is a static amount of debt which prompts managers to find the 'optimal capital structure' that maximizes firm value when the benefits of debt equal the marginal cost of debt.","[Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Grad Inst Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Lin, Feng-Li] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; Feng Chia University; Chaoyang University of Technology,"Chang, TY (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",tychang@fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,25,31,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, it has also consumed a lot of national resources in both human capital and financial capital. National valuable resources are limited and, as such, allocating resources to the most effective sector is critical for enhancing national competitiveness further in the future. This study adopts the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to evaluate the production efficiency of Taiwan's IC subsectors. 10 years of data, from 1995 to 2004, have been used to conduct the research. The productivities before and after the year 2000 are compared to see if there are any differences between the periods of economic upturn and downturn. The analysis finds that the IC design sector is the most worthwhile one in which a country's treasurable resources can be invested. However, the IC manufacturing and IC testing/packaging sectors are inefficient over an economic downturn due to their heavy capital investment. The results provide some insights for policy-makers.","Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Business Adm, Chungli 32003, Taiwan",Yuan Ze University,"Lu, LYY (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Business Adm, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan.",louisyylu@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This Great Recession launched vivid discussions on the causes and consequences of recent financial development, its macroeconomic effects, as well as the proper role of economic theory and policy. Facing the recession, some economists and general public once again argued that the mainstream financial and macroeconomic models were in disarray as they had not predicted well a collapse of U. S. mortgage market and a subsequent sharp decline in economic activity of major industrial countries. As this issue appers rather unexploited in the Czech academic milieu, the paper focuses on the reflection of, Great Recession in the international literature dealing with the methodological problems of macroeconomics and economic modelling. In particular, the paper pays attention to the dominant Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) approach and its criticisms for a lack of substance and relevance. In addition, the paper introduces a viable alternative called Post-Walrasian Macroeconomics or Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE), which becomes a popular platform for doing (macro) economics differently.

The research was based on study of EU and Latvian legislation, strategic and planning documents, scientific publications and specific literature related to the research topic. In order to carry out this study the following research methods were used: analysis and synthesis, logical and abstract interpretation, data interpolation and expert assessment They showed that the legislative framework in Latvia fragmented and incomplete. In current legislation there is lack of clear definition and national position key issues, such as on the national innovation policy, innovation funding and implementation mechanisms, rights of innovative enterprises and guarantees for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which are substantial obstacles for the development of innovative activities in Latvia. It was also concluded that linkage between major NIS actors in Latvia - government, business enterprises and research and scientific institutions - is weak and fragmented. To identify potential options for improving Latvia's NIS, the paper summarizes problems that hinder development of innovation in Latvia and offers some suggestions for solving them.","[Melece, Ligita; Popluga, Dina] Latvian State Inst Agrarian Econ, Dept Qual & Environm Protect, LV-1039 Riga, Latvia",,,ligita.melece@lvaei.lv,"Melece, Ligita/AAZ-6705-2020; Popluga, Dina/AAF-8097-2019","Melece, Ligita/0000-0002-3120-3711; Popluga, Dina/0000-0002-8182-8218",,,,,35,0,0,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,304,313,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200034,0

However, in many circumstances this may not be appropriate. Treaty rights or the capacity of a government to raise and collect taxes in the context of a developing country may preclude the introduction of new taxes. Alternatively, there may be settings where respondents reject the notion of an additional payment and a different approach to estimating nonmarket values is needed. This article demonstrates a methodology for estimating compensating budget reallocation, which is the amount of expenditure on other public goods that respondents are willing to forego for the government to provide more of another public good. One of the main contributions of this article is a demonstration of how to improve the specification of the opportunity costs of budget reallocations. Second, using choice modelling for the estimation of budget reallocations is compared with the standard approach of estimating compensating surplus. The two approaches produce aggregate results that are of a similar magnitude, however the relative importance of the environmental attributes differs. We also investigate the similarity of value estimates across income groups, and similar to Swallow and McGonagle (2006), we find that budget reallocations produce a different set of preferences for lower income earners.","[Morrison, Mark] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Business, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [MacDonald, Darla Hatton] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Policy & Econ Res Unit, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia",Charles Sturt University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Morrison, M (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Business, Panorama Ave, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",mmorrison@csu.edu.au,"Hatton MacDonald, Darla/D-3344-2011","Hatton MacDonald, Darla/0000-0003-1374-9128; Morrison, Mark/0000-0002-8761-0682",,,,,29,14,17,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To realize this objective, we regress HE on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the proportion of the population aged over 65 (P65) and a time trend (T). We first present results for 18 countries where real HE per capita is obtained using a general GDP deflator. For these countries, we find that health care is a luxury for just one country. Next, we present results for eight countries where real HE is obtained using a specific health-care price index. When the general GDP deflator is replaced with a specific health-care price index, at least one of the GDP, P65 or T coefficients for the eight countries changes in a reasonably dramatic fashion, suggesting that the use of the GDP deflator introduces bias into the regression. We find that HE is a necessity in all eight countries. Given that the reliability of the GDP deflator results is questionable, on the basis of the results for the eight countries, we conclude that HE is a necessity.","[Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield 3145, Australia; [Narayan, Paresh Kumar] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Australia; [Narayan, Seema] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Australia",Monash University; Deakin University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield 3145, Australia.",russell.smyth@BusEco.monash.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Narayan, Seema/H-5698-2019; Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019; Narayan, Seema Wati/GRY-3201-2022","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462; Narayan, Seema Wati/0000-0002-3993-4981; Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,49,10,10,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We create a new panel dataset that matches output and labor variables to industry-specific shifts in government demand. An increase in government demand raises output and hours, lowers real product wages and labor productivity, and has no effect on the markup.

We contrast optimal policies under commitment and discretion and identify several striking differences between these institutional environments. A government that can commit to its policy plans relies heavily on debt to smooth the adverse effects of large shocks over time. Lack of commitment seriously limits the government's ability to use debt as a shock absorber. Under discretion, an increase in debt leads to an increase in inflation expectations and therefore higher nominal interest rate distortions. Hence, the discretionary government keeps debt in close vicinity of its steady-state level, and the response of taxes, inflation, and interest rates to shocks is much more pronounced under discretion than under commitment. This is particularly relevant for large shocks and when the initial stock of government debt is already high at the time the shock occurs. We also argue that the adverse welfare effects of disasters are larger under discretion than under commitment, but these welfare differentials can be significantly reduced by making the discretionary government inflation averse.

First, in a one-sector model, I find a significant welfare cost of price rigidities under a standard Taylor rule, especially when labor is immobile. In the one-sector model, strict CPI inflation targeting is able to eliminate the welfare cost of price rigidities, with or without labor mobility. Then, I develop a vertically integrated two-sector model with nominal and real rigidities where there is a natural distinction between the rates of inflation in the final and intermediate goods sectors. In the two-sector model, the real rigidities are introduced by assuming that labor is immobile across sectors and firms. In the model, labor immobility plays an allocative role and causes large fluctuations in hours of work. This, in turn, magnifies the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. I find that the welfare costs range from 1.62 percent to 2.33 percent of consumption per period for different degree of price rigidities under an estimated Taylor rule over the Volcker and Greenspan years. Taking the household welfare under optimal (Ramsey) monetary policy as a benchmark, I show that an optimal modified Taylor rule with two measures of inflation is able to bring welfare closer to the benchmark value and reduces the welfare costs substantially, even if labor mobility is restricted.","Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Onmus-Baykal, E (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",eo57@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

It is well known that most African countries will not meet most MDGs set out in 2000 as an ambitious plan to achieve fast socio-economic progress in developing countries. This article introduces a special issue to the problematic of MDGs in Africa, progress achieved, challenges and what is missing from the MDG agenda. The article provides an overview of the situation with regards to the MDGs, with particular emphasis on the objective of reducing poverty, which is highly associated with the other MDGs. It is shown that the record in poverty reduction has been generally disappointing. Besides, the poverty reduction agenda has contributed to the fall of grand narratives of development and the demise of the idea of development as understood in the traditions of old development economics and political economy of development. The New Poverty and the MDG agendas have been relatively successful in garnering support to increase international assistance for basic needs in African countries, but are much less impressive in terms of achieved outcomes and their contribution to development strategies. The paper finally introduces the main contents of the special issue and some of the most salient critical points from a set of articles that critically engage with dominant discourses around MDGs in Africa.","Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Oya, C (通讯作者)，Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England.",co2@soas.ac.uk,,"Oya, Carlos/0000-0003-0379-6377",,,,,22,4,7,0,8,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Here the hypothesis Ho stands: The companies in tourist trade using RFID technologies are profitable and may help to its region to achieve any competitive advantage and to strengthen its economic position. In the introduction this technology is explained, subsequently there are outlined the basic principles and methods of its functioning c. the utilization of passive and active tags. Then SWOT analysis of RFID is mentioned. The essential part of the paper is a description of the practical use of RFID in tourism development - i. e. the identification of persons (entrance tickets, chip bracelets, smart ID cards, passports, etc.). Then the analysis of the standard classic identification and identification by radio frequency follows, in particular the cost analysis. The comparison of these two methods adverts to the advantages, but also to the disadvantages of RFID.

Individuals choose between starting a firm or working in one; and also between employing a traditional technology or a new technology about which little is known. In the face of ambiguity, decision-makers are either optimistic or pessimistic. We study the innovation-proof equilibria of the economy: wages clear all labor markets when agents make optimal occupational choices, and no mutually beneficial opportunity for innovation remains unexploited. In equilibrium, optimists are more likely to form firms, but also more likely to be workers in firms using the ambiguous technology. This phenomenon sheds new light on the relationship between firm culture and technology. We find that three types of firms emerge in equilibrium: entrepreneurial firms, where both owners and workers are optimists operating a highly ambiguous technology; traditional firms, where an optimistic owner employs a pessimistic worker and uses a less ambiguous technology; and bureaucratic firms where both owners and workers are pessimists employing a well-known technology. We also suggest how the relative scarcity of the optimists may help to explain the commonly observed S-shaped diffusion profile for successful innovations.","[Rigotti, Luca] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Ryan, Matthew; Vaithianathan, Rhema] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand",Duke University; University of Auckland,"Rigotti, L (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 1 Towerview Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",luca.rigotti@duke.edu,,,,,,,55,13,13,2,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The author examines the situation of a firm operating in a competitive market. The firm ought to determine an optimal time to realize a given investment project. However, it also must consider the possibility of undertaking a similar investment by a competitor, which would reduce the value of firm's investment option. The paper examines the relevance of competitive intensity for the optimal timing of investment decision, firm's strategy of financing investment project, its market value, market value and the cost of debt, which can be issued to cover investment inputs. The threat of the loss of the investment option value results in its earlier exercise. In such a case the market value of debt is lower and its cost is higher than in the case when the firm has a monopoly right to invest in a given project. Important are also links between competitive intensity, the time of option exercise and the way of investment financing. If the firm has a monopoly right to invest in the given project, the way of financing (equity or debt) significantly influences the optimal timing of investment desicions. The debt issue is an incentive to equityholders to exercise the option earlier because of the risk transfer to bondholders. Generally, the higher competitive threat, the less important is the problem how the investment could be financed (equity or debt), and timing strategies converge in both cases. Debt issue is related to agency costs of debt. They are the higher, the bigger is the threat of a comparable investment undertaken by competitor.","Uniwersytet Ekon, Katedra Matemat Stosowanej, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Rychlowska-Musial, E (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon, Katedra Matemat Stosowanej, Poznan, Poland.",elzbieta.musial@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2011,,6,,,,,795,814,,,,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,880HY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299399400002,0

Applying a systemic analysis of the variety of crisis situation concepts, the authors generalize the different crisis situation definitions found in the scientific literature and define the conception of crisis situation in a company. Though a crisis situation is often described as a negative phenomenon, however, the authors emphasize its positive influence on the further company 's performance focusing on the importance of the diagnosis of a crisis situation in its primary stage. It shows the complexity of the scientific research object. Obviously discussed object brings meaningful input to the analysis of crisis features in a company. In the paper crisis situation diagnosis has been defined as the application of different methods to unfold the features of the diagnosing phenomenon. The importance of crisis situation diagnosis in a company 's management system is huge because it lets estimating the state of a company and making decisions for further its performance. The paper aims at presenting the model of crisis situation diagnosis in a company (CSDC). The realization of the model involves three stages: analysis of the factors determining crisis situation in a company; crisis diagnosis and its depth estimation; analysis of the crisis causes, and the definition of further company 's goals and decision making. The CSDC model describes a general crisis situation diagnosis process in a company, emphasizing the necessity of a new method integrating artificial neural network (ANN) application together with the widely known traditional methods. The presented CSDC model unfolds additional advantages in a crisis diagnosis process: it enables to evaluate crisis depth in a company, to estimate crisis diagnosis results in dynamics, to use the dynamic rates which estimate internal and external environment changes and to do calculations quickly and in details. The interpretation - positivistic methodological approach has been chosen to solve the described problem what enables to reveal the subjective assessment of the phenomenon and point out the researchers ' attitude to the analyzed problems. The results of the model application have been summarized and further application perspectives as well as its improving possibilities have been pointed out. Having carried out the theoretical research and empirical analysis on the model of crisis situation diagnosis in a company, its advantages and disadvantages were emphasized.","[Sakalas, Algimantas; Virbickaite, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sakalas, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",algimantas.sakalas@ktu.lt; ruta.virbickaite@ktu.lt,,,,,,,31,6,6,2,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this article, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to demonstrate that the test's statistical size is biased in finite samples. Two complementing remedies to the related problems are proposed. One simple solution is to simulate new unbiased critical values for the ARCH-LM test. A second solution is based on the observation that for econometrics practitioners, detection of ARCH is generally followed by remedial modelling of this time-varying heteroscedasticity by the most general and robust model in the ARCH family; the Generalized ARCH (GARCH(1,1)) model. If the GARCH model's stationarity constraints are violated, as in fact is very often the case, obviously, we can conclude that ARCH-LM's detection of conditional heteroscedasticity has no or limited practical value. Therefore, formulated as a function of whether the GARCH model's stationarity constraints are satisfied or not, an unbiased and more relevant two-stage ARCH-LM test is specified. If the primary objectives of the study are to detect and remedy the problems of conditional heteroscedasticity, or to interpret GARCH parameters, the use of this article's new two-stage procedure, 2-Stage Unbiased ARCH-LM (2S-UARCH-LM), is strongly recommended.","[Sjolander, Par] Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Sjölander, P (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",Par.Sjolander@ihh.hj.se,,,,,,,28,6,6,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We reexamine the validity of purchasing power parity (PPP) from the nonparametric nonlinear point of view and provide robust evidence clearly indicating that PPP holds true for these countries.

Substantial misunderstandings can occur since this concept was labeled by different notions so far. Naturally, the same - with even higher intensity - holds true for transition/post-transition economies, Satisfactory definition of territorial marketing becomes increasingly complicated task also due to the fact that municipality/region represents much more complex unit than enterprise itself Common signs of territorial marketing can be thus found rather in used instruments, methods, concepts or common objectives. The main objective of the paper is to provide the insight into the practice of territorial marketing in the Czech Republic, which is a typical post-transition country. Our research was accomplished in the municipalities of Moravian-Silesian region, South Moravian and Vysacina regions as these NUTS Ill self-governing territories embody all principal functional characteristics of Czech regions. As it is shown, there is rather spontaneous than planned development of this concept in the Czech space. Distrust between public and private sectors, lack of finance for the accomplishment of territorial marketing, immaturity of institutions, non-coordinated regional and local development, skeptical attitude to the innovations on the one hand and non-critical acceptance of vogue conceptions on the other hand are just a sample of rather unfavorable factors plaguing Czech municipal milieu. At the same time, there exists sufficient room for the future application of selected components of territorial marketing in this country, which concerns various territorial scales. Last but not least, municipalities in the Czech Republic developed certain routines, which are often of adhoc character but which are in compliance with country's socioeconomic milieu and turned out to be efficient in the practice of territorial marketing.","[Suchacek, Jan; Sed'a, Petr] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,,jan.suchacek@vsb.cz; petr.seda@vsb.cz,"Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018; Suchacek, Jan/ABH-4495-2020","Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377; Suchacek, Jan/0000-0001-9508-6959",,,,,15,28,28,1,5,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,439,447,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200047,0

The larger the safety margin allowances, the less reliable the passenger perceived the mode to be. Stated preference questions were also used to determine the impact of travel time reliability on mode choice decisions. The second contribution of this research is the incorporation of air passenger perceived service quality in the calibration of airport ground access mode choice model. With the use of the survey data, the effects of safety margin allowances, travel time reliability, and perceived service quality on ground access mode choices to Hong Kong International Airport are quantified by a multinomial logit-type mode choice model.

Planning determinants have changed too - accent is being put on shorter planning periods, more scenarios involving active approaches involving innovation are needed. Most organizations were designed and operating for the industrial age of the past century, when capital was the scare resource, interaction costs were high and hierarchical authority and vertical integration structures were the key to efficient operation. More significant for the performance potential of the firm has become a feature on process effectiveness, seeking, drafting and management of correspondence between strategy, resources and organization in the firms. There is a need to remake the organizations of today into more adaptive, agile and focused organizations. The compliance between the dynamics of change of business environment and the tools of performance management based on strategy is today resolved using the process approach. It's also apparent that process management has become more developing and synthetic too.

This situation can be regarded as a Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (FMCDM) problem. The purpose of this study is to propose an FMCDM approach with fuzzy integral. This approach relaxes the independence assumption among criteria for the evaluation of the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problems, which is oftentimes the basic assumption in applying hierarchical system for evaluating the strategies of selecting investment style. We also employ Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) to represent the decision-makers' subjective preferences on the criteria, as well as for the criteria measurements to evaluate mutual funds investment style. To achieve this objective, first, we employ factor analysis to extract four independent common factors from those criteria. Second, we construct the evaluation frame using hierarchical system composed of four common factors with 16 evaluation criteria, and then derive the relative weights with respect to the considered criteria. Third, the synthetic utility value corresponding to each mutual fund's investment style is aggregated by the fuzzy weights with fuzzy performance values. Finally, we compare with empirical data and find that the model of FMCDM predicts the rate of return very accurately in certain ranges of lambda, hence the nonadditive fuzzy integral technique is an effective method for evaluating mutual funds' strategy.","[Wang, Shin-Yun] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, Shoufeng 974, Hualien, Taiwan; [Lee, Cheng-Few] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Lee, Cheng-Few] Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Tao Yuan 33857, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Nan Kai University Technology,"Wang, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Finance, 1,Sec 2,Da Hsueh Rd, Shoufeng 974, Hualien, Taiwan.",gracew@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,6,6,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this case, an increase in the productivity of skilled workers, and hence their wage, leads to an increase in average income and hence in benefits. The increased fallback income, in turn, makes unskilled workers ask for higher wages. As higher wages are not justified by corresponding productivity increases, unemployment rises. Generally, we show that skill-biased technological change leads to increasing unemployment of the unskilled and to a moderately increasing wage inequality when benefits are endogenous. The model provides a theoretical explanation for diverging dynamics in wage inequality and unemployment under different social benefits regimes. Analysing the social legislation in 14 countries, we find that benefits are linked to the evolution of average income in Continental Europe but not in the US and the UK. Given this institutional difference, our model predicts that skill-biased technological change leads to rising unemployment in Continental Europe and rising wage inequality in the US and the UK.","[Weiss, Matthias] Univ Mannheim, MEA, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Garloff, Alfred] IAB Hessen, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Weiss, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, MEA, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",weiss@mea.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,37,20,23,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, we analyze how horizontal fairness concerns affect performance and efficiency in an environment characterized by contractual incompleteness. In our experiment, one principal is matched with two agents. The principal pays equal wages in one treatment and can set individual wages in the other. We find that the use of equal wages elicits substantially lower efforts. This is not caused by monetary incentives per se because under both wage schemes it is profit-maximizing for agents to exert high efforts. The treatment difference instead seems to be driven by the fact that the norm of equity is violated far more frequently in the equal wage treatment. After having suffered from violations of the equity principle, agents withdraw effort. These findings hold even after controlling for the role of intentions, as we show in a third treatment. Our results suggest that adherence to the norm of equity is a necessary prerequisite for successful establishment of gift-exchange relations.

In so doing, he offers not only a socialist vision but also asks questions that may challenge Hayekian liberals to reformulate their institutional analyses. A critical assessment that combines Austrian and institutional theories leads to the conclusion that some redistributive policies may enhance the knowledge-disseminating function of markets, but that a market order that is limited to worker-managed firms diminishes the knowledge dissemination properties of the market process.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Publ Affairs Management, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Andersson, DE (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Publ Affairs Management, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",david@faculty.nsysu.edu.tw,"Andersson, David Emanuel/E-1221-2013; Andersson, David Emanuel/G-8471-2013","Andersson, David Emanuel/0000-0003-3572-8846; Andersson, David Emanuel/0000-0002-1640-1314",,,,,32,0,0,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

Agents derive utility from two types of consumption goods-one which relies on a natural resource input and one which does not-as well as from leisure and from natural resource amenity values. We connect second best policy to essential components of utility by considering the elasticity of substitution among each of the four utility arguments. The results illustrate potentially important relationships between amenity values and leisure. When amenity values are complementary with leisure, for instance when natural resources are used for recreation, optimal taxes on goods produced with natural resources generally increase over time. On the other hand, optimal taxes on goods produced from natural resources generally decrease over time when leisure and amenity values are substitutes. Under some parameterizations, complex dynamics leading to non-monotonic time paths can emerge.","[Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Gorostiaga, Arantza; Jose Gutierrez, Maria] Univ Basque Country, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Hamilton, Stephen F.] Cal Poly State Univ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Kansas State University; University of Basque Country; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Cassou, SP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",scassou@ksu.edu; arantza.gorostiaga@ehu.es; mariajose.gutierrez@ehu.es; shamilto@calpoly.edu,"Gorostiaga, Arantza/Z-5483-2019; Gutiérrez, María-José/C-1141-2009","Gorostiaga, Arantza/0000-0001-5540-5396; Gutiérrez, María-José/0000-0003-3074-0854",,,,,32,1,1,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In a cross section of countries over the period 1960-2000, findings reveal that, all other things being equal, a greater degree of human capital inequality increases fertility rates and reduces life expectancy, which in turn hampers the accumulation rates of human capital. This effect is reinforced in the countries where individuals find it difficult to access credit.

Under asymmetric preferences, a central banker places different weights on the losses associated with positive and negative deviations of economic variables such as inflation or output from their target values. Although asymmetry is conventionally estimated by the generalized method of moments, we use the bias correction Kalman filter suggested by Kim (2006), introducing the concept of time-varying asymmetry in central bank preferences. Estimates of the interest rate reaction functions suggest asymmetries in preferences for both output gap and interest rate. These asymmetries indicate that the ECB increases its interest rate aggressively when there is a surge in output but does not sustain an interest rate above its reference value.

Leverage rises during expansions, and when it rises enough it triggers the constraint, causing a Fisherian deflation that reduces credit and the price and quantity of collateral assets.

Although our finding of an inverse relationship between growth and political instability may seem to contradict Olson's (1982a) famous hypothesis regarding the growth retarding nature of political stability, such constitutional political changes were not primarily what Olson had in mind. We argue that enhanced political turnover is associated with more rent-seeking since payoffs to focusing on special interest (redistributive) policies vs. general (growth enhancing) ones are greater for less durable regimes.

First, we show that the true parameter value is set-identified and characterize the identification sets. Second, we propose novel estimation and inference methods for this true value. These estimation and inference methods are of independent interest and apply to any problem possessing the sensitivity structure, where the true parameter value is point-identified conditional on some nuisance parameter values that are set-identified. By fixing the nuisance parameter value in some suitable region, we can proceed with regular point and interval estimation. Then we take the union over nuisance parameter values of the point and interval estimates to form the final set estimates and confidence set estimates. The initial point or interval estimates can be frequentist or Bayesian. The final set estimates are set-consistent for the true parameter value, and confidence set estimates have frequentist validity in the sense of covering this value with at least a prespecified probability in large samples. Our procedure may be viewed as a formalization of the sensitivity analysis in the sense of Leamer (1985). We apply our identification, estimation, and inference procedures to study the effects of changes in housing wealth on household consumption.

Our model specification encompasses all mean-reverting stochastic volatility option pricing models with a constant-elasticity of variance and those allowing for price jumps under stochastic volatility. Our approach is made possible by linking the latent volatility to the VIX index via a new theoretical relationship under the risk-neutral measure. Because option prices are not directly used in estimation, we can avoid the computational burden associated with option valuation for stochastic volatility/jump option pricing models. Our empirical findings are: (1) incorporating a jump risk factor is critically important; (2) the jump and volatility risks are priced; (3) the popular square-root stochastic volatility process is a poor model specification irrespective of allowing for price jumps or not. Our simulation study shows that statistical inference is reliable and not materially affected by the approximation used in the VIX index construction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, these reforms require a legal and functional unbundling of vertically integrated companies. These unbundling processes may reduce the possibilities that exist to fruitfully exploit the advantages of vertical integration. The goal of this paper is to empirically analyze the presence of economies of scale and vertical integration in the Swiss electricity sector. Economies of vertical integration between electricity production and distribution result from reduced transaction costs, better coordination of highly specific and interdependent investments and less financial risk. Different econometric specifications for panel data, including a random effects and a random-coefficients model, have been used to estimate a quadratic multi-stage cost function for a sample of electricity companies. The empirical results reflect the presence of considerable economies of vertical integration and economies of scale for most of the companies considered in the analysis. Moreover, the results suggest a variation in economies of vertical integration across companies due to unobserved heterogeneity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The first main finding is that the wage elasticity of labour demand has increased substantially since 1980, although some of this increase may reflect a trend increase in the speed of adjustment rather than an increase in the long-run wage elasticity. The evidence on the potential contribution of offshoring to raising labour demand elasticity is mixed. No association is found between increases in offshoring and demand elasticity during the second half of the 1990s, but there is a significant cross-sectional association between higher average offshoring intensity during this period and higher demand elasticity. We also find some evidence that strict employment protection legislation weakens the cross-sectional association between offshoring and higher labour demand elasticity, suggesting that the relationship between offshoring and the labour demand elasticity may depend on the national institutional environment.

The demand for oil is divided in a speculative component and a real component. Speculators are boundedly rational in forming price expectations. Expectations are formed by one of two boundedly rational rules of thumb: fundamentalist and chartist. While fundamentalists trade on mean-reversion, chartists follow the trend in prices. Speculators then choose between these rules based on past profitability. Estimation results on Brent and WTI oil reveal that both groups are active in the oil market, and that speculators often switch between the groups. The model outperforms both the random walk and VAR models in out-of-sample forecasting. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[ter Ellen, Saskia; Zwinkels, Remco C.

The dynamics implied by the optimal incentive scheme is rich and quite different from that induced by other models of repeated moral hazard. In particular, our framework generates a rationale for firm decline. As young firms accumulate capital, the claims of both investor (outside equity) and entrepreneur (inside equity) increase. At some juncture, however, even as the latter continues to grow, invested capital and firm value start declining and so does the value of outside equity. The reason is that incentive provision is costlier the wealthier the entrepreneur (the greater is inside equity). In turn, this leads to a decline in the constrained-efficient level of effort and therefore to a drop in the return to investment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

National transplant organizations exhibit considerable differences in terms of their donor population rates. Spain's organization is by far the most efficient in this respect. We argue that much of the productivity advantage of Spain's transplant organization proceeds from an efficient organization of the production chain, from organ procurement to transplantation. Transplants from dead donors are analogous to a common resource for the transplant community. Their circulation through the national transplant organization creates public good externalities between the care units in charge of organ retrieval and those in charge of transplantation. A socially efficient production of transplant care services obtains through an optimal control, by the national transplant agency, of both the circulation and the production of transplants. In particular, transplant shortage makes the rotten kid theorem fail in this context. The analysis also produces a natural measure of public good externalities, evaluated from the standpoint of care units. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These two concerns, however, may conflict in a dynamic setting. Anticipating the regulator's future desire to give more permits to firms that appear to need them, firms purchase permits to signal their need. This raises the price above marginal costs and the market becomes inefficient. If the social cost of pollution is high and the government intervenes frequently in the market, the distortions are greater than the gains from trade and non-tradable permits are better.

Under the assumption of time-separable expected utility and complete markets all equilibria in this model are stationary. The Arrow-Debreu prices uniquely reveal the probabilities and discount factor. The equilibrium correspondence, defined as the map from endowments to stationary (probability-free) state prices, is identical to the equilibrium correspondence in a standard Arrow-Debreu exchange economy with additively separable utility. We examine possible restriction on this correspondence and give necessary as well as sufficient conditions on profiles of individual endowments that ensure that associated equilibrium prices cannot be arbitrary. Although restrictions on possible price changes often exist, we show that results from a representative-agent economy usually do not carry over to a setting with heterogeneous agents.","[Schmedders, Karl] Univ Zurich, Inst Operat Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kubler, Felix; Schmedders, Karl] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kubler, Felix] Univ Zurich, Swiss Banking Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Zurich,"Schmedders, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Operat Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",kubler@isb.uzh.ch; karl.schmedders@ior.uzh.ch,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Such effects are not observed when costs are asymmetric, since asymmetries provide a tacit coordination cue used by experienced players (as a substitute to communication).

This topology generalizes the now classic notion of proximity to common knowledge based on common p-beliefs (Monderer and Samet 1989). We show that convergence in the uniform-weak topology implies convergence in the uniform-strategic topology (Dekel et al. 2006). Moreover, when the limit is a finite type, uniform-weak convergence is also a necessary condition for convergence in the strategic topology.

Aggregate productivity and distribution risks are transferred across these agents via the bond market and via an efficient labor contract. The result is a combination of volatile returns to capital and a highly cyclical consumption process for the shareholders, which are two important ingredients for generating high and countercyclical risk premiums. These risk premiums are consistent with a strong propagation mechanism through an elastic supply of labor, rigid real wages and a countercyclical labor share. Based on the empirical estimates for the two sources of real macroeconomic risk, the model generates significant and plausible time variation in both bond and equity risk premiums. Interestingly, the single largest jump in both the risk premium and the price of risk is observed during the current recession. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Power measures have traditionally been based on current earnings, but earnings are determined by past/present time use decisions and hence potentially endogenous. More powerful individuals have been hypothesized to spend less time on housework, however, housework time also depends upon relative preferences for home produced goods and relative productivity in home production. Gendered notions of time use and censored earnings and time data also pose problems. We propose examining leisure time and exploring alternative measures of power less prone to endogeneity bias in order to address these theoretical and empirical concerns. Our results indicate that leisure time is more consistently and significantly associated with 'power' than housework time and that education share performs quite well as a measure of power. These results are particularly strong on non-work days and in the United States.","[Stratton, Leslie S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, CIM, IZA, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Gupta, Nabanita Datta] Aarhus Univ, CIM, IZA, Aarhus Sch Business, DK-8230 Aabyhoej, Denmark",Virginia Commonwealth University; Aarhus University,"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, CIM, IZA, 301 W Main St,POB 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",ndg@asb.dk; lsstratt@vcu.edu,"Datta Gupta, Nabanita/JXN-4176-2024","Datta Gupta, Nabanita/0000-0001-7904-445X",,,,,37,19,22,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

However, surprisingly no study has examined the economic effects of child disability in the Australian context. This paper attempts to quantify the link between a child's disability and the work behaviour of the female in the affected family. Our findings provide empirical justifications for the current policy linking the severity level of child disability to the assessment of eligibility for Carer Payment (Child). We also found that child disability has different impacts on the labour market activities of married women and non-married women. It appears that child disability imposes a greater hardship on non-married women than on married women in terms of work choice decision. Once non-married women manage to enter the labour force, they may have to stay on to work as usual even if they have a disabled child, because they may not have other family members to turn to for help as married women do.","[Lu, Zeng-Hua] Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, CRMA, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of South Australia,"Lu, ZH (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, CRMA, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",zen.lu@unisa.edu.au,"Zuo, Alec/AAU-3394-2020; Zuo, Alec/F-4562-2013; Lu, Zen/F-3737-2013","Zuo, Alec/0000-0003-0425-4633; Lu, Zen/0000-0003-3837-6516",,,,,20,8,9,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Based on the Solow growth theory with technology spillovers, a Spatial Durbin growth model recently developed is employed to capture the spatial externalities. We find strong evidence of positive spatial dependence between Chinese prefectures after 1991. Apart from the usual divergence conclusions, we find evidence for significant conditional convergence force when the spatial spillover effects are controlled. Our results also indicate the competition effect of capital accumulation and urbanization growth among neighboring regions.

Is this because they are less productive than equivalent younger workers? This paper uses data from a 2007 census of residential aged care homes in Australia to examine the productivity differentials of workers at different ages. We estimate production functions that take into account the age profile of the workforce in each aged care residential facility. We find that for the facilities having high care residents only, the productivity of nurses, whose work is more demanding of specialist knowledge, keeps increasing with age while the rate of increase declines after age 50. In contrast, the productivity of carers, whose work is more demanding of physical capacity, is highest in middle age. The facilities with low care residents only provide a much lower level of services because their residents are less frail and more independent. In this case, none of the coefficients regarding the impacts of age on productivity is statistically significant - suggesting that older workers are good substitutes for younger ones.","[Wei, Zhang] Flinders Univ S Australia, Fac Social Sci, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Wei, Z (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Fac Social Sci, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Room 3111,Social Sci N Bldg,GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",zhang.wei@flinders.edu.au,"Wei, Zhang/JSK-6014-2023",,,,,,20,3,5,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

This causes negative growth effects in poor developing countries. The reduced growth has a direct or indirect impact on the convergence issue, aid, remittances, labour force growth, investment and savings, net foreign debt, migration, tax revenues, public expenditure on education and literacy. We estimate dynamic equations of all these variables using dynamic panel data methods for a panel of countries with per capita income below $1200 (2000). The estimated equations are then integrated to a dynamic system of thirteen equations for thirteen variables that allows for highly non-linear baseline simulations for these open economies. Then we analyze the effects of transitional shocks as predicted by the international organizations for the OECD and world growth for 2008 and 2009. Whereas growth rates return to the baseline scenario until 2013 with overshooting for China and Australia, the level of the GDP per capita shows permanent effects, which are positive only for China. In the poor countries, investment, remittances, savings, tax revenues, public expenditure on education, all as a share of GDP as well as literacy and the GDP per capita, are reduced compared to the baseline until 2087 where our analysis ends. Investment, emigration and labour force growth start returning to baseline values between 2013 and 2017. GDP per capita and tax revenues start returning to baseline around 2040. Education variables do not return to baseline without additional effort. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ziesemer, Thomas H.

It is shown that the foundation of Baumol's classification scheme is the restrictive concept of first-best outcomes, and therefore it easily fails to appreciate the true impact of entrepreneurship in real-world circumstances characterized by suboptimal institutions. We present an alternative way of generalizing the notion of entrepreneurship and show how and why it encompasses the Baumol typology as a special case. Our main distinction is between business and institutional entrepreneurship. We draw on Schumpeter and introduce the entrepreneur in an additional function: as a potential disturber of an institutional equilibrium. Various subsets of institutional entrepreneurship are posited and discussed. It is shown that changing the workings of institutions constitutes an important set of entrepreneurial profit opportunities. An implication of this is that entrepreneurial efforts to reform or offset inefficient institutions can, in many cases, be welfare-improving.","[Douhan, Robin; Henrekson, Magnus] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Douhan, Robin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Uppsala University,"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.henrekson@ifn.se,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",,,,,42,72,76,3,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using data envelopment analysis to measure operating efficiency, we examine 73 utilities in the period 1994-2003 and find that the major divestitures that were required by state regulators had large adverse effects on efficiency, whereas utilities that divested at their own initiative had at worst neutral efficiency outcomes.

The second is the recent developments of various, mostly applied, research programs addressing the drivers, the mechanism and the consequences of EI in particular at the micro- and meso-economic level.

Yet for most of the developing world no internationally comparable estimates of cognitive skills exist. This paper uses student answers to publicly released questions from an international testing agency together with statistical methods from Item Response Theory to place secondary students from two Indian states-Orissa and Rajasthan-on a worldwide distribution of mathematics achievement. These two states fall below 43 of the 51 countries for which data exist. The bottom 5% of children rank higher than the bottom 5% in only three countries-South Africa, Ghana and Saudi Arabia. But not all students test poorly. Inequality in the test-score distribution for both states is next only to South Africa. The combination of India's size and large variance in achievement give both the perceptions that India is shining even as Bharat, the vernacular for India, is drowning. How India's development unfolds will depend critically on how the skill distribution evolves and how low- and high-skilled workers interact in the labor market. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that financial market integration, i.e. moving from segmented towards complete financial markets, results in different monetary policy objectives, namely stabilizing domestic goods prices as opposed to stabilizing the nominal exchange rate. Thus, the welfare ranking of different exchange rate rules can change in the process of international financial integration. It becomes evident that no single exchange rate regime outperforms the others in stabilizing both domestic consumption and output variability in the process of financial market integration.","Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Hoffmann, M (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",mathias.hoffmann@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In contrast to previous work, the empirical analysis takes explicit account of the possibility of (multiple) structural breaks in the underlying time series. We establish strong evidence of structural breaks, particularly along the years 2007 and 2008, suggesting the very relevant impact of the recent global crisis on CEE economies. Moreover, our results suggest that the way how countries react to world commodity price shocks is related to the underlying economic structure and the credibility of the monetary policy. We also find that some countries like Slovakia and Slovenia - already euro area members - react stronger to foreign industrial production shocks than other countries and that the responses to such shocks are strongly correlated for selected CEE countries. Nevertheless, our results also shed light on substantial differences in responses to foreign interest rate shocks that originate from the US or the euro area. (C) 2010 Society for Policy Modeling.

It is first shown that a tax innovation, such as the introduction of a VAT, reduces the marginal cost of public funds if and only if it also leads an optimizing government to increase the tax ratio. This leads to the estimation, on a panel of 143 countries for 25 years. of a system describing both the probability of VAT adoption and the revenue impact of the VAT. The results point to a rich set of determinants of VAT adoption, and to a significant but complex impact on the revenue ratio. The estimates suggest, very tentatively, that most countries which have adopted a VAT have thereby gained a more effective tax instrument, though this is less apparent in sub-Saharan Africa.

Considering a sample of Italian hospitals, we provide fresh evidence on the factor substitutability in the production of hospital services. Differently from other studies, based on North-American data and limited to pre-determined cost function models, we estimate a general specification (the Generalised Composite), and test it against traditional nested models (e.g. the Translog). For all the specifications we derive Allen, Morishima and Shadow elasticities of substitution between input pairs, obtaining a fairly consistent picture across all models and elasticity concepts. In particular, our results highlight a very limited degree of substitutability between factors in the production of hospital services, especially between beds and medical staff. These findings suggest that a restructuring policy of the hospital industry, which is confined to reducing the number of beds without involving workforce management, could not be a viable strategy for controlling public health care expenditure.

This is not surprising because most former Catholic colonies had a number of restrictions to the operation of Protestant missionaries that benefited Catholic missionaries. Therefore, our results are consistent with an economic rationale in which different rules created differences in competitive pressures faced by Catholic and Protestant missionaries.","[Gallego, Francisco A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Woodberry, Robert] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Gallego, FA (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",fgallego@alum.mit.edu,"Gallego, Francisco/E-5485-2015","Gallego, Francisco/0000-0002-2252-891X",,,,,47,87,102,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In the framework proposed, number sequences are technological objects ('tools') that are constituted by both form and function. To do their job, number sequences have to have the necessary internal structure - all elements (e. g. symbols) of the sequence must be distinct from one another, and the sequence must be a progression. In addition, numerical toolkits have to have the right external structure - they must be situated in a social network of economic agents that confers on them quantitative functions (e. g. identifying set sizes). Number sequences are the product of multilevel evolutionary processes, including psychological selection that screens sequences for their learnability by human users. Number tools are a kind of capital; they are material systems that are as real as other everyday objects. Just as changing physical tools alters the structure of productive activity, so too changing number sequences alters cognitive, behavioral, and social routines.","NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Harper, DA (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",David.Harper@nyu.edu,"Harper, David A/U-3706-2018","Harper, David A/0000-0002-4716-3638",,,,,84,5,5,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

The mean group method also accounts for dynamic heterogeneity across goods. Impulse response functions are obtained to calculate half-lives. With both methods, we find half-lives of only a few months or less, supporting the conjecture that convergence rates within a country are faster than rates estimated in an international context.

This paper empirically studies the association between offshoring, productivity, and plant characteristics by focusing on the geographical dimension of plants' business activities. Using data from Statistics Canada's Survey of Innovation 2005 and Annual Surveys of Manufacturers, we show that material offshoring is strongly associated with firms' outward-oriented business activities (including foreign operation, investing in foreign M&E, and exporting), even after controlling for geographic advantages and industry- and plant-specific effects. For R&D offshoring, we find that it is mainly associated with investment in foreign M&E. In addition, this paper shows that material offshoring is positively associated with productivity and that the association is significantly larger for material offshoring to Asia Pacific countries than for material offshoring to the U.S. and other locations.","[Tang, Jianmin; do Livramento, Henrique] Ind Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada",,"Tang, JM (通讯作者)，Ind Canada, 235 Queen St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada.",jianmin.tang@ic.gc.ca,"JIANMIN, TANG/JBS-6054-2023","JIANMIN, TANG/0000-0001-6091-9682",,,,,22,9,9,1,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

A theoretically consistent parameterization of the virtual relative price of imports circumvents the data problem, and thus enables the estimation of income and price responses by cointegration approach.

Threshold regression models are intuitively appealing methods to deal with this issue. We consider a fixed-effect panel data stochastic frontier model (Schmidt and Sickles, 1984; Martin-Marcos and Suarez-Galvez, 2000) and, relying on Hansen (1999, 2000a), we propose an estimator that accommodates multiple thresholds. Our model assumes absence of any unmeasured time invariant heterogeneity across firms as in Greene (2005, p. 277). Slope and threshold parameters can be estimated using a within estimator combined with a grid search over the threshold parameters. Testing for threshold effects is problematic because threshold parameters are not identified under the null hypothesis, a case of the so-called Davies' problem. We apply the bootstrap procedure proposed by Hansen (1999, 2000a) to test for the presence of thresholds. An asymptotic confidence set for the threshold parameter can be obtained by inverting an LR test, using the distribution result presented in Hansen (1999, 2000a). Our empirical application features a panel of Quebec dairy farms. We use farm size as the threshold variable. The presence of a trend in the specification matters for the determination of the number of thresholds. Technical efficiency scores and rankings of farms estimated from competing model specifications are highly correlated and do not vary significantly across groups of farm sizes defined by the threshold parameter values.

The training program we focus on is BRAC's Adolescent Development Program, which emphasizes the provision of life skills, entrepreneurship training, and microfinance. We find that girls who are more likely to benefit from the program are more likely to intend to participate. The program attracts girls who are likely to place a high value on financial independence: single mothers and girls who are alienated from their families. The program attracts girls who are more likely to benefit from training: girls who believe they could be successful entrepreneurs but currently lack the quantitative skills to do so. Reassuringly, girls who are in school full-time are less likely to intend to participate. We also find that the program attracts girls from poorer villages but we find no evidence that poorer girls within each village are more likely to want to participate.

The basic Mortensen-Pissarides model does not generate nearly enough volatility in unemployment for plausible parameter values. This paper extends the Mortensen-Pissarides model to allow for informational rents. Productivity is subject to publicly observed aggregate shocks, and to idiosyncratic shocks that are seen only by the employer. It is shown that there is a unique equilibrium, provided that the idiosyncratic shocks are not too large. The main result is that small fluctuations in productivity that are privately observed by employers can give rise to a kind of wage stickiness in equilibrium, and the informational rents associated with this stickiness are sufficient to generate relatively large unemployment fluctuations.","[Kennan, John] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kennan, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kennan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,,27,42,55,1,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This paper hypothesises that the provision of productive public goods (or lack of it) is a pathway that helps understand these different outcomes when policy choices are made under the threat of conflict inherent in resource-rich countries. Facing potential conflict over resources, a self-interested ruler may choose to invest in either military repression or in productive public goods-physical and social infrastructure. While both measures aim at preventing conflict, we show theoretically that the optimal policy choice depends on the relative effectiveness of the ruler and the population in contesting the resources. Increased resource wealth provides a disincentive to invest in development if the ruler is more effective than the population in appropriating the resources. Conversely, if the ruler is relatively ineffective, more resource wealth induces higher levels of public goods. We present empirical evidence consistent with the predictions of the model for a sample of 57 countries over three decades. Thus, we provide and test empirically a conditional resource curse theory, postulating that the relative effectiveness of the contenders plays a crucial role in determining whether resources are a curse or a blessing.","[Sarr, Mare] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Sarr, Mare] Univ Cape Town, Environm Policy Res Unit, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Wick, Katharina] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Sarr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",mare.sarr@uct.ac.za; katharina.wick@boku.ac.at,,"Sarr, Mare/0000-0002-5903-7102",,,,,33,21,22,2,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We assume that the ECB's monetary policy stance is in line with a Taylor rule and based on the overall situation in the Euro area, more specifically on the Euro area inflation rate and the overall business cycle position in the area. The question therefore boils down to investigating whether inflation and business cycles have converged since the start of the monetary union. We show that the ECB, if in existence in the 1990s, would have had an impossible task. This is because inflation and business cycles still strongly differed in that time, although convergence substantially increased in the run up to the monetary union. In this respect, the decade under EMU drastically differs from the preceding one. This being said, the evidence for a further improvement in the course of the first decade of the new millennium is mixed. This is because although inflation has further converged, business cycles have shown a tendency for increased divergence. If, however, we are willing to put weights on inflation and output gap divergence (as implied by the Taylor rule), we conclude that also in the course of the period under EMU in general the ECB's monetary policy has become more in line with the needs of the individual members. Looking at individual countries, we show that during the first decade of its existence the ECB's interest rate was most fitted to the needs of France and Italy, and least to the needs of Ireland and Greece (both too low) and Germany (too high). To a lesser extent there were also mismatches for Spain and Portugal (both too low). In the more recent period since 2005, the mismatch between the desired domestic interest rate and the desired ECB rate has come down for most countries (most noticeable Germany).

The IAH specifies that immigrants acquire destination relevant human capital, but at a decreasing rate, with duration in the destination. Hence, ceteris paribus, earnings would be expected to increase, at a decreasing rate, with duration. The true assimilation effects may be obscured, however, in analyses of synthetic cohort or panel (longitudinal) data if there are period effects. That is, if the effect on earnings of duration in the destination varies over time. The empirical analysis uses a matched sample of adult male immigrants from the 1983 and 1995 Censuses of Israel. The matched data show that selective exit from the labor force (due to death, absence from the labor force, and inability to match, but not the remigration of immigrants) is associated with lower earnings in 1983. This biases upward the earnings assimilation estimated by the synthetic cohort method. The earnings data are also consistent with the hypothesis that the mass immigration to Israel from 1989 to 1995 raised the return (price) to Israeli-specific human capital among long-duration immigrants sufficiently to more than offset the greater increase in units of destination human capital acquired by more recent immigrants. As a result, long-duration immigrants experienced a steeper increase in earnings from 1983 to 1995. This annulled the true assimilation effects from 1983 to 1995. Longitudinal tests of IAH which assume that the returns to destination-specific skills remained constant (i.e., that there are no period effects) are biased against supporting the IAH if these returns increased.","[Chiswick, Barry R.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Beenstock, Michael] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Chiswick, Barry R.] Inst Study Labor, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Paltiel, Ari] Cent Bur Stat, Jerusalem, Israel",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Chiswick, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",msbin@pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il; brchis@uic.edu; ari@cbs.gov.il,,,,,,,29,25,25,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This condition, which imposes a restriction on the behavior of the one-sided directional derivatives of the valuation functions with respect to individual types, is also shown to be sufficient and necessary to obtain the Payoff Equivalence principle for dominant strategy mechanisms whose choice rules are affine maximizers.

Such dual tax regimes exist in Norway for oil and hydropower, where the corresponding special purpose tax bases are unaffected by any derivatives payments. Dual tax firms with hedging programs therefore face the risk of potentially large discrepancies between the tax bases for corporate income tax and special purpose tax. I investigate how this tax base asymmetry influences the extent of hedging of value-maximizing firms facing hedgeable as well as unhedgeable risk. Dual tax firms facing deadweight costs in low-profit events generally demand less hedging than ordinary firms, but otherwise respond similarly to characteristics of the underlying risk exposures.

He advises us on how organization economics can shed substantial light on some of the most pressing social problems of the day. I comment on two of the areas he selects for discussion and offer some comments on the relationship of organization economics to new institutional economics. Judge Posner surely is right to argue that organization economics can help us understand the failures of corporate governance in regulating executive pay. Moreover, with additional and more institutionally nuanced theorizing, organizational economics should further our understanding of the work of judiciaries in the civilian and common law traditions. Judge Posner tells us that organization economics and new institutional economics are related fields. I make a plea for economic holism. Organizations are institutions. While getting clear on disciplinary boundaries and the differing kinds and concepts of institutions is important, logical differences in concepts like 'organization' and 'institution' may be less important than what to emphasize in theory construction and what to test for with those theories. The success of organization economics will be in whether the different emphases produce new insights. Judge Posner is right to tell us that new insights are coming and will continue to come from organization economics.

In this article, we consider a hybrid version of stare decisis, called by the French name of jurisprudence constante, adopted by mixed jurisdictions. Unlike stare decisis, which allows a single precedent to establish case law, the doctrine of jurisprudence constante links the recognition of a judge-made rule to the existence of a consecutive line of decisions affirming the same legal principle. We develop a model to consider the effects of this doctrine on the social costs arising from judicial error and uncertainty in case law.

There is significant over-dissipation in both stages of the two-stage contest and experience diminishes over-dissipation in the first stage but not in the second stage. Our experiment provides evidence that winning is a component in a Subject's utility.

For domestic supply shocks, a joint policy of a flexible exchange rate and strict inflation targeting fares well when the main source of nominal rigidities is in the domestic goods markets, but not if rigidities arise in the labor markets.","[Dellas, Harris] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Cuche-Curti, Nicolas A.; Natal, Jean-Marc] Swiss Natl Bank, SNB, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cuche-Curti, Nicolas A.] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Dellas, Harris] CEPR, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of St Gallen,"Dellas, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",nicolas.cuche-curti@snb.ch; harris.dellas@vwi.unibe.ch; jean-marc.natal@snb.ch,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Under rational expectations, international debt follows a random walk. Under adaptive learning, however, the model's unit root is eliminated and international debt is either a stationary or an explosive process, depending on agents' specific learning algorithm. Some stationary learning algorithms result in debt following an AR(1) process with an autoregressive coefficient less than 0.8. Because unit roots are a common and problematic feature of many international business cycle models, our results offer a new approach for generating stationarity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Each of three neighbouring regions is endowed with a stock of waste, but no additional waste is generated in any region and waste does not decay from natural reasons. A region's stock of waste can be reduced only by dumping on its neighbours. The model features two externalities: a strategic externality caused by the fact that the payoff of a coalition depends on the actions of players outside the coalition, and a stock externality caused by the fixed overall amount of waste. The game has a finite time horizon and it is shown that intertemporal core-theoretic cooperation can be sustained under intuitive conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we extend the manager-shareholder conflict problem in a real options model by incorporating debt financing. We show that manager-shareholder conflicts over investment policy increase not only the investment and default triggers but also coupon payments, which lead to a decrease in the equity value. Moreover, given the presence of manager-shareholder conflicts, debt financing increases investment and decreases total social welfare. As a result, there is a trade-off between the efficiency of investment and total social welfare with debt financing. These results fit well with the findings of previous empirical work in this area.

I apply several techniques in the extensive mathematical literature of stochastic optimal control/dynamic programming to derive an optimal debt in an environment where there are risks on both the asset and liabilities sides. The vulnerability of the borrowing firm to shocks from either the return to capital, the interest rate or capital gain, increases in proportion to the difference between the Actual and Optimal debt ratio, called the excess debt. As the debt ratio exceeds the optimum, default becomes ever more likely. This paper is A Tale of Two Crises because the same analysis is applied to the agricultural debt crisis of the 1980s and to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007.

Second, we aggregate the results obtained through filtering techniques in a consensus estimate, ascribing to each method a weight inversely related to its revision stability. The results suggest for the period 2001-2008 an average annual growth rate of the potential output equal to 5.8%, but on a descending slope, due to the adverse developments in the macroeconomic context.","[Altar, Moisa] Acad Econ Studies, DOFIN, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Altar, M (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, DOFIN, Bucharest, Romania.",maltar@ase.ro,"Necula, Ciprian/AAM-6491-2020; Bobeica, Gabriel/B-6771-2011","Necula, Ciprian/0000-0002-8809-3605",,,,,45,17,17,0,11,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We examine the trade-off between these two types of costs by examining the proportion of time that the quoted spread equals the minimum tick size (PTIMEMIN). We undertake this analysis on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a market that sets nine different tick sizes based on stock price. PTIMEMIN varies markedly across stocks, ranging from almost 0 to almost 100 percent. We find that trade size, the number of trades, and price are the most important determinants of whether the minimum tick size is a binding constraint. In fact, trade size and number of trades are more significant determinants of tick size constraint than price. Consequently, we argue that tick size should be set based on trading activity and price, rather than price alone. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The model follows the standard factor endowment approach to explain the effects of environmental regulatory policy on net exports in different product-based industries. An econometric model is constructed, which includes factor endowments and environmental regulations to examine how strict environmental policies impact export competitiveness. A panel dataset of 10 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, over 17 years, 1987-2003, was constructed for the modelling effort. The study finds that environmental regulations can be a way to combat the flight of manufacturing out of developed countries if the output from these industries can be identified as environmentally friendly. A positive relationship between net exports and environmental regulations was found for paper products, wood products and textile products. However, most manufacturing industries are harmed by increased environmental regulations.","[Babool, Ashfaqul; Reed, Michael] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40536 USA",University of Kentucky,"Reed, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40536 USA.",mrreed@uky.edu,,,,,,,25,11,13,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

But the presence of a cointegrated relationship is not enough to support PPP, as other restrictions must be met as well. Nevertheless, even simple cointegration has been rejected for many countries in previous studies. We apply the 'bounds testing' approach of Pesaran et al. (2001), which has only seen limited use thus far, to analyse 123 countries' bilateral rates with the United States. Besides testing for cointegration, we also assess whether our long-run coefficients support the PPP hypothesis. We find that while most rates are indeed cointegrated, only a few have coefficients that meet even one of the necessary restrictions for PPP.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen; Hegerty, Scott W.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu,"Hegerty, Scott/AAF-5659-2020",,,,,,20,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Since shocks to the economy affect employment across multiple occupations, we employ a new approach to assess the vulnerability of jobs due to such shocks by measuring how diversified an occupation is across sectors. Using U.S. employment data between the years 1999 and 2005, which include the downturn in the aftermath of the internet bust and the subsequent recovery, we find that an occupation spread across multiple industries is less volatile in terms of both numbers employed and the average wage. The result is robust to occupation size. Including various measures of an occupation's 'footloose' nature and geographical mobility does not affect the results. The evidence presented distills a key lesson from a previous downturn and recovery, and could improve our understanding of issues relating to business cycles, offshoring and higher education.","[Bardhan, Ashok] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tang, John] US Bur Census, Washington, DC USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bardhan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bardhan@haas.berkeley.edu; jptang@gmail.com,"Tang, John/AAN-7966-2020","Tang, John/0000-0003-1669-4249",,,,,24,9,10,0,9,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

It focuses on experience with the notion of the assessment of so called direct benefits associated with the investments rather than the estimation of the indirect ones in context of so popular in practice cost-benefit analysis generating a huge literature in its own right. Raising the issues of validity of the intervention of governments into economics in terms of social justice, the concept of public alternative costs is discussed. Concluding that the inadequate usage of public resources for the formation and development of highway infrastructure may have negative consequences on the dynamics and tendencies of the development of other economic sectors, the question of an adequate, socially and economically reasonable assessment of development is raised. Despite the fact that the cost-benefit analysis is the method by which this concept of efficiency can be applied to publicly supplied good it lacks clarity. In fact, the intangible costs and benefits never enter the analysis. It is suited only for ranking courses of action designed to attain the same ends so the real benefits of decisions will be speculative and uncertain. Taking into account the complexity of the interaction the authors of the article focus on the research of the methodological framework of the evaluation of the benefits of the public in the result highway system modification. The research is based on the improvement of the simplified general equilibrium model which focuses at the price effects of direct changes in transport costs and their measurement. The research results may answer the question if the accomplishment of tasks set for the system or its parts meet the society ( which uses or is a neighbor to that infrastructure) needs. Other aspects are going to be excluded from this initial investigation.

Moreover, an often expressed concern is that policies enhancing mobility may boost tax competition. We analyze these questions using a model where countries compete for the location of profitable firms. We show that a coordination of investment in transport cost reducing infrastructures within union countries enhances welfare and mitigates tax competition. In contrast, with regard to union-periphery infrastructure, the union has an interest in a coordinated reduction of investment expenditures. Here, the effects on tax competition are ambiguous.

It finds that general effective tax rates are relatively high in the Philippines, while investment incentives are comparable to those in neighboring countries. Tax holidays are most attractive for very profitable firms, creating redundancy, and for investment in short-lived assets. Two recently proposed tax reforms would replace tax holidays by a reduced corporate income tax rate or a low tax on gross receipts. The results suggest that this would result in stronger incentives to invest, while government revenue would increase. Alternatively, replacing tax holidays with a general reduction in the corporate tax rate and accelerated depreciation would either not provide the same incentives or be very costly.","[Botman, Dennis] Int Monetary Fund, Asia & Pacific Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Klemm, Alexander] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Baqir, Reza] Int Monetary Fund, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Botman, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Asia & Pacific Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dbotman@imf.org,,"Klemm, Alexander/0000-0002-9892-3182",,,,,20,8,8,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The automatic system is not a guaranty for success. Internationally a project oriented system of the international organizations is known instead of an automatic system but the final goal is not always very clear. Multiple Objectives Optimization looks more robust to obtain regional and international development. Moreover a system of transfer payments is not sufficient to measure the well being of a regional population. In the well-being economy, each individual would have to feel good concerning material wealth, health, education, all kind of security and concerning the environment. With other words, multiple objectives have to be fulfilled. However, these different multiple objectives are expressed in different units. Weights are most of the time used to equalize these different units. Introduction of weights means introduction of subjectivity. In order to avoid this dilemma, the internal mechanical solution of a ratio system, producing dimensionless numbers, is preferred: MOORA. In addition, this outcome creates the opportunity to use an additional non-subjective reference point theory. The choice and importance of the objectives is also non-subjective if all stakeholders involved come to an agreement. This theory is applied on the different counties of Lithuania. At that moment it is no more only a question of redistribution of income but also of a national policy of new constructions, of tourism development, of pollution abatement and of energy renewables, after the European Commission related to the promotion of local employment.","[Brauers, Willem Karel M.; Ginevicius, Romualdas; Podvezko, Valentinas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Brauers, WKM (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",willem.brauers@ua.ac.be; romualdas.ginevicius@vgtu.lt; valentinas.podvezko@vgtu.lt,"Brauers, Willem/AAS-5072-2021","Ginevicius, Romualdas/0000-0003-2067-4398",,,,,48,69,70,0,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

While the literature on geographic cost-of-living differentials is well developed, the literature on geographic cost-of-housing (as opposed to housing-price) differentials is much less so. Housing costs consist of the price of housing per se for owners or rental payments per se for renters plus utility costs. The significance of this research is elevated by the fact that the cost of housing is the main driver of cost-of-living differences between states. The OLS results imply that the cost of housing in a state is positively a function of the state's median family income, its heating degree days, and its mean January temperature, and negatively a function of toxic waste releases in the state, the state's property crime rate, and the presence of right-to-work laws in the state.","[Cebula, Richard J.; Toma, Michael] Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Dept Econ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA",University System of Georgia; Armstrong Atlantic State University,"Cebula, RJ (通讯作者)，Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Dept Econ, 11935 Abercorn St, Savannah, GA 31419 USA.",cebulari@mail.armstrong.edu,"Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,18,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The first method, Cross Validation (CV), has been commonly used in the applied literature using GWR. A second criterion selected an optimal bandwidth that corresponded with the smallest spatial error Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistic. We find that there is a tradeoff between addressing spatial autocorrelation and reducing degree of extreme coefficients in GWR. Although spatial autocorrelation can be controlled for by using the LM criterion, a substantial degree of extreme coefficients may remain. However, while the CV approach appears to be less prone to producing extreme coefficients, it may not always attend to the problems that arise in the presence of spatial error autocorrelation.","[Cho, Seong-Hoon; Lambert, Dayton M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Chen, Zhuo] Univ Chicago, Chicago Ctr Excellence Hlth Promot Econ, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; University of Chicago,"Cho, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr Econ, 2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",scho9@utk.edu,"Lambert, Dayton/A-8401-2009; Chen, Zhuo/A-1261-2007","Chen, Zhuo/0000-0002-5351-3489",,,,,27,40,44,4,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We first looked at statistical data regarding bilateral trade, custom duties and foreign direct investment; the resulting conclusions support our hypothesis. Further, we use a gravity equation, in order to forecast Romanian exports to a number of 43 countries, accounting for a sizeable share of total exports, covering a world-wide area using data series over a period of time between 1993 and 2008. Based on the gravity equation, we calculated export potential of Romania to the Russian Federation, being interested in the long run trade dynamics potential. We made the comparison between potential and real trade for the year 2008, being in fact interested in what export would have been in 2008 if during all the period studied (1993-2007) trade would have followed the gravity patterns. We conclude that if the Romanian exports to the Russian Federation would have perfectly fitted the general gravity pattern, the level of exports to the country would stand at 2,317 current billion dollars, which is 2.58 times higher than the registered level. From an economic point of view, these results can be interpreted, in the context of our broader analysis, as a good indicator that the opportunities in the Russian Federation market are still undervaluated by Romanian exporters and the rest of stakeholders in the exportation process.","[Dascalescu, Virgil] Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania; [Nicolae, Elena; Ion, Irina] Bucharest Univ Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dascalescu, V (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania.",gilcluj@yahoo.com; ela.nicolae@gmail.com; irinazgreaban@yahoo.com,"Irina, Ion C/C-6063-2011; Ion, Irina Elena/A-2340-2017",,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Tourism is the clearest choice for such growth, but more rapid growth in agriculture would have the greatest impact on poverty reduction and employment.

This article explores possible shifts in global savings and investment that have led to this fall in the world real interest rate. There are several key findings. First, the authors identify the relative weakness in investment demand as more important than the relative increase in desired global savings to explain the decline in global interest rates. Second, the results indicate that the key factors explaining movements in savings and investment are variables that evolve relatively slowly over time, such as labour force growth and age structure. The conclusions suggest that over the coming years, world real interest rates are likely to continue to adjust slowly, reflecting long-term trends.","[Desroches, Brigitte; Francis, Michael] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Desroches, B (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",bdesroches@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,23,8,8,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that regional effects account for a good part of this behaviour when modelled alone; however, regional effects themselves have no particular meaning. To this end, we try to empirically account for the regional effects using a large set of economic, political and demographic variables. Our results indicate that countries with past high levels of both investment and inflation cause growth to be less volatile today. Countries that have a greater number of changes in heads of government tend to experience lower growth volatility except in parliamentary democracies where the relationship reverses. The greater the number of effective parties the lower the volatility for all regime types. More strikes have no effect on volatility except for presidential democracies where volatility actually increases, while more open economies that share presidential and legislative powers also have more volatile growth rates.","[Edwards, Jeffrey Alan] N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA; [Gilbert, Ronald; Sherwell, Juan] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Edwards, JA (通讯作者)，N Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",jaedwar2@ncat.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Previous work demonstrates many participants in public goods experiments contribute to the public good out of confusion. We design experiments to provide insights on the consequences and causes of confusion. We establish that confusion amounts to more than statistical noise and does not dissipate with repetition (i.e. learning). Confused subjects use experimental parameters and the behavior of other players as cues, which confounds treatment effects and traditional strategies to identify other-regarding preferences through exogenous parameter changes and the modeling of reactions to other subjects' decisions. We argue that confusion stems from an inaccurate understanding of game incentives (failure of game form recognition), which is a consequence of the framing and inadequate payoff information in standard instructions. Modified instructions can substantially reduce confusion, and, in turn, change the distribution of contributions to the public good.","[Ferraro, Paul J.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Vossler, Christian A.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Ferraro, PJ (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",pferraro@gsu.edu; cvossler@utk.edu,"Ferraro, Paul/B-4435-2014; Vossler, Christian A/A-5453-2010","Ferraro, Paul/0000-0002-4777-5108;",,,,,40,27,27,3,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This is followed by presenting the idea of understanding the normal way of development of economic science as a from of migration of ideas in which a significant role is played by inspirations related not to the observation of real world but to the world of economists (ideas shared by academic communities), as well as phenomena of external environment such as new political and social ideologies, cultural and technological trends, and geopolitical changes. In the subsequent part of the paper the idea is put forward that over the last half-century the development of economic science has been heavily influenced by the broadening acceptance of the criterion of instrumental effectiveness (Laudan - Mongin) in appraising the progress of the science. It is argued that this resulted in lower ability of economics to explain some major contemporary civilization and technological trends, and reduced prediction strength of economic models and theories. However, the emergence of new and cognitively valuable schools and streams (e.g. New Institutional Economics), this cannot be considered a common feature of today's economics. The paper ends with an attempt at identifying the civilization and technological trends and structural changes in modern economies which are not sufficiently analyzed in the mainstream economics, thus causing some crisis phenomena in its cognitive, predictive and utilitarian value. An eclectic approach is advocated, understood as a postulate to look for analytical and policy answers into various (sometimes competing) theories and schools in today's economics.","Uniwersytetu Ekonomicznego Wroclawiu, Wroclaw, Poland",,"Fiedor, B (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Ekonomicznego Wroclawiu, Wroclaw, Poland.",rektor@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,2,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,4,,,,,453,466,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,654YX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282208400001,0

This departure from the standard separate accounting (transfer pricing) approach is an attempt to reduce the costs and distortions associated with auditing transfer prices. Unfortunately, apportionment formulas create their own economic distortions and, contrary to popular belief, they do not eliminate distortions due to asymmetric information between the multinational and the national tax authorities. In this paper, I explicitly model the role of private information in two tax competition games: one in which tax liabilities are calculated under formula apportionment and one in which tax liabilities are calculated under separate accounting and transfer prices are audited. Switching to a formula apportionment system affects the after-tax profit of multinationals and the tax revenues paid by both domestic and foreign firms. The direction and magnitude of the changes depend on the accuracy of the auditing technology and non-monotonically on multinational costs. The switch will have different effects on the tax receipts from domestic and foreign firms. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, two recent studies from the US have suggested, the seasonal component in box office revenue may in part be endogenously determined. Films that are expected to do well tend to be released at times of peak demand. Hence, the seasonal pattern may reflect both the underlying seasonal pattern and the market expansion effect of the films; evidence from the US suggests the former dominates the latter. This article investigates the same issue for the UK using a structural time series model. We find that, although the seasonal pattern varies over time, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the seasonal factors are constant.

J,"Hassan, RM",,,,"Hassan, Rashid M.",,,Implications of Climate Change for Agricultural Sector Performance in Africa: Policy Challenges and Research Agenda†,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Q54,IMPACTS,"The paper analysed how climate change (CC) has shaped African agriculture in the past and how it might impact on African farm economies in the future and what adaptation strategies African farmers have adopted to cope with these changes. The analyses covered all key farming systems and agro-climates of Africa in 11 countries in which data were collected from over 10,000 farm household surveys. Results provided evidence that African agriculture and the welfare of its rural population are vulnerable to CC. The highest risk of future CC damages is associated with specialised crop and livestock farming (mono systems) particularly under dryland conditions in arid and semi-arid regions. This indicates how difficult it is to achieve an African green revolution under the current high reliance on dryland systems (more than 95% of the land) given predicted harsh future climates (warmer and dryer projections) for most of the dryland areas in Africa. It will require substantial public and private investments in expanding irrigation and development of crop varieties and animal breeds that are tolerant to heat, water and low fertility stresses, and in building roads and marketing infrastructures that will improve access to critical inputs (e.g., fertiliser) and output trade. This essentially requires mainstreaming climate sensitivity as an integral component of all agricultural and broader economic development planning and policy design. Although the expected damages are large, many farming systems and communities in Africa face serious limiting conditions which reduce their ability to adapt and hence increase their vulnerability. Among the key factors found to constrain African farmers' ability to adopt effective adaptation measures are poor access to information, capital, technology and markets. Policies aimed at promoting farm-level adaptation need to emphasise the critical role of farmers' education; provision of improved climate, production and market information and the means to implement adaptations through affordable credit facilities. Other needed public interventions to help promote adaptation measures and reduce vulnerability include insurance against climate risks to farmers and provision of safety nets.","Univ Pretoria, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, CEEPA, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Hassan, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, CEEPA, Room 2-6, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Rashid.hassan@up.ac.za,"Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022",,,,,,64,29,31,0,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We characterize the optimal pricing strategy of a third-degree price discriminating monopolist under these rules. Under the minimum price rule, the minimum price gross of rebate always increases whereas prices gross of rebate in at least some of the markets always decrease. In contrast, under the average price rule, these prices may move in the same direction in all markets, with all increasing in some circumstances and all decreasing in others.

It has renewed calls for greater monetary and exchange rate cooperation. A country's suitability to join a monetary union depends, inter alia, on the trade intensity and the business cycle synchronization with other potential members of the monetary union. However, these two Optimum Currency Area criteria are endogenous. Theoretically, the effect of increased trade integration (after the elimination of exchange fluctuations among the countries in the region) on the business cycle synchronization is ambiguous. Reduction in trade barriers can potentially increase industrial specialization by country and therefore resulting in more asymmetry business cycles from industry-specific shocks. On the other hand, increased trade integration may result in more highly correlated business cycles due to common demand shocks or intra-industry trade. If the second hypothesis is empirically verified, policy makers have little to worry about the region being unsynchronized in their business cycles as the business cycles will become more synchronized after the monetary union is formed. This paper assesses the dynamic relationships between trade, finance, specialization and business cycle synchronization for East Asian economies using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach. The dynamic panel approach improves on previous efforts to examine the business cycle correlations - trade link using panel procedures, which control for the potential endogeneity of all explanatory variables. Based on the findings on how trade, finance and sectoral specialization have effects on the size of common shocks among countries, potential policies that can help East Asian countries move closer toward a regional currency arrangement can be Suggested. The empirical results of this study suggest that there exists scope for East Asia to form a monetary union. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Lee, Grace H.

An implication and prospective test of such models is that individuals who are outside the labour market have an incentive to locate in regions where amenities are capitalized into wages. In this article we construct a measure of the extent of amenity capitalization into wages for each county in England and Wales.

Data gathered in a multi-stage sample of 150 small coffee growers were used to estimate a logit model of investment in seasonal inputs applied to coffee. Liquidity was found to be the most important determinant of investment, followed by family farm labour, transaction costs, formal education and informal taxes imposed by the wantok system. Visits from extension staff did not have a significant impact on investment. It was not possible to test for the effects of land tenure security as virtually all the sample households suffered from insecure tenure. Improving the physical infrastructure in rural Papua New Guinea would help to reduce high transaction costs that constrain markets, including the rural finance market.","[Mauro, Jetori; Lyne, Michael; Nartea, Gilbert] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, New Zealand",,"Mauro, J (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, New Zealand.",,"Lyne, Michael C/V-8732-2018","Lyne, Michael/0000-0002-4530-1195",,,,,28,1,1,0,15,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

We show that the relation between long-run economic growth and both monetary and fiscal policies is Subject to threshold effects, a result that gives account of a number of recent empirical findings. Furthermore, the model shows that, to finance public expenditures, growth-maximizing governments must choose relatively high seigniorage (respectively income taxation), if institutional quality and financial development indicators are low (respectively high). Thus. our model may explain why some governments resort to seigniorage and inflationary finance, and others rather resort to high tax rates, as a result of growth-maximizing strategies in different structural environments (notably concerning institutional and financial development contexts). In addition, the model allows examining how the optimal mix of government finance changes in response to different public debt contexts. A short empirical section confirms our theoretical results.

Although both the threshold autoregressive model and the Momentum Threshold Autoregressive (MTAR) model detect asymmetries, the MTAR model is a better fit for the sample data. The finding that Thai banks exhibit faster adjustment in lending rates when the spread is widening (i.e. falling deposit rates) than when the spread is narrowing (i.e. rising deposit rates) supports the consumer reaction hypothesis of Stiglitz and Weiss. This phenomenon is the result of the 'oligopsonistic' relationship between the banks and their powerful corporate customers, and the attendant practice of the 'name'-based lending.","[Nguyen, Chu V.; Islam, Anisul M.] Univ Houston Downtown, Coll Business, Dept FACIS, Houston, TX 77002 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston Downtown,"Islam, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Houston Downtown, Coll Business, Dept FACIS, 320 N Main St, Houston, TX 77002 USA.",islama@uhd.edu,,,,,,,22,8,10,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The fight against the effects of the financial crisis implies diminution in the pressure generated by the central and local financing need combined with the growth in the performance of the authorities' management. This means achieving the financial sustainability of the central budget and the autonomy of the local community based on the budgetary equilibrium, so that the local budget deficits should not become global. Thus, the financially autonomous local communities have to efficiently plan and manage the local income and expense budgets.

So what, if anything, should we do to change the policy environment? Cannabis consumption is unambiguously harmful in several ways, but this does not automatically justify the prohibitionist policy dictated by the international drugs conventions. This paper sets out the arguments for policy intervention in the cannabis market and reviews the directions of policy change that have been called for. We argue that existing theoretical insights and empirical evidence give little compelling reason to prefer prohibition to the alternative of legalization of cannabis with harms controlled by regulation and taxation. Given this conclusion and the much wider prevalence of cannabis than of harder drugs, a reasonable way forward is to remove cannabis production and consumption (but not trade) from the current prohibitionist UN drug control treaties, to allow countries to adopt their own policies, thus generating new evidence on the potential impacts of a wider range of policy. - Stephen Pudney.","Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Pudney, S (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",,,"Pudney, Stephen/0000-0002-5697-0976",,,,,69,26,29,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

It argues that affirmative action is more than an ordinary policy prescription; rather, it has fundamental social engineering and restructuring intent, based on political and ideological considerations. Changes in the affirmative action programs have been associated with changes in the interests of the ruling elites, and, since independence, there have been shifts in emphasis and strategies resulting from the interests of the elites. Many affirmative action programs have led to failure and loss of state resources. Since the military coup in 2006, most of the affirmative action programs associated with past regimes have been removed, including through the dramatic control and then weakening of the indigenous Fijian middle class, which benefited from past affirmative action policies. Paradoxically, under the rubric of 'rural development', the interim government has reinvented affirmative action, but it is now targeted at poor rural villagers and shuns the middle class.","Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Ratuva, S (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,64,2,2,0,4,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

The choice rule of Quantile Maximization unifies maxmin and maxmax as maximizing the lowest and the highest quantiles of beliefs distributions, respectively, and offers a family of less extreme preferences. Taking preferences over acts as a primitive, we axiomatize Quantile Maximization in a Savage setting. Our axiomatization also provides a novel derivation of subjective beliefs, which demonstrates that neither the monotonicity nor the continuity conditions assumed in the literature are essential for probabilistic sophistication. We characterize preferences of quantile maximizers towards downside risk. We discuss how the distinct properties of the model, robustness and ordinality, can be useful in studying choice behaviour for categorical variables and in economic policy design. We also offer applications to poll design and insurance problems.","Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Rostek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,,35,48,58,0,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The research adopts a choice experiment approach to investigate households' WTP for these renewable energy technologies in the UK. The micro-generation technologies comprise solar photovoltaic, micro-wind, solar thermal, heat pumps, and biomass boilers and pellet stoves. The study compares the results from conditional and mixed logit models, which estimate the distribution of utility coefficients and then derives WTP values as a ratio of the attribute coefficient to the price coefficient, with a model in which the WTP distribution is estimated directly from utility in the money space. The results suggest that whilst renewable energy adoption is significantly valued by households, this value is not sufficiently large, for the vast majority of households, to cover the higher capital costs of micro-generation energy technologies.

In the last 50 years, this advance in health, measured by expectation of life at birth, has been shared more equally among people than the increase in income. The record of this concurrent increase in lifespan and income per capita suggests it may be important to understand how these events are interrelated. The connections between health and development are controversial, in part because the evidence on this topic comes from different scientific disciplines, answering different questions, relying on different types of data and using different analytical methods. However, hypotheses are emerging that merit much more study in Africa and elsewhere, to guide the allocation of resources for health, which will entail refinement of conceptual frameworks to isolate causal relationships through more rigorous empirical testing, and collection of new data for more decisive tests. Two types of relationships are distinguished: first, the linkages between conditions under which people live and their expected lifespan and health status, which characterise the technology of 'health production functions'; second, the relationship between an individual's stock of health and her or his economic productivity, well-being and duration of life, which characterise 'returns to health human capital'. In the last 50 years, the lifespan at birth of the relatively rich and poor converged, at least until the 1990s. There are indications that this was achieved mainly by improvements in nutrition and control of infectious diseases concentrated in childhood that were relatively cheap to disseminate. To control mortality and reduce disability among adults confronting degenerative chronic diseases has proved more costly, and the relatively poor may thus not benefit as much as the rich from the dissemination of these newer medical technologies unless subsidised. However, the prior reduction in childhood illnesses may itself contribute to improved adult health outcomes later in the life cycle. Birth cohorts which have experienced diminished infections and inflammatory illnesses in utero and early childhood and received better early nutrition may also increase their potential economic productivity as adults, as well as live longer lives free of disability.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Schultz, TP (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",paul.schultz@yale.edu,,,,,,,141,10,11,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Wildcat banking from the period of the 1830s to the 1860s is an example of a specific form of regulation imposed on the banking industry. In the work we are attempting to refute the myth that wildcat banking is an example of unsuccessful operation of so-called free banking. It is failure of the regulation which is identified as the reason for instability of this form of banking operation. As far as effects of regulatory measures are concerned in general, this historical period (or experience) can offer valuable parallels with the cause of the current global economic crisis at the beginning of the third millennium.

In contrast to the standard Ramsey model we assume that every splitting of production between consumption and capital accumulation is influenced by some random factor governed by transition probabilities depending on the current value of the accumulated capital and possibly on some (costly) decisions. Moreover, we assume that also some additional (expensive) interventions of the decision maker are possible for changing the depreciation rate of the capital. Finding optimal policy of the extended model can be then formulated as finding optimal policy of a highly structured Markov decision process. Unfortunately usual optimization criteria for Markov decision processes cannot reflect variability-risk features of the problem. To this end, we indicate how finding policies yielding maximal risk-sensitive rewards, i.e., if the stream of undiscounted one-stage rewards/costs is evaluated by an exponential utility function, can be also performed.","[Sladky, Karel] Inst Informat Theory & Automat ASCR, Dept Econometr, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,,sladky@utia.cas.cz,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,560,565,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900095,0

Additionally, banks themselves were not aware of the scale of their potential losses as they did not create effective information systems to measure their risks. The severity of the global recession resulted mainly from the large scale of the banking crisis. This illustrated that financial system did not have such neutral impact on the economy, as was assumed in the DSGE models. It will be difficult to include financial sectors into the general equilibrium models as the functioning of financial systems is characterized by short-time horizons, important role of the behavioral factors and non-linear dynamic properties. After the experiences of the recent crisis, central banks will use the interest rates policy not only to stabilize inflation, but also to tame unstable lending booms. However, the experiences of the recent crisis show that rising interest rates might not be sufficient to prevent boom-bust cycles. Thus, there is a necessity to change banking supervision not only to shield the stability of banks but also to hedge the economy against boom-bust cycles. This opens a new field for coordination between monetary policy and banking supervision which waits to be covered by macroeconomic research. Central banks will be interested also in tightening supervision over the inter-bank markets for commodity forward contracts, because speculation on these markets was an important factor behind the global sharp rise in food, oil, gas and metal prices that induced central banks to raise interest rates despite the approaching recession.",,,,aslawi@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,8,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,2,,,,,145,162,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,610KA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278730200001,0

Our literature review leads us to conclusion that when fiscal sustainability is being considered, putting fixed limit to public debt-to-GDP and budget balance-to-GDP ratio is a too simplified solution and that sustainable fiscal policy might be defined with public debt-to-GDP and budget balance-to-GDP ceilings, but taking into account some underlying country specific parameters. Our empirical analysis shows that most EU Member States entered year 2008 with healthy public finances. However, most EU Member States now face fiscal difficulties. Even more: almost all EU Member States would have to decrease budget deficit in 2009 and 2010, in order to achieve sustainable budget position. The extensive jumps in fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010, compared to 2007 (before crisis), are mainly due to lower,fiscal incomes as a consequence of lower economic growth and policy measures for tackling financial/economic crisis. We argue that these changes in fiscal deficits are not sustainable. Our analysis shows that in 2009 about 2/3 of the economies in question should have budget surplus, taking into consideration other relevant macroeconomic variables, such as economic growth, etc. In 2010, however, a more loosened fiscal policy would be possible, but still significantly lower fiscal deficit than forecasted would be sustainable.",,,,,,,,,,,43,9,9,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The majority of these studies use data either originating in or targeted at the US. This article presents evidence from a dataset of German inward and outward FDI. The dataset is similar in scope to the widely used US Bureau of Economic Analysis data, making the results comparable to those from previous studies. In addition, a new empirical specification is employed that avoids some of the problems that have plagued these studies. The results provide little indication of vertical multinationals. FDI happens largely between similarly endowed countries. Multinational firms originate in skilled-labour abundant countries, although the evidence is mixed on whether they are also small. A novel result is that German firms invest disproportionately in other European countries, while the reverse is not true.","Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Waldkirch, A (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, 5244 Mayflower Hill, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",andreas.waldkirch@colby.edu,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In 2000, dial-up access rates in rural households lagged behind their urban counterparts by 11 percentage points. By 2003, however, dial-up access rates were equal in rural and urban areas, but high-speed access rates were 14 percentage points higher in urban areas. This article uses a nested logit model to explore the household decision between no Internet access, dial-up access and high-speed access. A decomposition technique is then used to estimate the contributions of various factors, including education, income and infrastructure levels, to differences in Internet access among rural and urban households. The results suggest that policies which solely promote infrastructure in rural areas fail to address the dominant factors in the emerging high-speed digital divide.","[Whitacre, Brian E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74074 USA; [Mills, Bradford F.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Whitacre, BE (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 504 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74074 USA.",brian.whitacre@okstate.edu,"Whitacre, Brian/JAX-4638-2023","Whitacre, Brian/0000-0002-5083-1828",,,,,24,12,15,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that this stabilizing role call be attributed to transnational banks' access to more diversified sources of liquidity. There exists, however, no empirical evidence so far on transnational banks' liquidity behavior and its effect oil aggregate banking system liquidity. This paper aims at closing this gap. First, we look at the liquid assets holdings of transnational banks and show that in normal times they are significantly lower but in crises times higher than those of single-market banks. Second, we find evidence that transnational banks' presence significantly reduces the risk of aggregate liquidity shortages in emerging economies.

These curves and analysts' forecasts of future interest rates are then used to fit an affine term structure model to Australian interest rates, with the aim of decomposing forward rates into expected future overnight cash rates plus term premia. The expected future short rates derived from the model are on average unbiased, fluctuating around the average of actual observed short rates. Since the adoption of inflation targeting and the entrenchment of low and stable inflation expectations, term premia appear to have declined in levels and displayed smaller fluctuations in response to economic shocks. This suggests that the market has become less uncertain about the path of future interest rates.

Using an overlapping generations model which incorporates uncertain longevity, we set up a model which incorporates intergenerational transfers of time and examine the macroeconomic effect of public long-term care policy (LTC). Using the model, we show that LTC decreases the steady state level of capital stock, but that it enhances the welfare level in an aging economy, when the rate of tax is sufficiently small.

We find strong evidence that the quality of institutions and specifically, the degree of law and order, helps to sort countries into different regimes.

Our empirical results show that the banking aggregates loan loss provisions, write-offs, and total loans can be modelled for this group of banks using a small number of macroeconomics variables.

The proposed model includes Two Stage Probit Least Squares estimates suitable to correct for simultaneity bias when one of the variables is continuous and the other is dichotomous. Econometric results point out that age, schooling, house ownership, place of residence and individual perception of both social intercourse and safety in their neighborhoods have a meaningful effect on participation.

Signing a binding agreement can prevent players from free riding on the contributions to the public good. However, a well known theoretical result is that the outcome of the endogenous formation of agreements is not necessarily efficient. Our setting is a bargaining game in which agreements form sequentially. The individual level of contribution to the public good increases with the size of the coalition reaching an agreement and the global agreement is always the socially optimal structure. There are two equilibrium outcomes, the global agreement and an asymmetric structure, which consists of two coalitions of different sizes, the small one free riding on the contributions of the larger one. We run an experiment which lends force to the theoretical result that outcomes may be inefficient. However, subjects do not play Nash and the experimental outcome is, on average, even more inefficient than the theory predicts. Our analysis leads to the conclusion that different types of behaviour co-exist. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

He argues that markets are not well organized to manage the power that financial assets have to generate emotion and their wider effect on human imagination and judgement, anchored in neurobiology. Judgements and decisions about risk, reward and the evaluation of success can become systematically compromised because the excitement of potential gain is disconnected from anxiety about potential consequences, producing groupthink and bubbles. When anxiety breaks through, a catastrophic loss of confidence is inevitable. In the aftermath the emotional pain that would be involved in accepting responsibility stands in the way of lessons being learned. The author's theoretical framework is influenced by modern psychoanalysis and draws on an interview study of international fund managers in 2007. He suggests that underlying psychological conflicts have influenced the way market institutions have evolved to compete by selling the promise of exceptional performance. To cope with the expectations upon them, agents are impelled to base their actions on stories which overvalue opportunities and underestimate risks; this creates agency issues and facilitates the process of disconnecting anxiety from excitement that creates bubble potential. Policy implications go well beyond improving regulation and transparency.","UCL, Psychoanal Unit, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Tuckett, D (通讯作者)，UCL, Psychoanal Unit, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",D.Tuckett@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,4,4,2,22,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 20,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200940,,,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20MU,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208144900001,0

The results show that malaria matters the most and all other factors are statistically insignificant. Malaria also negatively affects savings. The results are robust even when the malaria ecology instrument is replaced by frost, humidity and rainfall and when the latter are used as additional control variables.

A monopolist produces infrastructure under decreasing cost using fixed equipment. Unlike similar work, we derive a unique closed-economy equilibrium. In a small open economy, with naive infrastructure provider(s), multiple equilibria obtain. The industrial export potential of the economy depends on unexhausted economies of scale, and equilibria are possible where manufactures are exported despite an autarky price higher than the world price. With a sophisticated infrastructure provider, even an open economy has a unique equilibrium, which, at least as long as economies of scale are unexhausted, also involves more industrialization than the naive equilibria. Access to the unlimited world market is necessary for significant industrialization but is not sufficient: one may also require Schumpeterian entrepreneurs, monopolists with a panoramic vision of the economy and of their catalytic role in it.","[Guha, Ashok S.] Indian Stat Inst, New Delhi 110016, India; [Guha, Brishti] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi; Singapore Management University,"Guha, AS (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, 7 SJS Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India.",ashoksanjayguha@gmail.com; bguha@smu.edu.sg,"GUHA, Brishti/D-1427-2009",,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In this paper we argue that the prevalence of soft budget constraints can be best explained by the political desirability of softness. We develop an infinite horizon political economy model where neither democratic nor autocratic politicians can commit to policies that are not ex post optimal. We show that because of the dynamic commitment problem inherent in the soft budget constraint, politicians can in essence commit to make transfers to entrepreneurs which otherwise they would not be able to do. This encourages such entrepreneurs to support them politically. Though the soft budget constraint may induce economic inefficiency, it may be politically rational because it influences the probability of political survival. In consequence, even when information is complete, politicians may fund bad projects which they anticipate they will have to bail out in the future. We show that, maybe somewhat surprisingly, dictators who are less likely to lose power, are more likely to use the soft budget constraint as a strategy to gain political support.

Under various classification systems to differentiate the degree of threat of imitation across countries, both positive and negative export effects of IPR are found in Taiwan's case.

First, we give a complete characterization of the class of functionals representing these preferences. Then, we show that any such functional can be represented as a Choquet integral I(f) = integral kappa(f)d nu where kappa : B(Sigma) -> A (C) is the canonical mapping from the space of bounded Sigma-measurable functions into the space of weak*-continuous affine functions on a weak*-compact, convex set C of probability measures on Sigma. Conversely, any preference relation defined by means of such functionals satisfies the axioms of the model we study. Different properties of the capacity give rise to different models. Our result shows that the idea of Choquet integration is general enough to embrace all the models mentioned above. In doing so, it widens the range of applicability of well-known procedures in robust statistics theory such as the Neyman-Pearson lemma for capacities [P.J. Huber, V.

In order to destabilize welfare decreasing pools, forcing coalitions members to offer individual licenses in parallel to the pool has been suggested.

The explicit employment contract specifies working hours, compensation, and job tasks. The implicit contract involves expectations about the extent to which the employment relationship is likely to continue over time. Will the firms will seek to avoid mass layoffs unless or until absolutely necessary? Will firms cushion the wages and compensation of employees to some extent from broad swings in the economy? Will employees show some degree of loyalty to the firm? This paper will argue that, along a number of dimensions, the nature of the worker-firm employment relationship may have changed substantially in recent years - a group of changes that as a whole have negatively affected the lives of workers and produced modest, if any, benefits for firms. If employers have become less involved with cushioning the blow of unemployment and avoiding layoffs where possible, then public policy might have a role to play in spreading the burden of a down labor market so that the burden is not borne so heavily by those who lose their jobs entirely.","[Hallock, Kevin F.] Cornell Univ, Sch Ind & Labor Relat, Ctr Adv Human Resource Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hallock, Kevin F.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hallock, KF (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Ind & Labor Relat, Ctr Adv Human Resource Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hallock@cornell.edu,,,,,,,61,31,48,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In performance metrics derived by comparing 28 mobile telephone markets, countries allocating greater bandwidth to licensed operators and achieving more competitive market structures are estimated to realize efficiencies that generally dominate those associated with license sales.

I argue that the magnitude of executive compensation seems excessive in light of a wide range of academic studies. I then propose specific regulatory measures that make compensation transparent and predictable for shareholders. Next, a simple taxation of executive compensation above a certain threshold is proposed; I argue that it is a much more efficient way to deal with the issue, than the current legislation in the United States. Turning to the 'pay for performance' paradigm, I argue that it must be applied with great care, as, along with the incentives to exert effort it also provides powerful perverse incentives, which are not immediately obvious, may vary dramatically across firms, and may not be well understood by the compensation committees and academics. I outline the design of several generic contracts appropriate for different environments. Finally, I stipulate that the downside of providing too much 'pay for performance' is especially evident in financial industry, which is opaque and subject to contagion, thus compensation contract should play a more important role in financial regulation.

Kenneth Dam finds that the legal tradition view inaccurately portrays how legal systems work, how laws developed historically, and how government power is allocated in the various legal traditions. Yet, after probing the legal origins' literature for inaccuracies, Dam, does not deeply develop an alternative hypothesis to explain the world's differences in financial development. Nor does he challenge the origins core data, which could be origins' trump card. Hence, his analysis will not convince many economists, despite that his legal learning suggests conceptual and factual difficulties for the legal origins explanations. Yet, a dense political. economy explanation is already out there and the origins-based data has unexplored weaknesses consistent with, Dam's contentions. Knowing if the origins view is truly fundamental, flawed, or secondary is vital for financial development policy making because policymakers who believe it will pick policies that imitate what they think to be the core institutions of the preferred legal tradition.

J,"Samuel, A",,,,"Samuel, Andrew",,,Preemptive collusion among corruptible law enforcers,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bribery; Collusion; Corruption; Moral hazard; Crime prevention,PRIVATE,"This paper considers collusion between a supervisor and an agent within a Principal-Supervisor-Agent model. Other papers consider the possibility of collusion after the supervisor has exerted costly effort to obtain hard (verifiable) evidence regarding the agent's actions, information which, if reported would result in the agent being fined with a certain probability. That is, collusion occurs because the supervisor may accept a bribe in exchange for hiding the information he has obtained. This paper allows the supervisor and the agent to enter into a collusive contract either before or after the supervisor has exerted effort to find verifiable information regarding the agent's actions. The former type of collusion, which occurs after the supervisor has exerted effort, entails ex-post corruption, while the latter, which occurs before the supervisor has exerted effort, entails preemptive corruption. This paper shows that although raising the supervisor's reward discourages ex-post corruption, it can simultaneously encourage preemptive corruption. Hence, raising the supervisor's reward will not always discourage collusion. This result further implies that though privatizing law enforcement can always be used to eliminate ex-post corruption, it cannot be used to eliminate preemptive corruption. Furthermore, when compared to ex-post collusion, an equilibrium without corruption is always socially preferred. However, when compared to preemptive collusion, an equilibrium without corruption may not always be socially preferred. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The policy coincided with the Economic Reforms of 1979 and the trend toward greater urbanization, all of which may have influenced the wellbeing of children. This paper examines the mobility status consequence of children in urban China since the introduction of the OCP and the economic reforms using data drawn from urban household surveys in China. The analysis first makes the comparison between child poverty in Canada, the United Kingdom and urban India, where it was found that both status and trends of child poverty are very different among the countries, with children not being over-represented in the poverty group in urban China. The extent to which the policies influenced investment in children is next examined by studying the way in which the relationship between the educational attainment of children and family characteristics changed within families formed prior to and after 1979. We found that the impact of household income and parental educational attainment increased significantly over time, with a positive gender effect where girls advanced more than boys. Applying new techniques for measuring mobility, we observe the reduction in intergenerational mobility.

In earlier work, Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) use a set betweenness axiom to restrict the set of preferences considered by Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini (2001) to those explainable via temptation. We argue that set betweenness rules out plausible and interesting forms of temptation including some which may be important in applications. We propose a pair of alternative axioms called DFC, desire for commitment, and AIC, approximate improvements are chosen. DFC characterizes temptation as situations in which given any set of alternatives, the agent prefers committing herself to some particular item from the set rather than leaving herself the flexibility of choosing later. AIC is based on the idea that if adding an option to a menu improves the menu, it is because that option is chosen under some circumstances. From this interpretation, the axiom concludes that if an improvement is worse (as a commitment) than some commitment from the menu, then the best commitment from the improved menu is strictly preferred to facing that menu. We show that these axioms characterize a natural generalization of the Gul-Pesendorfer representation.","[Dekel, Eddie] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dekel, Eddie] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lipman, Barton L.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Northwestern University; Tel Aviv University; Boston University; University of Cambridge; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Dekel, E (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,19,76,88,0,12,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In order to overcome omitted variables concerns, we employ a number of alternative difference-in-differences estimation strategies. We implement a propensity score matching algorithm to find a control group for each liberalizing country. In addition, we exploit variation in industry characteristics to obtain an alternative set of difference-in-differences estimates. Financial liberalization is found to have a positive effect on both growth and volatility of production across industries. The positive growth effect comes from increased entry of firms, higher capital accumulation, and an expansion in total employment. By contrast, we do not detect any effect of financial liberalization on measured productivity. Finally, the growth effects of liberalization appear temporary rather than permanent.

The argument is made that it contained multiple failures that not only generated constraints on adequately identifying and addressing the crisis but also contributed to that crisis. Those failures derived from a combination of theory and institutional practice. Specifically the use of forms of inflationary targeting based on broad adherence to the Taylor rule framework and the use of versions of a Conventional Theoretical Macro Model (CTMM) were both problematic. This was particularly so in the way policy was focused through issues of the primacy of price stability. The institutional arrangements of the central banks were also problematic. The division of labour between the central banks and other regulatory bodies and the limited information available within a liberalised finance system hampered efforts to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation. Partly due to the constraints imposed by the thinking and strategies that had been developed the central banks never got to grips with the fundamental problems of the crisis. Interest rate policy and liquidity provision were undertaken in ways that steadily radicalised the approaches of the banks but always in a way that was event led and always in ways that could not resolve those fundamental problems. The nature of the crisis highlights the importance of transforming the approach and institutional framework of the central banks. Relatedly, it highlights the need for a more Keynesian and heterodox approach to economics within decision making bodies at central banks.","Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance Res, POB 4,Yliopistonkatu 3, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",zen34405@zen.co.uk,,,,,,,56,24,24,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It has become clear that these profits were on shaky grounds and also that bank profits were not used to buttress banks' capital bases. This paper analyses the effects of structure on profitability from 1994 to 2005. Bank-level panel data are used to test the effects of concentration, market power, bank size and operational efficiency on profitability. Efficiency is not found to be a strong determinant of profitability, suggesting that banks' high profits during this period were not 'earned' through efficient performance. Robust evidence is found that concentration increases bank profitability. This holds even when the largest banks are excluded from the sample, suggesting that the relationship between concentration and profitability acts in a generalised structural way and that the higher profits arising from concentration are at the expense of the rest of the economy. The analysis points to various policy implications relevant to the current crisis, in particular in terms of the legitimacy of expectations of the restoration of pre-crisis profit rates and the need for much stronger regulation of the banking sector, especially in terms of the structure of the sector, pricing behaviour and use of profits.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Cambridge,"Tregenna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",fmt21@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,7,68,79,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In contrast to those states which had emerged through a quasi-Darwinian process of selection, some of these new countries had structural characteristics which gravely impeded the provision of public goods. Their lack of a unifying sense of shared identity made cooperation difficult, and their tiny economic size left them unable to reap scale economies. Two public goods, security and accountability, are particularly important for development and so, where they could not be provided, states failed. The cause of a problem is not necessarily a guide to its solution: Darwinian struggle among failing states is not something to be encouraged. Solutions lie partly in a phase of international provision of the key public goods, partly in enhanced regional pooling of sovereignty, and partly in institutional innovation to make the domestic provision of public goods less demanding of the state.","Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",paul.collier@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,44,53,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The framework is inspired in the parameterization method of Cabre et a]. [2003. The parameterization method for invariant manifolds. 1. Manifolds associated to non-resonant subspaces. Indiana University Mathematics journal 52(2), 283-328], and the semianalytical algorithms proposed by Simp [1990. On the analytical and numerical approximation of invariant manifolds.

Global dynamics in macroeconomics: all overlapping generations example. journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 27, 1941-1959]. Within this methodology, one call compute high order approximations of stable, unstable and center manifolds. In this last case the use of high order approximations (not just linear) are crucial in understanding the dynamic properties of the model near the steady state. To illustrate the algorithms we consider a model economy introduced by Azariadis et al. [2001. Public and private circulating liabilities. journal of Economic Theory 99, 59-116]. Besides its intrinsic importance, this four-dimensional macroeconomic model is an ideal testing ground because it delivers steady states with stable and unstable manifolds (of dimensions I or 2), and each of them has also a one-dimensional center manifold. Moreover, the numerical computations lead to a further theoretical Study of the dynamical system completing some of the results in the original paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using both least-squares and matching-based decomposition techniques, we find the wage gap among comparable men and women to be sizeable, but quite similar across firm hierarchy levels. The key reason why the average relative wage position of female top managers is worse compared to lower-ranking female employees is that women tend not to be at the helm of the highest-paying companies.

The so-called optimal wavelet basis allows to achieve a geometrical representation of the cascade process-named microcanonical cascade-that describes the behavior of local quantities and thus it helps to reveal the underlying dynamics of the system. In this context, we study the benefits of using the optimal wavelet in contrast to other wavelets when used to define cascade variables, and we provide an optimality degree estimator that is appropriate to determine the closest-to-optimal wavelet in real data. Particularizing the analysis to stock market series, we show that they can be represented by microcanonical cascades in both the logarithm of the price and the volatility. Also, as a promising application in forecasting, we derive the distribution of the value of next point of the series conditioned to the knowledge of past points and the cascade structure, i.e., the stochastic kernel of the cascade process.","[Pont, Oriol; Perez-Vicente, Conrad J.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Fis Fonamental, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Turiel, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Dept Phys Oceanog, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM),"Pont, O (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Fis Fonamental, Diagonal 647, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",oriol@ffn.ub.es; turiel@icm.csic.es; conrad@ffn.ub.es,"Vicente, Conrad J.

It is shown that interest rate targets (like a Taylor-rule), which are consistent with a unique equilibrium, cannot be implemented by money growth rules. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

When contestants are homogeneous, under a mild and plausible condition (regular contest technology), a grand contest generates more effort than any set of subcontests. When no restrictions are placed on the contest technology, the results further demonstrate an increasing-return-to-scale property such that each individual responds to a proportional increase in the number of contestants and the number of each prize by increasing individual effort. Therefore, when a collection of identical subcontests forms a grand contest, the total effort always increases and the grand contest leads to a higher rent-dissipation rate.

However, the effectiveness of inflation targeting on lowering inflation is found to be quite heterogeneous. The performance of a given inflation targeting regime can be affected by country characteristics such as government's fiscal position, central bank's desire to limit the movements of exchange rate, its willingness to meet the preconditions of policy adoption and the time length since the policy adoption.

Each party has the incentive to suppress evidence that may damage her case, and to reveal any evidence that strengthens her case. I model the decision of a litigant to suppress evidence. The court conditions its action (transfers between the parties) upon the evidence which is revealed. Enforcement costs, which are the cost of suppression and the cost of requesting evidence, are a loss to the relationship and form the basis for my evaluation of the relative merits of each system. I find that neither system always outperforms the other. The strength of the inquisitorial system is that it allows for randomization over evidence requests, which leads to lower expected enforcement cost. Litigants cannot commit to randomize as they are motivated by the expected award in litigation. The strength of the adversarial system is that it sometimes allows litigants to utilize their information about the level of suppression.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Bull, J (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Dept Econ, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",bullj@fiu.edu,,"Bull, Jesse/0000-0002-6047-6938",,,,,28,4,4,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A dynamic panel model without exogenous regressors is utilized, and the problem of bias in this specific context is considered. In general, it is concluded that the dynamics of per capita value added of US counties shows conditional convergence and low steady state dispersion. However, in the case of Mexico the dynamics is congruent with stratified growth.

The core of our analysis lies in the determinants of the division of labor. We consider a world economy comprising two large countries, with a continuum of goods and one factor of production, labor. Each good is characterized by its complexity, defined as the number of tasks that must be performed to produce one unit, There are increasing returns to scale in the performance of each task, which creates gains from specialization, and uncertainty in the enforcement of each contract, which create transaction costs. The trade-off between these two forces pins down the size of productive teams across sectors in each country.Under free trade the country where teams are larger specializes in the more complex goods.

On this criterion, ad valorem taxes outperform unit taxes in terms of welfare for a wide range of imperfect competition settings including Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition. However, in a number of policy fields such as environmental, health, and trade economics, policy makers use taxes to reduce the production/consumption volume in an industry, i.e., to correct an externality rather than to improve tax yield. This paper compares the two tax instruments with respect to equal corrective effect in a Dixit-Stiglitz setting with love of variety, entry, exit, and redistribution of tax revenues. We find that unit taxes lead to more firms in the industry, less output per firm, less tax revenue, but higher welfare compared to ad valorem taxes.","[Droege, Susanne] SWP German Inst Int & Secur Affairs, D-10719 Berlin, Germany; [Schroder, Philipp J.

Despite its proposed importance, the measurement and the definition of trust seem to be not fully settled, and the identification of the exact role of trust in economic interactions has proven to be elusive. It is still not clear whether trust is just an epiphenomenon of good institutions or whether it plays an independent causal role capable of shaping important aggregate economic outcomes. In this paper, I rely on a behavioral definition of trust that enables us to relate it to economic primitives such as preferences and beliefs. I review strong biological and behavioral evidence indicating that trusting is not just a special case of risk-taking, but based on important forms of social preferences such as betrayal aversion. Behaviorally defined trust also opens the door for understanding national and ethnic trust differences in terms of differences in preferences and beliefs, and it suggests ways to examine and interpret a causal role of trust.

This paper identifies a political economy channel of EMU as the monetary union implies that member states had to transfer or at least curtail their policy autonomy in several areas, such as monetary policy and fiscal policy. The paper shows that EMU has helped reduce the impact of political shocks on the domestic economy of member states but magnified the transmission of political shocks within the euro area. Equally importantly, economies with weak domestic policies and institutions exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity to domestic political shocks before EMU, but not thereafter. While this may entail that EMU has brought benefits to countries with weaker policies and institutions by insulating them from adverse political developments at home, a potential drawback is that it may provide weaker market discipline for domestic political stability. - Marcel Fratzscher and Livio Stracca.","[Fratzscher, Marcel; Stracca, Livio] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hassler, John] Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden",European Central Bank,"Fratzscher, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Our framework, which is valid under general conditions, can be used not only to detect past forecast breakdowns but also to predict future ones. We show that main causes of forecast breakdowns are instabilities in the data-generating process and relate the properties of our forecast breakdown test to those of structural break tests. The empirical application finds evidence of a forecast breakdown in the Phillips' curve forecasts of U.S. inflation, and links it to inflation volatility and to changes in the monetary policy reaction function of the Fed.","[Rossi, Barbara] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,,,"Rossi, Barbara/D-6756-2013","Rossi, Barbara/0000-0002-0410-0493",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,79,90,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Despite their essential function, weak legal and judicial institutions remain the norm across much of Eastern European and former Soviet Union. Barzel (2002) hypothesizes that the value of contract trade, as opposed to relationships and reputation, increases as products travel further and are more costly to inspect. Combining Barzel's theory with the high cost of searching for foreign buyers (Rauch, 1999), this article presents evidence that international trade played a significant role in the emergence of institutions. Search costs influence the potential to export value-added, or complex, products. The level of potential complex exports in turn influences the intensity with which businesses lobby for more credible legal and juridical institutions. Both a micro-level model and empirical evidence provide evidence consistent with an endogenous link between exports and legal and judicial institutions.","[Wanchek, Tanya] Univ Virginia, Weldon Cooper Ctr Publ Serv, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Wanchek, T (通讯作者)，POB 400206, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",tnw4j@virginia.edu,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The reasons given by the subjects for their behaviour suggest that the differences in behavior across the subject pools are driven by their different real life experiences. For example, when abstaining from corruption, public servants more often cite the need to reduce the social costs of corruption as a reason for their actions, and when engaging in corruption, they cite low government salaries or a belief that corruption is a necessary evil in the current environment. In contrast, students give more simplistic moral reasons.

The idea of industrial district is quite widespread in modern industrial economics and in business studies, with a variety of meanings and typologies. Indeed the real original conceptualisation dates back to Alfred Marshall and the economists of the so-called Cambridge school. Quite often the concept of industrial district is considered as synonymous with agglomeration, localisation and clustering. But, according to the meaning given originally by Marshall, these processes of industry 'territorialisation' are quite different from the more 'compound localisation' that is the Marshallian industrial district. Therefore, the aim of our contribution is focused on disentangling its original meaning from other subsequent interpretations, referring particularly to the debate on this subject that arose among the economists of the Cambridge School.","[Caldari, Katia] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Caldari, K (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",katia.caldari@unipd.it,,,,,,,31,72,86,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Utilising Pedroni's (1999 panel cointegrated test and the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) technique, we empirically examine the long-run co-movement relationship in a bivariate model between government popularity and macroeconomic outcomes as well as a lag term in accordance with updated data for 11 countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) during the 1975-2005 period. The results indicate the existence of panel cointegration relationships in our empirical model. The panel FMOLS shows that several macroeconomic shocks are responsible for positive contributions to government popularity, especially in regard to economic growth and government expenditures. By contrast, currency depreciation, higher interest payments, and a greater taxation burden on households all contribute to lower government support in our sample countries. Based on such evidence, important policy implications emerge for ECOWAS.","[Ying, Yung-Hsiang; Hsieh, Meng-Chi] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Shih Chien University,"Ying, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cpchang@mail3.kh.usc.edu.tw; yying@mail.nsysu.edu.tw; jagaqueen@gmail.com,,,,,,,62,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We estimate an equation system, which is based on theoretical grounds, for the Spanish market. We find that costs and demand benefits of airport dominance have to do with providing a high flight frequency. The high flight frequency that comes from the control of an airport network allows to be offered large discounts in fares to leisure travelers while charging higher fares for business travelers. Such benefits can seriously damage the competitive status of airlines that do not have a high airport presence. We conclude that a balanced allocation of airport slots is required to guarantee airline competition.","Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Fageda, X (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018","Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169",,,,,26,5,5,0,1,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Moreover, it assesses the statistical effect resulting from the enlargement of the European Union, and therefore the community of people for which inequality is measured. A three-level spatial decomposition of the overall personal inequality in the EU reveals that a fifth of its amount is attributed to the east-west income gap and that intra-regional inequality accounts for three quarters. The study detects a convergence of both average national income levels and within-country personal income inequality. Inequality is rising primarily in the Scandinavian social-democratic welfare states and decreasing in the Mediterranean countries of the EU15. In Eastern Central Europe, the rapid growth of inequality which had been observable during the first years of transition has come to an end.","[Hoffmeister, Onno] Commiss European Communities, L-2920 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Hoffmeister, Onno] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Hoffmeister, O (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Eurostat 5,Rue Alphonse Weicker, L-2920 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",Onno.HOFFMEISTER@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,69,14,14,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Owing to the spatial fixity of land, however, the question of possible spatial dependence in agricultural land prices arises. The presence of spatial dependence in agricultural land prices can have serious consequences for the hedonic model analysis. Ignoring spatial autocorrelation can lead to biased estimates in land price hedonic models. We propose using a flexible quantile regression-based estimation of the spatial lag hedonic model allowing for varying effects of the characteristics and, more importantly, varying degrees of spatial autocorrelation. In applying this approach to a sample of agricultural land sales in Northern Ireland we find that the market effectively consists of two relatively separate segments. The larger of these two segments conforms to the conventional hedonic model with no spatial lag dependence, while the smaller, much thinner market segment exhibits considerable spatial lag dependence.","Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Business Sch, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Kostov, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Business Sch, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",pkostov@uclan.ac.uk,"Kostov, Philip/A-4726-2013","Kostov, Philip/0000-0002-4899-3908",,,,,41,75,87,4,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The firm receives stochastic profit flows that are subject to progressive taxation. Tax progression arises from an exogenously given tax exemption threshold that makes the average tax rate increase with the tax base. The firm possesses an option to liquidate its operation, which is optimally exercised when the firm's profit flow reaches an endogenously determined threshold level (the liquidation trigger) from above. We show that the firm's liquidation trigger under progressive taxation increases with either a reduction in the tax exemption threshold or an increase in the corporate income tax rate. Corporate income taxes are thus not neutral when tax schedules are progressive. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach exploits the coherent aspects of choice that those positive models typically attempt to capture. It replaces the standard revealed preference relation with an unambiguous choice relation: roughly, x is ( strictly) unambiguously chosen over y (written xP*y) iff y is never chosen when x is available. Under weak assumptions, P* is acyclic and therefore suitable for welfare analysis; it is also the most discerning welfare criterion that never overrules choice. The resulting framework generates natural counterparts for the standard tools of applied welfare economics and is easily applied in the context of specific behavioral theories, with novel implications. Though not universally discerning, it lends itself to principled refinements.","[Bernheim, B.

It is then possible to distinguish, respectively, between an exogenous and an endogenous CP and, within the latter, between a short-run and a long-run CP.

One is that, given abatement technology investment decisions, it should attempt to ensure that firms which should produce do produce and firms which should not produce do not produce. This ex-post efficiency problem is not trivial when there is noise concerning the extent of environmental damage a firm does. We use a Bayesian information framework to show that the regulator may find it efficient to tax a firm that reads as a high (low) damage polluter at less (more) than the damage reading. Unfortunately when an abatement decision has to be made, this ex-post efficient tax system also dampens the incentive to abate. In the absence of wrong-firm concerns, a regulator can solve the abatement problem by an ex ante declaration that taxes will not be adjusted for signal noise. However, the regulator has a commitment problem as such taxes may not be ex-post efficient. The most appropriate policy may involve a combination of instruments.","[Feng, Hongli; Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Feng, Hongli; Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, CARD, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Feng, HL (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 560D Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",hfeng@iastate.edu; hennessy@iastate.edu,"Feng, Hongli/A-1662-2013","Feng, Hongli/0000-0001-7553-8145",,,,,16,0,0,1,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Some contributions to the literature, including Bullard and Mitra [2002. Learning about monetary policy rules. journal of Monetary Economics 49 (6), 1105-1139] and Evans and Honkapohja [2006. Monetary Policy, Expectations, and Commitment, Scandinavian journal of Economics 108, 15-38], have made significant headway in establishing certain features of monetary policy rules that facilitate learning. However a treatment of policy design for learnability in worlds where agents have potentially misspecified their learning models has yet to surface. This paper provides such a treatment. We begin with the notion that because the profession has yet to settle on a consensus model of the economy, it is unreasonable to expect private agents to have collective rational expectations. We assume that agents have only an approximate understanding of the workings of the economy and that their learning the reduced forms of the economy is subject to potentially destabilizing perturbations. The issue is then whether a central bank can design policy to account for perturbations and still assure the learnability of the model. We provide two examples one of which-the canonical New Keynesian business cycle model-serves as a test case. For different parameterizations of a given policy rule, we use structured singular value analysis (from robust control theory) to find the largest ranges of misspecifications that can be tolerated in a learning model without compromising convergence to an REE. In addition, we study the cost, in terms of performance in the steady state of a central bank that acts to robustify learnability on the transition path to REE.

This paper specifies a theoretical model of a school hiring teachers who are either traditional-completed a program of study in a teacher education program or alternative-entered teaching through an alternative path. We combine the implications of the theoretical model with the empirical literature on teacher labor markets to reach conclusions about how labor market policies would impact teacher quality. Perhaps the most important conclusion is that it is very likely that a regime of teacher licensure would lower teacher quality and student achievement. The key reason why licensure would lower teacher quality is that licensure fails to make the important distinction between marginal and average quality in hiring decisions.,"[Arias, J.

In this paper we show that, once institutional factors are introduced, integration may be detrimental to welfare. Exploiting a game theoretical approach, we consider the integration between two societies that only differ in their institutional structures. Two important results are derived. First, intercommunity integration may trigger the demise of the erstwhile internal arrangements. Second, the collapse of the domestic institutional equilibrium can lead to a loss of welfare for the community as a whole.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Belloc, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Publ Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",marianna.belloc@uniroma1.it,,"Belloc, Marianna/0000-0001-7330-2147",,,,,41,0,0,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This analysis examines whether the investment data compiled by national accountants underestimate productive ICT expenditure, and whether this is more pronounced in the case of industry than for services. For that purpose, we propose an assessment of the size of ICT inputs (termed 'indirect ICT investment') in non-ICT investment expenditure for France in 2000. The main result of our analysis is that the amount of 'indirect ICT investment' appears to be small, compared with 'direct ICT investment', suggesting that the biggest investors in ICT remain services, regardless of whether we consider 'direct' or 'direct' plus 'indirect investment'.","[Beretti, Paul-Antoine] Univ Mediterrane, GREQAM, Marseille, France; [Cette, Gilbert] Univ Mediterrane, CEDERS, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Beretti, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Mediterrane, GREQAM, Marseille, France.",paberetti@free.fr,,,,,,,6,5,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our main interest is in determining how neutrality in international affairs (non-membership in military alliances) affects defense spending. We find that neutrality is associated with a perception of lower levels of external threat; hence it confers economic benefits in the form of a smaller defense burden. However, neutrality does not fully insulate a country from variations in the level of external threat in the global system as perceived by members of military alliances. Swiss defense spending has tracked very closely the spending trends - but at a lower average level - of the United States and other NATO countries. To the extent that post-Cold War threats, such as international terrorism, materialize primarily in the context of existing security alliances, Swiss military spending patterns observed in 1975-2001 are likely to remain the same in the future.","[Bernauer, Thomas; Koubi, Vally] ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Koubi, Vally] Univ Bern, Oeschger Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Koubi, Vally] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Ernst, Fabio] Swiss Armed Forces Planning Staff, Ittigen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Koubi, V (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Seilergraben 49, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",vally.koubi@vwi.unibe.ch,,"Bernauer, Thomas/0000-0002-3775-6245",,,,,12,3,3,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This paper develops a simple model of judicial agency in which judges are corrupt and can be bribed by contracting parties. Higher-powered contracts expose contracting parties to more frequent and more severe corruption, which in turn lessens the incentives actually provided by the contract. Consequently the model predicts that individuals will commonly refrain from writing high-powered contracts, even when such contracts would be valuable absent judicial agency. I show that similar implications can also be obtained by considering other forms of imperfection in contract enforcement, such as variable expenditures on legal representation. I use the model to develop implications for the optimal punishment of individuals who are extorted by corrupt judges, and to establish circumstances under which a right-of-appeal is optimal.","Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Bond, P (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",pbond@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,6,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

In this regard, the paper faces two matters that are still open in the literature: the existence of a range of delta that can be used in different regions and the estimation of the most appropriate value of delta. For this aim, a Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out in order to generate 'true' multiregional I-O tables randomly. From the simulation, analyses based on probability distributions and regression were also carried out. Finally, these simulation results have been compared with those of an empirical case. Results confirm that there is actually a range of values of delta within which the best delta is more likely to fall. For the FLQ, this range is centred on 0.3 with an associated probability of 33% (if the width of the range is set at 0.1), whereas, for the AFLQ, the relevant range is between 0.3 and 0.4 with a probability by 38%. Finally, this paper provided a way to estimate the best d for a given region, without knowing the relevant and detailed economic structure at sectoral level.","Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Econ, Fac Econ G Fua, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Bonfiglio, A (通讯作者)，Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Econ, Fac Econ G Fua, Ancona, Italy.",a.bonfiglio@univpm.it,,"Bonfiglio, Andrea/0000-0001-5249-1217",,,,,9,30,36,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We found that teams repay with higher probability.

The dependence on information technology has grown far beyond our expectations. Many institutions have recognized the advantages of this development and entered the digital highway. Governments worldwide have begun to recognize the potential opportunities offered by ICT to fit with citizens' demands, and have started to introduce information and transactions online in what is now called e-Government. Regardless of how advanced is a country in terms of ICT infrastructure and deployment, many technical and non-technical obstacles must be faced in the adoption and dissemination of e-Government. Concerns about inadequate security and privacy safeguards in electronic networks can lead to distrust in applications of e-Government that might pose risks, such as through unwarranted access to sensitive personal information or vulnerability to online fraud or identity theft. Such concerns can be a major impediment to the take-up of e-Government services. This can also be affected by general trends in perceptions of trust in government, such as those caused by the attitude of a public administration to transparency and openness issues. In this context, many studies focusing on the citizen adoption of e-Government services suggest that trust, security and transparency are the major issues for e-government adoption. In the present article the attention was directed on the relation between trust and e-government. To fulfill this aim, an exploratory survey was undertaken with the goal to identify what factors could affect the citizens' trust in e-government services. The findings indicated that citizen's higher perception of technological and organisational trustworthiness, the quality and usefulness of e-Government services, the Internet experience and propensity to trust, directly enhanced the trust in e-Government. Age and privacy concerns have a negative influence over trust.","Acad Econ Studies, Res Ctr Publ Adm & Publ Serv, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Colesca, SE (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Res Ctr Publ Adm & Publ Serv, Calea Serban Voda 22-24, Bucharest, Romania.",sofiac@man.ase.ro,"Elena, Colesca Sofia/J-3528-2019","Colesca, Sofia/0000-0002-5590-0589",,,,,47,54,58,5,63,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Therefore, the present study introduces the robust modified M-estimator (MME) proposed by Yohai et al. (1991). In the case of growth regressions with fiscal variables it can be shown that LSE is biased and inefficient, whereas MME is not. The robust regressions ascertain a stable positive growth effect of public infrastructure and education.

We show that by shifting distributional assumptions from marginal utilities to the welfare measures themselves. a random parameters version of a censored logistic regression model (Cameron 1988) yields distributions of welfare measures more directly and without imposing any unnecessary assumption on the marginal utility of income.

The inability of the National Bank of Serbia to follow the aggressive reduction of the key interest rate that has been implemented by central banks in developed countries, partly explains the lack of a decline in shoo-term interest rates by the Serbian banking industry.

Public spending has two possible allocations: a direct subsidy to immobile households or a wage subsidy to mobile firms. We show that firms receive a lower net of tax subsidy in the high-productivity country than in the low-productivity one. Despite this less generous policy, the former country can host a larger share of firms, so that its total spending for firms can be higher than in the low-productivity country when trade costs are low enough. The welfare analysis suggests that the second-best optimum requires an increase in the subsidy to households in both countries when the economies axe weakly integrated or the productivity gap is low or the share of capital incomes redistributed outside the two economies is high.","[Exbrayat, Nelly; Rion, Stephane] Univ St Etienne, CREUSET, CNRS, F-42023 St Etienne 02, France; [Exbrayat, Nelly] Univ St Etienne, Wissensch Zentrum Berlin Sozialforsch, F-42023 St Etienne 02, France; [Gaigne, Carl] INRA, UMR1302, F-35042 Rennes, France",Universite Jean Monnet; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite de Rennes; INRAE,"Rion, S (通讯作者)，Univ St Etienne, CREUSET, CNRS, 6 Rue Basse Rives, F-42023 St Etienne 02, France.",exbrayat@wzb.eu; gaigne@rennes.inra.fr; stephane.riou@univ-st-eti-enne.fr,,"Gaigne, Carl/0000-0002-1540-234X; Exbrayat, Nelly/0000-0002-0566-504X",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Noted are high level of industry concentration in South African manufacturing, and a rising trend in concentration across a wide range of industries as measured by the Gini coefficient, though some countervailing evidence emerges on the Rosenbluth index, Analytically the paper examines the impact of concentration on employment and investment rates. Results show that increased concentration unambiguously lowers employment. For investment rates, increased inequality of market share serves to raise investment rates, while falling firm numbers for any given inequality of market share lowers investment rates. The difference is consistent with a disciplining effect of a competitive fringe of firms on the behaviour of large firms in a market. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These are commercial, such as the one trillion dollars of finance capital that circulates daily; or cultural. Some argue globalization represents a qualitative step away from earlier trends like internationalization; others use the term to contrast bilateral state-to-state flows with system-wide dynamics like environmental changes, or to indicate the simultaneous pressures on national level decision-making created from bottom up populist and participatory pressures, on the one hand, and top down transborder challenges on the other. Others use the term simply as an updated synonym for internationalization. The larger picture of global development that these trends paint isn't very encouraging. Despite efforts to develop the Third World, Third World peoples face higher levels of pollution, deforestation, overcrowding, and have lower standards of living and resource consumption. The larger conclusion we can draw from these statistics is that the First World's higher living standards, higher resource consumption, and less serious environmental problems are the direct result of developed countries exploiting the wealth, resources, and environment of the Third World. Despite First World efforts to develop the Third World, the majority of Third World people's lives and standard of living is lower than it was before 1945, when the developed nations led by the United States began in earnest to develop the Third World.","[Has, Aurelian; Radut, Carmen] Univ Constantin Brancoveanu Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University,,hasaurelian@yahoo.com; c_radut@yahoo.com,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,6,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,117,124,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS68,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287983800017,0

The revelations prompted the Mississippi legislature to authorize including on the November 1988 ballot a measure asking voters whether they favored switching to a more centralized 'unit system' of county governance or instead retaining the decentralized 'beat system' then in place in all but two of the state's 82 counties. We examine voters' decisions to participate in that election, in which 47 counties returned majorities for the unit system and 35 counties opted for the status quo. Controlling for participation in the 1988 presidential race and other relevant factors, we find that turnout rates for the beat-unit choice were positively correlated with supervisor corruption. We also find that the corrupt counties' higher voter turnouts were driven mainly by supporters of the corruption-prone beat system.","[Karahan, Goekhan R.] Delta State Univ, Div Management Mkt & Business Adm, Cleveland, MS 38733 USA; [Coats, R.

It plays an important part in shaping the political and economic image of the nation and its perceived global competitiveness. For this reason, sports sector is often treated not only as a tool for improving the physical and emotional well-being of the society, but also as a tool in the international area for promoting investment, developing international business linkages and socio-cultural relations between different cultures, as well as enhancing the political role of the nation. The growing economic attractiveness of sports makes it increasingly exposed to the participation of private business structures, which are interested in generating positive cash flows. In this context, the sports sector gradually evolves from being solely a public activity towards becoming a business sector, where the main role is played not by the athletes who strive for sportive goals, but business representatives who aim for an economic benefit. In the analysis of football business - one of the most commercialized sports nowadays - the systemic approach should be adopted The relevance of systemic approach relies on the assumption that in the sport business, benefit can only be achieved in close cooperation of various sport business subjects. Their linkages lead to the emergence of a certain business system. If sport is regarded as one of the business sectors, then the application of business system methodology can be fully justified. Football remains the most popular team-game in the world, which creates huge income flows in the most developed football countries and is a prospective business area in the emerging 'football countries. At present, economically strong football systems exist only in the developed countries, first of all - in Western Europe. In the less economically advanced countries, the developers of football face the challenge of football's economic assessment problem, which appears from not enough developed football business environment. The interest to create strong football business system calls for the search of the ways of popularizing football and boosting the economic potential of its participants. In the research literature, the analysis of football business is based on the presumption that it is a strong business sector, which is able to generate income and whose participants have the ability to perform at profit. However, such studies tend to ignore the business processes within the sports business. Besides, the systemic approach in football business is usually limited to presenting the structural elements of the system and the superficial analysis of their importance. These aspects can be better addressed by employing the business systems perspective. In this article we seek to structure football business by using the business system perspective. The outcome of this article is a more or less universal structure of football business system that enables a more thorough conceptual analysis of the football business (and, to some extent, the sport business as a whole).","[Karpavicius, Tomas; Jucevicius, Giedrius] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Karpavicius, T (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",t.karpavicius@ubig.lt; giedrius.jucevicius@ktu.lt,"Jucevicius, Giedrius/HPI-3903-2023",,,,,,45,5,6,2,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Controlling for the impact of re-distributional efforts by MLB, we find that the MR of a large-market team is about 50% larger than that of a small-market team.

We assume that Type Ys consider investing in human capital while Type Os have a certain predetermined level of human capital and do not consider changing it. Our model suggests that a government might consider imposing a MW exclusively for Type Y individuals and an EITC exclusively for Type O individuals.

Results indicate that individuals diagnosed with high cholesterol consume less cholesterol, fat, and saturated fat, and smoke less. However, using cholesterol-lowering drugs is correlated with increased fat and saturated fat intake, and larger waist size, after accounting for the endogeneity of choosing to use medicine.

To answer this question, we resort to a two-step empirical evaluation of our model. In a first step, we estimate the model by minimizing the distance between theoretical autocovariances of key macroeconomic variables and their VAR-based empirical counterparts. In a second step, we resort to Watson's [Watson, M.W., 1993. Measures of fit for calibrated models. Journal of Political Economy 101, 1011-1041.] procedure [Measures of fit for calibrated models. journal of Political Economy 101 (6), 1011.1041] to quantify the model's goodness-of-fit. Our main result is that the combination of sticky prices and sticky wages is central in order to obtain a good empirical fit. Our analysis also reveals that a model with only sticky wages does not perform well according to Watson's criterion [Watson, M.W., 1993.

The empirical analysis of different specifications shows a first evidence in favour of an EKC relationship with regard to waste generation. Nevertheless, the turning point (TP) is at very high levels of added value per capita (around 23 000-26 000), which concern a very limited number of wealthy Northern Italian provinces. Finally, the test on some waste management instruments proxies, leads to the conclusion that they are not yet impacting waste generation. To lower the TPs and to avoid an increasing gap between geographical areas, market based and more effective policy instruments should be implemented.

The marginal damages of sulfur dioxide (SO2) are driven by proximity to downtown Atlanta; emissions produced closer to the city lead to higher exposures and therefore damages. The spatial pattern in damages from nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are more complex because of the powerful role of atmospheric chemistry. NOx emissions from ground-level sources in downtown Atlanta reduce aggregate exposures to both the tropospheric ozone as well as small particulates. In contrast, NOx discharges in suburban or rural areas lead to higher exposures and damages from both pollutants.

However, this has not been shown empirically. This article is novel in presenting an empirical test of the fundamental assumption of the agency model that health-care professionals understand what their patients want. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are conducted simultaneously within samples of patients (women who gave birth) and care-givers (doctors and nurses), to elicit and contrast patients' authentic preferences (for five maternity ward attributes) with what care-givers believe them to be. Conclusion: agents have a biased perception of principals' preferences, and therefore a complete agency relationship does not exist. Our findings add a novel empirical contribution to the agency relationship literature. Moreover, parallel preference patterns of patients and care-givers are certainly of much interest to the field of health economics: Informing the unaware medical care-givers about the patients' preferences, will improve treatment and patients' satisfaction.","[Neuman, Shoshana] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Neuman, Shoshana] CEPR, London, England; [Neuman, Shoshana] I7A, Bonn, Germany",Bar Ilan University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Neuman, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",neumans@mail.biu.ac.il,,,,,,,15,6,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Although the implications of switching costs for consumers and firms have been well-documented in the literature, less attention has been paid to studying the consequences of switching costs for public policy. In general, switching costs have been shown to reduce market competition leading to higher prices, lower product and service quality, higher entry barriers and lower customer welfare. In order to gain more insight into the study of switching costs from a regulatory perspective and to evaluate the need for the regulator to intervene in the market, this study extends prior research in this field by measuring switching costs at the customer-level and investigating the switching costs distribution in the mobile phone market. The study results reveal that switching is costly in the mobile phone industry and that switching costs are highly heterogeneous among consumers.

Using this revision as a natural experiment, this study conducts a difference-in-differences estimation to examine the effect of punishment on juvenile crime. The analysis provides evidence that punishment can deter juvenile crime. In addition, this research examines the criminal behaviour of 13-year-olds, who face no change in punishment, but who soon will in the near future.

The problems in China's dairy industry were a result of rapid growth fueled by large investments from multinational dairy firms, development of a highly modem and concentrated processing sector that obtained its raw materials from millions of small, poor and uneducated traditional farmers and government support and encouragement for growth but with little emphasis on inspection and safety issues.

J,"Startiene, G; Remeikiene, R",,,,"Startiene, Grazina; Remeikiene, Rita",,,The Influence of Demographical Factors on the Interaction between Entrepreneurship and Unemployment,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment; demographic factors,SELF-EMPLOYMENT; DYNAMICS; WOMEN; TIME; MEN,"Lithuania has made a significant progress on institution-building and policymaking in support of entrepreneurship over the last ten years (Grundey et al., 2008); however, the constantly changing business environment, information-flow growth, processes of integration into the global market increase business risk, and this complicates the people's determination to start their own business (Remeikiene, Startiene, 2007; Voronova, 2008), because business itself cannot provide the projected free cash flow (Kazlauskiene, Christauskas, 2007); a business establishment is limited by the lack of financial support measures for the start ups and developments of small and medium-sized businesses (Tamosiunas, Lukosius, 2009); in order to survive in the market, firms are not only forced to recognize business risks, but must learn to manage them (Savcuk 2007). A person determined to become an entrepreneur must evaluate not only the external, but also personal circumstances. The article deals with an actual problem - the influence of demographical factors on the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment. The interaction between the entrepreneurship and unemployment is mainly analyzed through the two-way relationship between entrepreneurship and unemployment. The authors of studies (Thurik, 2003; Thurik, Verheul, 2002; Stel, Stunnberg, 2004; Audretsch, Carey, Thurik, 2002; Care, Stella, Thurik Audretsch, 2007) found that this relationship exists in the countries such as Japan, OECD countries. While studying the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment in other countries (Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom), the conclusion was made that economic analysis is insufficient in order to determine the bonds between them, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate all the chain of factors (cultural, demographic, political, psychological, technological)which determine the mutual relations between entrepreneurship and unemployment By the purpose of the article - the evaluation of the influence of demographical factors on the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment - the authors seek to show how demographic factors affect the development of entrepreneurship and reduce unemployment. Lithuanian and foreign scientists, examining the influence demographic factors on the entrepreneurship and unemployment, pays the highest attention to such demographic characteristics as gender, age, education, emigration, ethnic minorities, race, marital status, as they may determine the success of the business creation/survival or reduce the duration unemployment period The research provides interesting facts: individual demographic factors do not always positively influence entrepreneurship/unemployment It appears that the same factors may hinder the establishment of a business, or liberation from unemployment. The question is: why do the demographic factors explored have a twofold influence? Literature does not issue unambiguous answer, but the dual impact of demographic factors is based on the cultures of different countries, their political decisions,, traditions, climate difference or diversity of business fields. Deeper analysis of the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment through the prism of the demographical factors was encouraged by the fact that scientists tend to analyze only the effects of demographic factors on entrepreneurship, i.e. the significance of age, education, gender, ethnic minorities and others to business creation. There is the lack of studies which examine demographic factors with interpretation of the mutual bonds of entrepreneurship and unemployment. A systematic analysis of the literature leads to the conclusion that such demographic factors as one of parents'/spouse's being an entrepreneur, emigration, ethnic minorities, race and work experience encourage business creation, while the gender differences - hampers business. Moreover, the demographic factors (education, age, unemployment duration) were determined to affect the start ups of businesses differently. In practical part of the article Pearson's correlation and regression methods were used to examine the reliability presumptions raised. The conclusion was made that education of unemployed men as well as women significantly correlates with the indicator of the relation between the number of established companies with a ratio of the number of operating companies (R-men(2) = 0.74; R-women(2) = 0.77), education of unemployed women - with the number of newly registered enterprises (R-women(2) = 0.71), experience of unemployment - with the indicator of relation between the number of established companies and the number of operating companies (R-1-2(2) (months) = 0.81; R-3-5months(2) = 0.76) and experience of unemployment with the number of newly registered companies (R-1-2(2) (months) = 0.75). This shows that these factors are significant in incorporation of new companies as well as in existing business.","[Startiene, Grazina; Remeikiene, Rita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Startiene, G (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Laisves Av 55, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",grazina.startiene@ktu.lt; rita.remeikiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,66,20,23,3,58,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

J,"Tijunaitiene, R; Neverauskas, B",,,,"Tijunaitiene, Rigita; Neverauskas, Bronius",,,Activation of Participation Motivation Directed towards Agents: A Conceptual Model,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,motivation of participation; civil society organizations; participation; activation of motivation,EXPRESSION; MOTIVES,"A part of the results of the dissertation research of Tijunaitiene (2009) - the developed conceptual model of activation of participation motivation directed towards agents (CSOs), in which the means of activating participation motivation are proposed, is presented in this article. Tijunaitiene (2009) proposed two models (model is perceived, with reference to Denhardt (2001), not as an ideal form of organisation or the mode of organising, but as a real life representation), which are likely to be used by both managers of civil society organisations (hereafter - CSOs) and government officials, whose decisions must be accompanied by citizen participation. Specific means of activation of participation motivation are proposed in the models, however, the actual process of motivation should lead to their implementation, therefore the models are called not the models of motivation of participation in general, but the conceptual models of activation of motivation (especially as the studied citizens currently participate in various CSOs) to develop the existing motivation of participating citizens. As it was mentioned above, in this article one of the two models of activation of motivation, which were created after the measurement of the real motivation of participants, is presented. In order to measure the latter, the motives, which determine specific behaviour, were identified, the analysis of their expression was carried out (some aspects were presented in this journal in 2009, Vol. 1(61) (Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, Balciunas, 2009a) and in 2009, Vol. 3(63) (Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, Balciunas, 2009b), on the basis of which the conceptual models are introduced, as today namely the motives are the basis of motivating (Marcinkeviciute, 2003a, b, 2006). Having revealed the parameters of the expression of motivation (the complex of individualistic motives and collectivistic motives) and after their detailed analysis (the results are available in the dissertation of Tijunaitiene (2009)), the next stage is the proposal of possible (alternative) means of motivating, but the application of those (or any other) means depends on the managers of specific CSOs or government officials and different circumstances, therefore, the evaluation of results of the effect of particular means can be both the object of further academic research, and the concern of these institutions, which is not analysed in this article. Since motivating is not permanent, but constantly changing, it depends on the circumstances and the individual himself/herself, so it is difficult to offer (to answer) unambiguously, which means are the best for motivating. Different motives may act in different situations, moreover, one motive can be changed by another one, therefore it is necessary to monitor and analyse the reasons of participation of different individuals constantly. It can be stated that both developed models of motivating, hence, the model presented in this article as well, are suitable for a particular segment of citizens (currently participating in different CSOs). In this publication the conceptual model of activation of participation motivation directed towards agents (CSOs) is presented. It emerged on the ground of the analysis of collectivistic motives, measured in terms of attitudes, determining motivation to participate. The oneness of the model is that it can be used not for stimulation of motivation of participating citizens in general, but rather for selecting clusters of organisations specifically, in other words, if there is a need to activate those participating in certain segments of participants. The conceptual model of activation of participation motivation directed towards final customers (citizens), which emerged on the ground of the analysis of individualistic incentives, determining motivation to participate, was also developed As the proposed conceptual model is founded on most valued incentives, as well as on mostly experienced investments for likely future benefit (benefits), it can be stated that this model is based on enabling self-expression, because pleasure and greater self-realisation motivate most. The prerequisite of its successful implementation is the use of complex means, i.e. using proposed means, reducing the influence of mostly experienced investments. However, as the volume of the article is limited it will not be presented in this publication Presented examples of activation of motivation in both models can be used as information, disseminated by traditional marketing means (during events, campaigns of TV commercials, during conferences, symposiums, etc.).","[Tijunaitiene, Rigita] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Neverauskas, Bronius] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Siauliai University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Tijunaitiene, R (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu Str 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",rigita@smf.su.lt; bronius.neverauskas@klu.lt,,,,,,,33,5,5,1,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We draw on this stylized fact to construct a model where two firms in the same industry offer transfer payments in exchange for user-specific R&D services from a common laboratory. Inter-firm and within-laboratory externalities affect the intensity of competition among delegating firms on the intermediate market for technology. Whether competition is relatively soft or tight is reflected by each firm's monetary offers to the laboratory. These offers determine the R&D outcomes, the laboratory's capacity to earn benefits, the profits for the delegating firms, as well as social welfare. We identify the situations in which the laboratory finds it profitable to deliver services to only one firm, or to both of them. In the latter case we compare the delegated R&D game to two other ones where firms conduct in-house R&D, either cooperatively or non-cooperatively. The delegated R&D game Pareto dominates the other two games, and the laboratory earns positive benefits, if and only if R&D services are complementary inside the laboratory, but only limitedly so, and inter-firm spillovers are sufficiently low. The firms' privately-profitable decision to delegate R&D, when the laboratory participates, always benefits consumers.","[Versaevel, Bruno] CNRS, GATE, UMR 5824, F-75700 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),,versaevel@em-lyon.com; d.vencatachellum@afdb.org,,"VERSAEVEL, Bruno/0000-0003-2866-2228",,,,,58,3,3,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Recent evidence from the U.K. suggests that for a given level of prior achievement in secondary school a disadvantaged student has as much chance of enrolling in a university as a more advantaged student. However, simply participating in higher education is not sufficient--graduation is important. Therefore, this paper investigates whether students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have a higher rate of university dropout when compared to their wealthier counterparts, allowing for their differential prior achievement. Using a combination of school and university administrative data sets, we show that there is indeed a sizeable and statistically significant gap in the rate of withdrawal after the first year of university between advantaged and disadvantaged English students. This socioeconomic gap in university dropouts remains even after allowing for their personal characteristics, prior achievement in secondary school and university characteristics. In the English context, at least, this implies that retention in university of disadvantaged students is arguably a more important policy issue than barriers to entry for these students.",,,,,"Powdthavee, Nattavudh/I-2573-2013; GAMBOA, THOMAS/A-4646-2011; Powdthavee, Nattavudh/K-7230-2019",,,,,,38,43,56,1,29,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The expenditure for national defence contributes a lot to China's economic growth, whereas to some extent negatively affects the justice of rural-urban income distribution. The expenditure for social service culture and education plays a limited role in promoting economic growth, and to some extent negatively affects the justice of rural-urban income distribution. The administrative expense is large both in absolute and relative amount, while its effects on promoting economic growth and the fairness of rural-urban income distribution is relatively weak. The expenditure on social security and policy subsidies doesn't have much effect on economic growth, but it greatly improves the justice of rural-urban income distribution.

Moreover, the unobservable determinants driving money and time donations are positively correlated, suggesting a certain degree of complementarity between the two decisions.

This implies that the value of UI depends on age at job loss, consumption needs (such as the presence of children), discount rates, the return on saving, access to credit and the presence of other social insurance programmes.

When the refined models are applied to the Danish balance of payments, the largest improvements are observed for outward and inward FDI separately.

Under quite general conditions of competition, theory suggests that lower termination charges will result in higher prices for mobile subscribers, a phenomenon known as the waterbed effect. The waterbed effect has long been hypothesized as a feature of many two-sided markets and especially the mobile telephony industry. Using a uniquely constructed panel of mobile operators prices and profit margins across more than twenty countries over six years, we document empirically the existence and magnitude of this effect. Our results suggest that although regulation reduced termination rates by about 10%, this also led to a 5% increase in mobile retail prices. We also provide evidence that both competition and market saturation, and most importantly their interaction, affect the overall impact of the waterbed effect on prices.","[Genakos, Christos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",Athens University of Economics & Business; Imperial College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Genakos, C (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",cgenakos@aueb.qr; t.valletti@imperial.ac.uk,"Genakos, Christos/G-7782-2015; Genakos, Christos/ACH-5893-2022","Genakos, Christos/0000-0002-0147-8108; Valletti, Tommaso/0000-0001-9728-5513",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,28,56,59,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

It goes on to discuss how the disciplined and integrated stock/flow presentation of national accounts could be more fully exploited to assess such questions as the adequacy and sustainability of national and public investment and to inform better macroeconomic and macro-prudential polices. It describes extended usage of the national accounts to assess government's own direct contribution to the generation of value, in the form of public services. In the same vein, distributionally adjusted national accounts could be used to provide evidence not just about the material prosperity of a society in aggregate but about trends in material wellbeing across the income distribution. There is clearly no reason why these trends should all be the same. Finally, it goes on to discuss the currently topical (deservedly) measurement of national wellbeing.

It considers the past, and therefore supply-side models, such as the standard neoclassical, juxtaposed against essentially demand-side approaches such as the export-base and cumulative causation models (as integrated into the Kaldorian approach); before moving on to the 'present' and more recent versions of the neoclassical model involving spatial weights and 'convergence clubs', as well as new economic geography core-periphery models, and the 'innovation systems' approach. A key feature of the more recent literature is an attempt to explicitly include spatial factors into the model, and thus there is a renewed emphasis on agglomeration economies and spillovers. Discussing 'present' and 'future' approaches to regional growth overlaps with the current emphasis in the literature on the importance of more intangible factors such as the role of 'knowledge' and its influence on growth. Finally, there is a discussion of the greater emphasis that needs to be placed at the 'micro-level' when considering what drives growth, and thus factors such as inter alia firm heterogeneity, entrepreneurship and absorptive capacity.","[Harris, Richard] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,,,,"Harris, Richard/0000-0001-8066-3629",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,185,55,67,0,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We employ a computable general equilibrium framework to numerically examine the reforms for an aging Japan in the dynamic context of overlapping generations. Our simulation produced the following results: first, an increase in the co-payment rate, a prominent feature of the 2006 reform, would promote economic growth and welfare by encouraging private saving. Second, the ex-post moral hazard behavior following the increase in co-payment rates, however, reduces economic growth. Third. Japan's trend of increasing the future public health insurance benefits can mainly be explained by its aging population, and increasing the co-payment rate does little to reduce future payments of public health insurance benefits. Fourth, the effect on future economic burdens of reducing medical costs through efficiencies in public health insurance, emphasis on preventive medical care, or technological progress in the medical field is small. Finally, a policy of maintaining public health insurance at a fixed percentage of GDP will require reducing public health insurance benefits, perhaps up to 45% by 2050. Such a policy also reduces economic growth until approximately 2035. Our simulation indicates that the reform does not significantly reduce future public health insurance benefits, but it can enhance economic growth and welfare by encouraging private saving.

However, there are only a limited number of studies on the influence that such an increase has had on the labor market in the Republic of Korea. Thus, using 'Workplace Panel Survey' data surveyed by the Korea Labor Institute (KLI), this paper examines the relationship concerning the labor demand of an establishment between domestic temporary and foreign workers. Analysis using a bivariate Tobit model shows that a typical Korean firm attempts to employ domestic temporary and foreign workers simultaneously. Further, the empirical analysis found that any establishment that is relatively newly established and has difficulty in recruiting domestic workers hires foreign workers, but there is no evidence that establishments hire foreign workers rather than domestic temporary workers to save on the production cost.

Each farmer engages in trade with his m adjacent neighbors, where m is termed the span of interaction. Trade is governed by a prisoner's dilemma rule of engagement. A farmer's payoff is the sum of the payoffs from the m prisoner's dilemma games played with his m/2 neighbors to the left, and with his m/2 neighbors to the right. When a farmer dies, his son takes over. The son who adheres to his father's span of interaction decides whether to cooperate or defect by considering the actions taken and the payoffs received by the most prosperous member of the group comprising his father and his father's m trading partners. Under a conventional structure of payoffs, it is shown that a large span of interaction is detrimental to the long-run coexistence of cooperation and defection, and conditions are provided under which the social outcome associated with the expansion of trade when individuals trade with a few is better than that when they trade with many. Under the stipulated conditions it is shown, by means of a static comparative analysis of the steady state configurations of the farmer population, that an expansion of the market can be beneficial in one context, detrimental in another.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Stark, Oded; Behrens, Doris A.] Univ Klagenfurt, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Behrens, Doris A.] Vienna Univ Technol, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",University of Bonn; University of Klagenfurt; University of Vienna; University of Warsaw; Warsaw School of Economics; Technische Universitat Wien,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de; doris.behrens@uni-klu.ac.at,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The assessment of decisions as to the timing and volume of funding of a project is extremely important and relevant for any organisation; therefore, it has been considered necessary to explore different models for possible financing by applying empiric and financial models, as well as theoretical mathematical methods. The objective of the present research exercise was to develop an optimal model for the appropriation of financing of defined scope according to different financing scenarios. For that purpose the researchers used a hypothetical reference heuristic financing appropriation plan for four periods of identical duration in three construction objects. By reference to the linear programming theory an optimal plan was identified by assigning, in individual periods and to each object, different priorities rated in points. The financing appropriation plans are assessed in terms of their impact upon the enterprise value that is computed applying the cash flow discounting method and the tax shield effect theory. Since the selection of the financing source is an important factor for the enterprise value the calculations were performed assessing three possible scenarios of the enterprise financing taking into account the enterprise's liquidity: a - an enterprise has accumulated sufficient own funds to finance the project, b - an enterprise has accumulated funds sufficient only to pay the interest for borrowed capital, c - an enterprise does not possess any disposable monetary resources to finance the project during its implementation, therefore it capitalizes the interest payable to the bank. It was concluded that under scenario a the selection of a financing plan does not affect the enterprise value, as the enterprise finances the investment from own resources. In the case of scenario b the loan obtained from the purpose of the investment creates additional value, the choice of the plan, however, does not affect the enterprise value. When capitalising the interest payable to the bank under scenario c, the highest value of an enterprise is created in the case of selection of an optimal plan that is developed by setting an overall limit of the amount to be funded, i.e., by prioritizing mathematical logics without referring to the up-front appropriation of financial resources by objects. The present article deals with the theory of the evaluation of investment project solutions. The results of the evaluation of the solutions for construction project financing appropriation are presented by criteria for optimal solutions and possible financing scenarios.","[Stunguriene, Stanislava; Urbsiene, Laima] Vilnius Univ, Int Business Sch, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Stunguriene, S (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Int Business Sch, Sauletekio Al 22, LT-10225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ststunguriene@centras.lt; laima.urbsiene@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,1,1,0,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

To get around the endogeneity of paternal migration, I use individual fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation (FEIV) where the instrumental variables are based on U.S. city-level employment statistics in two industries popular with Mexican immigrants. Overall, the estimates suggest that in the short-run, children reduce study hours and increase work hours in response to a father's U.S. migration. Decomposing the sample into sex- and age-specific groups suggests that this is mainly driven by the effects of paternal migration on 12-15 year-old boys. These results are consistent with a story in which the immediate aftermath of a father's migration is one of financial hardship that is borne in part by relatively young children.

We model Carbon price returns and industrial production as nonlinear and state-dependent, with dynamics depending on the sign and magnitude of past realization of returns and the growth of industrial production. Our findings show that (i) macroeconomic activity is likely to affect carbon prices with a lag, due to the specific institutional constraints of this environmental market; (ii) the joint dynamics of industrial production and carbon prices seem adequately captured by two-regime threshold vector error-correction and two-regime Markov-switching VAR models compared to linear models as main competitors.

In our model, there is a continuum of consumers, who use the search engine's pool, and there is a continuum of firms, whose entry to the pool is restricted by a price-per-click set by the search engine. We show that a monopolistic search engine may have an incentive to set a relatively low price-per-click that encourages low-relevance advertisers to enter the search pool. In general, the ratio between the marginal and average relevance in the search pool induced by the search engine's policy is equal to the ratio between the search engine's profit per consumer and the equilibrium product price. These conclusions do not change if the search engine charges a fixed access fee rather than a price-per-click.","[Eliaz, Kfir] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",Brown University; Tel Aviv University; University of London; University College London,"Eliaz, K (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",kfir_eliaz@Brown.edu,,,,,,,6,49,58,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0133,,,ECON J,Econ.

We consider the possibility that the age-price relationship has changed over time by: (a) estimating separate age-price functions for three generational groups of artists-those born before 1880, between 1880 and 1920, and after 1920 and thus coming of age in the world of post-war 'contemporary art' and (b) estimating a parameterization where the shape of the age-price profile is permitted to change continuously depending on the year of birth of the artist.

Using a unique dataset of firm-level surveys that are representative of the entire Indian manufacturing industry, I show that India's unilateral reduction in final goods tariffs increased the average productivity of small, informal firms, which account for 80% of Indian manufacturing employment but have been excluded from previous studies. In contrast, the increase in productivity among larger, formal firms was driven primarily by the concurrent reduction in input tariffs. By examining the effect of the tariff liberalization on the distributions of productivity and firm size, I find evidence consistent with the exit of the smallest, least productive firms from the informal sector. In addition, I find that although the decline in final goods tariffs did not significantly impact average formal sector productivity, it did increase productivity among the top quantiles of the distribution.

In the model, demand for liquidity takes the form of demand for money to make payments. We show that banks can provide elastic aggregate liquidity by creating and lending out deposits, which will reduce the need for people to sell assets and help maintain asset price stability. We also compare two types of liquidity provision mechanisms. The first is liquidity-risk-sharing through a Diamond-and-Dybvig style coalition that pools together people's resources, and the second is liquidity provision by banks though money creation. We show that without elastic aggregate liquidity provided by banks, coalitions can not actually perform their risk-sharing function, their attempt to sell assets to raise liquidity will only make asset prices decrease further, without actually raising more liquidity for shareholders hit by liquidity shocks. However, with banks providing elastic aggregate liquidity, people can indeed achieve better risk-sharing though coalitions. Finally, we show that the central bank can help banks provide liquidity to the market by lending to banks at low interest rates during the inter-bank settlement process, so as to relax the liquidity constraint of banks.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Qiu, JF (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiujunfeng@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,11,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The tax instruments at the government's disposal are a fixed (per-firm) fee and a linear tax on output. If all firms in an industry are taxed, we show that it is optimal to impose a positive fee to internalize administrative costs. The output taxes satisfy the inverse elasticity rule for taxed industries, but industries with sufficiently high administrative costs should be exempted from taxation. We also investigate the case where firms with outputs below a cutoff level can be exempted from taxation. It may be optimal to set the cutoff high enough to exempt a sizable number of firms, even though some firms reduce their outputs to the cutoff level, creating a missing middle: small and large firms - but not those of intermediate size - exist.

TESTBED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH IV AND HG VALUES,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HYPOTHETICAL BIAS; CONTINGENT VALUATION; ELICITATION; AUCTION,"Hypothetical bias is a long-standing issue in stated preference and contingent valuation studies-people tend to overstate their preferences when they do not experience the real monetary consequences of their decision. This view, however, has been challenged by recent evidence based on the elicitation of induced values (IV) in the lab and home-grown (HG) demand function from different countries. This paper uses an experimental design to assess the extent and relevance of hypothetical bias in demand elicitation exercises for both induced (IV) and homegrown (HG) values. For testbed purpose, we use a classic second-price auction to elicit preferences. Comparing the demand curve we elicit in both, hypothetical bias unambiguously (i) vanishes in an IV, private good context and (ii) persists in HG values elicitation context. This suggests hypothetical bias in preference elicitation appears to be driven by preference formation rather than preference elicitation. In addition, companion treatments highlight two sources of the discrepancy observed in the HG setting: the hypothetical context leads bidders to underestimate the constraints imposed by their budget limitations, whereas the real context creates pressure leading them to bid zero to opt out from the elicitation mechanism. As a result, there is a need for a demand elicitation procedure that helps subjects take the valuation exercise sincerely, but without putting extra pressure on them.","[Jacquemet, Nicolas] Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France; [Joule, Robert-Vincent] Univ Provence, Lab Psychol Sociale, F-13621 Aix En Provence 1, France; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Aix-Marseille Universite; University of Wyoming,"Jacquemet, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",Nicolas.Jacquemet@univ-paris1.fr; joule-rv@up.univ-aix.fr; stephane.luchini@univmed.fr; JRamses@uwyo.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019; Jiang, Adam/G-7505-2011; Jacquemet, Nicolas/F-4736-2010","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Jacquemet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5056-9225",,,,,38,12,12,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We then present a small open economy model with productivity shocks and countercyclical interest rates. The model incorporates a working capital requirement and the Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) preference that allows for flexible parameterization of the strength of income effects on labor supply. The model can account for the high volatility of wage and consumption relative to output and countercyclical trade balances that characterize emerging-market economies. During economic downturns, rising interest rates in emerging markets induce relatively large income effects on labor supply, so households would not reduce their labor input as much even though wages drop significantly.

Moreover, the principal's auditing effort is unverifiable in our model. Therefore, besides the agent's misreporting incentive, there is the principal's incentive to accuse the truthful agent even without auditing. If the principal's auditing effort is verifiable, granting no exit option to the agent is optimal although the principal can still accuse a truthful agent after the audit. We show that when the principal's auditing effort is unverifiable, granting an exit option to the agent and auditing are complementary. Without granting an exit option to the agent, no auditing is optimal, and the principal grants an exit option to conduct a sincere audit, which in turn mitigates the agent's misreporting incentive. Our analysis also reveals that, when the cost of auditing is sufficiently large, the principal conducts more sincere audits with a smaller amount of penalty.","[Yun, Sungho] Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Ansan, Kyunggi Do, South Korea; [Shin, Dongsoo] Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Hanyang University; Santa Clara University,"Yun, S (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Ansan 426791, Kyunggi Do, South Korea.",uwyunsh@hanyang.ac.kr,"yun, sungho/Q-9971-2019","Yun, Sungho/0000-0001-6380-9534",,,,,25,0,0,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Because neuroeconomics is a young discipline, a sufficiently sound structural model of how the brain makes choices is not yet available. However, the contours of such a computational model are beginning to arise; and, given the rapid progress, there is reason to be hopeful that the field will eventually put together a satisfactory structural model. This paper has two goals: First, we provide an overview of what has been learned about how the brain makes choices in two types of situations: simple choices among small numbers of familiar stimuli (like choosing between an apple or an orange), and more complex choices involving tradeoffs between immediate and future consequences (like eating a healthy apple or a less-healthy chocolate cake). Second, we show that, even at this early stage, insights with important implications for economics have already been gained.","[Fehr, Ernst] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of Zurich; California Institute of Technology,"Fehr, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",ernst.fehr@econ.uzh.ch; rangel@hss.caltech.edu,,,Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [0922982] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),,,113,158,186,1,59,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

However, the design of these schemes is rather complex and the effects of GSP have been found to be controversial. In our empirical analysis, based on an extensive dataset covering most of world trade, we find that GSP tends to foster developing countries' exports in the short-run, but hampers them in the long-run. Also, GSP granting countries are able to promote their own exports initially, while in the long-run their exports decrease. Taken together, GSP does not seem to be a suitable instrument to promote sustainable economic growth and development of low-income countries.","[Wagner, Marco] Stat Bundesamt, German Council Econ Experts, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Herz, Bernhard] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Econ, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Wagner, M (通讯作者)，Stat Bundesamt, German Council Econ Experts, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.",Bernhard.Herz@uni-bayreuth.de; Marco.Wagner@destatis.de,,,,,,,23,27,32,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

By drawing upon a special feature of human nature, that is the sense of gain and loss affiliated with initial ownership as described by the prospect theory in Kahneman and Tversky (1979), we find that it helps mitigate the inefficiency stemming from the agency problem. In particular, there exists a most desirable level of 'managerial irrationality' that completely offsets the social efficiency loss inflicted by the moral hazard problem. Moreover, less control right should be allocated to outside investors and more compensation should be granted to the manager as the latter reveals more serious concern about his ownership gain and loss.","[Lin, Yu-Hsiu] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Hu, Len-Kuo] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Chengchi University,"Lin, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, 415 Chien Kung Rd, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.",yushiu@cc.kuas.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using data on Italian households for 2004, we assess the strength of tax morale by relying on single items as well as composite multi-item indices. Our main result that fiscal honesty generates a higher hedonic payoff than cheating is in line with Harbaugh et al. (2007)'s neuroeconomic finding. Further, it sheds light on the well-known puzzle of compliance, that is the fact that many individuals pay taxes even when expected penalty and audit probability are extremely low: tax compliance is less puzzling once we show that not only it is materially costly, but also provides sizeable non-pecuniary benefits that make it rewarding in itself.

This reform increased the mandatory retirement age and simultaneously it set a tax levied on early retirement windows paid by firms to their older workers, to encourage them to leave their job early. We use a matching model with endogenous job destruction extended to account for a mandatory retirement age and we calibrate the model with data drawn from the French Labor Force Surveys for the years 2002 and 2003. We show that in the case of a high tax rate, delaying retirement raises job separation rates, which partially offsets its positive effect on job finding rates. Consequently, the combination of an increase in the retirement age and a taxation on early retirement windows may have negative effects on the employment rate among older workers.

J,"Morgan, J; Olsen, W",,,,"Morgan, Jamie; Olsen, Wendy",,,Conceptual issues in institutional economics: clarifying the fluidity of rules,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper addresses the issue of how rules are conceptualized by Hodgson in Old Institutional Economics (OIE). The argument is put forward that the concept of rules can be constructively clarified. Rather than provide a general form of single rules within a rule system, we argue for a taxonomic range of single rule forms. This approach has the additional advantage of providing a more explicit account of how rules operate as part of a rule system. It also provides one way to address the fluidity of rules. Rules are understood to be more or less fluid (incomplete) and subject to a practical dynamism. This, we argue, can be differentiated from the idea of tendency based on the capacity of agents not to follow rules. A useful concept here is that of 'mezzo rules' or recodifications that both define the rule and distance the agent from their own rule-following behaviour. In pursuing the argument we also highlight various methodological implications. First, conceptual development is a key aspect of the OIE, particularly when it is located within Dow's structured pluralism. As such elaboration on rule forms enhances the consistency of OIE as methodology. Second, the exploration of a taxonomic range of rules and of forms of fluidity can provide useful resources in mapping out institutional processes in real research.","[Morgan, Jamie] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Olsen, Wendy] Univ Manchester, IDPM, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Helsinki; University of Manchester,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Global Governance Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",zen34405@zen.co.uk,"Olsen, Wendy/B-8586-2014","Olsen, Wendy/0000-0003-1440-5810",,,,,71,9,9,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Further, intrafirm prices have been shown to differ from arm's length prices in each of these characteristics. This paper develops a state-dependent model of price setting by strategic intermediate goods producers that anticipate and respond to their competitors' actions.

A rise in real energy price reduces the degree of persistence in the investment adjustment cost function. Panel results suggest that in manufacturing a 1% rise in real energy price reduces investment by a country's firms by 1.9% relative to that by firms in other countries with a smaller effect for non-manufacturing firms. The negative effect of a higher relative price of energy on firm-level investment is significantly less marked the larger the firm. Results imply that stabilizing the relative price of energy would steady firm investment with greater gains in stability at smaller and medium sized firms. Results are robust to consideration of country business cycle effect and firm leverage. Estimation of investment is based on the Euler equation approach with over 21,000 observations.

It finds that politicians' gender affects policy, but that their social position, i.e., their caste, should be taken into account as well. Female legislators in seats reserved for lower castes and disadvantaged tribes invest more in health and early education and favor women-friendly laws, such as amendments to the Hindu Succession Act, which was designed to give women the same inheritance rights as men. They also favor redistributive policies, such as land reforms. In contrast, female legislators from higher castes do not have any impact on women-friendly laws, oppose land reforms, invest in higher tiers of education and reduce social expenditure. The causal effect of female legislators is estimated using close elections between women and men. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A large body of literature evaluates the extent to which the Supplemental Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) has accomplished this goal, but most studies have been based on research designs that compare program participants to non-participants. If selection into these programs is non-random then such comparisons will lead to biased estimates of the program's true effects. In this study we use the rollout of the WIC program across counties to estimate the impact of the program on infant health. We find that the implementation of WIC led to an increase in average birth weight and a decrease in the fraction of births that are classified as low birth weight. We find no evidence that these estimates are driven by changes in fertility or selection into live births. Our preferred estimates suggest that WIC initiation raised average birth weight by 2 g, or by 7 g among infants born to mothers with low education levels. These translate into estimated birth weight increases among participating mothers of approximately 18 to 29g. Estimated treatments on the treated impacts among infants born to participating mothers with low education are of similar magnitude. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find negative employment effects in the short term for all program types, effects whose magnitude and persistence is directly related to program duration.

The distributional effects of road pricing with heterogeneity in values of time and schedule delay,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Traffic congestion; Road pricing; Heterogeneity; Distributional impacts; Bottleneck model,PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION; MODEL; POLICIES,"This paper analyses the efficiency and distributional impacts of congestion pricing in Vickrey's (1969) dynamic bottleneck model of congestion, allowing for continuous distributions of values of time and schedule delay. We find that congestion pricing can leave a majority of travellers better off even without returning the toll revenues to them. We also find that the consumer surplus losses or gains from tolling are not strictly monotonic in the value of time, because they also depend on the value of schedule delays. The greatest losses are not incurred by drivers with the lowest value of time, but by users with an intermediate value of schedule delays and the lowest value of time for that value of schedule delays. For second-best pricing with an untolled alternative, the pattern of distributional effects is quite similar to that for first-best pricing. In contrast with results from prior static models, users who are indifferent between the two alternative routes are not the ones who gain least from this type of second-best pricing. Our results suggest that, in assessing the distributional impacts of road congestion pricing, it is important to take into account both the distribution of the value of time and of the value of schedule delays, as well as the dynamics of departure time choice.

The lagged ethical ETF returns unilaterally influence current stock index returns or the bilateral relationships between them. This article sheds new light on the selection process involved in ethical ETFs and may provide clues for fund managers as they reward investors who prefer ethical value investments.","Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Chungli 32023, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Chen, JH (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Finance, Chungli 32023, Taiwan.",johui@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,10,9,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The expert receives a set of arguments, and each argument favors one of two alternatives. He can disclose each argument credibly, but cannot prove whether he has disclosed everything. In all equilibria, the biased expert sends messages containing arguments both for and against his preferred alternative. However, the decision maker is not influenced by the unfavorable arguments revealed by the biased expert. The latter is able to convince the decision maker to choose the biased expert's preferred alternative only if he reveals sufficiently many favorable arguments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We use a panel of antiulcer prescriptions from Italian physicians between 1990 and 1992 and focus on a new molecule available since 1990. We solve the model by calculating physicians' optimal decision rules as functions of their beliefs about the new pharmaceutical. According to our counterfactuals, physicians' initial pessimism and uncertainty can have large, negative effects on their propensity to prescribe the new drug and on expected health outcomes. In contrast, subsidizing the new good can mitigate informational losses.","[Ferreyra, Maria Marta] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kosenok, Grigory] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",Carnegie Mellon University; New Economic School,"Ferreyra, MM (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",mferrey@andrew.cmu.edu; gkosenok@nes.ru,,,,,,,27,8,13,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0095-2583,,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Examples of background risks include uncertain labor income, uncertainty about the terminal value of fixed assets such as housing and uncertainty about future tax liabilities. While some of these risks are additive and have been amply studied, others are multiplicative in nature and have received far less attention. The simultaneous effect of both additive and multiplicative risks has hitherto not received attention and can explain some paradoxical choice behavior. We rationalize such behavior and show how background risks might lead to seemingly U-shaped relative risk aversion for a representative investor. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
