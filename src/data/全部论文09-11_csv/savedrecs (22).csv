Cheating may be especially tempting when one player has an advantage over another. We show that when audit probabilities are low (high), the leading (trailing) player has more incentive to cheat. Furthermore, we show that correlated audits are more effective at decreasing the frequency of cheating than independent audits. Finally, we show that differential monitoring schemes, where contestants are audited based on either their initial position or final ranking, more efficiently achieve full deterrence than schemes that monitor contestants with equal probability.","[Stowe, C.

This helps understand various possible linkages between poverty, growth and inequality. It might also help design policies to improve both equity and welfare. The tools are applied using the recent 2004 Nigerian national household survey. Interesting insights emerge from both the analytical and empirical analyses. One such insight is that both the sign and the size of the elasticities can be quite sensitive to the choice of measurement assumptions (such as the choice of inequality and poverty-aversion parameters, and that of the poverty line). The elasticities are also very much distribution-sensitive and dependent on the type of inequality-changing processes taking place. This also suggests that the response of poverty to growth can also be expected to be significantly context-specific.","[Araar, Abdelkrim; Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Araar, Abdelkrim; Duclos, Jean-Yves] Univ Laval, CIRPEE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Duclos, Jean-Yves] CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Madrid, Spain",Laval University; Laval University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Araar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",aabd@ecn.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,41,8,9,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In this paper we examine the basis for these criticisms, and explore how far and in what ways NEG models might be made more credible with respect to their representation of geography and history, and particularly whether and to what extent the work of geographers themselves provides some insights in this regard. We argue that the conceptualization of space and time is in fact a challenge for both NEG theorists and economic geographers, and that, notwithstanding their ontological and epistemological differences, both groups would benefit from an interchange of ideas on this front.","[Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Dept Int Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Groningen; University of Cambridge,"Garretsen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Int Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",j.h.garretsen@rug.nl; rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023",,,,,,107,75,80,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

This paper addresses that argument and concludes that cap-and-trade will need to be accompanied by complementary regulatory measures. While it is a necessary component in a climate mitigation programme, it is unlikely to be sufficient by itself to accomplish the desired emission reductions. The paper reviews the evidence on how SO2 emissions were reduced and the extent to which actual emission trading was responsible for the reduction as opposed to other innovations. It also identifies differences between the past regulation of SO2 and other air pollutants and the challenges presented by the regulation of GHG emissions. What actually happened in the US with SO2 emission trading deviated in several significant respects from what would be predicted based on the conventional theoretical analysis. While there was a dramatic reduction in SO2 emissions, it occurred because of several factors, some of which are unlikely to apply for GHG emissions, and others of which argue for an activist regulatory policy by the government as a complement to the functioning of an emissions market for GHGs.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hanemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hanemann@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,85,21,24,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

On the one hand, leaving environmental protection to the free market, relying on notions of corporate social responsibility and altruistic consumer and shareholder preferences, will not deliver optimal results. On the other hand, nationalizing the delivery of environmental protection is likely to fail because nation states rarely have the depth and quality of information required to instruct all the relevant agents to make appropriate decisions. Thus, as for many areas of policy, appropriate models of environmental intervention will lie between these two extremes. While it is impossible to specify general rules concerning the precise form of intervention, in part because the type of intervention depends upon value judgements, this paper sets out some of the considerations that are particular to environmental policy, and explores several principles for policy design, including information, coordination, and principal-agent problems, with a particular focus on the international context.","[Hepburn, Cameron] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hepburn, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England.",cameron.hepburn@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,71,58,64,6,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In this paper, we bring new information to the current literature by applying non-linear panel unit root test of Exponential Smooth Auto-Regressive Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ESTAR-ADF) unit root test developed by Cerrato et al. (2008) to the time series data for the period 1952-2003. The number of converging provinces decreases in the post-reform period when using panel ESTAR-ADF test. Furthermore, our results find evidence of increasing regional disparity that has been prevailing in China since the open door economic reforms of the late 1970s, which confirms the view of Pedroni and Yao (2006) that interprovincial inequalities have been widening since 1978. In addition, we also examine the determinants of conditional convergence in China. The results indicate that low inflation. transport and telecommunication infrastructure, and trade openness could stimulate economic growth in China. Human capital also play a significant role in growth, and it exhibits non-linearity between human capital and growth in the sense that at low levels of human capital the effect on growth is negative and became positive at middle levels.

Individuals are heterogeneous with respect to time preferences and they make investments in health care that affect their survival probabilities. The main case considered is that where both preferences and investments (and hence the endogenous survival probabilities) are unobserved. Thus, the model captures a further source of inefficiency that is particular to annuity market: an endogenous correlation between the desire for annuities and the survival probabilities.

When the equilibrium is separating, the government intervention may yield Pareto improvements. If the equilibrium is pooling, the government intervention may improve the well-being of individuals affected by the inefficiencies and the negative externalities caused by the asymmetric information.","[Platoni, Silvia] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy; [Platoni, Silvia] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of London,"Platoni, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy.",silvia.platoni@unicatt.it,,"PLATONI, Silvia/0000-0002-4637-0723",,,,,16,0,0,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

They should instead be diagnosticians, helping decisionmakers choose the right model (and remedy) for their specific realities, among many contending models (and remedies). In this spirit, Ricardo Hausmann, Andres Velasco, and I have developed a growth diagnostics framework that sketches a systematic process for identifying binding constraints and prioritizing policy reforms in multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. Growth diagnostics is based on the idea that not all constraints bind equally and that a sensible and practical strategy consists of identifying the most serious constraint(s) at work. The practitioner works with a decision tree to do this. The second step in growth diagnostics is to identify remedies for relaxing the constraint that are appropriate to the context and take cognizance of potential second-best complications. Successful countries are those that have implemented these two steps in an ongoing manner: identify sequentially the most binding constraints and remove them with locally suited remedies. Diagnostics requires pragmatism and eclecticism, in the use of both theory and evidence.

First, tendencies toward over-borrowing have roots in consumers' predispositions to conform to rising consumption norms. Second, following Commons, regulation should be confined to bona fide public problems not better solved via private means.

However, there is ambiguity in the theory whether the entry of care providers increases consumers' surplus in a market with differentiated services, such as childcare. This study empirically investigates how perceived search costs and parental life satisfaction change when actual childcare availability is altered. It exploits the new panel data from Australia on the number of center-based childcare places per 100 children within a household's residential area. The results show that an increase in the availability of center-based childcare is associated with a decrease in perceived difficulty in finding 'good quality' childcare, as well as an increase in mothers' satisfaction with the amount of free time available. These findings imply that the local availability of center-based childcare has enhanced the subjective well-being of parents.","Australian Natl Univ, Econ Program, RSSS, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Yamauchi, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Econ Program, RSSS, HC Coombs Bldg, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",chikako.yamauchi@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,41,15,16,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The strength of the SMC for hidden information problems is to provide a full characterization of implementable contracts using only the local incentive compatibility (IC) constraints. These constraints are equivalent to the monotonicity of the decision variable with respect to the agent's unobservable one-dimensional parameter. When the SMC is violated the local IC constraints are no longer sufficient for implementability and additional (global) IC constraints have to be taken into account. In particular, implementable decisions may not be monotonic and discretely pooled types must have the same marginal utility of the decision (or equivalently, get the same marginal tariff). Moreover, at the optimal decision, the principal must preserve the same trade-off between rent extraction and allocative distortion measured in the agent's marginal rent unit. In a specific setting where non-monotone contracts may be optimal we fully characterize the solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This is the case whenever the new technology reduces the costs of more efficient types more strongly. Nevertheless, if the owner contracts directly with a worker (two-tier hierarchy), the cost-reducing effect always dominates. By contrast, if the firm has more hierarchical tiers such that contracting with the worker is delegated to a manager, the rent effect may prevail.

J,"Hornbeck, R",,,,"Hornbeck, Richard",,,BARBED WIRE: PROPERTY RIGHTS AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPACT; INVESTMENT; EFFICIENCY,"This paper examines the impact on agricultural development of the introduction of barbed wire fencing to the American Plains in the late nineteenth century. Without a fence, farmers risked uncompensated damage by others' livestock. From 1880 to 1900, the introduction and near-universal adoption of barbed wire greatly reduced the cost of fences, relative to the predominant wooden fences, especially in counties with the least woodland. Over that period, counties with the least woodland experienced substantial relative increases in settlement, land improvement, land values, and the productivity and production share of crops most in need of protection. This increase in agricultural development appears partly to reflect farmers' increased ability to protect their land from encroachment. States' inability to protect this full bundle of property rights on the frontier, beyond providing formal land titles, might have otherwise restricted agricultural development.","[Hornbeck, Richard] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hornbeck, Richard] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hornbeck, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,57,114,159,3,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

In particular, the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and industrialisation in reducing poverty is examined. Empirical evidence shows that poverty reduction did occur during the 1990s following the implementation of India's economic liberalisation program, which included mainly industrial and FDI policy reform. The empirical analysis shows that, thus far, FDI has not contributed significantly to poverty reduction, but it did influence structural changes in the economy, particularly with respect to industry, which is an important driver of poverty reduction. The analysis clearly shows that states with dominant industrial sectors have been able to reduce poverty faster than states dominated by agriculture. It is argued that targeting of FDI in India has been misplaced. Had it been in the more labour-intensive manufacturing, it would have more effectively contributed to the reduction of poverty.","[Kalirajan, Kaliappa] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Singh, Kanhaiya] Natl Council Appl Econ Res, New Delhi, India",Australian National University,"Kalirajan, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Kalirajan, Kaliappa/X-5293-2019",,,,,,32,7,7,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The bounds test yields evidence of cointegration between electricity consumption, GDP, and capital formation when electricity consumption and GDP are used as dependent variable. Causality results indicate that there is no significant causal relationship between electricity consumption and investment. Estimates, however, detect in the long-run a bidirectional causal relationship between electricity use and real GDP. There is also evidence of a positive feedback causal relationship between GDP and capital formation. Burkina Faso is therefore an energy dependent country. It is also a country in which electricity consumption is growing with the level of income. All of this shows that electricity is a significant factor in socio-economic development in Burkina Faso; as such, energy policy must be implemented to ensure that electricity generates fewer potential negative impacts.

We then exploit the randomized research design of the PROGRESA evaluation data to identify whether the treatment effects of PROGRESA transfers on secondary school enrolment vary according to the characteristics of extended family. We find PROGRESA only raises secondary enrolment among households that are embedded in a family network. Eligible but isolated households do not respond. The mechanism through which the extended family influences household schooling choices is the redistribution of resources within the family network from eligibles that receive de facto unconditional cash transfers from PROGRESA, towards eligibles on the margin of enrolling children into secondary school.

A model of firm behaviour based on separability allows derivation of the labour demand elasticity with respect to service offshoring for each occupation. Estimation is performed with quasi-maximum likelihood, to account for high degrees of censoring in the employment variable. The estimated elasticities are then related to proxies for the skill level and the degree of tradability of the occupations. Results suggest that service offshoring is skill-biased, because it increases employment in more skilled occupations relative to less skilled occupations.

The foreign exchange market is characterized by nonlinear interactions between technical and fundamental traders. Such interactions may generate complex dynamics and recurrent switching between bull and bear market phases via a well-known pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcation path, when technical traders become more aggressive. The two stock markets are populated by fundamentalists, and prices tend to evolve towards stable steady states, driven by linear laws of motion. A connection between such markets is established by allowing investors to trade abroad, and the resulting three-dimensional dynamical system is analyzed. One goal of our paper is to explore potential spill-over effects between foreign exchange and stock markets. A second, related goal is to study how the bifurcation sequence which characterizes the market with heterogeneous speculators is modified in the presence of interactions with other markets.

I modify a standard model of optimal nonlinear income taxation with discrete types to consider differences in both earning ability and the disutility of effort. This gives a role for workfare in the optimal tax policy. The existence of screening mechanisms can play a role in explaining nonparticipation in cash and in-kind redistribution programs, including Progresa-Oportunidades, Lifeline Telephone subsidies, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women. Infants, and Children (WIC). Stigma can increase efficiency of a redistribution program by discouraging participation by individuals near the eligibility thresholds. The Family Assistance Program proposed in the early 1970s lacked adequate stigma for nonworkers. which contributed to a lack of political support. In contrast, the current Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) provides greater benefits to workers than to nonworkers. Thus the EITC does not require any stigma to screen out individuals who do not work from obtaining benefits. Reasons for separate income support programs for nonworkers and for workers are discussed.","Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Hamilton, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",hamilton@ufl.edu,"Hamilton, Jonathan/L-3849-2019",,,,,,45,3,4,0,10,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using unique data from a world-wide survey of agents involved in international climate policy, we show that the perceived support of different equity rules by regions may be explained by the ranking of their economic costs. Despite being self-interested, equity arguments may be perceived as being used for different reasons, for example, out of fairness considerations or in order to facilitate negotiations. Consistent with experimental and behavioral studies on fairness perceptions, we find that individuals are more likely to state reasons with positive attributes if they evaluate their own region or regions that support the individual's personally preferred equity rule.

A reduced favorite-longshot bias is interpreted as evidence that insider trading on the exchanges is not widespread and not as commonplace ... as is sometimes portrayed in the media. Given that the Shin measure assumes betting with bookies, whereas the exchanges represent betting without bookies, the present study employs the notion of 'significant mover' to empirically test for the presence of 'known loser' insider trading on the exchanges where traditional notions of bookmaking do not apply. Findings indicate that, far from being less problematized by insider trading compared to racetrack betting, activity aimed at profiting from known losers may be potentially commonplace on the exchanges. This includes profiting from horses that are unplaced.

The consistently negative influence of cultural distance indicates that policymakers may wish to consider mechanisms that enhance the build-up of trust and commitment when seeking to facilitate the initiation and completion of international trade deals.

We briefly sketch the changing attitudes toward fiscal policy and the demise of arbitrary rules for the budget deficits and the reassertion of purposeful fiscal policy, that is fiscal policy for the purpose of helping to create the conditions for high levels of employment. Instead of a focus on debt overall, there should be consideration of the net balance sheet position. It is often argued that running a budget deficit places upward pressure on interest rates. We argue that in the context of the use of functional finance, the ability of the deficit to in effect fund itself removes any underlying upward pressure on interest rates.

The model shows that if some adolescents are likely to be in trouble with law, their chances to complete education and thus the expected value of investment in their human capital are negatively affected. As a consequence, their parents not only optimally invest less in the offspring's education but also give birth to more children. The analysis helps to understand why some minority groups who for exogenous reasons are more likely to be convicted of crime exhibit higher reproduction rates and lower levels of education. It also demonstrates that prison education may have unintended adverse consequences.","Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Azarnert, LV (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",azarnel@mail.biu.ac.il,,,,,,,20,4,5,0,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In particular; I conclude that the central bank should monitor and regulate systemic risk because preserving financial stability is (a) closely aligned with the standard objectives of monetary policy and (b) likely to require lender of last resort powers. I also conclude that the Fed should supervise large financial institutions because that function is so closely to regulating systemic risk.

Although this makes some of the analysis period-specific, most of the issues and principles considered are timeless. For a fiscal stimulus to be both effective there must be idle resources due to a failure of effective demand. For it to be desirable, there must be no alternative policy instruments (including monetary policy) for boosting demand. There must be no complete financial crowding out and no complete direct crowding out, through Ricardian equivalence/debt neutrality, through Minsky equivalence or through a high degree of substitutability between private and public exhaustive expenditure in private preferences or production possibilities. Finally, for international coordination to be desirable, there must be cross-border externalities from national fiscal stimuli.

The use of threshold variables to model the changes in the regression structure with respect to different market conditions enables us to investigate the lead-lag interaction in a data-based approach and avoid stratifying the data arbitrarily. Using the basis as the threshold variable, we find that the short-selling restrictions in the spot market reduce the effect of the spot index as the leading variable. To study the effect of market-wide information on the interaction between the spot and futures markets, we use the coefficient of determination in the regression of the S&P500 on the Morgan-Stanley Composite Index-US and the Major Market Index as the threshold variable. We find that the lead effect of the futures market over the spot market is stronger when there is more market-wide information. On the other hand, the lead effect of the cash market over the futures market is weaker when there is more market-wide information. In addition, we also use the lagged 45-min return of the spot market as the threshold variable. We find that the lead effect of the spot market is stronger in periods of directionless trading than in periods of good or bad markets.","[Tse, Yiu-Kuen] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Chan, Wai-Sum] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Singapore Management University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Tse, YK (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore.",,"TSE, Yiu Kuen/D-1451-2009","Chan, Wai-Sum/0000-0002-6021-0312",,,,,18,7,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The nature of the Hungarian system cannot be described by classical normative theories of fiscal federalism. The operation of Hungarian local governments is determined rather by the decentralisation of conflicts stemming from the reduction of state responsibilities, and the resulting municipal behaviour. The second generation theory of fiscal federalism pays particular attention to the institutional guarantees of fiscal discipline shown by the lower levels of government sector. Actors in the Hungarian system, a system that functions as a 'conflict container', try to offset the financial pressures, weighing heavily on them by borrowing and by contingent liabilities. While central government has transferred new duties to local governments from year to year, it has reduced the amount of fiscal subsidies. Until a long-term comprehensive reform is implemented, consequent risks must be treated in the short run, as well.","[Vigvari, A.] Budapest Business Sch, Inst Finance & Accountancy, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest Business University,"Vigvári, A (通讯作者)，State Audit Off, Res Inst, POB 265, H-1364 Budapest 4, Hungary.",vigvaria@asz.hu,,,,,,,42,9,9,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We begin by looking at some relevant history of the industry, including the series of events that led financial regulators to outsource their judgments to the credit rating agencies (by requiring financial institutions to use the specific bond creditworthiness information that was provided by the major rating agencies) and when the credit rating agencies shifted their business model from investor pays to issuer pays. We then look at how the credit rating industry evolved and how its interaction with regulatory authorities served as a barrier to entry. We then show how these ingredients combined to contribute to the subprime mortgage debacle and associated financial crisis. Finally, we consider two possible routes for public policy with respect to the credit rating industry: One route would tighten the regulation of the rating agencies, while the other route would reduce the required centrality of the rating agencies and thereby open up the bond information process in a way that has not been possible since the 1930s.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10006 USA",New York University,"White, LJ (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10006 USA.",Lwhite@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,48,244,302,2,68,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Second, some legal scholars have fallen into the problematic habit of applying results from experiments directly to law and policy rather than applying well-supported theories. Third, the divergent purposes behind economics studies and legal scholarship give rise, in part, to problematic cherry-picking of experimental studies by legal scholars.

Using a standard sticky price general equilibrium model, Barsky, House, and Kimball [American Economic Review 97(3) (2007), 984-998] demonstrate that if durable goods are flexibly priced and nondurables are sticky, then a monetary contraction leads to an expansion in production in the durable sector. This is wildly at odds with the empirical evidence.

When investment is irreversible, zero investment can be optimal and investment becomes lumpy. Because external funds are not a perfect substitute for internal funds, financially constrained firms invest differently than unconstrained firms. To incorporate both irreversibility and financial constraints into estimations, the analysis develops a switching regression model that depends on the real options theory of capital investment. The analysis investigates three US industries: the oil refining, communications equipment manufacturing and semiconductor manufacturing industries.

Alternatively, individuals may both self-select into stressful jobs and choose to smoke based on unobserved factors. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine how job stress affects the probability that smokers quit and the number of cigarettes smoked for current smokers. To address the potential endogeneity of job stress based on time invariant factors, we include individual fixed effects, which control for factors such as ability to handle stress. Occupational fixed effects are also included to control for occupational characteristics other than stress; time dummies control for the secular decline in smoking rates. Using a sample of people who smoked in the previous wave, we find that job stress is positively related to continuing to smoke among recent smokers. The results indicate that the key impact of stress is on the extensive margin of smoking, as opposed to the number of cigarettes smoked.","[Ayyagari, Padmaja; Sindelar, Jody L.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Ayyagari, P (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",padmaja.ayyagari@yale.edu; jody.sindelar@yale.edu,,,"NIAAA NIH HHS [RL1 AA017542-02, RL1 AA017542-03, RL1 AA017542-05, RL1 AA017542-01, RL1 AA017542-04, RL1 AA017542, RL1 AA017542-02S1] Funding Source: Medline; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG027045-03, R01 AG027045-04, R01 AG027045-01, R01 AG027045, R01 AG027045-02] Funding Source: Medline",NIAAA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,70,28,28,0,31,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We consider a theoretical reduced-form relationship between the exchange rate and fundamentals in which parameters are either constant or time varying. We calibrate the model to data for exchange rates and fundamentals and conduct the exact same Meese-Rogoff exercise with data generated by the model. Our main finding is that the Impact of time-varying parameters on the prediction performance either is very small or goes in the wrong direction. To help interpret the findings, we derive theoretical results on the impact of time-varying parameters on the out-of-sample forecasting performance of the model. We conclude that it is not time-varying parameters, but rather small sample estimation bias, that explains the Meese-Rogoff puzzle.","[Bacchetta, Philippe; Beutler, Toni] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,,,,,,,,,39,26,27,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",1932-8796,,978-0-226-70749-5,NBER INT SEM MAC,,,2010,6.0,,,,,,125,+,,,,,,67,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQH63,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000281026600004,0

We trace the separation of firms and industries to the introduction of population thinking in the discipline of industrial economics, including some broadly evolutionary analyses. If researchers conflate a population of firms with an industry, they introduce thin means of relating firms to one another and to industries. Despite his device of the 'representative firm', Marshall develops thick means of relating firms to industries by means of their internal and external organizations. Penrose avoids the notion of industry by focussing on heterogeneous and potentially mobile firms. Young and Steindl develop mundane explanations of firms' relations within groups and locate the impetus for economic growth in a poorly understood environment. We conclude that evolutionary economists should revisit firms' boundaries, not in the sense of explaining the existence of firms but in a relating and communicating sense in which boundaries signify the selective means of firms' relationships.","[Finch, John] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Glasgow G4 0RQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Bloch, Harry] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",University of Strathclyde; Curtin University,"Finch, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Stenhouse Bldg,173 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RQ, Lanark, Scotland.",harry.bloch@cbs.curtin.edu.au; john.finch@strath.ac.uk,"Bloch, Harry/A-9591-2008; Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019; Finch, John/N-6351-2014","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Finch, John/0000-0003-2480-8541",,,,,68,5,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The employment of a considerable part of their labour force abroad was accompanied by a massive inflow of remittances. Remittances are considered the basic gain of migration for the emigration countries and their main compensation for losing (temporarily or more permanently) a part of their labour force. Whether remittances contribute to the economic development of the country receiving them depends on how they are used, that is, what activities they finance. Their exclusive use for consumption and imports, for example, is considered less development-stimulating than financing productive investment. This article investigates the impact of remittances on three basic macroeconomic variables, namely consumption, investment and imports, for three transition Balkan economies: Romania, Bulgaria and Albania.

Pets differ from standard economic goods in significant ways, and the market displays a number of interesting problems, most notably pet overpopulation. Despite this, the market has been ignored by economists. This paper develops a dynamic model of the market for pets and uses it to study the problem of pet overpopulation. The positive predictions of the model square well with key features of the markets for dogs and cats in the U.S. The model is used to understand, from a welfare economic perspective, the sense in which there is overpopulation of pets and the underlying causes of the problem. The paper also employs the model to consider what policies might be implemented to deal with the problem. A calibrated example is developed to illustrate these corrective policies and quantify the potential welfare gains.","[Coate, Stephen] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Knight, Brian] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Cornell University; Brown University,"Coate, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",sc163@cornell.edu; brian_knight@brown.edu,,,,,,,28,4,5,2,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using repeated cross-sections of the population, it identifies a structural break in the relationship between income inequality and satisfaction. Whereas in the first stage of the transition process, an increase in income inequality was interpreted by the population as a positive signal of wider opportunities, later in the transition period increased inequality became a factor in dissatisfaction with the country's economic situation. This was accompanied by increasing public sentiment that the process of income distribution is flawed and corrupt.","[Grosfeld, Irena; Senik, Claudia] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Grosfeld, Irena] CNRS, Paris, France; [Senik, Claudia] Univ Paris 04, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite,"Grosfeld, I (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",grosfeld@pse.ens.fr; senik@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,41,63,68,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

This paper offers a new method of evaluating the accuracy of these apportionment rules and the ownership distortions they create. Evidence from European company accounts indicates that apportionment formulas significantly misattribute income, since employment and other factors on which they are based do a very poor job of explaining a firm's profits. For example, the magnitude of property, employment and sales explains less than 22% of the variation in profits between firms, and the prediction estimates from using such a formula exceed half of predicted profits 64% of the time, and exceed twice predicted income 11% of the time. As a result, the use of formulas rewards or punishes international mergers and divestitures by reallocating taxable income between operations in jurisdictions with differing tax rates. The associated ownership distortion is minimized by choosing factor weights to minimize weighted squared prediction errors, for which, based on the European evidence, labor inputs should play little if any role in allocation formulas. But even a distortion-minimizing formula creates large incentives for inefficient ownership reallocation due to the enormous variation in profitability that is unexplained by formulary factors, implying that significant resource allocation costs would accompany European adoption of formulary apportionment methods.

Such bilateral feedback giving introduces strategic considerations. We focus on reciprocity in the giving of feedback: how prevalent a strategy of giving feedback is only if feedback is first received from one's trading partner. The overall level of feedback activity clearly depends on the prevalence of the reciprocation strategy: in a market with many reciprocators and few unconditional feedback providers, the equilibrium quantity of feedback can be quite low. We estimate the prevalence of such reciprocation in one market, eBay. Reciprocation cannot be directly distinguished from late feedback that was not conditioned on the partner having provided feedback. We develop a model that distinguishes the two by exploiting information about the timing of feedback provision when the partner does not provide feedback. We find that buyers and sellers on eBay used the reciprocate only strategy about 20-23% of the time. We also measure the extent to which the prevalence of these strategies changes with the experience levels of the two parties and with the item price.","[Jian, Lian] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [MacKie-Mason, Jeffrey K.; Resnick, Paul] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Southern California; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Jian, LA (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ljian@umich.edu; jmm@umich.edu; presnick@umich.edu,,"MacKie-Mason, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5753-3778; Resnick, Paul J./0000-0001-8368-0600",,,,,19,5,5,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, the explanatory power of the lagged interest rate has been questioned from various points of view. This paper formally examines a situation in which a central bank has an aversion to frequent policy reversals. Imposing an irreversibility constraint on the control space makes the lagged interest rate a state variable. However, the policy function cannot then be expressed as a partial adjustment form, even if the original Taylor rule would be the correct policy function in the absence of the irreversibility constraint. The simulation results reveal that conventional regression tends to falsely support the functionally misspecified partial adjustment model. This implies that the significant role of the lagged interest may simply reflect the central banks' aversion to policy reversal.","Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University,"Kobayashi, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",kobayashi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,,"Kobayashi, Teruyoshi/0000-0002-3135-9038",,,,,29,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Using moving window techniques, we see that the pro-cyclical relationship holds over the entire time period.

Using variation in state EITC supplements, I find that a 10 percent increase in the generosity of the EITC is associated with a 5 percent fall in the wages of high school dropouts and a 2 percent fall in the wages of those with only a high school diploma, while having no effect on the wages of college graduates. Given the large increase in labor supply induced by the EITC, this is consistent with most reasonable estimates of the elasticity of labor demand. Although workers with children receive a much larger EITC than childless workers, and the effect of the credit on labor force participation is larger for those with children, the hourly wages of both groups are similarly affected by an EITC increase. As a check on this strategy, I also use federal variation in the EITC across gender-age-education groups, and find that those demographic groups that received the largest EITC increases also experienced a drop in their hourly wages, relative to other groups.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Leigh, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",andrew_leigh@ksg02.harvard.edu,"Leigh, Andrew/AAV-1366-2020","Leigh, Andrew/0000-0002-5639-0509",,,,,42,54,67,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

First, the reallocation of employment from less to more Productive firms will yield efficiency gains. Second, workers will find it in their interest to seek out higher-paying employers. Recent research has provided support for both hypotheses. Third, the existence Of worker and employer heterogeneity offers possible gains from sorting. However, because the problem of identifying the presence of sorting is model dependent, it is too early for conclusions about its significance.","[Lentz, Rasmus] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Mortensen, Dale T.] Aarhus Univ, NBER, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Lentz, Rasmus] CAM, Madison, WI USA; [Mortensen, Dale T.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mortensen, Dale T.] IZA, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Aarhus University; Northwestern University; Aarhus University,"Lentz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",d-mortensen@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,82,19,27,0,49,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4602-7,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

At the same time, it introduces some methodological and informational improvements. The most significant of them is the structural decomposition of the economy, associated with input-output techniques. Due to the relatively advanced stage of the transitional processes in Romania, the behavioural functions were accommodated - as much as possible - to the standard relationships. Unlike the versions that used the statistical series beginning in 1980, the present one is based exclusively on information concerning the period 1989-2004. Therefore, we have considered more adequately naming this variant the macromodel of the Romanian market (not transition, as before) economy.

We investigate the presence of leverage effects in empirical time series and estimate different asymmetric GARCH-family models (EGACH, PGARCH and TGARCH) specifying successively a Normal, Student's t and GED error distribution. We find that GARCH family models with normal errors are not capable to capture fully the leptokurtosis in empirical time series, while GED and Student's t errors provide a better description for the conditional volatility. In addition, we outline some stylized facts about volatility that are not captured by conventional ARCH or GARCH models, but are considered by the asymmetric models and document their presence in empirical time series. Finally, we report that volatility estimates given by the EGARCH model exhibit generally lower forecast errors and are therefore more accurate than the estimates given by the other asymmetric GARCH models.","[Miron, Dumitru; Tudor, Cristiana] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Int Business & Econ Dept, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Miron, D (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Int Business & Econ Dept, Bucharest, Romania.",dumitru.miron@ase.ro; cristianat@gmail.com,"tudor, cristiana/A-2705-2010; Miron, Dumitru/AAW-4320-2020; Tudor, Cristiana/AGZ-0508-2022; Miron, Dumitru/C-6816-2012","tudor, cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; Miron, Dumitru/0000-0003-0606-6329; Tudor, Cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666;",,,,,50,18,18,0,15,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Recently, Pierru proposed adapting the Aumann-Shapley cost sharing method to deal with this issue. Our paper aims at describing the conceptual and technical difficulties of this adaptation to the WIT context. Moreover, we show that this approach, as proposed by Pierru, is not applicable to any real-type refinery model. Different suggestions are provided to improve its applicability (when it is possible) in real situations.

Correct production planning policy chosen for the right product at the right moment in the product life cycle (PLC) reduces production, storing and other related costs. This leads to such problems to be solved as defining the present PLC phase of a product and also determining the transition point - a moment of time when the PLC phase changes. The paper presents the Agent-Based Production Planning Support system meant for supporting a production manager in his/her production planning decisions. The developed system is based on the analysis of historical demand for products and on the information about transitions between phases in life cycles of those products. The system creates a model and uses it to forecast a transition point for a product that only begins its life on the market. The architecture of the developed system is presented and an analysis of testing on real-world data results is given.","[Parshutin, Serge; Borisov, Arkady] Riga Tech Univ, Inst Informat Technol, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Parshutin, S (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Inst Informat Technol, 1 Kalku Str, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia.",serge.parshutin@rtu.lv; arkadijs.borisovs@cs.rtu.lv,"Gerhards, Guntis/D-5197-2009",,,,,,18,0,0,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Four countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia - are the source of the predominant part of the OFDI stock of the Central-Eastern European area. Since the beginning of the 2000s the OFDI of the Central European countries has increased sharply. A small number of large horizontal multinationals investing in the neighbouring countries account for the bulk of the OFDI flows and stock. We distinguish three different OFDI paths and analyse the strengths and weaknesses of each one: the Czech and Hungarian path is characterised by the pivotal role of the foreign-owned multinationals in the OFDI process. The Polish OFDI path differs from the Czech and Hungarian path by the central role played by the state-owned extractive and infrastructure companies in the Polish FDI abroad. In Slovenia, the OFDI path takes the form of investments by private indigenous-grown multinationals that have successfully set up subsidiaries in the neighbouring countries.","[Rugraff, Eric] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Technol, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Rugraff, Eric] BETA, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Montpellier,"Rugraff, E (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Technol, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",eric.rugraff@unistra.fr,,,,,,,50,27,27,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,1,,,,,1,17,PII 919255310,10.1080/14631370903525561,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277674300001,0

Starting from a hypothetical state of nature, agents can delegate the task of enforcing cooperation to one of them in exchange for a proper compensation. Both individual and collective commitment problems stand in the way of institution formation. These problems imply first that a potentially efficient institution may fail to emerge and also that if it emerges, it may do so inefficiently. We show that big and untrustworthy societies are more likely to support institutions whereas their emergence is more difficult in small and trusting societies, but if institutions do emerge, they tend to be more inefficient in the former type of societies. Finally, we show that the threat of secession by a subset of agents may alleviate the latter problem.","[Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Straub, Stephane] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse, France",University of Edinburgh; Universite de Toulouse,"Sanchez-Pages, S (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",ssanchez@staffmail.ed.ac.uk; stephane.straub@univ-tlse1.fr,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The common answer is that money solves the problem of double coincidence of wants, imperfect monitoring of past actions and anonymity. This friction provides neccessary and sufficient condition for money to be essential. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this claim. I provide a game-theoretical model based on the random matching model of Kiyotaki and Wright (1993). Although all of the above mentioned frictions are present in the model, money need not to be essential if agents implement a social enforcement rule. Moreover, I will show that money becomes essential if agents have private information about their preferences or production skills. Therefore, we can conclude that money serves also as a device that forces agents to reveal their true preferences and production skills.","[Stanek, Rostislav] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,rostanek@mail.muni.cz,"Staněk, Rostislav/AAL-7813-2021","Staněk, Rostislav/0000-0002-6310-4777",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,578,583,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900098,0

We discovered that cointegration has existed between the Shanghai A Share Index and the exchange rate of the renminbi against the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar since 2005, when the Chinese exchange rate regime became a flexible, managed, floating system. We found that both the exchange rate and the money supply influenced stock price, with a positive correlation. We further show that the money supply increase was largely caused by a huge 'hot money' inflow from other countries in recent years. After local currency appreciation, hot money, followed by the money supply increase, pushed the market into a high level, based on expectations regarding the local currency's further appreciation.","[Tian, Gary Gang; Ma, Shiguang] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Tian, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",gtian@uow.edu.au,"Tian, Gary/P-1272-2019","Tian, Gary/0000-0002-7638-7606; ma, shiguang/0000-0003-4510-4236",,,,,47,33,43,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

J,"Torokoff, M",,,,"Torokoff, Made",,,Analysis of Directing the Innovation Process and its Relation to Middle Level Manager's Work: the Case of Estonian Enterprises,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,creativity; innovation; learning organisation; emotional climate; motivation,ORGANIZATIONS,"In the process of innovation learning in the organisation (individually and as a team) plays an important role. Many entrepreneurs underestimate and dedicate little energy and time to formulating teams where members' skills complement one another; and also do not engage in improving their own managerial abilities (Fitzsimons, 2002). One has to know how to gather and analyse information, make balanced decisions and constantly find new solutions in order to support the success of a business in a demanding and fast-changing world of technology. The mid-level manager can also support innovation and contribute to the innovative culture in the company. In the analysis of directing innovation process this article derives from the concept of learning organisation. The model and questionnaire were based on the five discipline model (Senge, 1990) and the three-dimension model of organisational development framework - 3-D model (Mets, 2002). The study covers the years of 2005-2008; the questionnaire was filled out by 573 employees from different companies in Estonia. The study of different samples delineates different patterns of a learning organisation. Based on factor analysis, it became clear that the patterns of characteristics are substantially different for companies whose learning is based on employees or managers. From the analysis of free-form answers in the questionnaire it came out that if the company lacks a clear vision the employees are unable to connect their development with the enterprise, information does not travel between different levels without hindrances, and learning in organisation is less structured for employees than for managers. One of the conclusions of this study is that the perception of an enterprise as a learning organisation is more simplistic for employees than for managers. Therefore the role of mid-level managers in directing the development of their direct subordinates is more important than it has been realised thus far. Mid-level managers have to learn the skill of communicating the strategy of the company to the employees and conveying the ideas and views from the bottom to the top management. The development of the learning organisation is one precondition for directing the innovation process; for that the author of the article proposes a new model of a motivational cycle.","Univ Tartu, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Fac Econ & Business Adm, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Torokoff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Narva Rd 4, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia.",made.torokoff@ut.ee,,,,,,,45,4,5,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Both the lower bounds on holdings and the total investment constraints influence the optimal portfolio adjusting strategies. Furthermore, a numerical example of a portfolio adjusting problem is given to illustrate our proposed effective approaches.

This failure, we argue, stemmed from an incomplete understanding of the pivotal role of financial institutions in the amplification of the crisis and its transmission to the wider economy. Low global interest rates and a consequent 'search for yield' in the pre-crisis period encouraged financial institutions to build highly leveraged balance sheets which, in turn, generated extremely large asset-price movements when a 'small event'-the downturn in the US sub-prime mortgage market-triggered the worldwide crisis. The paper then briefly describes the element of the broadly successful and coordinated macroeconomic policy response to the crisis before turning to the medium-term challenges facing policy-makers in sustaining global recovery. At the national level, we focus on the resolution of fiscal imbalances which contributed, in part, to the crisis, and which then worsened because of the policy actions which have been taken to deal with it. At the international level, we emphasize the need to rectify the imbalances between savings and investment in many significant countries. This will require greater coordination of macroeconomic policy across the world's major economies. It will also involve strengthening the role, and the governance, of the International Monetary Fund.","[Adam, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Adam, Christopher] Univ Oxford, St Cross Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England; [Vines, David] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Australian National University,"Adam, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",christo-pher.adam@economics.ox.ac.uk; david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,113,11,12,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Relaxing the identical technology assumption does not improve either the results for the interregional trade or trade with the OECD countries, though an improvement exists in the results for the international trade vector and especially for the flows with non-OECD countries.

(ii) During the period of banking instability (2000-2003), subordinated debt investors tended to use financial variables such as the non-performing loan ratio, ROA, and ROE to screen good banks. (iii) During the period after the banking system regained stability (2004-2007), investors tended to pay less attention to the above variables due chiefly to the mitigated default risk of these banks.

Our theoretical and empirical analyses emphasize the importance of allowing for the fact that households buy durable as well as non-durable goods. The theoretical analysis shows that in the short run households can cut back significantly on total expenditures without a significant fall in welfare if they concentrate their budget reductions on durables. We then present an empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey of workers who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes in the unemployment insurance system over our sample period we show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these expenditures may be non-separable from employment status. The effects we find are particularly strong for households with no liquid assets before the spell started. These qualitative findings are in precise agreement with the theoretical predictions.

We estimate the effects of the marginal Social Security benefits that accrue with additional earnings on three measures of labor supply: retirement age, hours, and labor earnings. We develop a new approach to identifying these incentive effects by exploiting five provisions in the Social Security benefit rules that generate discontinuities in marginal benefits or non-linearities in marginal benefits that converge to discontinuities as uncertainty about the future is resolved. We find that individuals approaching retirement (age 52 and older) respond to the Social Security tax-benefit link on the extensive margin of their labor supply decisions: we estimate that a 10% increase in the net-of-tax share reduces the two-year retirement hazard by a statistically significant 2.0 percentage points from a base rate of 15%. The evidence with regard to labor supply responses on the intensive margin is more mixed: we estimate that the elasticity of hours with respect to the net-of-tax share is 0.42 and statistically significant, but we do not find a statistically significant earnings elasticity. Though we lack statistical power to estimate results within subsamples precisely, the retirement response is driven mostly by the female subsample, while the hours response comes from the male subsample.

Yet overt evidence of advertiser influence on the news can be elusive, partly because fear of offending advertisers may lead news organizations to censor themselves. An apparent departure from self-censorship, however, is the anti-business reporting that characterized the muckraking era of the early 20th century. We therefore examine muckraking's demise as a case study of potential advertiser influence. As alternative hypotheses of muckraking's decline, our tests seek to distinguish between an advertising boycott and a fall in reader demand for muckraking content. The tests involve comparing market performances of muckraking and non-muckraking magazines, and estimating the determinants of advertising in muckraking magazines. We generally find no evidence to support the hypothesis of an advertising boycott. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results are consistent with statistically significant economies of scale at the lowest output levels and a cost inefficiency averaging from about seven to nine per cent for all firms. The findings also suggest that all else equal, the smallest firms and the largest firms have lower unit costs than mid-sized firms. While this work suggests that policies that would give incentives for the smallest firms to increase their scale of operations might help to reduce their unit costs, further investigation needs to be done with respect to why firms in the mid-level size categories appear to be less efficient.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,25,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We develop two versions so that we can solve the model either as a fully inter-temporal optimization problem (forward-looking, perfect foresight) or recursively. The standard EPPA model on which these models are based is solved recursively, and it is necessary to simplify some aspects of it to make inter-temporal solution possible. The forward-looking capability allows one to better address economic and policy issues such as borrowing and banking of GHG allowances, efficiency implications of environmental tax recycling, endogenous depletion of fossil resources, international capital flows, and optimal emissions abatement paths among others. To evaluate the solution approaches, we benchmark each version to the same macroeconomic path, and then compare the behavior of the two versions under a climate policy that restricts greenhouse gas emissions. We find that the energy sector and CO2 price behavior are similar in both versions (in the recursive version of the model we force the inter-temporal theoretical efficiency result that abatement through time should be allocated such that the CO2 price rises at the interest rate.) The main difference that arises is that the macroeconomic costs are substantially lower in the forward-looking version of the model, since it allows consumption shifting as an additional avenue of adjustment to the policy. On the other hand, the simplifications required for solving the model as an optimization problem, such as dropping the full vintaging of the capital stock and fewer explicit technological options, likely have effects on the results. Moreover, inter-temporal optimization with perfect foresight poorly represents the real economy where agents face high levels of uncertainty that likely lead to higher costs than if they knew the future with certainty. We conclude that while the forward-looking model has value for some problems, the recursive model produces similar behavior in the energy sector and provides greater flexibility in the details of the system that can be represented.

The political aggregation rules used at date t + 1 are instrumental choices under rules at date t. Effectively, rules are players who can strategically delegate future policy-making authority to different rules. A political rule is stable if it selects itself. A reform occurs when an alternative rule is selected. The stability of a political rule is shown to depend on whether its choices are dynamically consistent. For instance, simple majority rules can be shown to be dynamically consistent in many common environments where wealth-weighted voting rules are not. The result extends to political rules that incorporate private activities such as extra-legal protests, threats, or private investment. The approach is one way of understanding various explanations of institutional change proposed in the literature. A parametric model of public goods provision gives an illustration.

We use four conventionally accepted proxies for financial development, namely money supply (M2), liquid liabilities (M3), domestic bank credit to the private sector and total domestic credit provided by the banking sector (all percent of GDP). Applying a modified version of the Granger causality test due to Toda and Yamamoto [Toda. H.Y. and Yamamoto, T, Statistical inference in vector autoregressions with possibly integrated process. journal of Econometrics 1995; 66; 225-250], our empirical results suggest that in three out of the four measures of financial development we found evidence of a two-way Granger causality: (1) between domestic credit provided by the banking sector and economic growth; (2) between total domestic credit provided by the banking sector and economic growth, and (3) between liquid liabilities and economic growth. This implies that neither the supply-leading nor the demand-following hypotheses are supported in Kenya and that economic growth and financial development are jointly determined, or they complement each other. A major implication of our finding is that financial development promotes economic growth in Kenya and that policies at enhancing the development of the financial sector can help to spur economic growth.

We focus on the effect of four different factors: whether monitors are accountable to the service recipients, the degree of observability of service providers' effort, the providers' wages and the providers' professional norms. In accordance with theory, we find that service providers perform better when monitors are elected by service recipients and when their effort is more easily observed. However, there is only weak evidence that service providers perform better when paid more. Monitors are more vigilant when elected and when service providers are paid more. Playing the game with Ethiopian nursing students, we also find that those with greater exposure to the Ethiopian public health sector perform less well, either as provider or as monitor, when the experiment is framed as a public health provision scenario, suggesting that experience and norms affect behavior.

This dataset contains-for the first time for Italy-information on seniority. The effects of marginal incentives and social security wealth (SSW) on retirement go in the expected direction; when employees become eligible for pension benefits, the change in financial incentives they experience is so great that their retirement probability increases by 30 percentage points. We also find that the procedure used in previous Italian studies to impute seniority leads to a considerable overestimation of that variable and of SSW. We show that, due to these measurement errors, the estimate of the SSW coefficient takes the wrong sign. A comparison of retirement studies across countries (see Gruber and Wise [Gruber, J., and Wise, D., (2004). Social Security Programs and Retirement Around the World: Micro-Estimation, NBER.

The evolutions of the employment and output distributions also differ significantly, but display strong inter-industry regularities, including that the nature of the evolution depends on whether the industry is experiencing growth, shakeout, maturity, or decline. The observed patterns have implications for theories of industry dynamics and evolution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Large firms default less often than small firms but they investigate more thoroughly and reject more good ideas. With easier access to consumer credit, talented workers become less averse to the income risk of working in small firms. Thus, small firms gain an advantage on the labour market, their profit volatility increases and large firms react by creating spin-offs.

All the usual sources of inertia are absent here i.e., all firms are simultaneously free to change their price once every period and face no adjustment costs in doing so. Despite this, the model generates persistent movements in aggregate output and inflation in response to a nominal shock. Two modi. cations of a standard one-quarter pre-set pricing model deliver these results: learning-by-doing and habit formation in leisure. While the model delivers persistence, simulations based on estimated shocks to tfp and money growth suggest both output and inflation are too volatile relative to the data and fail to closely follow the historical time series.

The data allow not only a test of the extent to which the commission charged to buyers is reflected in the buyers' bids but also a reasonably comprehensive explanation of variations in wine auction prices.

Using a two-country general-equilibrium model, this paper quantitatively shows that the gap in productivity growth between the US and the rest of the world cannot explain the US current account deficits, especially in the 1980s and the 2000s. This is because on a GDP-weighted basis, the rest of the world actually had higher productivity growth during these periods, and standard macroeconomic models would predict an outflow of funds from the US to the rest of the world, and a consequent US current account surplus. We show that changes in global financial integration can help explain this anomaly in US current account behavior.","[Chakraborty, Suparna] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Bert W Wasserman Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Dekle, Robert] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); University of Southern California,"Chakraborty, S (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, Bert W Wasserman Dept Econ & Finance, 55 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10010 USA.",Suparna_Chakraborty@baruch.cuny.edu; dekle@usc.edu,,,,,,,24,6,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Using an event-study approach, the paper finds evidence that the G7 has been overall effective in moving the US dollar, yen and euro in the intended direction at horizons of up to three months after G7 meetings, but not at longer horizons. While the success of the G7 is partly dependent on the market environment, it is also to a significant degree endogenous to the policy process itself. In particular the reputation and credibility of the G7, as well as its ability to communicate a consensus among individual G7 members, are important determinants for the G7's ability to manage major currencies. The paper concludes by analyzing the factors that help the G7 build reputation and consensus, and by discussing the implications for global economic governance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thus they do not count as either GDP or investment. We ask how treating such spending as investment affects some key macro variables, namely, market sector gross value added (MGVA), business investment, capital and labor shares, growth in labor and total factor productivity (TFP), and capital deepening. We find: (a) MGVA was understated by about 6 percent in 1970 and 13 percent in 2004; (b) instead of the business investment/MGVA ratio falling since 1970 it has been rising; (c) instead of the labor share being flat since 1970 it has been falling; (d) growth in labor productivity and capital deepening has been understated and growth in TFP overstated; and (e) TFP growth has not slowed since 1990 but has been accelerating.","[Haskel, Jonathan] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, CEPR, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Haskel, Jonathan] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Wallis, Gavin] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Imperial College London; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of London; University College London,"Haskel, J (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, CEPR, Tanaka Bldg,S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",j.haskel@ic.ac.uk,,"Haskel, Jonathan/0000-0003-2961-165X",,,,,25,76,84,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

If, prior to 1982, the US economy was characterised by Marx-biased technical progress, what requires explanation is why labour productivity continued to grow after 1982 in the absence of sufficient capital deepening.

How does the value of these assets compare to the present value of states' pension liabilities? Just as future Social Security and Medicare liabilities do not appear in the headline numbers of the U.S. federal debt, the financial liability from underfunded public pensions does not appear in the headline numbers of state debt. If pensions are underfunded, then the gap between pension assets and liabilities is off-balance-sheet government debt. We show that government accounting standards require states to use procedures that severely understate their liabilities. We then discuss the true economic funding of state public pension plans. Using market-based discount rates that reflect the risk profile of the pension liabilities, we calculate that the present value of the already-promised pension liabilities of the 50 U.S. states amount to $5.17 trillion, assuming that states cannot default on pension benefits that workers have already earned. Net of the $1.94 trillion in assets, these pensions are underfunded by $3.23 trillion. This pension debt dwarfs the states' publicly traded debt of $0.94 trillion. And we show that even before the market collapse of 2008, the system was economically severely underfunded, though public actuarial reports presented the plans' funding status in a more favorable light.","[Novy-Marx, Robert] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rauh, Joshua D.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA",University of Chicago; Northwestern University,"Novy-Marx, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",rnm@ChicagoBoodh.edu; joshua-rauh@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,27,119,154,0,30,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In Stackelberg routing games, where a fraction of flow is centrally-controlled, a natural problem is to route the centrally-controlled flow such that the overall cost of the resulting equilibrium is minimized. We consider the scenario where the network administrator wants to know the minimum amount of centrally-controlled flow such that the cost of the resulting equilibrium solution is strictly less than the cost of the Nash equilibrium. We call this threshold the Stackelberg threshold and prove that for networks of parallel links with linear latency functions, it is equal to the minimum of the Nash flows on links carrying more optimum flow than Nash flow.

Yet to what extent can project design compensate for these community-specific constraints? I address this question by examining determinants of collective success in a costly problem for developing economies - the upkeep of local public goods. It is often difficult to obtain reliable outcome measures for comparable collective tasks across well-defined communities. In order to address this I conducted detailed surveys of community-maintained infrastructure projects in Northern Pakistan. The findings show that while community-specific constraints do matter, their impact can be mitigated by better project design. Inequality, social fragmentation, and lack of leadership in the community do have adverse consequences but these can be overcome by changes in project complexity, community participation, and return distribution. Moreover, the evidence suggests that better design matters even more for communities with poorer attributes. The use of community fixed effects and instrumental variables offers a significant improvement in empirical identification over previous studies. These results provide evidence that appropriate design can enable projects to succeed even in bad communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A traditional economic view states that there is a trade-off between being green and being competitive. According to that view, no voluntary environmental action is expected to occur. To undertake an in-depth analysis of the scope for voluntary action, this paper reviews empirical literature that analyzes the relationship between manufacturing firms' environmental initiatives or performance and economic results. This review moves beyond the general test of the 'pay to be green' hypothesis, preferring instead to systematize empirical results in more specific research questions. Empirical findings of the reviewed literature generally support that there is no penalty for being green. In addition, the typology of firms, the methods utilized for implementing environmental initiatives, the intensity of abatement efforts and stockholders' valuation of green firms have all been shown to have a sizeable influence on the actual economic results of environmental action or management. Consequently, the findings of this paper challenge the traditional strategic theory that predicts widespread free-riding; it holds major implications for environmental policy-making and environmental business decisions.",,,,,"Blanco, Esther/K-9124-2014; Rey-Maquieira, Javier/G-1167-2016; lozano, javier/K-8970-2017","Blanco, Esther/0000-0002-4887-5717; lozano, javier/0000-0003-0265-2291",,,,,82,60,67,0,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Here we investigate where changes in the price of crude oil originate and how they spread by examining causal relationships among prices for crude oils from North America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East on both spot and futures markets. Results indicate that innovations first appear in spot prices for Dubai-Fateh and spread to other spot and futures prices while other innovations first appear in the far month contract for West Texas intermediate and spread to other exchanges and contracts. Links between spot and futures markets are relatively weak and this may have allowed the long-run relationship between spot and future prices to change after September 2004.

Once tacit collusion developed, it proved remarkably robust to institutional changes that weakened it as an equilibrium of a game-theoretic model.

J,"Maddison, A",,,,"Maddison, Angus",,,MEASURING THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF TRANSITION ECONOMIES: SOME LESSONS FROM CHINESE EXPERIENCE,REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CAPITA; REAL; GDP,"This article quantifies the comparative performance of China in several dimensions. Firstly, it shows that China's move from a command to a market economy was less abrupt and more successful than that of 29 other economies making a similar transition. Secondly, while official estimates show annual GDP growth of 9.6 percent in 1978-2003, this is reduced to 7.9 percent after adjustment for exaggeration of industrial performance and growth in non-material services. Thirdly, as the exchange rate understates China's achievement, a purchasing power parity (PPP) converter is necessary to measure comparative level of performance. Our PPP converter shows that China in 2005 was the world's second largest economy, with a GDP about 80 percent of the U.S. It is assumed that China will have overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest economy before 2015. Until recently, the World Bank estimate of the PPP for China was close to that of Maddison, but the Bank's new estimate for 2005 shows Chinese GDP about half this level. The Bank's new estimates for China and other Asian countries are not plausible, and this paper advances several reasons for rejecting them. Finally, energy use per head of population is a good deal smaller than that of the U.S., and its total energy use for a much bigger population is likely to be somewhat smaller than that of the U.S. in 2030. However, heavy dependence on dirty coal means that it will have bigger carbon emissions than the U.S. This is a major problem as Beijing and other big cities already have severe pollution problems.","[Maddison, Angus] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Maddison, A (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",angus.maddison@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,31,17,17,1,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Boulding uses the notion of noosphere of human knowledge, where learning transmits the noogenetic structure. Hayek's and Boulding's Lamarckian theories are compared with Darwin's theory of social evolution to explore how the latter may be extended to explain the links between human knowledge, rules, and evolution of society, outlining a Darwinian social/cultural approach.

A seemingly unrelated time-series version shows much of the explanatory power of the data to be in the irregular (fast-moving) component. An OLS regression produces robust goodness-of-fit and diagnostic results, and the coefficient estimates produce inferences in contrast to those of Schmidt and Berri (2001), with persistent shocks.","La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Lenten, LJA (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",l.lenten@latrobe.edu.au,,"Lenten, Liam/0000-0001-7694-994X",,,,,34,18,18,0,8,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The traditional Taylor rule is amended by the inclusion of the growth rate of nominal wage. or 'wage inflation'. Nominal rigidities are inserted via quadratic adjustment costs for both prices and wages a la Rotemberg [1982. Sticky prices in the United States. journal of Political Economy 90, 1187-1211] and Kim [2000. Constructing and estimating a realistic optimizing model of monetary policy. journal of Monetary Economics 45, 329-359]. Cost of capital adjustment together with a positive steady state inflation rate allow the model to match the main empirical facts about US economy. The model is solved by using a second order approximation around the non-stochastic steady state, as in Kim et al. [2008. Calculating and using second order accurate solutions of discrete time dynamic equilibrium models. journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 32 (11), 3397-3414]. The welfare metric is offered by the second order expansion of the utility function conditional to the non-stochastic steady state. The results show that wage inflation targeting is welfare improving when coupled with inflation targeting. Moreover, optimal monetary rules include also a positive coefficient for output targeting, as the need to smooth out quantity adjustments induced by real and nominal rigidities. Similar results occurs when both targets are in expected value one period-ahead. The model shows good in sample and out of sample properties. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These measures have been helpful in avoiding a further accelerated loss of confidence. But they are not costless. Like any guarantee, deposit insurance gives rise to moral hazard, especially if the coverage is unlimited. In the midst of a crisis, the immediate task is to restore confidence, and guarantees can be helpful in that respect. Nonetheless, to keep market discipline operational, it is important to specify when the extra insurance will end, and this timeline needs to be credible. To be able to establish such a timeline the root causes of the lack of confidence-that is the effects of troubled assets on financial firms' health-need to be addressed effectively. On a more fundamental level, once a government has ventured down the road of guarantee expansion, there may be a general perception that a government guarantee will always be available during crisis situations. As a consequence, other elements of the financial safety net may need to be strengthened, including the prudential and supervisory framework.","OECD, Directorate Financial & Enterprise Affairs, F-75775 Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Schich, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Directorate Financial & Enterprise Affairs, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris, France.",sebastian.schich@oecd.org,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,5,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 25,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200920,,,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20ME,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208143300001,0

In a laboratory setting professional managers are confronted with an intertemporal decision problem in which they have to decide whether or not to search for, and possibly adopt, a new technology. Technologies differ in the per-period benefits they yield, and their purchase price increases with the per-period benefits provided. We introduce a subsidy on the more expensive technologies (that also yield larger per-period benefits), and find that the subsidy scheme induces agents to search for and adopt these more expensive technologies even though the subsidy itself is too small to render these technologies profitable.

In spite of a long tradition dealing with the matter from different perspectives, the emergence of cooperation or defection still remains a controversial issue from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view. In this paper we propose a local interaction model with endogenous network formation, in the attempt to provide a reasonable account of emerging behaviors. A population of boundedly rational agents repeatedly chooses to cooperate or defect. Each agent's action affects only her interacting mates, according to a network of relationships. Agents are randomly given the possibility to substitute undesired mates with unknown ones. Full cooperation, full defection and coexistence of both cooperation and defection in homogeneous clusters are possible outcomes of the model. Computer-based simulations are applied to investigate under what circumstances either case is most likely. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The median overcharge achieved by cartels is 20 percent of selling price. As predicted by cartel theory, market structure is an important determinant of the overcharge level. Markets where cartels have high market shares tend to have higher overcharges. The number of cartel participants and the size inequality among them are inversely related to the overcharge level. International cartels impose higher overcharges than domestic cartels. Overcharges attained in the US and European markets tend to be lower than overcharges achieved in the Asian markets and the rest of the world. Results on the impact of changes in the antitrust law environment over time on the size of cartel overcharges are mixed. However, there is some evidence indicating that the lowest overcharges are associated with the latest antitrust law period. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Given the target, the EGS wage and access can be fine-tuned to deliver Outcomes ranging from a contestable labor market to a simple universal unemployment benefit. The Credibility of any such target, however, is shown to be triggered endogenously by a host of factors: the distributional concerns of the planner, private sector productivity, the prevalence of market power and the need for Public works.

The pervasive assumption in game theoretic models in economics is that players beliefs are unambiguous. This paper argues, drawing on examples from economics and politics, that it may be illuminating, in instances, to model players as having ambiguous beliefs. Optimistic and pessimistic responses to ambiguity are formally modelled. We show that pessimism has the effect of increasing (decreasing) equilibrium prices under Cournot (Bertrand) competition. In addition the effects of ambiguity on peace-making are examined. It is shown that ambiguity may select equilibria in coordination games with multiple equilibria.

Discrete-time multinomial-logit-hazard model estimates indicate that classroom characteristics play a larger role than school average student characteristics in determining teacher mobility. Opportunity wages based on past teacher movements to other competing districts and professions are found to pull teachers away from their initial placements. Once opportunity wages and working conditions are considered, teachers' own salaries are found to exert little impact on teacher mobility within the profession; although, they reduce attrition out of the profession. Policy simulations indicate that targeted salary increases based on teacher-specific working conditions are important to retain teachers at a given school.","Texas State Univ San Marcos, McCoy Coll Business & Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Feng, L (通讯作者)，Texas State Univ San Marcos, McCoy Coll Business & Adm, Dept Finance & Econ, McCoy Hall 561,601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",LF20@txstate.edu,"Feng, Li/D-7155-2014","Feng, Li/0000-0002-0536-1791",,,,,46,51,117,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Our model is solved under three alternative scenarios: (i) the intermediate sector is composed of a public monopoly under government control; (ii) the intermediate sector is dominated by a private monopoly; and (iii) the intermediate sector is competitive. The comparison of these models suggests that the income benefits of state-to-market transitions are mostly due to increased competition on the deregulated market and that the privatization of state enterprises is not likely to generate significant changes in the economy when the public monopoly is replaced by a private monopoly.

TO answer this question, we construct a model of unionized mixed duopoly and examine the regulatory framework of public institutions, especially focusing on a wage regulation imposed on the public firm. The wage regulation turns out to yield critical welfare implications as it gives rise to two opposing Strategic effects: the wage regulation intensifies downstream-market competition while it loosens upstream-market competition. The overall welfare effect is ambiguous, depending crucially on the degree of product differentiation between the firms. We also show that, in contrast to the popular belief,,ranting the right to bargain collectively to civil servants would not necessarily help them because they tend to demand excessively high wages when they are allowed to bargain collectively, Finally, we briefly discuss I new perspective on the role of profit motives in public institutions when the wages are determined endogenously.

Using data from the World Values Survey and other sources, we study various explanations of this phenomenon. First, we document that the disparity in life satisfaction between residents of transition and nontransition countries is much larger among the elderly. Second, we find that deterioration in public goods provision, an increase in macroeconomic volatility, and a mismatch of human capital of residents educated before transition (which disproportionately affects the aged population) explain a great deal of the difference in life satisfaction between transition countries and other countries with similar income and other macroeconomic conditions. The rest of the gap is explained by the difference in the quality of the samples. As in other countries, life satisfaction in transition countries is strongly related to income; but, due to a higher nonresponse of high-income individuals in transition countries, the survey-data estimates of the recent increase in life satisfaction, driven by 10-year sustained economic growth in transition region, are biased downwards. The evidence suggests that if the region keeps growing, life satisfaction in transition countries will catch up with the normal level in the near future.","[Guriev, Sergei; Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina] New Econ Sch, Ctr Econ & Financial Res, Moscow, Russia",New Economic School,"Guriev, S (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Ctr Econ & Financial Res, Moscow, Russia.",sguriev@nes.ru; ezhuravskaya@efir.ru,"Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169; Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina/0000-0002-3496-2086",,,,,33,127,135,1,29,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Recently an anti-cartel policy called a leniency program has been introduced in many countries as an effective policy to dissolve cartels. In this paper, we studied several kinds of leniency programs through laboratory experiments. We experimentally controlled for three factors: 1) cartel size: the number of cartel members in a group, small (two-person) or large (seven-person), 2) fine schedule: the number of firms that are given leniency, and 3) degree of leniency: a partially reduced fine, a fully reduced fine, or a reward is given to self-reporting firms. The experimental results showed that (I) an increase in the number of cartel members in a group increased the number of cartels dissolved, (2) changing the fine schedule had no significant effect both in the two-person group size and in the seven-person group size, and (3) positive enforcement such as giving a reward for a self-reporting firm in a courageous leniency program has great impact on dissolving cartel activities, (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores the ways discrete data can be incorporated into PCA. The effects of discreteness of the observed variables on the PCA are reviewed. The statistical properties of the popular Filmer and Pritchett (2001) procedure are analyzed. The concepts of polychoric and polyserial correlations are introduced with appropriate references to the existing literature demonstrating their statistical properties. A large simulation study is carried out to compare various implementations of discrete data PCA. The simulation results show that the currently used method of running PCA on a set of dummy variables as proposed by Filmer and Pritchett (2001) can be improved upon by using procedures appropriate for discrete data, such as retaining the ordinal variables without breaking them into a set of dummy variables or using polychoric correlations. An empirical example using Bangladesh 2000 Demographic and Health Survey data helps in explaining the differences between procedures.","[Kolenikov, Stanislav] Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Kolenikov, S (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",kolenikovs@missouri.edu,"Kolenikov, Stas/AAG-5091-2019; Kolenikov, Stanislav/F-8341-2010","Kolenikov, Stas/0000-0003-2977-7326; Kolenikov, Stanislav/0000-0003-2977-7326",,,,,80,481,546,1,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

For all its presumed flaws, the particular approach to macroeconomic and structural policies that has been adopted by the Chinese government has helped to deliver high productivity and output growth, along with a reasonable degree of macroeconomic stability. There comes a point, however, when the policy distortions needed to maintain this approach could generate imbalances, impose potentially large welfare costs, and themselves become a source of instability. The traditional risks faced by emerging market economies, especially those related to having an open capital account, do not loom large in the case of China. In the process of securing protection against external risks, however, Chinese policymakers may have increased the risks of internal instability. There are a number of factors that could trigger unfavorable economic dynamics that, even if they don't rise to the level of a crisis, could have serious adverse repercussions on growth and welfare. The flexibility and potency of macroeconomic tools to deal with such negative shocks is constrained by the panoply of policies that has supported growth so far. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

If China is to replace fossil fuels on a large scale with renewable energy sources, the production costs and prices of renewable energy must be brought down. All countries are facing the challenge of moving to a more secure and low-carbon energy system without weakening economic and social development. In this regard, China is facing an even greater challenge in terms of economic cost, as cheap coal remains the main energy form. Technical innovation and industrialization in the area of renewable energy is an important means of lowering cost.

The incentives and behavior of judges, however, remain largely opaque. Do judges act as neutral third-party enforcers of substantive decisions made by others? Are judges ordinary policymakers who advance whatever outcomes they favor without any special consideration for law as such? Emerging recent scholarship has started to explore more nuanced conceptions of how law, facts, and judicial preferences may interact to influence judicial decisions. This work develops a perspective on judging that can usefully be understood as the modern manifestation of American Legal Realism, a jurisprudential movement of lawyers, judges, and law professors that flourished in the early twentieth century. The purpose of this essay is to introduce, in simplified form, the Realist account of judicial decision making; to contrast this view with alternative theories about law and judging; and to sketch out how a more explicit integration of the Realists' conceptual insights about law and judicial behavior might enrich the rapidly expanding economic work in this field.","Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Stephenson, MC (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mstephen@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,90,42,47,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

It shows that the utility-based loss function for this economy can be written as a quadratic expression of domestic inflation, output gap and real exchange rate. The presence of an internal monopolistic distortion and a terms of trade externality drives optimal policy away from domestic inflation targeting and affects the optimal level of exchange rate volatility. When domestic and foreign goods are close substitutes for each other, the optimal policy rule implies lower real exchange rate volatility than a domestic inflation targeting regime.

Using a comprehensive sample of U.S. corporation tax returns for the period 1982-2005, we explore a variety of potential explanations for this Surge in tax losses, taking account of the significant use of executive compensation stock options beginning in the 1990s and recent temporary tax provisions that might have had important effects on taxable income. We find that losses rose because the average rate of return of C corporations fell, rather than because of an increase in the dispersion of returns or an increase in the gap between corporate profits subject to tax and corporate profits as measured by the national income accounts. Our analysis also suggests that the increasing importance of S corporations may help explain the recent experience within the C corporate sector, as S corporations have exhibited a different pattern of losses in recent years. However, we can identify no simple explanation for the differing experience of C and S corporations. Our investigation concludes with some new puzzles: why did rates of return of C corporations fall so much early in the decade, and why has the incidence of losses among C and S corporations diverged?","[Altshuler, Rosanne] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,,,,,,,,,15,18,22,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0892-8649,,978-0-226-07654-6,TAX POL EC,,,2009,23.0,,,,,,73,122,,10.1086/597055,0.0,,,50,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BKM84,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268600700003,0

This included the adoption of concrete measures directed towards the growth and increase of the financial sector efficiency. Given this we use panel data over the period 1999-2007 for a sample of 21 countries, to test the convergence's hypothesis by the Bayesian iterative estimation method. Here two financial variables are introduced to control the differences in steady-state.

This paper investigates the importance of relative income within and between castes in the Indian caste system, using a choice experimental approach. The results indicate that slightly more than half of the marginal utility of income comes from some kind of relative income effects, on average. This is comparable to the results from previous studies in other countries. Belonging to a low caste and having a low family income are associated with higher concern for relative income. Moreover, an increase in the mean income of the caste to which the individual belongs, everything else held constant, reduces utility for the individual. Thus, the negative welfare effect of having a reduced relative income compared to the own caste average income dominates the positive welfare effect due to increased relative income of the own caste compared to the income of other castes.","[Carlsson, Fredrik; Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gupta, Gautam] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Econ, Kolkata 700032, India",University of Gothenburg; Jadavpur University,"Carlsson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.carlsson@economics.gu.se; gautamju@yahoo.com,"Carlsson, Fredrik/E-3734-2010","Johansson-Stenman, Olof/0000-0003-4460-4765; Carlsson, Fredrik/0000-0003-4789-8009",,,,,50,35,37,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Public officials have unsustainably and irresponsibly exploited Nauru's trust funds for decades, denying future generations the benefit of the phosphate resource by subsidising public consumption instead of looking for long-term investment in human and physical capital. In contrast, the mineral trust funds of other countries, such as the Norwegian Petroleum Fund and the Alaskan Permanent Fund, have been successful in managing mineral wealth by maintaining clear rules regarding governance, and diverting dividends to individuals rather than to government bodies to manage.

Such an investigation is important, since large and persistent budget deficits may impose strains on the foreign exchange markets and are considered by some to be one of the main causes of crises in international financial markets. We permit regime shifts in the cointegration analysis, which extends empirical modelling relative to existing studies. We find that the admission of regime shifts substantially influences the empirical conclusions: we find a long-run relationship between budget deficits, real interest rate and current account deficit in 13 out of 23 countries, whereas the number of countries with apparent long-run relationships is dramatically reduced when regime shifts are not permitted. We argue that, when structural breaks are taken into account, it seems to be the countries with a more extensive financial infrastructure in which the twin deficits are less likely to be conjoined.","[Daly, Vince; Siddiki, Jalal U.] Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, Kingston KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Siddiki, JU (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",J.Siddiki@kingston.ac.uk,,"Siddiki, Jalal/0000-0002-4313-1866",,,,,12,32,34,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The Dutch government plans to gradually replace car purchase and ownership taxes by a national road user charging system (kilometre charge) in the period 2012 to 2016. As a result, new and second hand car prices in the Netherlands will drop up to 30%. Relatively little research has been conducted on the impacts of such large price changes on car ownership. Reduced car prices are likely to lead to an increase in car ownership. But consumers could also refrain from buying extra cars when they consider the extra operating costs resulting from the kilometre charge. This paper presents one of the few empirical studies to examine the effects of both (large) fixed and variable car cost changes on both car ownership and use. An internet survey among Dutch households was designed and conducted including stated intentions and stated preference experiments. We investigated whether households react more to present one-off fixed costs than to recurrent variable costs, for various specifications of car costs. Model analysis was conducted to derive fixed and variable price elasticities for private car ownership and effects of the kilometre charge. The study shows in their car purchase decisions, households react more strongly to a change in euro per year in fixed car costs than to a euro per year in variable car costs. Abolishing the Dutch car purchase tax while at the same time introducing a kilometre charge will lead to 2% rise in car ownership on the short to medium run (1-5 years).","[de Jong, Gerard; Kouwenhoven, Marco; Bucci, Pietro; Tuinenga, Jan Gerrit] Significance, Koninginnegracht 23, NL-2524 AB The Hague, Netherlands; [de Jong, Gerard] ITS Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [de Jong, Gerard] NEA, NL-2700 AG Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Geurs, Karst] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Leeds; University of Twente,"de Jong, G (通讯作者)，Significance, Koninginnegracht 23, NL-2524 AB The Hague, Netherlands.",dejong@significance.nl; kouwenhoven@significance.nl; k.t.geurs@utwente.nl; bucci@significance.nl; tuinenga@significance.nl,,"Geurs, Karst/0000-0003-0918-8903",,,,,29,8,9,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

At the same time, it introduces some methodological and informational improvements. The most significant is the structural decomposition of the economy, associated with input-output techniques. Due to the relatively advanced stage of the transition processes in Romania, the behavioural functions were accommodated - as much as possible - to the standard relationships. Unlike the versions that used the statistical series beginning with 1980, the present one is based exclusively on information concerning the period 1989-2004.

Chinese manufacturing industries reversed an early drop in industrial agglomeration and have been increasingly agglomerated since the early 1990s. Resource-intensive industries have been relatively dispersed while export-oriented industries have been progressively agglomerated. Industries driven by market and global forces are agglomerated while those favoured and protected by local governments are widely dispersed. Statistical analysis confirms a significant positive relationship between industrial agglomeration and labour productivity in China. This positive relationship was particularly prominent in liberalised and globalised industries in the 1980s and has been found in most industries since the 1990s. The empirical results imply that marketisation and globalisation have stimulated industrial agglomeration and thereby raised industrial competitiveness in China.,"[He, Can-fei; Zhu, Sheng-jun] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"He, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Zhu, Shengjun/AAD-3723-2020",,,,,,22,11,12,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2009,21.0,1,,,,,103,115,PII 909478442,10.1080/14631370802663711,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,418HE,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264138500007,0

This is in the interests of large and small, rich and poor and emerging countries alike. In fact, the absence since the 1970s of a universal monetary order and the prevailing monetary nationalism and regionalism at a time of globalization and global finance have been responsible for a lack of equitable adjustment mechanisms and of effective checks and balances on financial and fiscal excesses in the world economy. The recurring financial crises have been hurting the economies not only of the poorer but by now also of the richest economies. The task of designing, negotiating and implementing a new international monetary order is clearly a combined political and economic and security challenge. A possible approach for a new design could be inspired by the original European Monetary System (EMS). The responsibility for this initiative for an Extended EMS belongs first and foremost to the three principal market economies: the United States, the European Union and Japan. From the start this Extended EMS would benefit the entire world economy - including the major new powers such as Brazil, China and India, and the weaker economies that suffer the most from the recurring financial crises. In the long run it would also be open to new members in order to become a truly universal system. But it is only the commitment and active participation of the three main pillars of the liberal international economic order, the US, Europe and Japan could be the guaranty of success: the absence of either one of the three would inevitably lead to failure with dire consequences for the outlook for an integrated and prosperous world economy.",,,,hieronymi@webster.ch,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,2,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Development of traditional business processes is not sufficient in order to reach long-lasting effect and wishes to survive in competitive surrounding determine use of electronic business potential, which can help to get a competitive advantage. The basis of electronic business is application of information and communication technologies having changed the usual conception of business and having formed the conditions, for business development worldwide. The extents of business partners' cooperation determine improving of electronic business models. The term business model is used in the context of traditional and Internet business, In a general sense business model is a method of business organization in a company and its major aim is profit. As the processes of globalization have been taking place, development of information technologies determines the changes in the processes of business organization and in the conception of traditional business models. The importance of Electronic business models increases due to constant broadening of extents of corporations' activity. The analysis of the conception of Electronic business models working and the problem aspects is presented in the article. With the reference to the analysis of academic works the conceptions of traditional business and Internet business are summarized, the structure of electronic business model is described The classification of electronic business models according to the consumer's type is offered. Considering Electronic business models, which are used in usual practice, the analysis of four business models, their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages is presented, The greatest attention in the article is focused on the models business-to-business, business-to-consumer, government-to-business, government-to-consumer. Use of electronic business models gives companies possibility to survive under the conditions of competition, to reach greater markets, educate loyal consumers. However, it is impossible to single out one concrete electronic business model in most companies' activity as in practice several Electronic business models are combined in order to get the greatest efficiency. So the backgrounds of interaction between Electronic business models are emphasized in the article. Considering to the analysis of academic literature it is possible to maintain that interaction between Electronic business models takes place in the context of globalization, educated society and government.","[Jovarauskiene, Donata; Pilinkiene, Vaida] Kauno Tech Univ, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Jovarauskiene, D (通讯作者)，Kauno Tech Univ, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,24,14,15,0,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Econometrically, we demonstrate that in the regional structures the main economic variables (dynamics of the gross domestic product per capita, rate of unemployment, dynamics of the average net nominal monthly earnings, etc.) do not significantly influence the voting behaviour, so that a model based on the responsibility hypothesis is not adequate for explaining the creation of voting preferences in the Romanian regional structures in the June 2008 elections. We also demonstrate that for the June 2008 local elections the hypothesis of partisan voting cannot be econometrically supported. As a consequence, we have conceived a political impact model.

We show that within-country regional variation in inherited human capital in four such economies explains the bulk of regional variation in unemployment; we explore potential explanations. Our evidence suggests that internal skill-biased migration and the flow of foreign direct investment are not working as adjustment mechanisms but rather help explain the lack of convergence in regional unemployment rates. Although this capital and labour mobility pattern is consistent with the presence of regional skill spillovers, we find little support for this hypothesis. Instead, the observed migration pattern appears to arise from different skill-specific adjustments to regional shocks brought about in part by labour-market institutions such as guaranteed welfare income.","[Jurajda, Stepan] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE, EI, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Jurajda, Stepan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Econ, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Terrell, Katherine] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Terrell, Katherine] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Jurajda, S (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, CERGE, EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic.",stepan.jurajda@cerge-ei.cz; terrell@umich.edu,"Jurajda, Stepan/H-2886-2014","Jurajda, Stepan/0000-0001-6176-2656",,,,,44,28,31,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We focus on an empirically relevant case with moderately large instabilities, which are well approximated by a local asymptotic embedding that does not allow the instability to be detected with certainty, even in the limit. We show that for many forms of the instability and a large class of GMM models, usual GMM inference on the subset of stable parameters is asymptotically unaffected by the partial instability. In the empirical analysis of presumably stable parameters-such as structural parameters in Euler conditions-one can thus ignore moderate instabilities in other parts of the model and still obtain approximately correct inference.","[Li, Hong] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Mueller, Ulrich K.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Brandeis University; Princeton University,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",,,,,,,,42,9,12,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The findings suggest that exchange rate players may effectively monitor and forecast the exchange rate movement via the money supplies, incomes, and interest rates variables of both Thailand and Japan.

On the basis of Johansen's cointegration test and ADCC model, the empirical results suggest that the release of investor restrictions among the submarkets has an impact on the market integration. The cointegration tests demonstrate the evidence of one cointegration relationships among the A-, B- and H- shares after the B- shares were available to local investors. The GARCH-ADCC model estimates the dynamic correlations between each two submarkets.

However, taking over risks, in banking cannot be entirely avoided An inadequate risk management, influences of various macro and microeconomic factors are cause of losses whose accumulation infallibly leads to a banking crisis. The regulatory and supervisory authorities have never been able to completely prevent the appearance of banking crises, which then, as situations when the bank's liabilities surpass the market value of its assets, lead to a decrease in the value of its assets (capital and claims) in relation to its liabilities and a decrease of the net value of the bank. Although once a rare phenomenon, banking crises became more frequent during the 1980es and 1990es, affecting the banking systems of both developed and developing economies (examples of Chile, Argentina, Poland, Spain, USA, Japan and other countries). The Croatian banking system has been through similar crises, while at the same time undergoing the process of banks privatization.

Yet, flexible and integrated regional labour markets can help achieve both equity and macroeconomic goals. Therefore, this study examines the dynamics of Canadian provincial labour markets using a long-run restrictions structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. Labour market fluctuations are decomposed into the parts arising from shocks to labour demand (new jobs), labour supply through migration (new people) and internal labour supply (original residents). The results suggest that demand innovations primarily underlie provincial labour market fluctuations. Despite significant geographic and language barriers that could impede their performance, there also is little overall evidence to suggest that provincial labour markets are more sluggish or less flexible than US state labour markets. Finally, original residents benefit slightly more from increased provincial labour demand compared to findings for US states.","[Rickman, Dan S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Rickman, DS (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",dan.rickman@okstate.edu,,"Rickman, Dan/0000-0003-1233-7420",,,,,45,10,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The effects of these policies on the external accounts have largely been ignored. We endogenize FDI inflows in a structuralist general equilibrium framework to contribute towards filling this gap. Our economy consists of: (i) a non-tradable goods sector and (ii) an export processing zone (EPZ) that hosts transnational corporations. We find that most of the commonly pursued policies considered are likely to have a negative impact on the balance of payments due to: (i) income re-distribution towards groups more likely to spend on imported goods, (ii) higher capacity utilization in the (more import-intensive) EPZ, and (iii) the excess supply of non-tradables created, which in turn has an adverse valuation effect via a real internal depreciation. Strong backward linkages, however, may under certain conditions help offset the adverse impact through a favorable valuation effect.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The results show that a long-run relationship exists between the trade variables and RD expenditure and a unidirectional causality run from RD expenditure to exports, imports and net exports. Further, the variance decomposition and impulse response functions confirm that, a significant portion of fluctuations in the trade variables beyond the sample period is explained by RD expenditure. Therefore, government policies that lift expenditures on business RD are shown to contribute to the narrowing of Australia's chronic trade deficits.","[Salim, Ruhul A.; Bloch, Harry] Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Salim, RA (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Ruhul.Salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Bloch, Harry/A-9591-2008; Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925",,,,,33,22,22,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, because of the difficulties which the wood products industry, particularly the plywood industry, has experienced over the past decade, the question arises whether export substitution provides the proper incentives to develop an efficient manufacturing industry.","Indonesian Inst Sci P2E LIPI, Econ Res Ctr, Jakarta 12710, Indonesia",National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI),"Thee, KW (通讯作者)，Indonesian Inst Sci P2E LIPI, Econ Res Ctr, 5F Jalan Gatot Subroto 10, Jakarta 12710, Indonesia.",theekw@cbn.net.id,,,,,,,20,6,8,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Tourism demand is proxied by revenue collected from an ad valorem hotel room tax in Savannah. The hotel tax revenue series is first modelled as a seasonal ARIMA model with three intervention variables: an index variable to capture the influence of the best-selling book and two dummy variables to represent the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and hurricane Floyd. The presence of time-varying variance in the residuals is captured through an ARCH model. The results indicate that the book index had a positive and significant impact on hotel tax receipts, while the dummy variables for the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and hurricane Floyd were each negative with only the dummy variable for hurricane Floyd marginally significant.","[Payne, James E.] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Toma, Michael; McGrath, Richard] Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Dept Econ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA",Illinois State University; University System of Georgia; Armstrong Atlantic State University,"Payne, JE (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",jepayne@ilstu.edu,"Payne, James/IZQ-1848-2023; Payne, James/Q-9569-2019",,,,,,13,2,2,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This claim raises the following empirical question, does inflation alter the composition of real output; that is, does it change real output shares? We examine this question using dynamic panel data methods for nine sector panels each with seven OECD countries from 1970 to 2005.

Institutional vulnerability can arise through communication between actors in a common language. To apprehend this requires an elaboration of John Searle's (1995, 2005) argument that language is the fundamental institution. Ontologically, language delineates and circumscribes a community. A community cannot function without a common language, and language at the same time constitutes a community's boundaries, allowing for focused and effective communication within a community. Communication through language introduces ambiguity as well, however, and so institutional reproduction, mediated by language, is a deeply contentious process. Communication across boundaries may particularly irritate a system, as Niklas Luhmann has argued. How can institutions then be re-identified through change? Searle's general form for institutions is in need of elaboration. We develop arguments by drawing upon Luhmann's (1995) systems analysis and notion of communication.","[Dolfsma, Wilfred] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Finch, John] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Groningen; University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow,"Dolfsma, W (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",,"Finch, John/N-6351-2014","Finch, John/0000-0003-2480-8541",,,,,44,14,16,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Health is a form of general human capital; labor turnover and labor-market frictions prevent an employer-employee pair from capturing the entire surplus from investment in an employee's health. Thus, the pair underinvests in health during working years, thereby increasing medical expenditures during retirement. We provide empirical evidence consistent with the comparative statics predictions of our model using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).

For males, I describe and contrast results from three basic types of model: static models (especially those that account for nonlinear taxes), life-cycle models with savings, and life-cycle models with both savings and human capital. For women, more important distinctions are whether models include fixed costs of work, and whether they treat demographics like fertility and marriage (and human capital) as exogenous or endogenous. The literature is characterized by considerable controversy over the responsiveness of labor supply to changes in wages and taxes. At least for males, it is fair to say that most economists believe labor supply elasticities are small. But a sizable minority of studies that I examine obtain large values. Hence, there is no clear consensus on this point. In fact, a simple average of Hicks elasticities across all the studies I examine is 0.31. Several simulation studies have shown that such a value is large enough to generate large efficiency costs of income taxation. For males, I conclude that two factors drive many of the differences in results across studies. One factor is use of direct versus ratio wage measures, with studies that use the former tending to find larger elasticities. Another factor is the failure of most studies to account for human capital returns to work experience. I argue that this may lead to downward bias in elasticity estimates. In a model that includes human capital, I show how even modest elasticities-as conventionally measured-can be consistent with large efficiency costs of taxation. For women, in contrast, it is fair to say that most studies find large labor supply elasticities, especially on the participation margin. In particular, I find that estimates of long-run labor supply elasticities-by which I mean estimates that allow for dynamic effects of wages on fertility, marriage, education and work experience-are generally quite large.","[Keane, Michael P.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Keane, Michael P.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Keane, MP (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377",,,,,112,202,249,2,54,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Several decompositions of the profit rate are explored in pursuit of proximate determinants of the rising profit rate. A Marxian decomposition shows that the 1920s were characterised by a rising rate of surplus-value and a falling composition of capital; and the 1930s by a constant rate of surplus-value and a falling composition of capital. A decomposition into the product of profit share and capital productivity shows that the profit share in the first half of the 1920s was driven upwards by the excess of productivity growth over real wage rate growth, but thereafter fluctuated inversely with fluctuations in the unproductive wage share; the predominant positive impact on the profit rate was rising capital productivity. This was due to rising labour productivity with constant capital intensity in the 1920s, and rising labour productivity with falling capital intensity in the 1930s. Some implications for both Marxian theory and historical interpretation are considered.","[Mohun, Simon] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Mohun, S (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",s.mohun@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,1,2,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The treasury bond market is one of the financial market segments. Polish membership in the European Union and liberalization of capital movement were important factors in the development of the Polish Treasury bond market. General government deficits and public debt in the EU countries and in Poland have made this market develop. The aim of this paper is to examine the degree of Polish treasury bond market integration with that in the eurozone. An analysis of integration of these two Treasury bond markets based on the beta-convergence model and sigma-convergence model showed a decrease in the degree of integration in the period 2004-7 and an increase in the said degree in the period 2008-9. The analysis dealing with the evolution of the beta coefficient, the alpha(i,t) intercept, and the variance ratio (VRi,t), as well as the mean, distance (delta(i,t)) of the beta coefficient from the value of 1, meaning full integration, confirmed these tendencies.

The existing dominant moneylender, the bank official and the new moneylenders move sequentially. The existing moneylender acts as a Stackelberg leader and unilaterally decides on the informal interest rate. We show that there may arise a case where an increase in the supply of formal credit results in an increase in the informal interest rate under reasonable parametric restrictions. This shows that apart from (i) asymmetric information on the part of informal sector lenders (Bose, 1998), (ii) an increase in the probability of default of all informal sector lenders (Hoff and Stiglitz 1997), and the (iii) possibility of informal lenders to collude (Floro and Ray 1997), the presence of corruption in the distribution of formal credit might be another factor responsible for the policy of vertical linkage to break down.

The main reason behind this development is that the regions complement each other in several dimensions. China and India are the fastest-growing, oil-consuming nations in the world, while GCC countries have the largest proven deposits of oil and gas. The GCC is interested in China and India as reliable oil customers over the long-run and the latter look at the GCC as reliable suppliers of oil and gas. The two regions are also attracted to each other because both are enjoying strong economic growth and offer many investment opportunities to the other. It is expected that GCC economic relations with China and India will grow stronger in the coming decades and serve as a good example of South-South economic cooperation for other developing countries.","Brandeis Univ, Crown Ctr Middle E Studies, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Brandeis University,"Habibi, N (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Crown Ctr Middle E Studies, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",,"Habibi, Nader/N-1371-2018","Habibi, Nader/0000-0002-8666-2085",,,,,16,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0818-9935,,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We develop the analytical form of the price dynamics, and we display graphics for the responses of prices, output and inflation. We show that the choice made for each of the three assumptions has a strong influence on the dynamic properties.

Workers invest some of their endowments into building up and fostering their social networks as an insurance device against future job losses.

Our purpose is to examine the intensity of coverage of economic issues as a function of the underlying economic conditions and the political affiliation of the incumbent president, focusing on unemployment, inflation, the federal budget and the trade deficit. We investigate whether there is any significant correlation between the endorsement policy of newspapers, and the differential coverage of bad/good economic news as a function of the president's political affiliation. We find evidence that newspapers with pro-Democratic endorsement pattern systematically give more coverage to high unemployment when the incumbent president is a Republican than when the president is Democratic, compared to newspapers with pro-Republican endorsement pattern. This result is robust to controlling for the partisanship of readers. We find similar but less robust results for the trade deficit.

Buchanan has emphasized that a subjective conception of economics, and a focus put on exchange rather than on choice, has implications on an analysis of externalities. In this paper, we analyze the reverse claim: Buchanan's views on externalities are a perfect illustration of his plea for subjectivism in economics, and the need to focus on economics-as-a-science-of exchange.

This study used data from 3079 adult participants in Japan's Social Policy and Social Consciousness (SPSC) survey conducted in 2000. Controlling for unobserved city size- and area-specific fixed effects, I find through Ordered Probit estimations that social capital has a significantly positive effect on health status for long-time but not for short-time residents. Results also suggested that the experience of divorce is negatively associated with health status for long-time but not short-time residents. People can enjoy a social network, a kind of social capital, if they are a member of such a network. Nevertheless, people appear to be negatively influenced if they are excluded from networks. Such positive and negative effects of social capital are more obvious when people are more deeply integrated into a community. Empirical study provided evidence that social capital and socio-economic effects on health status are significantly influenced by the extent to which respondents are integrated into a community.

Indeed, the increase in FDI more than offsets the decline in the extent of production undertaken by Southern imitators so that the South's share of the global basket of goods increases.

In this paper, we analyse how efficiently this tax is administered in the Spanish case. While we find that the managerial (or net) efficiency of the tax administration was very high for the period 1993-2002 (95.9%), our main aim here is to identify the determinants of this. Interestingly, political factors are found to play a role. Specifically, the fear of losing a parliamentary seat in a region forces the tax authorities to reduce their efficiency in ensuring tax compliance in that region (swing voter model). Additionally, in those electoral districts where the central government obtains higher electoral support the efforts to collect taxes diminish (core voter model). However, the former political effect tends to disappear when the central government holds a sufficient majority in the central parliament. Thus, we find empirical evidence on redistributive politics in tax administration.","Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Esteller-Moré, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",aesteller@ub.edu,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Our results show that fiscal and monetary policies in China can be adequately described using some simple rules, and that significant regime shifts took place around 1998. Fiscal policy tended to be active and countercyclical in the pre-1998 period, then switched to be passive and more countercyclical, whereas monetary policy was characterized as passive and procyclical in the pre-1998 period, and switched to be active and countercyclical afterwards. The mix of fiscal and monetary policy rules can explain inflation dynamics better than the monetary policy rule alone. Therefore, price stability requires not only appropriate monetary policy but also appropriate fiscal policy.","[Guo, Qingwang; Jia, Junxue] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhiyun] Inst Sci & Tech Informat China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Jia, JX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",guoqw@ruc.edu.cn; jiajunx@ruc.edu.cn; zyjzxyshuai@163.com; zhiyunzhao@istic.ac.cn,"zhao, zhiyun/E-6560-2011",,,,,,26,4,5,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2011,19.0,5,,,,,47,66,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01258.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,829YZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000295624500004,0

Since there are multiple representations for these transient data features using a set of bases available, the sparsity measure based Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) model is proposed in this paper to find the optimal combinations of representations to model these transient data features. Therefore, this paper proposes a MCA based hybrid methodology for analyzing and forecasting the risk evolution in the crude oil market. The underlying transient data components with distinct behaviors are extracted and analyzed using MCA model. The proposed algorithm incorporates these transient data features to adjust for conservative risk estimates from traditional approach based on normal market condition during its risk measurement process. The reliability and stability of Value at Risk (VaR) estimated improve as a result of finer modeling procedure in the multi frequency and time domain while maintaining competent accuracy level, as supported by empirical studies in the representative West Taxes Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil market.

This study aims to examine those factors that have the most significant impact on the degree to which market studies are utilised by companies. Most of the work in this area has studied the use of information in strategic decisions a priori. This paper - while reflecting on the findings of research on organisational theories of information processing - aims to bridge this gap. It proposes and tests a new conceptual framework that examines the use of managerial market research information in decision-making and knowledge creation within one single model. Collected survey data, including all the top-income business enterprises in Hungary indicate that market research findings are efficiently incorporated into the marketing information system only if the marketing manager has trust in the researcher, and believes that the market study is of high quality. Decision-makers are more likely to learn from market studies facilitating the resolution of some specific problem than descriptive studies of a more general nature.","Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Mkt, Inst Mkt & Media, Fac Business Adm, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Keszey, T (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Mkt, Inst Mkt & Media, Fac Business Adm, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",tamara.keszey@uni-corvinus.hu,"Keszey, Tamara/E-8735-2016","Keszey, Tamara/0000-0003-2535-9581",,,,,71,4,4,0,24,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The equal-equivalent utility function defines individual welfare cleaned of differences in sui generis individual tastes and hedonic capacities deemed irrelevant for macrojustice. Then, equal allocation is a deeper end-value than equal welfare but has to be complemented by free choice for freedom, Pareto efficiency and a demanded partial self-ownership.

We decompose total factor productivity into technical efficiencies and environment-technology gap ratios across four climatic zones for selected years from 1996/1997 to 2005/2006 using farm-level panel data. Results show surprisingly little interzonal and intertemporal variation in productivity. It appears that Philippine rice producers have been able to adapt their crop management strategies sufficiently to suit their particular agroclimatic conditions. However, after an increase in the first 5 years of the study period, mean environment-metatechnology gap ratios stagnated in the second 5 years. The metafrontier does not appear to have substantially shifted outwards over the whole period, suggesting that rice producers achieved little technological progress and increased total factor productivity.","[Mariano, Marc Jim; Villano, Renato; Fleming, Euan] Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Mariano, Marc Jim] Philippine Rice Res Inst, Socioecon Div, Nueva Ecija 3119, Philippines",University of New England; Philippine Rice Research Institute,"Villano, R (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business Econ & Publ Policy, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",mjmariano21@yahoo.com; rvillan2@une.edu.au; efleming@une.edu.au,"; Villano, Renato Andrin/I-3680-2017","Mariano, Marc Jim/0000-0002-3792-7112; Villano, Renato Andrin/0000-0003-2581-6623",,,,,25,33,37,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the welfare effects of distortions in the intertemporal allocation of R&D resources and to compare diverse policy interventions so as to improve social welfare. To this end, we introduce a calibrated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with Schumpeterian endogenous growth that is capable of explaining the observed procyclicality of R&D. Our results show that the cost of business cycles is lower in the decentralized economy with procyclical R&D than in the efficient allocation with countercyclical R&D. This is because the suboptimal propagation of shocks in the decentralized equilibrium offsets some of the existing steady-state distortions. In this second-best context, countercyclical R&D subsidies have no positive effect on welfare. In contrast, fiscal policies aimed at restoring the optimal steady-state produce large welfare gains.","Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Nuño, G (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",galo.nuno@bde.es,,,,,,,29,21,24,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Leibenstein insisted that absent strong competitive pressure, firms are unlikely to use their resources efficiently, and he suggested that X-efficiency is pervasive. Leibenstein, of course, was attacking a fundamental economic assumption: that firms minimize costs. The X-efficiency article created a firestorm of criticism. At the forefront of Leibenstein's powerful critics was George Stigler, who was very protective of classical price theory. In terms of rhetorical success, Stigler's combination of brilliance and bluster mostly carried the day. While Leibenstein's response to Stigler was well reasoned, it never resonated with many economists, and Leibenstein remains undeservedly underappreciated.

The federal government claims the 20 per cent renewable energy target will increase electricity tariffs by 4 per cent. Apart from the direct costs, critics of renewables cite additional 'hidden costs' arising from the intermittency of wind and the subsequent causation of 'back-up plant' for system security. South Australia, where wind's market share now exceeds 17 per cent, provides a valuable case study to analyse 'hidden costs'. The evidence is that hidden costs are trivial and the government's claim appears accurate.","[Simshauser, Paul] Griffith Univ, AGL Energy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Simshauser, Paul] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Simshauser, P (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, AGL Energy, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Simshauser, Paul/H-1244-2015","Simshauser, Paul/0000-0003-1857-550X",,,,,31,18,19,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

It examines how long firms survive after initial signs of economic distress. The study is conducted on an extensive dataset of 5,233 Belgian distress-related exits of mature firms, the majority being privately held. The results highlight that slack resources have an opposite effect on the timing of court driven exits and voluntary liquidations. On the one hand, high levels of available and potential slack increase the time to court driven exit, as they allow distressed firms to postpone an impending court driven exit. On the other hand, high available slack resources shorten the time to voluntary liquidation, since they make voluntary liquidation easier. Further, a high level of stakeholder dependence increases the time to exit after distress, whether the firm exits through voluntary liquidation or through a court decided exit. This is explained by the fact that stakeholder dependence increases the complexity of the exit decision and the exit procedure.","[Manigart, Sophie; Ooghe, Hubert] Vlerick Leuven Ghent Management Sch, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Balcaen, Sofie] Univ Ghent, Dept Accountancy & Corp Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Vlerick Business School; Ghent University,"Manigart, S (通讯作者)，Vlerick Leuven Ghent Management Sch, Reep 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Sofie.Balcaen@UGent.be; Sophie.Manigart@vlerick.com,"Manigart, Sophie/F-9747-2012","Manigart, Sophie/0000-0002-3406-9386",,,,,105,26,31,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It offers a behavioral explanation for the empirically observed lack of relative performance evaluation. We analyze a principal-multi agent model and assume that agents are inequity averse or status seeking. We show that team contracts can be optimal even if the agents' performance measures are positively correlated such that relative performance evaluation would be optimal with purely self-interested agents and even though relative performance evaluation provides additional incentives to provide effort if agents have other-regarding preferences. Furthermore, optimal incentive contracts for other-regarding agents can be low-powered as compared to contracts for purely self-interested agents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This type of collective choice problem arises when members of a federal system have to coordinate nonbudgetary policies such as laws, regulations, standards, or diplomatic policies. Contrary to the common wisdom, decentralization becomes optimal when coordination becomes very important.

O41, J61) We extend the Solow growth model with human capital and migration flows by introducing public capital subjected to congestion as an essential input in the production function. This is an important novelty given that population variation induced by migration affects factors productivity and, hence, growth. We show that, in general, the impact on physical and public capital growth induced by migration is ambiguous and depends on the degree of public capital congestion. As regards the human capital growth rate, not only does it depends on the congestion externality linked to public capital, but also on the relative human capital endowment of migrants with respect to resident population. Moreover, the long-run per capita growth rate coincides with the exogenous technological progress growth rate only when public capital is not congested. In the general case in which congestion affects public capital, the long run-growth rate differs from the traditional Solow model and could even be negative. Finally, we analyse the transitional dynamics and derive the conditional convergence equation for the growth rate of per capita income.","Univ Cagliari, Fac Econ, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Piras, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Fac Econ, Via S Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",pirasr@unica.it,"Piras, Romano/AAF-1499-2020","PIRAS, ROMANO/0000-0002-0809-5732",,,,,41,2,2,0,13,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We study how the strength of competition among sellers affects the ability of sellers of high quality goods to achieve communication by means of appropriate pricing decisions in the context of a market populated by a large number of strategic price-setting sellers and a large number of buyers. When competition among sellers is weak high quality sellers are able to use prices as a signaling device and this enables them to trade. By contrast, strong competition among sellers inhibits the role of prices as signals of high quality, and high quality sellers are driven out of the market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The results presented in this paper are based on a model with firm microeconomic foundations and which takes into account both the supply and demand-side effects of exchange rate variations. The distinguishing feature of the model is the role of exchange rate expectations. We consider three kinds of expectations: adaptive, extrapolative, and regressive expectations. We also perform several sensitivity tests based on these expectations. Our simulation exercise shows that the effect of induced currency depreciation depends largely on supply-side effects. In most cases, we find that currency depreciation results in (i) a fall in output, (ii) an increase in prices and (iii) an improvement in the balance of trade. In the absence of weak supply-side effects of exchange rates, we find that, if the Marshall-Lerner conditions hold, then depreciation of the home currency has a favorable effect on output but its effect on the balance of trade is negative.

Generally, economics coursework and majoring in economics are significantly related to higher levels of earnings, home equity, and savings. They are also associated with working more hours and negatively related to completing graduate degrees (except the MBA). Among graduates with positive savings, those with more economics coursework invest more in individual stocks and money market accounts, and are more likely to have employer-provided life insurance. They have fewer credit cards, which are more often paid in full each month. Most of these findings also hold for graduates who majored in business, but on average economics majors worked more hours and earned more than business majors, were more likely to have been self-employed, and expected to retire at an older age. Business majors were more likely to have experienced a layoff, and were even less likely than economics majors to complete graduate degrees (except the MBA). Economics majors expected to save even more than business majors by retirement, and viewed short-term and precautionary motives for saving as more important. Finally, our results suggest that exposure to economics through course-taking is more important for later outcomes than actual performance in those courses.","[Allgood, Sam] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Bosshardt, William] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [van der Klaauw, Wilbert] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Watts, Michael] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Allgood, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",sallgood@UNLnotes.UNL.edu; wbosshar@FAU.edu; Wilbert.Vanderklaauw@ny.frb.org; mwatts@purdue.edu,"Kim, Moon Jung/D-3519-2014",,,,,,47,13,15,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

As such, it is susceptible to a fallacy that is inherent in such situations: confusing the chances that a person would test positive if he/she was DUI with the chances that a person was DUI if he/she tested positive. This is referred to here as the breathalyser fallacy and this article provides quantitative estimates of the size of this fallacy. Almost all of the criticism of the conclusions of breathalyser tests (namely, a person over the limit is DUI, a person below the limit is not) concerns the likelihood of a person who is not DUI being incorrectly identified. This analysis questions this argument. We show that the likelihood of an innocent person testing positive depends on two further factors: (i) the a priori likelihood that a person selected for breath analysis is, in fact, DUI and (ii) the reliability of the test in terms of the likelihood of a DUI person being found to be over the limit. If these two likelihoods are high, then the probability of a person being guilty of DUI for a positive outcome on the breathalyser test would also be high, even though there is a significant chance that a person who is not DUI will be incorrectly identified as being over the limit.","Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland",Ulster University,"Borooah, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Sch Econ, Shore Rd, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland.",vk.borooah@ulster.ac.uk,,,,,,,7,0,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The presence of complementarities is important for policies that aim to achieve the optimal allocation of resources, e. g. unemployment insurance. We argue that using wage data alone, it is virtually impossible to identify whether assortative matching is positive or negative. Even though we cannot identify the sign of the sorting, we can identify the strength, i.e. the magnitude of the cross-partial and the associated welfare loss. We first show that the wage for a given worker is non-monotonic in the type of his employer. This is due to the fact that in a sorting model, wages reflect the opportunity cost of mismatch. We analytically show that this non-monotonicity prevents standard firm fixed effects to correlate with the true type of the firm. We then propose an alternative procedure that measures the strength of sorting in the presence of search frictions. Knowing the strength of sorting facilitates the measurement of the output loss due to mismatch.","[Kircher, Philipp] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kircher, Philipp] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Pennsylvania; University of Oxford,,,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008","Eeckhout, Jan/0000-0001-6509-4296","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0752076] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,34,88,109,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A rule should also reduce macroeconomic volatility and be easily understood. Toward such ends, a government may run structural surpluses. In so doing, the government accumulates a precautionary cushion of assets on behalf of agents who do not enjoy access to capital markets. As an additional criterion, that level of assets should be bounded. We provide an example of a structural surplus rule that satisfies all such criteria.

Data on the past damage to a household's residences from the 1999 Tajik Living Standards Survey is used as well as data on the events during the conflict within a conceptual framework that controls for important individual, household and community characteristics. Girls who were of school age during the conflict and lived in affected regions were less likely to complete their mandatory schooling than girls of the same age who lived in the regions relatively unaffected by conflict. The results also indicate that exposure to violent conflict had a large and statistically significant negative effect on the enrollment of girls. No effect of regional and household conflict exposure on education of boys was found. The results are robust to community and household fixed effects, selection into violence and migration.

Maximum likelihood logistic analysis is used to estimate the relationship between the likelihood of incurring out-of-pocket payments and a set of individual- and facility-level covariates, such as income, education level and wealth of the patient. Empirical findings indicate that as the level of education, age and income increase the likelihood of making out-of-payment expenditures on health increases. Additionally, the attitudes of patients towards the health-care system and their possible impacts on the decision of out-of-pocket payments have also been considered. The distrust in the public health-care system is reflected in patients' choices regarding the first applied medical centre. It appears that patients with high levels of income prefer private health-care rather than the public health-care services.","[Yildirim, Julide] Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Erdogan] Minist Hlth, Ankara, Turkey; [Korucu, Nebile] Istanbul Kultur Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Gazi University; Ministry of Health - Turkey; Istanbul Kultur University,"Yildirim, J (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, Ankara, Turkey.",jyildir@hotmail.com,"Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/G-5706-2018; Korucu, Nebile/AAH-9127-2019","Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/0000-0002-4739-6028; KORUCU GUMUSOGLU, NEBILE/0000-0003-3308-4362",,,,,3,4,4,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Because the decision whether to smoke is affected by the cigarette tax level and by various socioeconomic factors, it is appropriate that we treat smoking indicators as endogenous in econometric analyses. To control this endogeneity, I use the levels of state and federal cigarette taxes per package and family attributes as instrumental variables for habitual smoking. According to the estimation results, there is no difference in wages between smokers and nonsmokers of both genders after appropriately controlling for the endogeneity of smoking. This result is different from the results of most previous studies, most of which suffer from several methodological problems. I also found that cigarette taxes have a strong impact on smoking participation for both genders. However, it is also found that cigarette taxes do not make smokers without rationality quit smoking.","Chukyo Univ, Sch Econ, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668666, Japan",Chukyo University,"Yuda, M (通讯作者)，Chukyo Univ, Sch Econ, Showa Ku, 101-2 Yagotohonmachi, Nagoya, Aichi 4668666, Japan.",yudamich@mecl.chukyo-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20330062] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,13,1,2,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

I analyze two interactive firms, one with private information and the other without, who must decide when to undertake an irreversible and uncertain investment decision. Traditional non-strategic models of irreversible investment under uncertainty involve a single decision maker and result in an optimal period of delay before the investment is undertaken. In a strategic setting, firms must balance their desire to delay against competitive advantages from early investment. I find that an equilibrium may not exist within the standard continuous framework when the private information is over revenues. Moreover, when an equilibrium does exist the competitive pressures from the uninformed firm are weak. This is in contrast to existing models with asymmetric information over costs, where an equilibrium always exists and the competitive pressures remain strong (Hsu and Lambrecht, 2007). This work shows that the investment timing decision, and thus the value of the private information, is highly sensitive to the nature of incomplete information. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, the risk decision matrix is transformed into the certain decision matrix based on the expectation value. Then, the deviation entropy weight method is used to determine the attribute weights. And according to the definitions of the distance and the positive/negative ideal solutions for different data types, the relative closeness coefficients can be calculated by TOPSIS. Furthermore, the alternatives are ranked by the relative closeness coefficients. Finally, an application case is given to demonstrate the steps and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Liu, Peide] Shandong Econ Univ, Informat Management Sch, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Han, Zuosheng] Ocean Univ China, Sch Management, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics; Ocean University of China,"Liu, PD (通讯作者)，Shandong Econ Univ, Informat Management Sch, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China.",hanzsh@sdie.edu.cn; peide.liu@gmail.com,"Liu, Pei/JFS-0950-2023; Liu, Peide/D-3392-2013",,,,,,32,64,66,1,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This results in the unionised country's government offering a tax discount (or a subsidy premium) to the outside firm in excess of what is needed to compensate the investor for the higher union wage.

The relationship between distance and housing prices is known to be negative for a densely populated area. I will examine whether this relationship holds for a sparsely populated area, and will test whether this relationship is convex with respect to distance. A macro panel dataset from Iceland will be used. The existence of the expected relationship is among the main findings. Thus, transportation improvements between the CBD and other localities have greater marginal impact on the local real price of houses in closer localities compared to those which are farther away. Rapports marginaux entre prix de l'immobilier et ameliorations dans les transports: emplacement et impact marginal Resume Dans la presente communication, j'examine le rapport entre le prix de l'immobilier et l'amelioration des transports.

Je vais examiner si ce rapport reste vrai pour des zones a faible densite, et effectuer des essais afin d'etablir si ce rapport est convexe en fonction de la distance. Un ensemble de donnees de macro panel provenant d'Islande sera utilise. Une des principales conclusions est l'existence de rapports prevus.

Additional evidence of a sports premium in the regular labor market is arrived at when analyzing the long-run impact of physical fitness on later labor market outcomes. The analysis uses register data on adult earnings and physical fitness when enlisting at age 18.

Consumers post ex ante demands, based on their expectations on aggregate demand. Posted demands are met if ex post supply capacity is sufficient. However, if supply is inadequate all ex ante demands are proportionally interrupted. Consumers' expectations of aggregate demand are assumed to be rational. Under reasonable values for the consumer's degrees of relative risk aversion and prudence, demand is decreasing in supply reliability. We derive operational expressions for the optimal pricing rule and the capacity expansion rule. We show that the optimal price under uncertainty consists of the optimal price under certainty plus a markup that positively depends on the degrees of relative risk aversion, relative prudence and system reliability. We also show that any reliability enhancing investment-though lowering the operating surplus of the public utility-is socially desirable as long as it covers the cost of investment.","[Schroyen, Fred; Oyenuga, Adekola] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Schroyen, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",fred.schroyen@nhh.no; adekola_oyenuga@yahoo.no,,,,,,,39,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The conventional view is that the domestic turmoil is the consequence of foreign retaliation, although there is no clear empirical evidence on classic default penalties. This paper emphasizes, instead, a direct link between sovereign defaults and liquidity crises building on two natural assumptions: (i) government bonds represent a source of liquidity for the domestic private sector and (ii) the government cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors in the event of default. In this context, external debt emerges even in the absence of classic penalties, and government default is countercyclical, triggers a liquidity crunch, and amplifies output volatility. In addition, a reform that involves a substitution of government bonds with privately-sourced liquidity instruments could backfire by restricting governments' access to foreign credit.

In a standard model, I explicitly characterize and examine all the efficiency-inducing paths of taxes/subsidies on the resource. Consistently with the literature, there is a family of such optimal paths. In contrast with Im (2002), it may not be necessary to subsidize the monopoly at any date: within the family of optimal paths of taxes/subsidies, there may exist some paths along which the regulator raises positive revenues at all dates. This illustrates how the static trade-off between inducing efficiency and raising tax revenues in the presence of market power is relaxed under exhaustibility. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The answer depends crucially on the fundamental friction that limits private risk sharing in the first place. If risk sharing is limited because insurance markets are missing for model-exogenous reasons (as in Bewley (1986) [8]) publicly provided risk sharing improves on the allocation of risk. If instead private insurance markets exist but their use is limited by limited enforcement (as in Kehoe and Levine (1993) [23]) then the provision of public insurance interacts with equilibrium private insurance, as, by providing risk sharing, the government affects the value of exclusion from private insurance markets and thus the enforcement mechanism of these contracts. We characterize consumption allocations in an economy with limited enforcement and a continuum of agents facing plausible income risk and tax systems with various degrees of progressivity (public risk sharing). We provide conditions under which more publicly provided insurance actually reduces total insurance for agents (excess crowding-out), or under which more public insurance increases total insurance (partial crowding-out).","[Krueger, Dirk] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Krueger, Dirk; Perri, Fabrizio] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Perri, Fabrizio] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Perri, Fabrizio] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Krueger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dkrueger@econ.upenn.edu; fperri@umn.edu,,,,,,,42,51,60,0,18,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0022-0531,1095-7235,,J ECON THEORY,J.

A long-run elasticity larger than 1 suggests a more than proportional increase of government expenditure with respect to economic activity. In addition, according to the spirit of the law, we found that the correlation is usually higher in countries with lower per-capita GDP, suggesting that the catching-up period is characterized by a stronger development of government activities with respect to economies in a more advanced state of development.","[Zaghini, Andrea] Banca Italia, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Lamartina, Serena] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank,"Zaghini, A (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",zaghini@yahoo.com,"Zaghini, Andrea/HNI-7188-2023",,,,,,25,62,66,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The negative relationship between the stage of economic development and self-employment rate identified in the paper indicates that China has entered the process of fast industrialization, and self-employment is playing a diminishing role in economic growth and employment. We also find a substitution effect between self-employment and private enterprises. While both are important components of China's private sector, private enterprises are becoming an increasingly important source of China's economic growth and employment. Furthermore, our findings also imply that when job opportunities are limited, self-employment in China is likely a forced choice of disadvantaged people who are not qualified for wage jobs.","[Li, Kun; Zhao, Changwen] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Li, K (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",kunlibe@msn.com; cwzhao2000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,7,7,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2011,19.0,3,,,,,49,67,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01242.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,772IJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291227300004,0

TVECM model is applied on daily spot and futures oil prices covering the period 1990-2009. The hypothesis we test is to what extent BRENT crude is indeed an integrated oil market in terms of threshold effects and adjustment costs. Our findings support that market follows a gradual integration path. We find that BRENT crude spot and futures are cointegrated, though two regimes are clearly identified. This implies that a threshold exists and it is indeed significant. Adjustment costs in the error correction are present, and they are valid at the typical regime that is the dominant, and as a result should not be ignored. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Even relatively staunch advocates of competition such as Friedrich Hayek believe that the state must provide law centrally. This article asks whether Hayek's theories about competition and the use of knowledge in society should lead one to support centrally provided law enforcement or competition in law. In writing about economics, Hayek famously described the competitive process of the market as a discovery process. In writing about law, Hayek coincidentally referred to the role of the judge under the common law as discovering the law in the expectations and conventions of people in a given society. We argue that this consistent usage was more than a mere semantic coincidence-that the two concepts of discovery are remarkably similar in Hayek's thought and that his idea of economic discovery influenced his later ideas about legal discovery. Moreover, once this conceptual similarity is recognized, certain conclusions logically follow: namely, that just as economic discovery requires the competitive process of the market to provide information and feedback to correct errors, competition in the provision of legal services is essential to the judicial discovery in law. In fact, the English common law, from which Hayek drew his model of legal discovery, was itself a model of polycentric and competing sources of law throughout much of its history. We conclude that for the same reasons that made Hayek a champion of market competition over central planning of the economy, he should have also supported competition in legal services over monopolistic provision by the state-in short, Hayek should have been an anarchist.

We examine economies where agents herd on others, yet they have limited sets of information on other agents to imitate. In particular, we conduct experiments on economies with agents with different levels of information sharing where agents can imitate: (1) the strategies of others but with an error, (2) the strategies of only a fraction of agents, or (3) the strategies of others, but update their parameters only by a proportion. In each experiment we change the likelihood that agents make errors to copy the strategy of others, the fraction of agents to herd, or the proportion of the parameter that agents update, in order to examine the effect of the different degrees of information sharing on volatility clustering. We show that volatility clustering tends to disappear when agents have limited information on the strategies of others, and agents need to imitate the strategy details of others in order to generate the clustered volatility.","Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Yamamoto, R (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",ryuichi@nccu.edu.tw,"Yamamoto, Ryuichi/ABF-5197-2020",,,,,,38,5,6,1,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

The key price mediating the response is the interest rate. A decline in the rate stimulates all categories of spending. But in a low-inflation economy, the room for a decline in the rate is small, because of the notorious lower limit of zero on the nominal interest rate. In the Great Depression, substantial deflation caused the real interest rate to reach high levels. In the Great Slump that began at the end of 2007, low inflation resulted in an only slightly negative real rate when full employment called for a much lower real rate because of declines in demand. Fortunately, the inflation rate hardly responded to conditions in product and labor markets, else deflation might have occurred, with an even higher real interest rate. I concentrate on three closely related sources of declines in demand: the buildup of excess stocks of housing and consumer durables, the corresponding expansion of consumer debt that financed the buildup, and financial frictions that resulted from the decline in real-estate prices.

We assume that the North and the South are characterized by increasing-returns-to-scale and decreasing-returns-to-scale technologies, respectively. Real national income grows at the same rate in both countries along the balanced growth path owing to a terms of trade effect. However, real income per capita grows at different rates because of population growth differentials.

While the spot price exhibited sharp price volatility, that volatility was only partially transmitted to the back end of the futures curve which was anchored around the $20-22 per barrel range. However, as oil prices rose sharply during the boom years, the consensus on the oil price that would balance the long-term fundamentals of the oil market broke down and the whole futures curve became subject to a series of shifts. Our empirical evidence suggests that in the late 1990s and early 2000s there was limited evidence of adjustment between short-term and long-term oil prices. These dynamics, however, changed in early 2005 with the long-term price making most of the adjustment towards the prompt price. We suggest an interpretation of the long-term behaviour of oil prices based on the insights of two models. The first is based on a signal extraction mechanism and shows that when the private beliefs by investors about the long-run determinants of oil prices become less precise relative to the information contained in the current spot price, then the expected future oil price becomes closer to the current spot price. The second model is based on Bayesian updating and shows that if the variability of the spot price increases and/or if the spot price remains higher over a sustained period of time than anticipated by investors, then the probability distribution of the parameter capturing the speed of mean reversion will shift and the expected future price will move closer to the current spot price. Our analysis predicts that in the face of increased uncertainty the long-term and short-term prices are bound to exhibit similar movements. These changes have important consequences on the oil price formation process.","[Fattouh, Bassam] Univ London, Oxford Inst Energy Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Fattouh, Bassam; Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ London, Dept Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Ist, I-00173 Rome, Italy",University of London; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Fattouh, B (通讯作者)，Univ London, Oxford Inst Energy Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England.",bassam.fattouh@oxfordenergy.org; ps6@soas.ac.uk,,"Scaramozzino, Pasquale/0000-0003-4917-6560",,,,,14,15,15,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Energy conservation in household water heating is increasingly important for reducing an amount of CO2 emission, because the share of water heating in household energy consumption is approximately 30%. Recently, Japanese households have widely used ecologically efficient electric heat pump water heaters (Eco Cute) or gas-fired water heaters (Eco Jozu). The total number of such efficient water heaters sold in Japan was more than 2.5 million at the end of 2008. This study investigates various factors and impacts of marketing strategy for promoting the appliances in Japan. We apply mixed and nested logit models to a disaggregated choice data on water heaters from 2004 to 2008. This study considers retail energy prices, a government financial support and marketing activities as important factors for appliance selection. In addition, we consider consumers' housing attributes such as floor space and age of building. This empirical study finds two business implications. One of the two implications is that an increase in an energy price may enhance a choice probability of Eco Cute and Eco Jozu because a price increase invites consumer's consciousness on energy conservation so that a cost reduction on energy consumption becomes essential in a use of the efficient appliances. The other implication is that marketing activities, especially by recommendations from sales representatives and/or housing suppliers, are important for consumer behaviors. The other important findings are discussed in this study. This business experience in Japan is useful to the other countries where ecologically efficient water heaters are not popular at the current moment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we focus our attention on issue voting, that is, on the likelihood that different policies offered by politicians affect the probability of voting. If voters consider both the benefits and the costs of voting, rational voters will only vote when politicians offer differentiated policies. In a multidimensional policy space this implies that citizens only vote when they perceive enough difference on the issues they care about the most. We investigate the role of voter abstention due to indifference in a unidimensional and a multidimensional policy setting using data from the US National Election Studies for 1972-2000 and find support for our predictions: voters perceiving a small difference between the platforms of the Democratic and Republican parties are less likely to vote; and voters who perceive the two parties as more different on a larger number of issues are significantly more likely to vote.","[Hortala-Vallve, Rafael] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Esteve-Volart, Berta] York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; York University - Canada,"Hortala-Vallve, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.hortala-vallve@lse.ac.uk; berta@econ.yorku.ca,,,,,,,23,5,7,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

In practice, however, the system is slow and costly to administer. It both fails to compensate patients who have suffered from bad medical care and compensates those who haven't. According to opinion surveys of physicians, the system creates incentives to undertake cost-ineffective treatments based on fear of legal liability-to practice defensive medicine. The failures of the liability system and the high cost of health care in the United States have led to an important debate over tort policy. How well does malpractice law achieve its intended goals? How large of a problem is defensive medicine and can reforms to malpractice law reduce its impact on healthcare spending? The flaws of the existing system have led a number of states to change their laws in a way that would reduce malpractice liability-to adopt tort reforms. Evidence from several studies suggests that wisely chosen reforms have the potential to reduce healthcare spending significantly with no adverse impact on patient health outcomes.","[Kessler, Daniel P.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kessler, Daniel P.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kessler, Daniel P.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kessler, Daniel P.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kessler, DP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",fkessler@stanford.edu,,,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG025282] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,89,80,92,1,16,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In most participation contexts, the at-risk group is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to identify. For pools centered on technologies that result from a standard-setting process, in contrast, we are able to identify a relatively unambiguous population of patents eligible for inclusion but that have not been included in the pool. We find that vertically integrated firms, with patents and downstream operations, are more likely to join a patent pool and among those firms that do join, those with relatively symmetric patent contributions (in terms of value) to a standard appear more likely to accept numeric patent share rules for dividing royalty earnings.

Using a non-competitive input-output table, we establish a comparative-static general equilibrium model to simulate the impact of real exchange rate changes on Sino-US trade and labor markets. The simulation shows that the impacts of a 10-percent RMB revaluation on the trade surplus of China and the labor market of the USA are more modest than is generally perceived, and the negative impact on the output of the non-processing industry in China is more significant than that on the processing industry. The Sino-US trade imbalance will continue to deteriorate, China's non-processing trade surplus will decline and the processing trade will increase, with the combined effect being small. For the USA, labor-intensive goods imported from China will shift to different Asian countries instead of transferring back to the US market.

Sceptics often point to the late nineteenth century as a period when protectionist policies promoted economic development. This apparent blueprint for the benefits of protectionism paradoxically comes from a period that is often described as the first era of globalization. In this paper we reassess the empirical evidence about the relationship between tariffs and growth between 1870 and 1914. Our key findings challenge the idea that in the nineteenth century countries that raised tariffs thereby increased their own growth rate. Using new and improved data and employing a whole portfolio of econometric tests we do not find evidence that increased protectionism raised the rate of individual countries' growth. While some positive cross-sectional correlation exists between tariffs and growth, this may reflect unobserved country traits rather than a causal relation. There is equally little evidence that other external factors, such as real exchange rates and terms of trade changes, were key drivers of economic performance. A paradox of this first era of globalization is not that free trade was bad for growth; it is that international economic policies seem to have mattered little to countries' growth trajectories.","[Schularick, Moritz] Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, D-1000 Berlin, Germany; [Solomou, Solomos] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",Free University of Berlin; University of Cambridge,"Schularick, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, D-1000 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,67,29,33,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

The results suggest that, if governments adjust statutory corporate tax rates to balance their budget, profit shifting and discrete location render CBIT more attractive for most individual European countries. European coordination makes a joint ACE more, and a joint CBIT less efficient. A combination of ACE and CBIT is always welfare improving.","[de Mooij, Ruud A.] Erasmus Univ, The Hague, Netherlands; [de Mooij, Ruud A.] CPB, The Hague, Netherlands; [Devereux, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Oxford,"de Mooij, RA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, The Hague, Netherlands.",radm@cpb.nl,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F037864/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,41,43,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Skeptics of globalization, among them Marxists, critical theorists, and a large portion of the NGO community, see globalization facilitating the exploitation of the weak by the strong, exclusion of the poor from economic gain and political rights, increased inequality and economic insecurity, all of which results in social disarray-in other words, globalization is a 'race to the bottom.' Thus, resistance to globalization by ordinary people, they argue, will be met with greater state repression. Previous studies have examined the issue with single indicators, such as trade openness and the level of FDI. We make use of a unique measure of globalization, which gauges globalization along economic, political, and social dimensions, to assess the propositions. Our findings reveal a strong positive association between overall globalization and its disaggregated components on government respect for physical integrity rights between 1981 and 2005 for a large sample of countries, controlling for a host of relevant factors, including the possibility of endogeneity. The results are robust to sample size, alternative data and methods, and when assessing developing countries only. Contrary to the skeptics, our results show that increased exposure to globalization lowers state violations of basic human rights.","[Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany; [de Soysa, Indra] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [de Soysa, Indra] Oslo PRIO, Ctr Study Civil War, Peace Res Inst, Oslo, Norway",University of Gottingen; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO),"Vadlamannati, KC (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany.",kvadlam@uni-goettingen.de,", Indra/D-6635-2015",", Indra/0000-0003-2751-4223; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya/0000-0001-5999-1126",,,,,97,42,45,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2011,64.0,1,,,,,20,53,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00493.x,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,705ES,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000286112300002,0

Such formula is popularly called Black-Scholes-Merton owing to an attributed eponymous discovery (though changing the standard deviation parameter is in contradiction with it). However, we have historical evidence that: (1) the said Black, Scholes and Merton did not invent any formula, just found an argument to make a well known (and used) formula compatible with the economics establishment, by removing the risk parameter through dynamic hedging, (2) option traders use (and evidently have used since 1902) sophisticated heuristics and tricks more compatible with the previous versions of the formula of Louis Bachelier and Edward O. Thorp (that allow a broad choice of probability distributions) and removed the risk parameter using put-call parity, (3) option traders did not use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula or similar formulas after 1973 but continued their bottom-up heuristics more robust to the high impact rare event.

We extend on Lee's research (2008, 2010) by including both the opportunity cost of time and characterizing the Stackelberg equilibrium. Thus, our aim is two-fold to contribute to the literature. First, we analyze tax competition in more general cross-border structure shopping which incorporates time opportunity costs in addition to transportation costs. Second, we examine the Stackelberg equilibrium in a tax-setting game and compare it with the Nash equilibrium. The leader country collects more tax revenue if it adopts the Stackelberg tax-setting model than the Nash tax scheme because the cross-border shopping incorporates the time cost factor. In summary, based on the assumption of a more general cross-border shopping structure, the derived Stackelberg equilibrium in tax rates will shed some light on the optimal tax policy design for tax competition and tax harmonization in the EU.","Andong Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Andong, South Korea",Andong National University,"Lee, SK (通讯作者)，Andong Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Andong, South Korea.",skl62@paran.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,12,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Modeling simultaneously our estimate of the ex-ante equity premium as a dependent variable and our measure of financial architecture as an instrumental variable, we document that equity premia are larger in countries that have a more bank-oriented financial architecture, as well as greater control of corruption, more foreign access to capital, and higher spending on education. Smaller equity premia are associated with greater political stability, greater measures against self-dealing, higher market volatility and greater uncertainty avoidance. Given the importance of the ex-ante equity premium in long-term investment decisions, the anticipated demographic challenges and financial reform in most countries and recent increases in cross-border investment, there is much interest among bankers, managers and policy-makers in these results, documenting the determinants of cross-national variations in equity premia.","[Aggarwal, Raj; Goodell, John W.] Univ Akron, Coll Business Adm, Akron, OH 44325 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Goodell, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Akron, Coll Business Adm, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",johngoo@uakron.edu,,"Aggarwal, Raj/0000-0002-0571-5844",,,,,52,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Since religion is an important part of the daily lives of many people throughout the world, the management of religious diversity and how to best accommodate the observance of religious behaviours of employees in the workplace is now an important aspect to take into consideration in the management of a business. Communication and negotiation are two key elements in establishing an organisational culture that respects the rights all employees and strikes a practical and effective balance between organisational and employee needs. Frank and open communication is of the utmost importance. It is recommended that employees must communicate with their managers regarding their needs but managers must also be prepared to communicate with employees about strategies to accommodate their right to practise religious behaviours in the workplace while also maintaining the integrity of workplace operations. Communicating with colleagues in an informal way is also important to build awareness and understanding regarding religious observances in the workplace. Successfully balancing religious tolerance with the accommodation of religious beliefs and practices in the workplace has its complexities. Therefore, it is vital for employers and employees to know and understand the laws that govern such matters in the workplace and how the laws can be applied to particular situations. Total accommodation of all interests is rarely possible in conflict resolution procedures. Thus, it is crucial that the parties in conflict be open to compromise. Further studies are needed to test such models and to clarify the main causes of conflict that may be due to the religious diversity in workplaces.","[Alnamlah, Yousef] Macquarie Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE, 00000, SINGAPORE",2010-4626,,978-981-08-9083-4,INT P ECON DEV RES,,,2011,10.0,,,,,,469,473,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BZY02,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000303284800088,0

In contrast to the view of Minsky that regards the capitalist system as inherently unstable, this article presents the endogenous monetary business cycle theory as a theoretical and conceptual framework that allows to differentiate between periods of sustainable economic growth (sustained by a prior increase in real savings) and periods of unsustainable growth (stimulated by the process of credit expansion in an environment of loose monetary policy) that result in economic bubbles and business cycles.

An overwhelming share of industry-level aggregate total factor productivity growth is accounted for by a small number of plants, which were larger and more productive before the implementation of NAFTA and expanded and became more productive following the implementation of NAFTA. Plants that exported before NAFTA and exported continuously through to 2000, and new exporters, are more likely to be among the top-performing plants. The performance of plants with similar exporting experience displays, however, remarkable heterogeneity: a significant number of plants that never export have strong output and productivity performance, while many exporters display poor performance. Spending on research and development, and three variables describing plants' level of integration in the global markets - foreign direct investment, use of imported intermediary inputs, and investment in foreign capital goods are positively correlated with output and productivity performance.","[Voicu, Alexandru] CUNY, Coll Staten Isl, PEP Dept, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA; [Voicu, Alexandru] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Calderon-Madrid, Angel] El Colegio Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Colegio de Mexico,"Voicu, A (通讯作者)，CUNY, Coll Staten Isl, PEP Dept, 2800 Victory Blvd, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA.",alexandru.voicu@mail.csi.cuny.edu,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

(TFP). These cycles are characterized by a boom in which consumption, investment, output and hours-worked all rise in advance of any movement in TFP. We model knowledge capital as an input into production which is endogenously produced through a learning-by-doing process. When firms receive news of an impending productivity increase, the value of knowledge capital rises, inducing the firm to hire more hours to invest in knowledge capital. The rise in the value of knowledge capital immediately raises the value of the firm, causing an appreciation in share prices, a feature that has empirical support. The increase in output of the firm allows both consumption and investment to rise despite the absence of any contemporaneous productivity shock. If the expected increase in productivity fails to materialize, the model generates a recession as well as a crash in the stock market. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, the study takes a distinct empirical route, combining a cointegration technique and regression analysis. In the first step, we obtain three definitions for the dependent variable that represent the degree of the interaction between domestic saving and investment (S-I), employing a cointegration analysis for 86 countries in the sample. In the second step, each definition of the dependent variable is regressed on potential explanations for the co-movement of the S-I such as openness, country size, productivity shocks, and real interest rate differentials. After examining a number of potential variables for their explanatory power on this puzzle, however, none of the posited variables are found to be statistically significant determinants of the S-I interaction. The results indicate that the size of the economy, productivity shocks or interest rate differentials have almost no role in explaining the S-I behavior. Further, the findings show that openness has no influence on the S-I interaction, suggesting that it is not plausible to view the S-I correlation as an indicator of international capital mobility as F-H did.","[Gur, Timur Han; Erden, Lutfi; Ozkan, Ibrahim] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Gür, TH (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",timurgur@hacettepe.edu.tr; lerden@hacettepe.edu.tr; iozkan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Gur, Timur Han/AAD-2627-2019; Ozkan, Ibrahim/I-8714-2013","Ozkan, Ibrahim/0000-0002-1092-8123; Erden, Lutfi/0000-0002-9365-6599",,,,,26,3,3,0,10,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,3,,,,,343,353,,10.2298/PAN1103343G,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,834YP,,gold,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296000700004,0

The second goal is to compare the time and income group impact of different social policy programmes on income inequality, in order to derive policy recommendations. To this end, using statistical data from the Household Budget Survey 2006-09 which cover more than 4500 households per year, we have conducted the first research of this kind in Serbia. Various statistical and econometric means were used: Gini coefficients for income inequality, the Coady-Grosh-Hoddinott (CGH) index for targeting performance, the Newey-West (HAC) procedure and recursive regression, Error Component Two Stages Least Squares Method (EC-2SLS) for panel estimation. The confirmed hypotheses are that, in general, income inequality is decreasing as a consequence of certain social policy measures, except in the last observed year, due to the economic crisis, but that these effects are different in different income groups. In the conclusion certain policy recommendations are drawn concerning specific vulnerable groups and the need for redistribution of resources towards better targeted programmes.","[Ivancev, Olgica] Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Jovicic, Milena] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade,"Ivancev, O (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",olgicai@ef.uns.ac.rs,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,3,,,,,327,342,,10.1080/14631377.2011.595126,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HJ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624500003,0

We give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a player's expected utility under an arbitrary mixed-strategy profile, and show how to use this algorithm to achieve exponential speedups of existing methods for computing sample Nash equilibria.

We study the strategic interaction between hits and niches in their pricing, entry, and innovation decisions using a model of competition under product differentiation and generalized cost structure. In contrast to the popular view, we show that improvements in information and communication technology can lead to either the long tail effect or an opposite superstar effect (Rosen, 1981), depending on (a) how the structure (not simply the level) of producer costs changes, and (b) how disparate are consumer preferences. These two factors also determine whether there is excessive or insufficient product diversity. Post-entry product and technology innovation incentives may be inefficient in the long tail market structure because producers can soften price competition by engaging in excessive product differentiation and adopting technologies with high variable costs. These results have implications for various competition-related policies.","[Tsui, Kevin] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,"Tsui, K (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",tkendall@compasslexecon.com; ktsui@clemson.edu,,,,,,,12,10,10,6,43,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Mirroring per se is the spectator's simulation of the emotion/action of the principal. While the understanding process usually involves the attenuation of original emotions, the mimicking process often leads to escalation and mob psychology. What is paradoxical is how the same primitive, mirroring, gives rise to divergent processes. To solve the paradox, this paper distinguishes between two kinds of evaluations: rationality and niyya. The rationality axis evaluates whether the action is proper (rational) or improper (irrational), while the niyya (an Arabic word for faith or trustworthiness) axis evaluates whether the motive is virtuous (wellbeing-supporting) or malicious (wellbeing-threatening). The interplay of the two-axes promises also to explain the differences among four kinds of fellow-feeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Korea,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EARNINGS; BRAZIL,"This article examines the effect of family background on the returns to schooling in Korea. In doing so, sample selection bias is controlled, as the probability of being employed is affected by the schooling of family members. The results of this study are different from previous studies, which did not consider sample selection bias. While the effect of family background on the returns to schooling was obvious in previous studies, it is weakened with the control of sample selection bias. This phenomenon is particularly strong for the wife. Moreover, controlling sample selection bias increases the downward bias due to measurement error. Thus it is concluded from these findings that sample selection bias should be controlled to accurately estimate the effect of family background on the returns to schooling.","[Kim, Hong-Kyun] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Kim, HK (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, CPO Box 1142, Seoul, South Korea.",hongkyun@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We focus mainly on the effects of price and habits, but also account for other factors in the demand for water such as climate, income and productive activity. Allowing for trend break stationarity or nonlinear trend stationarity, we find evidence against the unit root hypothesis for many time series. Based on this result, standard cointegration analysis would not be appropriate; therefore we adopt an alternative estimation and testing procedure. We focus, in particular, on the so-called bounds testing approach, which can be applied irrespective of the level of integration of the variables and which can be a useful modelling strategy given that dynamics are important when estimating a water demand equation. The main results are that long-run price elasticity is higher than short-run elasticity, and that consumption habits are relevant. We also find that both climate, sectoral and technological modifications affect water consumption, while income is not significant. Finally, the changes to pricing schemes in the mid-1970s provoked reactions of different magnitudes among households and firms.","[Musolesi, Antonio] INRA, CESAER, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Nosvelli, Mario] CNR CERIS, Milan, Italy",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon,"Musolesi, A (通讯作者)，INRA, CESAER, 26 Bd Dr Petitjean, F-21079 Dijon, France.",a.musolesi@ccris.cnr.it,"Hill, Colin/A-5611-2012",,,,,,46,7,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using data for more than 50 000 individuals in 10 European countries, 1992-2002, we find that the social costs of unemployment, in terms of general unemployment's impact on life satisfaction, relate significantly and to a considerable extent to unemployment duration. It is thus not just the risk of becoming or staying unemployed that people worry about, but especially the prospect of staying long-term unemployed. This fear affects employed and unemployed people alike. Our findings provide a strong point for focusing labour market policies on long-term unemployment, in addition to considerations of human capital depreciation.","[Ochsen, Carsten] Univ Appl Labour Studies, D-19055 Schwerin, Germany; [Welsch, Heinz] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Ochsen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Labour Studies, D-19055 Schwerin, Germany.",carsten.ochsen@arbeitsagentur.de,,"Ochsen, Carsten/0000-0002-4178-4249",,,,,11,16,19,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This increase to the minimum wage was the first in nearly a decade and was approved with the objective of alleviating poverty among low-income households. However, a higher minimum wage may result in more unemployment and poverty. We exploit time-series variation in minimum wages set by Canadian provinces between 1981 and 2004. OLS and IV results suggest that a 10% increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3%-5% drop in teen employment. Further, a 10% rise in the minimum wage is also significantly associated with a 4%-6% increase in the percentage of families living under Low Income Cut Offs (LICOs). Difference-in-difference estimates from the 1993, 1995, and 1998 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) support these findings as they suggest that income earned by teens constitutes a non-trivial portion of household income for families beneath Low Income Cut Offs. Therefore, a higher minimum wage may paradoxically result in a significant negative shock to household income among low-income families. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A leading type of AMP compares the offer price from each generation unit with a recent historical average of accepted offer prices from that same unit during periods when there was no transmission-system congestion to impede competition. If one or more units' offer prices exceed the recent historical average by more than a specified margin, and if these offer prices raise the market-clearing price by more than a specified margin, the market operator replaces the offending offer prices with lower ones. In an experiment, we test an AMP of this type. We find that it keeps market prices close to marginal cost if generation owners have low market power in uncongested periods. However, with high market power in uncongested periods, a condition that may apply in many parts of the world, the generation owners are able to gradually raise the market price well above short-run marginal cost in spite of the AMP. We also test the effect of the AMP on the frequency with which high-variable-cost units are used, inefficiently, in place of low-variable-cost units. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Variables originating in financial markets were selected EMBI spreads, Central Bank interest rate as well as macroeconomic fundamentals inflation, CROI index - in order to identify factors by which volatility pattern can be depicted. The key result of the research points toward a deep correlation of the exchange rate volatility between the CEE countries and the Euro Zone, implying the necessity to develop strong financial management strategies at the macroeconomic level, capable of annihilating the transmission belt crisis mechanisms.","[Brezeanu, Petre; Huidumac, Catalin] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Triandafil, Adrian Morar] Romanian Banking Inst, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,cristina_triandafil@yahoo.com; brezeanupetre@yahoo.com; catalinhuidumac@yahoo.com; consultantbancar@yahoo.com,"Triandafil, Cristina Maria/C-6765-2012; Huidumac, Catalin/AAP-4412-2021; PETRE, BREZEANU/F-9468-2012",,,,,,34,2,2,2,14,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Additionally, it makes use of time-series-based projections of labour productivity growth up to 2009 in order to detect breaks depending on confidence intervals of the projections. The identification of structural breaks in the US labour productivity growth is far from obvious. A statistically significant break is found in the late 1990s only if at least the 97.5th percentile of forecasts materializes in the future, which means that despite a clear pick up in productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s, the size of the hump is not large enough compared with past variations to make this change a statistically significant break. However, a significant break point is detected in the mid-1990s for the difference in labour productivity growth between the US and the EU15, even when controlling for the convergence of Europe towards the US productivity levels that has contributed to higher European performance in the early catch up phase. Finally, within Europe, the accumulation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capital seems to be related to differences in the shifts in structural labour productivity growth across countries.","[Turner, Laure] Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Turner, Laure; Boulhol, Herve] Econ Cooperat Org, Dept Econ Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, F-75775 Paris 16, France",,"Turner, L (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Stat & Etud Econ, 15 Blvd Gabriel Peri, F-92245 Malakoff, France.",laure.turner@insee.fr,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Increase of the share of sectoral investment in R&D that is deductible from the corporate income tax and increase of government spending on R&D turned out to be the most effective suggested policy measures. While the former policy measure is still followed in part by an undesired transfer of the tax relief to dividends, a moderate increase of government spending on R&D boosts long-run productivity in the economy, thus increasing the future value of firms, which is reflected in a desired dividend increase. The households that would gain more utility from such policy scenarios are those with more skilled and highly skilled labour, but not the very top earners in the economy.","[Verbic, Miroslav; Cok, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav; Majcen, Boris] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Ivanova, Olga] TNO Bouw & Ondergrond, Delft, Netherlands",University of Ljubljana; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@guest.ames.si; majcenb@ier.si; Olga.Ivanova@tno.nl; mitja.cok@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,51,15,16,0,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,1,,,,,67,89,,10.2298/PAN1101067V,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,750HG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289536600005,0

First, the demand and supply of pregnancies should be studied within the theoretical framework of a market with economic incentives. Second, a theoretical model for the demand for abortion must incorporate the total market for children, which implies the market for pregnancy, abortion, and adoption. Third, there exist in the overall market for procreative goods and services certain unique characteristics that need to be carefully considered. Producers and suppliers within the procreative goods and services market have radically different price and cost elasticity functions and unique production asymmetries that create a potential net benefit for buyer and seller alike. The market for abortion and adoption, while seemingly related and similar, suffer from a fundamental disconnect, preventing a simple exchange of goods and services: abortion implies potential supply that does not flow to potential consumersthose seeking to adopt. Studying this market inefficiency will benefit from a two-sided market analysis used in situations where an intermediary business must attract both producers and suppliers. There are two key findings. First, I find that the producer decision to supply the good depends primarily on exogenous preference formation and not on consumer-provided incentives. Second, I find that the market would benefit from legal framework for a market clearing institution using the market for real estate as the blueprint.","Peking Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, HSBC Sch Business, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University; HSBC Holdings,"Balding, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, HSBC Sch Business, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",cbald-ing@szpku.edu.cn,,,,,,,25,4,5,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Because domestic (overseas) R&D activities may enter the overseas (domestic) R&D determination equation as an endogenous right-hand side variable, the traditional estimation approach will be invalid due to the endogeneity problem. Therefore, it is proposed that the two R&D decisions be estimated using a simultaneous Tobit model. The results in this paper indicate that Taiwanese MNEs that engage in higher levels of domestic R&D activities will engage in overseas R&D activities. Interestingly, it is also found that Taiwanese MNEs increase their overseas R&D activities in developed countries instead of their domestic R&D activities, whereas Taiwanese MNEs that engage in overseas R&D activities in less-developed countries will raise their domestic R&D activities. As for the other common determinants of the overseas and domestic R&D activities, firm size and the capital-labor ratio are found to be the main factors.","[Chuang, Wen-Bin] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli 545, Nantou, Taiwan; [Lin, Hui-lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University; National Taiwan University,"Chuang, WB (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Puli 545, Nantou, Taiwan.",chuangwb@ncnu.edu.tw; huilin@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,60,6,6,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Evidence from the airline industry,RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AIR-TRAFFIC DELAYS; COSTS; ADAPTATION; BOUNDARIES; OWNERSHIP; FORM,"We investigate the effects of vertical integration on operational performance. Large U.S. airlines use regional partners to operate some of their flights. Regionals may be owned or governed through contracts. We estimate whether an airline's use of an owned, rather than independent, regional at an airport affects delays and cancellations on the airline's own flights out of that airport. We find that integrated airlines perform systematically better than nonintegrated airlines at the same airport on the same day. Furthermore, the performance advantage increases on days with adverse weather and when airports are more congested. These findings suggest that, in this setting, vertical integration may facilitate real-time adaptation decisions.","[Forbes, Silke J.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Lederman, Mara] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Toronto,"Forbes, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",sjanuszewski@ucsd.edu; mara.lederman@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,39,79,102,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Due to the complementarity between ability and technology, under technology adoption the productivity of a more able worker increases more strongly than the productivity of a less able colleague. As a consequence, both workers' motivation to exert effort is reduced. We show that this adverse incentive effect is dominant and, consequently, keeps the firm from introducing a better production technology if talent uncertainty is sufficiently high and/or monitoring of workers is sufficiently precise.

The study uses innovation accounting tools (impulse response and variance decomposition) within the framework of an unrestricted VAR to examine the degree of pass-through as well as the relative importance of a number of variables in explaining changes in domestic prices. The key findings suggest that after 1 per cent shock to nominal effective exchange rate, the level of CPI increases by 0.125 per cent, giving a pass-through elasticity of 13 per cent. However, the pass-through elasticity of producer price is 20 per cent after 24 months suggesting that favourable shocks to producer price inflation can have considerable moderating effect on CPI inflation.","Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Econ, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Ocran, MK (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Econ, S Summer Strand Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",matthew.ocran@nmmu.ac.za,,"Ocran, Matthew/0000-0001-8095-4995",,,,,20,8,8,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our results provide little evidence for asymmetric behaviour. However, the degree to which prices overreact to tax changes and the significance of market power across the different regions suggests that the market for petrol/diesel is not very competitive.

These two strategic settings allow us to identify and distinguish the role of predatory and preemptive incentives as determinants of cooperation and conflict. In our model, weapons unambiguously facilitate peace under complete information. In contrast, under strategic risk, we show that increases in weapon stocks can have a nonmonotonic effect on the sustainability of cooperation. We also show that under strategic risk, asymmetry in military strength can facilitate peace, and that anticipated peacekeeping interventions may improve incentives for peaceful behavior.","[Chassang, Sylvain] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; London Sch Econ, Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev, Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Princeton University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chassang, S (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,ESRC [ES/F041764/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F041764/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,50,59,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

J,"Galenson, DW",,,,"Galenson, David W.",,,UNDERSTANDING CREATIVITY,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,creativity; experimental innovators; conceptual innovators,,"The discipline of economics has traditionally refused to study the behavior and achievements of specific individuals. Yet creativity - a primary source of the technological change that drives economic growth - is largely the domain of extraordinary individuals or small groups. For the first time in the history of the discipline, within the last decade economists have begun to study how these extraordinary individuals make their discoveries, and the results have been dramatic. Research done to date has demonstrated that artistic innovators can usefully be divided into two types. Experimental innovators seek to record their perceptions. They proceed tentatively, by trial and error, building their skills gradually, and making their greatest contributions late in their lives. In contrast, conceptual innovators use their art to express ideas and emotions. The precision of their goals allows them to plan their work, and execute it decisively. Their most radical new ideas, and consequently their greatest innovations, occur early in their careers. The research that has established these patterns has several central components. A key element is the systematic measurement of an artist's creativity over the course of the life cycle: this not only establishes when the artist made his greatest contribution, but also provides an objective identification of his greatest innovation. This facilitates another key element of the research, the categorization of the artist as experimental or conceptual. This effectively depends on whether the artist works inductively, building his contribution incrementally from observation, or deductively, creating his innovation as a consequence of a new idea. These patterns have been established empirically, by a large number of studies of important practitioners of a wide range of arts. It is now time to extend economic research on creativity, by applying this analysis to other intellectual domains. It is important to recognize that economists' failure to study individuals has prevented them from understanding the sources of the contributions of the most productive people in our society. Breaking this disciplinary taboo may now allow us not only to understand, but perhaps also to increase, the creativity of these remarkable individuals, and to help others to follow them.","Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Galenson, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Natl Bur Econ Res, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",galenson@uchicago.edu,"Dörfler, Viktor/A-3717-2009","Dörfler, Viktor/0000-0001-8314-4162",,,,,36,6,7,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

By exploiting geographic variation in terror attacks in Israel from 1988 to 2006, we show that local terror attacks cause Israelis to be more willing to grant territorial concessions to the Palestinians. These effects are stronger for demographic groups that are traditionally right-wing in their political views. However, terror attacks beyond a certain threshold cause Israelis to adopt a less accommodating position. In addition, terror induces Israelis to vote increasingly for right-wing parties, as the right-wing parties move to the left in response to terror. Hence, terrorism appears to be an effective strategy in terms of shifting the entire political landscape to the left, although we do not assess whether it is more effective than non-violent means.","[Gould, Eric D.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Econ Policy Res, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Gould, ED (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Econ Policy Res, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",,"Gould, Eric/R-8785-2019","Klor, Esteban/0000-0002-6756-0825; Gould, Eric/0000-0001-6564-2168",,,,,53,125,140,0,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

It is, therefore, a common objective among global companies to optimize their entire supply system using prompt and accurate methods. Global companies are also trying to secure dominant competitive positions in the global supply chain by employing new processes, building partnerships and securing out sourcing. In this study, we investigate the interrelationships among key parameters in the global supply chain and their effects on business performance, process innovation, and business partnership. We conducted an empirical study to determine the significant variables of business performance, process innovation, and business partnership in various industries. Our research findings show that I) accuracy in forecasting and the ability to adjust to a changing business environment are determinant factors for improving process innovation, 2) customer service, partner reliability, outsourcing, and standardization are required for building successful business partnerships, 3) business partnership has a moderate effect on business performance in some industries, and 4) inter-correlations exist among business performance, process innovation, and business partnership.

First, if separated capital markets in the North and the South are integrated, enforcement of IPR would have more desirable welfare effects in both regions. Second, when international capital movement is allowed, the North always gains from the tightening of IPR if the imitation rate is sufficiently high. This implies that the North's demand on the South to tighten IPR becomes stronger as the integration of international capital markets progresses.","Shiga Univ, Shiga 5228522, Japan",Shiga University,"Okawa, Y (通讯作者)，Shiga Univ, 1-1-1 Banba Hikone, Shiga 5228522, Japan.",Okawa@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Dollar pricing implies that the international effects of US monetary shocks are different from those of European shocks because of an asymmetric exchange rate pass-through to import prices. A dollar pricing model can explain the observed asymmetry in the transmission of monetary policy: US monetary policy affects US output more than European monetary policy affects European output. I also show that the current account is an important channel through which monetary policy affects welfare.

We identify backward-stealing and forward-manipulation problems that arise when governments bargain under the MFN principle in a sequential fashion. We show that these problems impede governments from achieving the multilateral efficiency frontier unless further rules of negotiation are imposed. We identify the WTO nullification-or-impairment and renegotiation provisions and its reciprocity norm as rules that are capable of providing solutions to these problems. In this way, we suggest that WTO rules can facilitate the negotiation of efficient multilateral trade agreements in a world in which the addition of new and economically significant countries to the world trading system is an ongoing process.

We are primarily interested in Europe's monetary union. Given that unification entails the loss of a policy instrument, its potential benefits have to be found elsewhere. Unification may serve as a vehicle for beneficial institutional changes. In particular, it may be a route toward an independent monetary policy, which alleviates the scope for political pressure to relax monetary policy. Unification also eliminates harmful monetary policy spillovers and competitive devaluations. We explore how disagreement between the monetary and fiscal authorities about their policy objectives can lead to extreme macroeconomic outcomes. Further, we pay considerable attention to the desirability ( or not) of fiscal constraints and fiscal coordination in a monetary union. Monetary commitment and fiscal free riding play a key role in this regard. Similar free-riding issues also feature prominently in the analysis of how unification influences structural reforms. We end with a brief discussion of monetary unification outside Europe. The cost-benefit trade-off of unification may differ substantially between industrialized and less-developed countries, where differences in fiscal needs and, hence, the reliance on seigniorage revenues may dominate the scope for unification.","[Beetsma, Roel] Univ Amsterdam, CEPR, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, CEPR, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,81,76,81,1,38,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Costain and Reiter have found the existence of a trade-off in the model's performance: any attempt to change the calibrated values to improve the model's ability to predict the business cycle jeopardizes its predictions of the impact of unemployment benefits on unemployment. In surveying the literature originating in these findings, I distinguish three different avenues that have been followed to correct the model: change in wage formation, change in the calibration and changes in the model specification.

Since stealing others' possessions is permitted under anarchy, the winner is able to enjoy the lion's share of total outputs produced by all parties, and this generates a diversification effect, since the random outputs are polled together. Taking this effect into account, we characterize the subgame-perfect equilibrium for our two-stage game. Specifically, the emergence of property rights is shown to depend on players' incentives to fight, variances, and market correlations. The model predicts that property rights are more likely to emerge when market correlations increase.

Aspects regarding structural breaks and regime switches are discussed as well. To do that, the methods proposed by Hassler and Meller (2009) and Tsay and Hardie (2009) are used. The major results indicate that unemployment rates have two different levels of persistence. The first one is nonstationary whereas the second one is nonstationary but mean-reverting. Based on these findings, the convergence hypothesis of regional unemployment rates was tested. Following the fractional stochastic convergence criterion put forward by Mello and Guimaraes-Filho (2007), it was concluded that regional unemployment rates are convergent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Fulfilling such guarantees would require printing trillions upon trillions of dollars and causing hyperinflation. The potential for such runs is very large, indeed, thanks to Uncle Sam's perilous fiscal finances. Achieving fiscal balance and financial security will require fundamental reform of America's retirement, tax, Social Security, and financial systems.

It demonstrates that there is a sound theoretical basis and empirical support for the conclusion that U.

S. manufacturing belt is examined with reference to union density, bargaining power, and the effects that large-scale production plants have on these factors. The meat packing industry in the postwar United States serves as a case study to establish the specific ways that class conflict has shaped the scale profile and geographic distribution of production plants.

We have two findings: first, we find evidence for high persistency in real exchange rate in terms of the Japanese yen for five countries and for four countries in terms of the US dollar the for the full and pre-crisis sample periods. Second, for the post-crisis period, the presence of low persistency in real exchange rate supports PPP for three countries in terms of the Japanese yen and five countries in terms of the US dollar.

In the calibrated model, the general equilibrium impacts of the PLX are different from the standard partial equilibrium ones, mainly because employers post more high-skill vacancies when both search channels operate.","[Plesca, Miana] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Plesca, Miana] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of Guelph,"Plesca, M (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

The focus is on conceptualization of control issues, and changes in such conceptualizations over time. Among individuals who are in a position to affect the overall direction of corporations, there are broadly shared views of the overall orientation that should be adopted. Such conceptions of control are a response to important contingencies in the firm's institutional environment. In the United States the most broadly shared conception of control currently is a particularly narrow one, focusing on financial measures of performance. This has not always been the case: conceptions of control are subject to evolutionary change over time. The paper traces such changes, evaluates the current situation and its relation to shareholders, and speculates as to the possibility of a future change in a more socially conscious direction.","Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA",Indiana State University,"Redmond, W (通讯作者)，Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",,,,,,,,38,2,4,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Analyses of our samples from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth show that, other things being equal, the initial wage decline is greater for intersectoral movers than for intrasectoral movers. Intersectoral movers, however, enjoy higher wage growth in subsequent years on postunemployment jobs than intrasectoral movers do, and hence are compensated for their initial wage decline. Our estimates suggest that, other things being constant, the additional short-term wage loss associated with sector shifts is overturned in no more than four years by the greater wage growth of intersectoral movers in subsequent years. The findings in the current study clearly show that the true economic costs of intersector mobility tend to be overstated in existing studies and are significantly lowered in the long-term perspective. Calibration of a simple lifetime utility model demonstrates that inter- and intrasectoral movements of workers are quantitatively consistent with an equilibrium framework, at least for a major group of workers who move with longer term perspectives. Evidence also shows that job seekers consider not only the initial wage rate but also the subsequent wages received from the postunemployment job when deciding whether to recommence employment or switch sectors.","[Shin, Donggyun] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Seonyoung] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Kyung Hee University; Korea University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Shin, D (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dgshin@khu.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",,,,,35,2,2,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

He discusses alternatives to the financial bailouts and shows how the crisis could have been dealt with more efficiently and at little cost to taxpayers. Finally, the author discusses fundamental reforms that would reduce the volatility of financial markets and increase their efficiency. He reviews some social science literature that views the current crisis as an episode in the secular decline of the United States and more generally of the Western Democracies. The timidity of current reforms, which is striking when compared to those that followed the excesses of the Gilded Age and the Great Depression, can be understood in this framework. The author concludes that the industrialized world is now dominated by a 'financial-political complex' that maximizes speculative profits in good times and socializes losses in times of crisis.","Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Hillinger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ludwigstr 33-4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",hillinger@lmu.de,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,10,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 5,2010,4.0,,,,,,,,201023,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2010-23,0.0,,,62,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298283900002,0

Unlike the conventional small open-economy model that assumes constant commodity prices, factor substitution influences the direction of these effects. When a factor endowment increases, complementarity with the expanding factor benefits an unchanged factor, but substitutability harms it. If the unchanged factors are complements, there is a possibility of a rise in the expanding factor's price. A comparison of this closed-economy model with the small open-economy model reveals the role of international trade, which dampens the effect on the expanding factor's price.","Kobe Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6508586, Japan",Kobe Gakuin University,"Ban, H (通讯作者)，Kobe Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Chuo Ku, 1-1-3 Minatojima, Kobe, Hyogo 6508586, Japan.",ban@eb.kobegakuin.ac.jp,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

After generalizing their no-shirking constraint to accommodate asset accumulation, and demonstrating that the resulting economy's equilibrium is saddle-path stable, we use our dynamic model to obtain significant departures from the Shapiro-Stiglitz prescriptions for optimal policy. Most notably, wage income should be taxed (not subsidized) in the long run if the labor market is sufficiently distorted. Furthermore, interest income should be (exhaustively) taxed only during an initial interval of time, as in Chamley's (1986) full-employment model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments are conducted in four-person groups in a star network, where one central player observes and is observed by the others. This imposes a social structure on the game, and gives the central player a leadership role in the group, simply by virtue of being commonly observed. We further manipulate status by allocating the central position to the person who earns the highest, or the lowest, score on a trivia quiz. These high-status and low-status treatments are compared, and we find that the effect of organizational structure-the existence of a central position-depends on the status of the central player. Higher status players are attended to and mimicked more systematically.

To this end, the effect of government size on subjective well-being is estimated in a combined survey and country-level dataset covering 153,268 respondents from twelve EU countries over the 1990-2000 period. The first finding is an inversely U-shaped relationship between government size and well-being. In addition, the analysis suggests that given the high institutional quality as compared to other parts of the world there might be scope for a further enlargement of governments in the EU from a well-being perspective. However, one must acknowledge that the effect on well-being may be quite small and that democratic societies in Europe have no experience with even larger governments. The investigation also reveals that the impact of government size on well-being depends negatively on levels of corruption and positively on the extent of decentralization. Moreover, left-wing voters and low-income earners are the main beneficiaries of a large public sector. Finally, in all twelve EU countries included in the sample higher levels of well-being could have been achieved by allocating a higher share of public resources to education, while Finland and Germany could have given an additional boost to well-being by cutting expenditures on social protection.","Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Hessami, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",Zohal.Hessami@uni-konstanz.de,,"Hessami, Zohal/0000-0002-0669-6913",,,,,60,48,59,2,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0023-5962,,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2010,63.0,3,,,,,346,382,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00478.x,0.0,,,37,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,626AV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000279939000003,0

We show that the combination of internal competencies and context-specific factors is different when explaining decisions to start e-government activities vs. the intensity of such activities. Municipalities involved in e-government are larger, carry out more in-house ICT activities and are more likely to have intranet infrastructures than PAs that do not offer front-office digitized services. They are also generally located in regions having relatively large shares of firms using or producing ICTs, where many other municipalities offer digitized services, and where population density is relatively low. The range and quality of e-government services supplied by local PAs tend to increase with their stock of ICT competencies, their efforts to train workers, and with their ability to organise efficient interfaces with end-users. Moreover, there is a correlation between the range and quality of e-government services offered and the broadband infrastructure development in the area where local PAs are located.

This has revived the so-called growth-rebalancing debate. In particular, the new emerging consensus calls for a re-orientation of the US economy away from consumption and toward exports, and for policy shifts that can help China to reduce its dependence on external demand and inefficiently high rates of capital accumulation. We discuss the economic and political feasibility of the proposed patterns of re-adjustment by focusing on the short-term and long-term trade-offs faced by the policy-makers. We argue that the rebalancing will be gradual and partial because of the costs associated with a radical shift in the growth models adopted by both countries.

We find that both housing quantities and homeownership rates respond strongly to eliminating social security. Accordingly, the aggregate impacts of this policy reform are significantly larger in an economy with explicit housing choices than in a standard life-cycle economy. Our analysis shows that the key mechanism behind these results is the substitution effects of a change in interest rates and, thus, the price of housing services on the choice of nondurable consumption versus housing services.

We then introduce a model that combines elements of both free and coordinated entry. This model describes how an upstream firm may find it optimal to restrict dowstream entry in some markets while allowing for free entry in other markets. The discussion shows how uncovering fixed costs from these alternative entry models is parallel to uncovering marginal costs from alternative oligopoly models of pricing or output behavior. To allow for clear comparisons, we focus on market-level entry models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we extend this type of analysis and integrate the effects on productivity growth, theoretically and empirically. Productivity growth is introduced into the theoretical model making use of the Verdoorn effect or of Kaldor's technical progress function and hence of a positive relationship between GDP or capital stock growth and productivity growth. Further on, a cost-push or Marx/Hicks-effect and hence a positive impact of real wage growth or the wage share on productivity growth is taken into account. In the empirical part we estimate productivity growth equations for six countries introducing these two effects.

Across identification methods and comparison groups, the results consistently suggest that choice significantly reduces the drop-out rate and increases the cognitive achievements of high-school students.

However, when a foreign monopolist employs a second degree price discrimination mechanism in the domestic market the calculus of welfare maximization is very different. While there are still terms of trade effects from the imposition of a tariff, the existence of such effects are neither necessary nor sufficient to determine the sign of the optimal tariff. Instead the distribution of valuations within the population is the key determinant of the nature of policy intervention. This result differs significantly from the uniform price case and is driven by the incentive compatibility constraint which places the distribution of types at the center of the analysis. If there is a relatively large fraction of high valuation types in the population, then domestic information rents may be increased by subsidizing imports thereby increasing the consumption of the low valuation types and moving the incentive constraint in favor of the high valuation types. However, if the share of high types in the population is relatively small then the increase in information rents will also be small but the fiscal implications of a subsidy will be large. Consequently, the optimal policy will be to impose a trade tax. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) show that while consumption, asset wealth, and labor income share a common long-term trend; they substantially deviate from one another in the short run. In this paper, I show that these transitory deviations can be explained by fluctuations in the price of crude oil. Linear and threshold multivariate autoregressive models are used to measure the oil price effect. Oil price effect on the consumption to aggregate wealth ratio is robust to monetary policy effect, sub-period effect, and econometric specifications of oil price effect. Generally speaking, higher (lower) oil price will lead to a decrease (increase) in the proportion of aggregate wealth consumed. In addition, the magnitude of the oil price effect is asymmetric and sub-period dependent. Oil price effect was higher before the 1980's than in succeeding periods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

While talent is assessed through mechanisms offering more or less observations, coaching decisions and team quality that can affect performance in team sports are generally not present in individual sports. Avoiding the possible distortions that can come from assessing athletic talent in team sports, this article examines the ability of two PGA TOUR promotion mechanisms-the Nationwide Tour and Qualifying School (Q-school)-to predict success. As expected, the results suggest that more observations from the Nationwide Tour assessment mechanism provide more information about talent that can be used to better predict success on the PGA TOUR.

First, it aims to reveal the logic of interest rate settings pursued by the monetary authorities of twelve new EU members. Using an estimation of an augmented Taylor rule, we find that central banks in countries with flexible exchange rates respond mainly to (expected) inflation, though often rather loosely. Countries with fixed exchange rates seem to apply an interest rate peg with the euro. Second, it sheds light on the inflation processes of these countries. To this end, we estimate an open economy Phillips curve (PC) and find that inflation rates are not only driven by backward persistency, but also have a forward-looking component. Finally, we assess the viability of existing monetary arrangements for price stability, using the conditional inflation variance obtained from a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity estimation of the PC. We conclude that inflation targeting is preferable to an exchange rate peg because it allows for decreasing inflation rates as well as anchoring inflation volatility.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Vasicek, B (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,34,13,13,0,7,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The tractability of the model allows us to rank outsourcing and migration, according to the wages of both types of workers.

By enabling the researcher to precisely control the variation in the data, field experiments allow the estimation of parameters and testing of hypotheses that would be very difficult to implement with observational data. The results of this body of empirical work, in turn, have pushed theory in new directions. Much of this paper illustrates the power of this interplay between experimental and theoretical thinking. Rather than discussing this in the abstract, we focus on one area where the recent empirical work has been particularly exciting and useful - credit. Credit markets in developing countries offer up many facts and puzzles that lead us to build theories based on informational constraints and psychological limitations. The empirical work inspired by these theories, in turn, has generated both support for the theories, which then influenced policy thinking, and new puzzles, which have prompted new efforts to improve the theory. We see the substantive, two-way conversation taking place between theory and data around credit markets in developing economies as a promising template for the field.","[Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Duflo, Esther] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Duflo, Esther] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Duflo, Esther] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit V.; Duflo, Esther] Ctr Econ & Policy Res, London, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Banerjee, AV (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",banerjee@mit.edu; eduflo@mit.edu,,,,,,,60,78,91,3,46,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

However, some dynamic sequences commencing from such points may not be considered valid equilibria because they asymptotically violate some economic restriction of the model. This paper studies a pure-exchange monetary overlapping generations economy in which young and old agents face exogenous minimum consumption requirements, and money is the only asset. The presence of the minimum consumption requirement on the old is shown to produce multiperiodic monetary equilibria in which real balances cycle forever between momentary equilibrium points (those which generate monetary sequences that potentially violate equilibrium strictures asymptotically). The novelty is to show that segments of the intergenerational offer curve that would have been deemed dynamically invalid can, in fact, be used to produce asymptotically valid cyclical paths. Indeed, a limit cycle can bestow dynamic validity on momentary equilibrium points that had erstwhile been classified as dynamically invalid. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We employ simulation techniques to quantify the effects of intercorrelated preferences on men's and women's aggregate satisfaction with the outcome of the Gale-Shapley matching mechanism. Our results show that even a small amount of positive intercorrelation in a matching market means increased satisfaction for women and dramatically decreased potential for strategic manipulation. Negative intercorrelation has the opposite effects. Thus, matching markets characterized by positive intercorrelation are well suited for matching via Gale-Shapley, while markets characterized by negative intercorrelation may face opposition from the nonproposing side of the market. So that our results are immediately applicable, we also define and employ a general measure of intercorrelation that can be used for any matching market.","[Boudreau, James W.] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78541 USA; [Knoblauch, Vicki] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Connecticut,"Boudreau, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Pan Amer, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78541 USA.",vicki.knoblauch@uconn.edu,,,,,,,15,10,13,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Using a dynamic program, we calculate the certainty-equivalent of the difference between the cash rewards that entrepreneurs actually received over the past 20 years and the cash that entrepreneurs would have received from a risk-free salaried job. The payoff to a venture-backed entrepreneur comprises a below-market salary and a share of the equity value of the company when it goes public or is acquired. We find that the typical venture-backed entrepreneur received an average of $5.8 million in exit cash. Almost three-quarters of entrepreneurs receive nothing at exit and a few receive over a billion dollars. Because of the extreme dispersion of payoffs, an entrepreneur with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of two places a certainty equivalent value only slightly greater than zero on the distribution of outcomes she faces at the time of her company's launch.","[Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Woodward, Susan E.] Sand Hill Econometr, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Hall, RE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, 434 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rehall@stanford.edu; swoodward@sandhillecon.com,,,,,,,10,139,170,3,73,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,,,AM ECON REV,Am.

First, they largely neglect considering the link cost and the link benefit that agents usually take into account in forming their links. Second, they view a social network as a consequence of unilateral decisions of agents, not of bilateral decisions of linking parties, although a link of an agent can be formed only after he obtains the consent of the other side. Third, there is no logical justification for the assumption of preferential attachment upon which their analysis heavily relies. In this paper, we provide several models that overcome the three drawbacks. By analyzing the models, we can explain preferential attachment as rational equilibrium behavior. The main idea is that people are not certain of the value that they can obtain from forming a link with someone. Based on this assumption, we will argue that a person has an incentive to form a link with another who has many links because the number of his links can convey some information about his value.","[Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Jo, Hang-Hyun] Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Phys, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS),"Kim, JY (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Hoegidong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",jyookim@khu.ac.kr,"Jo, Hang-Hyun/F-4666-2012","Jo, Hang-Hyun/0000-0002-4214-9204",,,,,22,6,8,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This could be explained by increases in the costs of managing diverse activities, the enlargement of branch networks and the upgrading of the banking technology platform.","[Vu, Ha Thu; Turnell, Sean] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Vu, HT (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",hvu@efs.mq.edu.au; sean.turnell@mq.edu.au,,"Turnell, Sean/0000-0002-2865-1089; Vu, Ha/0000-0003-2599-1851",,,,,25,31,33,0,5,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1351-3958,,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Agrofood trade specialization stability and duration are investigated by main agrofood products groups according to the degree of product processing and the dynamics in demand growth by EU-15 markets. Excepting Serbia and Montenegro, and to a lesser extent the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the SEE experienced an increasing trade deficit in agrofood products with the EU-15. SEE-6 agrofood exports to the EU-15 markets are highly concentrated in bulk raw commodities with a lack of export specialization for higher-valued processed consumer-ready food. The most recent SEE agrofood export deconcentration is due to new emerging competitive niche products as a result of the SEE agrofood sector restructuring. Except in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, SEE agrofood export specialization is toward the most dynamic demand growth products by the EU-15 markets. Regression and survival analyses confirm that EU integration increases stability and duration of agrofood trade specialization on the EU-15 markets.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Imre Ferto] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia.",,"Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,21,10,10,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The credit boom has come at the expense of increased banking fragility, as banks reduced their capital base and registered an increase in nonperforming loans.

This approach provides a framework which allows drivers of cross-border financial flows and other determinants of saving and investment to be included in a current account model, an advantage not offered by the elasticity approach (which views the current account balance as the sum of net exports, net investment income, and net unilateral transfer). We estimate and compare vector error-correction models of the absorption and elasticity approaches, with the absorption model nesting the elasticity model.

The diversification of Chinese exports and their technological upgrading have been phenomenal. However, there is also inertia, illustrated by the persistent dualism of the trade sector, the unrelenting specialization in downmarket products and the deteriorating terms of trade. These weaknesses have helped its partners to adjust to the rise of this new trade power. In the past decade, China's economy has faced the adverse effects of an export-led growth and the global crisis has revealed its vulnerability. China is now forced to rebalance its economy. This will imply major changes in foreign trade, in favor of ordinary trade and away from processing.

The LWR-LEU fuel industry is decades old, and (except for the high entry cost of designing and licensing a fuel fabrication facility and its fuel), labor and additional fabrication lines can be added at Nth-of-a-Kind cost to the maximum capacity allowed by a site license. The industry appears to be competitive: nuclear fuel fabrication capacity is assured with many competitors and reasonable prices. However, nuclear fuel assurance has become an important issue for nations now to considering new nuclear power plants. To provide this assurance many proposals equate nuclear fuel banks (which would require fuel for specific reactors) with LEU banks (where LEU could be blended into nuclear fuel with the proper enrichment) with local fuel fabrication. The policy issues (which are presented, but not answered in this paper) become (1) whether the construction of new nuclear fuel fabrication facilities in new nuclear power nations could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and (2) whether nuclear fuel quality can be guaranteed under current industry arrangements, given that fuel failure at one reactor can lead to forced shutdowns at many others.

The empirical results indicate that, first; the asymmetric cointegration relation exists in the deposit rate of four countries and the lending rate of six countries. Second, a minority of the impacts of expected and unexpected monetary policy are positive, and the effect of unexpected monetary impulse are larger that expected ones. Third, the impacts of hetero-risk of interest rate are significant in certain countries, and the leverage effect exists in six countries.

We observe that discontinuous changes in introduction dates can occur as firms' abilities as researchers change. Further, when the research abilities of the firms differ, either the high ability firm or the low ability firm may be the first mover. The underlying research abilities of the firms determine the social optimality of the entry patterns we observe. Minimum quality standards and novelty requirements can play a role in correcting these suboptimal patterns of entry. While minimum quality standards increase welfare for a large range of research abilities, we find that increasing the novelty requirement does not necessarily increase either the profits or, consequently, the research investment incentives of the initial innovator, contrary to much of the cumulative innovation literature. Indeed, as the effect of policy interventions differs significantly across industries where quality improvement is steep and those where it is flat, targeted policies towards specific industries as are often observed in minimum quality standards are generally preferable to more broad-based policies.","[Rockett, Katharine] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Prokop, Jacek] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Rockett, Katharine] Univ Tromso, N-9001 Tromso, Norway",University of Essex; Warsaw School of Economics; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Rockett, K (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",kerock@essex.ac.uk,"Prokop, Jacek/K-1035-2019","Prokop, Jacek/0000-0001-5228-658X",,,,,30,0,0,0,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 29,2010,4.0,,,,,,CP1,U50,201015,,,,,50,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,865AO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000298283000001,0

Should an integrated regulator take care of them all? Or is it better to have separate regulators responsible for them? We analyze the effect of the separation of regulatory powers on the regulated firm's ex ante incentive to invest in a cooperative innovation. The effects of the innovation are not verifiable and the cost of investing is sunk, hence, there is a problem of hold-up. We find that when the innovation produces opposite effects the ex ante firm's incentive to invest is larger in the case of separation than in the case of integrated regulation. We also stress the risk of over-investment that the separation of regulatory powers may induce. We maintain that along with classical incentive regulation-which mainly provides incentives for the firm to be efficient-the separation of regulatory powers may play a role in providing an incentive for cooperative innovations.","Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Bartolini, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Econ, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",d.bartolini@univpm.it,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,7,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

An optimal fiscal and monetary policy problem is formulated and solved for a small-open economy that faces a country-specific interest rate spread in international financial markets. It is found that, in the presence of the country spread, optimal fiscal and monetary policies as well as capital flows are procyclical under a reasonable parametrization. Optimal policies and capital flows turn countercyclical in the absence of the country spread. This pattern is robust to a range of alternative model specifications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Only younger workers might be against immigration since they will coincide with immigrants in their retirement periods. Moreover, we show how a larger immigrant quota would increase the probability of a Pareto improvement for the current domestic population.","[Lacomba, Juan A.; Lagos, Francisco] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Lacomba, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"Lagos, Francis/AAT-6192-2020","Lagos Garcia, Francisco Miguel/0000-0003-1945-3272",,,,,19,14,15,2,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0427,,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2010,77.0,306,,,,,283,295,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2008.00770.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,562ZY,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275096100004,0

We focus on two aspects of ratings that contributed to the boom and bust of the market for structured debt: rating inflation and coarse information disclosure. The paper discusses how regulation can be designed to mitigate these problems in the future. Our preferred policy is to require rating agencies to be paid by investors rather than by issuers and to grant open and free access to data about the loans or securities underlying structured debt products. A more modest (but less effective) approach would be to retain the 'issuer pays' model but require issuers to pay an upfront fee irrespective of the rating, ban 'credit shopping', and prescribe a more complete format for the information that rating agencies must disseminate. --- Marco Pagano and Paolo Volpin.","[Pagano, Marco] Univ Naples Federico 2, CSEF, EIEF, Naples, Italy; London Business Sch, London, England",University of Naples Federico II; University of London; London Business School,"Pagano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico 2, CSEF, EIEF, Naples, Italy.",,"PAGANO, MARCO/AAD-8218-2022","PAGANO, MARCO/0000-0002-0709-6119",,,,,43,49,58,0,22,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0266-4658,,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

It is possible that such targets may work where there is considerable consensus that performance needs to be improved. We investigate this possibility by examining the response of the English National Health Service to high profile waiting time targets. We exploit a natural policy experiment between two countries of the UK (England and Scotland) to establish the global effectiveness of the targets. We then use a within-England hospital analysis to confirm that responses vary by treatment intensity and to control for differences in resources which may accompany targets. We find that targets met their goals of reducing waiting times without diverting activity from other less well monitored aspects of health care and without decreasing patient health on exit from hospital.

Our estimates suggest that the excess burden per-period amounts to approximately 2.2 billion Euros or to about 0.1 per cent of GDP. In present value terms, the excess burden translates to about 89 billion Euros or 4.0 per cent of GDP. In order to identify the impact of the firm's financial behaviour on the size of the emerging excess burden, we perform several sensitivity analyses with regard to debt financing, external equity financing and debt constraints via agency cost.","[Radulescu, Doina Maria; Stimmelmayr, Michael] Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Radulescu, Doina Maria; Stimmelmayr, Michael] CES, CESifo, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut,"Stimmelmayr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",Radulescu@lmu.de; Stimmelmayr@lmu.de,"; Radulescu, Doina/R-6762-2018","Stimmelmayr, Michael/0000-0002-1496-1203; Radulescu, Doina/0000-0002-9708-2502",,,,,48,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

(Not quite what everybody thinks),JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The agency problem at the core of corporate law stems from a chronic potential conflict of interest between directors' self-interest and that of shareholders. Corporate law views directors' self-interest in terms of diverting welfare to directors at the expense of shareholders. Another component of directors' self-interest - being perceived as maximizing shareholders' welfare - is seen not as part of the agency problem, but as part of the solution (aligning directors' incentives with shareholders'). This is true only if taking actions that maximize shareholders' welfare is also the optimal manner for a director to be perceived as maximizing welfare. However, directors have more appealing ways to be positively perceived. In conducting bias arbitrage, directors identify risks that shareholders over-estimate, take action to address the risk, and then take credit for the 'lowered' risk (i.e., shareholders' corrected assessment of the risk). Bias arbitrage is more attractive as shareholders' misperception of a risk increases. The opportunity to bias arbitrage thus leads directors to address highly misperceived risks instead of highly remediable risks.","Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Aviram, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",aviram@law.illinois.edu,,,,,,,4,2,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,,,J I ECON,J.

Second, fiscal policy instruments are often pro-cyclical (and practically never counter-cyclical).

Profit-maximizing banks have incentives to compete for deposits by opening branches or expanding branch networks through mergers and acquisitions. Larger branch networks reduce the transaction cost of financial intermediation and encourage depositors to save more, hence resulting in higher per capita output. Empirically, the development of the Canadian banking industry during 1889-1926, notably the merger wave in the early 1900s, is examined. A VECM shows that savings, real GNP and the number of bank branches, all on a per capita basis, are cointegrated - with long-run savings being a positive function of the other two variables. Results of innovation accounting are also consistent with predictions of the theory. Our findings not only have policy implications for bank branch deregulation as well as mergers and acquisitions but also shed light on the debate about the finance-growth nexus in Canada.

The highest achieving girls in the U.S. are concentrated in a very small set of elite schools, suggesting that almost all girls with the ability to reach high math achievement levels are not doing so.","[Ellison, Glenn; Swanson, Ashley] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ellison, Glenn] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ellison, Glenn] Bigelow Middle Sch, Newton, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ellison, G (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gellison@mit.edu; aswan@mit.edu,,,,,,,22,93,131,1,33,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We answer this question by considering a representative agent consuming two goods whose availability evolves over time in a stochastic way. We extend the Ramsey rule by taking into account the degree of substitutability between the two goods and of the uncertainty surrounding the economic and environmental growths. The rate at which environmental impacts should be discounted is in general different from the one at which monetary benefits should be discounted. We provide arguments in favor of an ecological discount rate smaller than the economic discount rate. In particular, we show that, under certainty and Cobb Douglas preferences, the difference between the economic and the ecological discount rates equals the difference between the economic and the ecological growth rates. Using data about the link between biodiversity and economic development, I estimate that the rate at which changes in biodiversity should be discounted is 1.5%, whereas changes in consumption should be discounted at 3.2%.

We find that larger foreign presence stimulates the entry of domestic firms within the same industry, indicating the existence of positive horizontal spillovers from FDI. We also find evidence of significant vertical entry spillovers-FDI in downstream (upstream) industries initiates entry in upstream (downstream) sectors. Our results also show that entry spillovers through vertical linkages are stronger than horizontal spillovers and that while service industries benefit from both horizontal and vertical spillovers, manufacturing industries do not experience significant positive entry spillovers of any kind. We also find that country of origin of FDI matters-horizontal spillovers are driven by FDI from the EU countries. The right skewness of the firm size distributions in industries without FDI further emphasizes an important role of FDI presence for overall industry dynamics.","[Ayyagari, Meghana] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Kosova, Renata] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",George Washington University; Cornell University,"Ayyagari, M (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sch Business, 2201 G St,Funger Hall 401, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",ayyagari@gwu.edu; rk373@cornell.edu,"Ayyagari, Meghana/Q-8869-2017",,,,,,19,91,101,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0965-7576,,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Using transition data on individual workers, we document a marked increase in structural change and turbulence, in particular since 1990. Net employment changes resulted partly from an increase in gross flows, but also from an increase in the net transition 'yield' at any given gross worker turnover. In growing sectors, net structural change was driven by accessions from non-participation rather than unemployment; contracting sectors reduced their net employment primarily via lower accessions from non-participation. German reunification and Eastern enlargement appear to have contributed significantly to this accelerated pace of structural change.","[Bachmann, Ronald] RWI Essen, D-45130 Essen, Germany; [Burda, Michael C.] Humboldt Univ, IZA, D-1086 Berlin, Germany; [Burda, Michael C.] CEPR, Berlin, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bachmann, R (通讯作者)，RWI Essen, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45130 Essen, Germany.",bachmann@rwi.essen.de,,"Bachmann, Ronald/0000-0001-7675-5272",,,,,33,16,16,0,20,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1465-6485,,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

EVIDENCE FROM A CONSUMER CREDIT MARKETING FIELD EXPERIMENT,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SELF-CONTROL; CHOICE; ALTERNATIVES; PSYCHOLOGY; ECONOMICS; DECISION,"Firms spend billions of dollars developing advertising content, yet there is little field evidence on how much or how it affects demand. We analyze a direct mail field experiment in South Africa implemented by a consumer lender that randomized advertising content, loan price, and loan offer deadlines simultaneously. We find that advertising content significantly affects demand. Although it was difficult to predict ex ante which specific advertising features would matter most in this context, the features that do matter have large effects. Showing fewer example loans, not suggesting a particular use for the loan, or including a photo of an attractive woman increases loan demand by about as much as a 25% reduction in the interest rate. The evidence also suggests that advertising content persuades by appealing peripherally to intuition rather than reason. Although the advertising content effects point to an important role for persuasion and related psychology, our deadline results do not support the psychological prediction that shorter deadlines may help overcome time-management problems; instead, demand strongly increases with longer deadlines.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, NBER, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, CEPR, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Yale Univ, Jameel Poverty Act Lab, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Harvard Univ, Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Yale Univ, Innovat Poverty Act, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Harvard Univ, Innovat Poverty Act, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Chicago; Yale University; Harvard University; Princeton University; Dartmouth College; Yale University; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA); Harvard University; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA),"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, NBER, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Shafir, Eldar/H-9957-2014","Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052; karlan, dean/0000-0003-0164-1398",,,,,57,247,290,1,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Similar to the discrepancy between normal'' and actual'' bilateral trade, one may ask the question about the difference between normal'' and actual bilateral multinational activity. However, with multinational activity, zero bilateral data and heteroskedasticity are very important, even more so than with trade data. Therefore, this paper suggests using generalized linear rather than log-linear models to specify normal'' FDI and obtain estimates of unexhausted FDI potentials. I use panel data on Austria's bilateral multinational activity across 25 countries and 7 country-blocs, 4 sectors and 13 years to illustrate the disadvantage of log-linear model estimation at quasi-maximum likelihood estimation.","[Egger, Peter] Ifo Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter] LMU, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Egger, P (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Munich, Germany.",egger@kof.ethz.ch,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,19,9,9,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2010,37.0,1,,,SI,,5,17,,10.1007/s10663-009-9116-5,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V25OC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208486300002,0

There is one indivisible good, which comes in different qualities; each consumer buys 0 or 1 unit, and each supplier sells 0 or 1 unit. Consumer types, supplier types and qualities can be either discrete of continuous, in which case they are allowed to be multidimensional. Prices play a double role: they keep some agents out of the market, and they match the remaining ones pairwise. We define equilibrium prices and equilibrium distributions, and we prove that equilibria exist, we investigate to what extend equilibrium prices and distributions are unique, and we prove that equilibria are efficient. In the particular case when there is a continuum of types, and a generalized Spence-Mirrlees condition is satisfied, we prove the existence of a pure equilibrium, where demand distributions are in fact demand functions, and we show to what extent it is unique.

However, it is often true that the productivity of enforcement resources decreases with the number of violators. In this paper, an individual who violates the law provides a positive externality for other offenders because the probability of being punished decreases with the number of individuals violating the law. This externality explains the existence of correlation between individuals' decisions to break a law. The model evaluates the implications when determining the socially optimal enforcement expenditure, focusing specifically on the case of neighborhood crime. In particular, using a parametrized functional form, I show that neighborhood externalities will enhance or impede enforcement, depending on the crime rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Absent stochastic shocks, decentralized tax setting (two or more jurisdictions) maximizes the rate of growth, as the constant returns to scale present with endogenous growth implies extreme tax competition. Stochastic shocks imply that households face a portfolio choice problem, which dampens down tax competition and may raise taxes above the centralized level. Growth can be lower with decentralization. Our results also predict a negative relationship between output volatility and growth with decentralization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Ethical issues typically arise because of conflicts between individuals' personal moral philosophies and values and the values and attitudes of the organizations in which they work and the society in which they live. The research question is: Are there connections between national culture and ethics? This paper adopts a deontological approach by testing the absoluteness of right and  wrong and the importance of the No-harm Principle (cf. Pojman, 2002). Three countries were selected to conduct the investigation -Brazil, China, and Estonia. These three countries are from three different cultural clusters. A scale was developed to measure Ethical Relativism and No-harm Principle. The national cultural connection was stronger with Ethical Relativism, where six cultural practices and two cultural values seem to be related to how people think about what is right and wrong. Concerning the No-Harm Principle one should not psychologically or physically harm another person, nor perform an action which might threaten the dignity and welfare of another individual, only In-Group Collectivism as a value was (negatively) connected with the No-Harm Principle. As a managerial suggestion, organizations ought to pay attention to the following cultural dimensions when doing business in different cultures could be useful: In-Group Collectivism, Institutional Collectivism, Humane Orientation, Performance Orientation, Future Orientation and Gender Egalitarianism.","[Alas, Ruth; Gao, Junhong] Estonian Business Sch, Tallinn, Estonia; [Carneiro, Jorge] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, IAG Business Sch, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Estonian Business School; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro,"Alas, R (通讯作者)，Estonian Business Sch, Lauteri 3 Talinn, Tallinn, Estonia.",ruth.alas@ebs.ee; junhong.gao@ebs.ee; jorgemtc@iag.puc-rio.br,,,,,,,27,8,13,0,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The overall objectives of economic policy, which forms the basis of our approach, is squarely sustainable (environmental and otherwise) and equitable economic development and growth. And within it we identify the main objective of macroeconomic policy as the achievement of full employment of the available labour force (recognising that the available labour force depends on social conditions and is influenced by the path of economic activity). Achieving such an objective would require, inter alia, the maintenance of a high level of aggregate demand consistent with the full employment of labour, and the provision of sufficient productive capacity to enable that full employment, where sufficient is to be interpreted in terms of quantity, quality and geographical distribution.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Leioa, Spain; [Sawyer, Malcolm] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country; University of Leeds,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,42,6,7,0,3,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-0-230-28541-5,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2010,,,,,,,81,119,,,,,,39,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BVJ31,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291643100003,0

A weak positive relation between economic level and efficiency arises. Some weak evidence also exists that public management of refuse collection is more efficient than private.

On the one hand, the opportunity cost to train is lower during downturns, and thus training should be counter-cyclical. On the other hand, a positive shock may be related to the adoption of new technologies and increased returns to skill, making training incidence pro-cyclical. The first contribution of this paper is to document, using the Canadian panel of Workplace and Employee Survey (WES), that (i) training moves counter-cyclically with aggregate output fluctuations (more training in downturns), while at the same time (ii) the relative position of sectoral output has a positive impact on training decisions (more training in sectors doing relatively better). This second fact is novel and unexplored. Overall, the results show that the firms' decisions to train are quite complex; in order to fully understand them, one needs to take into account not only the change in aggregates, but also the relative position of each sector in the economy. The second contribution of the paper is to illustrate the mechanisms at work by incorporating training decisions into a standard Mortensen-Pissarides model. In the standard model, production takes place if workers' productivity is above a reservation threshold. In our extension, this threshold gets expanded into a whole interval within which production takes place if workers are trained. The quantitative analysis from the calibrated model illustrates the counter-cyclical opportunity cost adjustment from aggregate shocks and the pro-cyclical adjustment coming from sectoral reallocation.","[Caponi, Vincenzo] Ryerson Univ, Inst Study Labor, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kayahan, Burc] Acadia Univ, Wolfville, NS B0P 1X0, Canada; [Plesca, Miana] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Acadia University; University of Guelph,"Caponi, V (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Inst Study Labor, Toronto, ON, Canada.",vcaponi@ryerson.ca; ckayahan@acadiau.ca; miplesca@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

First, it presents a simple theoretical model of conflict that defines a two-sector economy. In a contested sector, two agents struggle to appropriate the maximum possible fraction of a contestable output. In an uncontested sector, they hold secure property rights over the production of some goods. Agents split their resource endowment between 'butter', 'guns' and 'ice-cream'. Following the theoretical insights the empirical analysis focuses on the relationship between civil wars and different sectors of the economy. In particular, a panel probit specification shows that the incidence of a civil war decreases in the size of manufacturing sector.","Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Econ Policy, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Caruso, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Econ Policy, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",raul.caruso@unicatt.it,,"Caruso, Raul/0000-0002-9307-5460",,,,,46,21,22,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The methodology we propose allows dividing the impact of exogenous injections into four different effects: direct-direct effect (D-D); direct-indirect effect (D-I); indirect-direct effect (I-D) and indirect-indirect effect (I-I). Results using the 2000 Vietnamese SAM show that the highest direct effects on the income of household groups are related to exogenous injections into the agricultural sector, while the highest indirect effects result from investing in other agriculture-related sectors such as, for example, food processing. Policy interventions focusing on the agricultural sector and on rural households will thus have the greatest effect on reducing the level of income inequality.","[Pansini, Rosaria Vega] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Civardi, Marisa] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Lenti, Renata Targetti] Univ Pavia, Dept Publ Econ, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",Bocconi University; University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Pavia,"Pansini, RV (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy.",rosaria.pansini@unibocconi.it,"Pansini, Rosaria Vega/AAE-6199-2020","Pansini, Rosaria Vega/0000-0003-0823-0508",,,,,11,5,8,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Therefore the statistical relationship between the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and corresponding official statistics series will be analyzed in order to see how the changes in ESI reflect on various segments of economic activity in Croatia.

The contribution of this article is to apply meta-regression analysis (MRA) to the empirical literature. On average, exchange rate variability exerts a negative effect on international trade. Yet MRA confirms the view that this result is highly conditional, by identifying factors that help to explain why estimated trade effects vary from significantly negative to significantly positive. MRA evidence on the pronounced heterogeneity of the empirical findings may be instructive for policy: first, by establishing that average trade effects are not sufficiently robust to generalize across countries; and second, by suggesting the importance of hedging opportunities - hence of financial development - for trade promotion. For the practice of MRA, we make a case for checking the robustness of results with respect to estimation technique, model specification and sample.","[Pugh, Geoff] Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DF, Staffs, England; [Coric, Bruno] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Split 21000, Croatia",Staffordshire University; University of Split,"Pugh, G (通讯作者)，Staffordshire Univ, Sch Business, Leek Rd, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DF, Staffs, England.",geoff@plainfigures.com,"Ćorić, Bruno/D-4900-2017; Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019","Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757",,,,,82,42,45,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This version of the Romanian macromodel incorporates the experience accumulated through the utilization of its previous forms - either experimental (tested during 1991-1995) or operational (developed during 1996-2003). At the same time, it introduces some methodological and informational improvements. The most significant of them is the structural decomposition of the economy, associated with input-output techniques. Due to the relatively advanced stage of the transitional processes in Romania, the behavioural functions were accommodated - as much as possible - to the standard relationships. Unlike the versions that used the statistical series beginning in 1980, the present one is based exclusively on information concerning the period 1989-2004. Therefore, we have considered more adequately naming this variant the macromodel of the Romanian market (not transition, as before) economy.

The Principal Component Analysis has been adopted to extract the most appropriate underlying dimensions of FMT to use in place of the eight FMT variables owing to the potential multicollinearity. The study has been conducted within FMT intensively adopted 16 three-digit industries that encompass 50 five-digit industries covering the years 2000-2005. The results obtained from the two situations, one, including the industry fixed effects dummy variables and the other without these, are contrasted. It is established that the model that included the industry fixed effect dummy variables has a greater explanatory power. The two principal components that account for the greater variation in FMT show positive and moderately significant relationship with TFPG. The study provides sufficient evidence to conclude that FMT has a direct and moderately significant relationship with TFPG. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We apply a weighted difference-in-difference regression approach and instrumental variables to estimate labour supply functions using a panel dataset. The mean regression results indicate that the tax reform led to a statistically significant increase in hours of work for men but had no effect on work hours for women. However, we find a positive response to tax changes in both tails of the female work hour distribution. We also find that the reform increased the probability of finding a job among both men and women. Despite significant variation in individual responses, the aggregate labour supply elasticities are trivial. This suggests that reform-induced changes in labour supply are an unlikely explanation for the amplified personal income tax revenues that followed the reform.","[Duncan, Denvil; Peter, Klara Sabirianova] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Peter, Klara Sabirianova] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Duncan, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",ecodrdx@langate.gsu.edu; kpeter@gsu.edu,"Sabirianova Peter, Klara/A-4799-2009","Duncan, Denvil/0000-0001-7554-5548",,,,,31,9,9,3,21,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0967-0750,,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Our review of trends in the market for news suggests three stylized facts: i) particular quality news markets are dominated by merely a few providers, ii) demand for quality news appears stable, but provision of news has become specialized; mainstream news is decoupled from quality news, and iii) the dominant business model of internet news mirrors that of radio, television, and newspapers in that costs of news production are recouped via advertising. We build a stylized model that rationalizes these facts. Our model captures three conflicting effects: ( 1) economies of scale in the production of news lead to monopolies on particular markets, ( 2) easy access to information on the internet makes it cheaper to provide high-quality news and to disseminate it via the web, which increases the production of such news; and ( 3) the existence of bloggers and news aggregators who recycle the stories of news-providers reduces the effective property rights of high-quality news producers, thus forcing the business model of the internet to be advertising-based.

We show that independently of the nature of uncertainty high price caps always increase production and welfare as compared to setting no price cap. We also derive conditions on the demand distribution under which a price cap close to marginal cost can be optimal and when it is not. For demand distributions with an increasing hazard rate we show that price regulation under demand uncertainty can be viewed as a well behaved extension of the analysis for deterministic demand. For this class of distributions we characterize the optimal price cap, which is unique and may or may not be close to marginal cost. Our general framework nests the limit case of deterministic demand as well as results by Earle et al.

We evaluate the ability of the Sloping Lands Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China, a reforestation payments programme, to relax constraints on off-farm labour markets and achieve these dual objectives. Our model of the agricultural household allows for heterogeneous exposure to constraints and impacts. The model predicts that the impact of the SLCP on off-farm labour supply will be larger for constrained households if constraints are relaxed. To test the predictions we combine a switching regression with difference in differences. Applied to panel data, this technique allows identification of the heterogeneous impact of the SLCP on constrained and unconstrained households. Our results identify some support for the 'win-win' hypothesis in the case of the SLCP, and how the targeting of the programme can be improved.","[Groom, Ben] Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Grosjean, Pauline] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Nat Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kontoleon, Andreas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Swanson, Timothy] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Swanson, Timothy] UCL, Fac Law, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Zhang, Shiqiu] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Peking University,"Groom, B (通讯作者)，Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England.",bg3@soas.ac.uk,,"grosjean, pauline/0000-0002-3623-8083",,,,,33,72,79,6,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Important features of the research design include the use of individual fixed effects models as well as the inclusion of country-specific trends in the dependent variable. A robust finding is that policies making it easier to create temporary jobs on average raise the likelihood that wage and salary workers will be in temporary jobs. This effect is felt primarily when the regional unemployment rate is relatively high. However, there is no evidence that such reforms raise employment. Thus, these reforms, while touted as a way of jump-starting individuals' careers in the job market, appear rather to encourage a substitution of temporary for permanent work. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Fuzzy memberships represent similarities of objects to imprecisely denned properties, while probabilities convey information about relative frequencies.

Efficiency requires to maximize total welfare. Fairness requires to treat equal agents equally. One must form a queue, set up monetary transfers to compensate agents having to wait, and not a priori arbitrarily exclude agents from positions. As one may not know agents waiting costs, they may have no incentive to reveal them. We identify the only rule satisfying Pareto-efficiency, equal treatment of equals in welfare or symmetry, and strategy-proofness. It satisfies stronger axioms, as no-envy and anonymity. Further, its desirability extends to related problems. To obtain these results, We prove that a rule, single-valued or not, satisfies queue-efficiency and strategy-proofness if and only if it always selects efficient queues and sets transfers A la Groves [Groves, T., 1973.

However, our case study shows that the economy of East Germany got stuck in a long-term stagnation. The growth theory of the new institutional economics based on the North's path dependency concept offers more plausible explanations of the failure of East Germany transition: important causes of the long-lasting decline in productive activities lie in the incompatibility between West Germany formal institutions and East Germany informal institutions.

Some ways for the convention are proposed. Dynamism of the range of societal groups, growing complexity of modern economics and the protracted process of current economic downturn stimulate broad investigation pursuing identification the essential landmarks of society's development as well as boosters of the economics pursuing possible common causes of current embarrassments. In this paper the attempt is made to investigate the vigor of one pillar of the current economics. That is quality of manpower acting in the conditions of the postmodern economics. It is assumed among many causes of economic downturn as well as society's alienation and detune a whole chain of interconnected reasons. At the very beginning of the chain supposed to be the erosion of spiritual values of community members acting in current economics. It is claimed in the article that disremembered and muted spiritual values could be the reason of released greediness, boosted corruption and undercut confidence between partners. Those circumstances grounded conditions and influenced the emerging and afterwards consecutive fall of the expanded fictional business pyramids in many countries. Globalism of economic downturn demonstrates that those circumstances are common to American and European continent. In that connection it is important to have a look to relevance of education and training of human resources as well as to investigate the essentials of education including cultivation of the spirituality of graduates in every study programme. Discussing the content of study programmes adequate attention to interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study programmes is underlined as well. It is mentioned that those programmes could enable educating pathfinders with the broader scope of spirituality, knowledge and skills. Those graduates could become leaders in making reasonable sustainable long-run oriented innovations in the industry and society. Maintaining the European concept of university's diversity worth development of entrepreneurial universities with clear specific mission and regional involvement is supported as another essential improvement relevant to the current situation in the education and training field of the postmodern European society. In the article University multidimensional ranking as another political instrument for enhancing of their quality is overviewed and recommended. It is stated that strenghtening the autonomy of universities as well as increasing investments in education and training are enabling preconditions for the improvement of the performances of universities in European countries. The specific accent is made to the fact that relations of autonomy and financing as well as quality of universities are inseparable. The main objective of the article is to discuss the mix-up in contract between university, society and authorities as well as circumstances and instruments for enabling universities to realise their assumed long run mission and the particularly mission in strengthening knowledge-based economy and society in Europe.","Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Europe, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Krisciunas, K (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Europe, Kestucio St 8, LT-44320 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kestutis.krisciunas@ktu.lt,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Given a class of semi-algebraic exchange economies parameterized by individual endowments and possibly other exogenous variables such as preference parameters or asset payoffs, there exists a semi-algebraic correspondence that maps parameters to positive numbers such that for generic parameters each competitive equilibrium can be associated with an element of the correspondence and each endogenous variable (i.e. prices and consumptions) is a rational function of that value of the correspondence and the parameters. This correspondence can be characterized as zeros of a univariate polynomial equation that satisfy additional polynomial inequalities. This polynomial as well as the rational functions that determine equilibrium can be computed using versions of Buchberger's algorithm which is part of most computer algebra systems. The computation is exact whenever the input data (i.e. preference parameters etc.) are rational. Therefore, the result provides theoretical foundations for a systematic analysis of multiplicity in applied general equilibrium. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Agents decide whether or not to adopt a new technology with unknown payoffs based on their prior beliefs and the experiences of their neighbors in the network. Using a mean-field approximation, we prove that the diffusion process always has at least one stable equilibrium, and we examine the dependence of the set of equilibria on the model parameters and the structure of the network. In particular, we show how first and second order stochastic dominance shifts in the degree distribution of the network impact diffusion. We find that the relationship between equilibrium diffusion levels and network structure depends on the distribution of payoffs to adoption and the distribution of agents' prior beliefs regarding those payoffs, and we derive the precise conditions characterizing those relationships. For example, in contrast to contagion models of diffusion, we find that a first order stochastic dominance shift in the degree distribution can either increase or decrease equilibrium diffusion levels depending on the relationship between agents' prior beliefs and the payoffs to adoption. Surprisingly, adding more links can decrease diffusion even when payoffs from the new technology exceed those of the status quo in expectation.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lamberson, PJ (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pjl@mit.edu,,,,,,,55,15,18,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The choice of information variables is based on three well-known hypotheses about interest rates: the expectations hypothesis, the Fisher relationship, and the condition for uncovered interest parity. The empirical framework consists of an autoregressive distributive lag (ADL) model in error-correction form with information spreads and a Markov regime-switching estimation methodology. The models choose interest-rate regimes that are similar in many respects to those found for the USA. The different regimes in Canada are driven by movements in the monetary policy rate, the US short-term rate, and the long-term yield. The monetary policy rate is found to trigger very large changes in the short-term rate, responding one-for-one in the high-variance regime and slightly less in the more 'normal' interest-rate regime. Both the US short rate and long-term yield are also found to trigger relatively large changes in short-term rates, but only in the high-variance regime. Inflation, however, is not found to contain additional information about regime switches in interest rates at the short-term horizon.","Laurentian Univ, Dept Econ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",Laurentian University,"Lange, RH (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Dept Econ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",rlange@sympatico.ca,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Long-run restrictions are used to interpret the effects in terms of aggregate demand and supply curves. The responses indicate that the immediate effects of terrorism are similar to those associated with a negative demand shock. Such a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve is consistent with the existence of adverse effects on most components of aggregate expenditure documented in previous empirical studies. The long-term consequences of terrorism are similar to those related to a negative supply shock. Such a leftward shift of the long-run aggregate supply curve agrees with adverse effects on the determinants of the potential output, such as contractions of physical capital highlighted in earlier work, as well as reductions of technological innovations and slowdowns of net immigrations, which have not been fully analyzed in the existing empirical literature.","[Lincourt, Genevieve; Normandin, Michel] HEC Montreal, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Larocque, Denis] HEC Montreal, Dept Management Sci, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Larocque, Denis] Gerad, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Normandin, M (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Econ, 3000 Chemin Cote Ste Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",denis.larocque@hec.ca; genevieve.lincourt@hec.ca; michel.normandin@hec.ca,,,,,,,24,10,10,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This paper considers whether there are lessons to be learned from more than six decades of international cooperation on trade through the GATT/WTO. It argues that in comparison to trade cooperation, the climate change negotiations are taking place against a background of great uncertainty, a long gap in time between actions and results, significant distributional issues, basic differences among parties in terms of the appropriate balance of national responsibilities for action, and sharp differences over policy approaches. All these factors make the negotiations more complex and less likely to result in the kind of detailed policy commitments that characterize the GATT/WTO. Nevertheless, the paper argues that excessive imprecision or reliance or voluntarism at the national level will result in insufficient effort to address the challenges of climate change. A universal agreement with differentiated but clear obligations, a phased approach to the assumption of these obligations, and creative flexibilities offer the best chance of success.","[Low, Patrick; Murina, Marina] World Trade Org, Ctr William Rappard, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Low, P (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Ctr William Rappard, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",Patrick.Low@wto.org,,,,,,,48,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We find that transfer program expenditures in total rose from 1984 to 2004, but the increase was spread unevenly across different demographic groups and income classes. Very poor elderly, disabled, and childless families received greatly increased expenditures, mostly arising from Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, SSI, and the health programs. Very poor single-parent and two-parent households experienced declines in expenditures, driven largely by lower recipiency rates, benefit receipt, or both in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children/TANF and Food Stamp programs. For example, AFDC/TANF participation for one-adult families with children and market income below 50% of the poverty line fell from 62% in 1984 to 24% in 2004. However, expenditures received by one- and two-parent households further up the income scale increased, largely because of expansions of the EITC. Thus there was a redistribution of income from the very poor to the near-poor and nonpoor for these one- and two-parent households, as well as an overall relative redistribution from them to the elderly, disabled, and childless.","[Moffitt, Robert] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,,,,,,,,,26,10,10,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0892-8649,,978-0-226-07673-7,TAX POL EC,,,2010,24.0,,,,,,111,152,,10.1086/649830,0.0,,,42,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BRC91,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282377300005,0

Third, the study also examines differences in cross-country trends that characterize developed countries, including aging of the population, increased tourism, higher unemployment rates and increased consumption of wine. The Mediterranean wine-drinking countries are shown to be categorically distinct from the beer-drinking countries and Nordic spirits-drinking countries. Fourth, the study examines the panel data for unit roots and employs model specifications that correct for nonstationary data.

The use of bank credit can affect firm growth in two opposite ways. The effect may be positive if credit allows a firm to address its liquidity constraint and increase investment and profitability. However, if macroeconomic shocks such as unexpected increases in interest rates make firm debts unsustainable, as experienced in Kenya in the 1990s, indebted firms may shrink or even collapse. Using microeconomic data on the Kenyan manufacturing sector, this study finds that conditional on survival, the firms that use credit grow faster than those not using it. There is also evidence that small firms grow faster than large ones, confirming the convergence hypothesis. These results are robust to alternative estimation procedures controlling for both endogeneity and selection bias.","UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Nkurunziza, JD (通讯作者)，UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland.",janvier.nkurunziza@unctad.org,,,,,,,58,17,17,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

To consider the robustness of these results, we use an encompassing model, the Gegenbauer AutoRegressive Moving Average (GARMA) model, which nests as special cases the existing linear methods. The GARMA model accommodates a complete notion of persistence and allows shocks to dissipate slowly in a cyclical manner. We find evidence supporting a weak version of purchasing power parity, where equilibrium errors are long memory with strongly persistent cycles. However, this new form of cyclical mean reversion is likely too slow to be economically meaningful. The inability to find a strong equilibrium attractor process, using a very general encompassing linear methodology provides support for the recent models that allow for a nonlinear attraction process and for shifting real exchange rate equilibria.","[Norrbin, Stefan C.] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Smallwood, Aaron D.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Norrbin, SC (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",snorrbin@garnet.acns.fsu.edu,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Magnitudes of differences depend on the permanence of legal status, with naturalized citizens and green card holders benefiting more from their legal status than those with other forms of work authorization. Results suggest that a new program granting amnesty to undocumented immigrant farmworkers, reminiscent of the Seasonal Agricultural Worker program under the Immigration Reform and Control Act, would have minimal effects on farmworker outcomes especially in the short term, and that if employers pass labor cost increases to consumers via food prices, effects on consumers would be similarly minimal.","Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Pena, AA (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",anita.pena@colostate.edu,,,,,,,16,20,22,1,18,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

With costly deferments, the tradeoff between conscription and a volunteer military involves the cost of deferments with the former and the higher deadweight cost of taxation with the latter. Among the results are: 1) conscription is socially preferable to a volunteer military only if a large percentage of eligible individuals is demanded by the military; 2) if conscription is used when it is socially cheaper than a volunteer military, welfare is improved if deferments have lower social benefits; and 3) ignoring other costs of conscription (e.g., higher turnover and reduced investment in human capital), the U.S. in World War II may have been near the point at which conscription and a volunteer military were of equal social cost.","Appalachian State Univ, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Perri, T (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",perritj@gmail.com,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,51,2,2,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Harsanyi, R. Selten, A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA and London, 1988] risk-dominance to multi-player, multi-action games. There are three reasons why generalized risk-dominance (GR-dominance) is interesting. Extending the logic of risk-dominance, GR-dominant actions can be interpreted as best responses to conjectures that satisfy a certain type of symmetry. Second, in a local interaction game of [G. Ellison, Learning, local interaction, and coordination. Econometrica 61 (5) (1993) 1047], if an action is risk-dominant in individual binary interactions with neighbors, it is also GR-dominant in the large game on a network. Finally, we show that GR-dominant actions are stochastically stable under a class of evolutionary dynamics. The last observation is a corollary to new abstract selection results that applies to a wide class of so-called asymmetric dynamics. In particular, I show that a (strictly) ordinal GR-dominant profile is (uniquely) stochastically stable under the approximate best-response dynamics of [M. Kandori, G.J. Mailath, R. Rob, Learning, mutation, and long run equilibria in games, Econometrica 61 (1) (1993) 29]. A (strictly) cardinal GR-dominant equilibrium is (uniquely) stochastically stable under a class of payoff-based dynamics that includes [L.E. Blume, The statistical-mechanics of strategic interaction, Games Econ. Behav. 5 (3) (1993) 387-424]. Among others, this leads to a generalization of a result from [G. Ellison, Basins of attraction, long-run stochastic stability, and the speed of step-by-step evolution, Rev. Econ. Stud. 67 (230) (2000) 17] on the 1/2-dominant evolutionary selection to all networks and the unique selection to all networks that satisfy a simple, sufficient condition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

With capital investments highly concentrated by province and sector, geographic labor mobility may be critical in spreading the gains from growth. Conversely, rising income inequality may be attributable in part to impediments to migration. We first use census data to investigate migration patterns and determinants. We then examine the role of migration as an influence on income ratios between pairs of provinces. The former analysis robustly confirms economic motives for migration but also suggests the existence of poverty-related labor immobility at the provincial level. Examination of income ratios between pairs of provinces reveals that the impact of migration on inequality can be either negative or positive. A robust inequality-reducing impact of migration is found for migration flows into provinces where most of Vietnam's trade-oriented industrial investments are located. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the analysis of the potential benefits, bearing in mind the intermodal competition, is usually neglected. This paper analyzes the potential competition of the high speed train (HST) with the main competing modes on the Madrid-Barcelona route, where a new HST infrastructure has been recently built. The analysis is based on the estimation of disaggregated Nested Logit models using information provided by travellers in the main corridors: Madrid-Zaragoza and Madrid-Barcelona. The utility specification considers the effect of the main level-of-service attributes as well as some latent variables on modal choice. We analyze demand response to various policy scenarios that consider the potential competition between HST and other modes as well as the willingness to pay for improved levels of service. The results highlight the low level of competition that the HST could exert over air transport services in Madrid-Barcelona corridor, showing that policy makers may have been very optimistic about the figures of traffic diversion from air that could be attained.","[Roman, Concepcion; Espino, Raquel; Carlos Martin, Juan] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, GC, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Román, C (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, GC, Spain.",croman@daea.ulpgc.es; respino@daea.ulpgc.es; jcmartin@daea.ulpgc.es,"Román, Concepción/I-5632-2018; Espino, Raquel/HPE-1283-2023; Martin, Juan Carlos/F-6473-2014","Román, Concepción/0000-0002-0591-1298; Espino, Raquel/0000-0002-4138-5846; Martin, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-2950-2405",Spanish Ministry of Transport under its Programa de Ayudas a la Investigacion 2002 en el area de Transporte,Spanish Ministry of Transport under its Programa de Ayudas a la Investigacion 2002 en el area de Transporte,"The authors wish to thank the financial support obtained from the the Spanish Ministry of Transport under its Programa de Ayudas a la Investigacion 2002 en el area de Transporte.

Of those in the mostly-spend category, the response was swift, with over 80% reporting increasing their spending within 3 months of receiving their rebate. Older households, households with higher wealth and higher income, and those expecting future income growth were generally more likely to spend the rebates. A review of other surveys confirms the general pattern of results and suggests that small changes in survey design do not have a major effect on the distribution of responses. The distribution of survey answers corresponds to an aggregate marginal propensity to consume (MPC) after 1 year of about one-third. The paper combines this survey-based estimate of the MPC and the survey-based estimate of the timing of spending to show that the rebates help explain the aggregate movements in saving, spending, and debt in 2008. Because the rebate was large and was distributed over a short period, it had a nontrivial effect on total spending in the second and third quarters of 2008.

Managing for quality is now one of the major issues for educational organizations. One of the key tasks for education managers is to provide the learning process participants with an effective and motivating educational environment. Management of the educational environment presupposes giving a particular attention to students' needs and requirements in order to improve educational practice and enhance educational quality. Among other things having their impact on the educational environment effectiveness is to what extent it motivates students for further studies. In this context, we regard student motivation as an essential factor for the educational environment quality improvement. This paper considers some quality management procedures that can be used by education managers to provide qualitative changes in the educational environment. To improve the quality of the educational environment we may use several management tools, regular educational environment evaluation being one of them.

Employing data for US state-level exports to the 75 trading partners for which measures of cultural distance can be constructed, we find that greater cultural differences between the United States and a trading partner reduces state-level exports to that country. This result holds for aggregate exports, cultural and noncultural products exports as well, but with significantly different magnitudes.

To examine the robustness and plausibility of the two estimates, we compared the estimate results in both the periods. For constructing the equivalence scales, the costs of children and additional adults are estimated. Further, in order to investigate the most plausible equivalence scales for measuring poverty, the following two methods are employed for the estimations: Engel's food share method (Engel method) and the subjective economic well-being method (SW method). The estimation results show that the equivalence scales for a child, obtained from the Engel and SW methods, could be similar; however, the results for an additional adult are very different. It reveals that poverty evaluation is highly underestimated when the SW method is used. In conclusion, although the Engel method has a theoretical flaw, it might be more plausible than the SW method in the context of poverty evaluation for transitional Russia.","Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Takeda, Y (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjyuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",y.takeda@aoni.waseda.jp,,,,,,,12,3,6,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

I explore the decision of charitable foundations to place material restrictions on grants to nonprofits. Foundations often place constraints on grant use to limit cross-subsidy of projects or ex-post opportunism by nonprofit managers. In contrast, nonprofits prefer fewer restrictions to smooth income across revenue streams or compensate for shifts in demand. The paper utilizes a pseudo panel of 6000 grant contracts to examine the relationship between the various costs of those restrictions and the observed characteristics of grant contracts. Empirical results confirm received theory that high contracting costs will reduce the probability of grant restrictions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Regime changes in the underlying monetary framework, i.e. realignment crises in the European Monetary System, the Maastricht treaty and, eventually, the introduction of European Monetary Union, are reflected in a deterioration of the model's explanatory power.","Univ Bonn, Inst Int Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Int Econ, Lennestr 37, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",tillmann@iiw.uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It is however possible that these elasticities may differ among various socio-economic groups. At the same time, parametric gasoline demand models may not be flexible enough to capture the changes in price elasticities with different levels of income. This paper models US gasoline demand using more flexible semiparametric techniques. accommodating the possibility of differences in responses among households. The econometric model employs a non-parametric bivariate smoothing for price and income and a parametric representation of other explanatory variables. Possible heterogeneity in price and income elasticities is modelled through interacting price and income with demographic variables. Results show that price responses do vary with demographic variables such as income, multiple vehicle holding, presence of multiple wage earners or rural or urban residential locations. Households' responses to a price change decrease with higher income. Multiple vehicle and multiple earner households also show higher sensitivity to a price change. Households located in urban areas reduce consumption more than those in rural areas in response to an increase in price. Comparison of the flexible semiparametric model with a parametric translog model, however, reveals no significant differences between results, and the parametric models have the advantage of lower Computational requirements and better interpretability.

The structure of the new long-term W8D model for Poland is presented. Being a complete model, it covers the blocks of equations explaining final demand and the production process as well as financial flows. The equations explain both the long-term relationships and the dynamic adjustments using ECM. The model is of medium-size, including 235 equations, of which Ill are stochastic. They are mostly non-linear, dynamic and compose a simulations system. The consumption and investment function estimates are shown. The paper discusses the notions of extended production function and total factor productivity (TFP). The TFP represents the impacts of new technologies being endogenized, as well as human capital. The discussion covers the measurement issues and explanation of the role of domestic and foreign R&D expenditures, as well as educational expenditures. The price and wages equations as well as incomes explaining the expenditures close the model. The discussion is extended to include proposals to construct new submodels explaining the sectors of research and education and also the ICT industries, as well as the ecological issues.","Univ Lodz, Inst Econometr, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Welfe, W (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Inst Econometr, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,6,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The model generalizes Jovanovic (1979) to the case of heterogeneous workers and firms. Equilibrium wage dispersion arises due to productivity differences between workers, technological differences between firms, and heterogeneity in beliefs about match quality. Under a simple CRS technology, the equilibrium wage is additively separable in worker-and firm-specific components as well as in the posterior mean of beliefs about match quality. This parallels the person and firm effects empirical specification of Abowd et al (1999) and others. The model predicts a negative correlation between estimated person and firm effects, which is consistent with most previous empirical evidence. I estimate the equilibrium wage function and test the model's empirical predictions using linked employer-employee data from the U.S. Census Bureau. I find empirical support for many of the model's predictions and estimate that dispersion in beliefs about match quality explains over 20 percent of observed earnings variation.","Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Woodcock, SD (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",swoodcoc@sfu.ca,,"Woodcock, Simon/0000-0002-6157-1646",,,,,62,5,7,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.
