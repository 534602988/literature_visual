The study was carried out with 71 forest cooperatives in the Kastamonu province, located in the Western Black Sea Region. By using a principal component analysis it was found that the most important factors affecting forest cooperative's participation in forestry are: (1) member involvement, (2) forest ownership and administration, and (3) harmony within cooperatives and between cooperatives and the state. These three factors explained 59% of participation within a cooperative. Regression analyses indicate that active members, sufficiency of work, use of published material, and the availability of capital and credit are important variables to explain variations in participation. A game theoretic model indicates a positive link between a cooperative's wood production (payoff) and levels of participation as derived from the principal component analysis, indicating that a productive forest goes hand in hand with high levels of forest cooperative's participation in forestry.

Under the standard territoriality principle, products imported from countries outside of a RTA territory will be treated as non-originating. A rigid application of the rules can lead to a denial of origin for products even if considerable portions originate from the RTA country or even if they are substantially transformed within the RTA country. This pressures manufacturers to move production locations away from countries that are not parties to a RTA. The flow of trade and investment face distortions and ultimately the economic interests of non-RTA countries can be thwarted. Due to their economic vulnerability, developing countries will bear a considerable burden of such shifts in production. In this paper, we show how outward processing provisions in several recently adopted RTAs can serve as a means to overcome the problems that arise out of strict application of the territoriality principle and thus help developing countries.","[Kim, Joongi] Yonsei Univ, Coll Law, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,,jbkim@kdischool.ac.kr; kimjg@yonsei.kr,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Accurate determination of tree count and canopy volume can aid growers in planning some orchard operations and estimating yield. The analytical capability of Feature Analyst (FA) to count trees enables the user to quantify the trees in a given area. Eight sample sets of ortho and oblique images were selected from Pictometry aerial imagery software (Pictometry International Corp, 100 Town Center Drive, Suite A, Rochester, NY, 14623) by entering the coordinates of the required area of interest. The images thus obtained were exported to Arc Map in ortho and oblique views. The same training samples randomly selected from the study area in the ortho view were also used for the oblique image in FA to validate/determine the number of trees. The image was represented by a shape file, and an attribute query denoted the quantity of trees. After processing with FA, the majority of the machine counts were below the actual value. Three of the eight ortho images represented over counts, while five represented under count with a total range of -16 to +23%, with a mean error of 8.67%. All the eight oblique images represented under counts with an error range of 0.26 to 27.82% with a mean error of 9.94%. Thus, Oblique images had an error range of 27.56%, while orthogonal images have an error range of 39%, but overall the average error was less for ortho images. An estimate was made of tree height using oblique images in Pictometry. The errors were partially due to the ambiguity in selecting each tree's base and apex. Assuming there may be 0.15 m error due to resolution in ground area covered and tree height centering contributed an 11% error, overall precision in tree canopy volume measurement was still 85%.","[Ayyalasomayajula, B.; Ehsani, R.; Albrigo, L.

The Dispute Settlement Panel and the Appellate Body (AB) essentially upheld the position advocated by the EC, with one exception that is of no practical import, as the EC had already modified its regime. While the AB followed prior case law, it added two new findings. First, the WTO-consistency of laws can be challenged under Art. X GATT if they concern the implementation or application of laws concerning customs administration and enforcement. Second, the obligation included in Art. X.3(b) GATT to establish tribunals or procedures to review and correct administrative actions relating to customs matters concerns courts of first instance only.

The core issue in both the disputes involves the US Department of Commerce's practice of zeroing. The scope of the claims in both cases was considerably broader than in the previous WTO disputes involving zeroing. The two arguments in Support of the practice were that (a) the practice of zeroing has been a standard administrative practice for many years and (b) the Antidumping Agreement does not clearly prohibit it and hence deference must be given to national authorities. While, the Appellate Body was arguably correct in prohibiting the use of zeroing under the main methods of Article 2.4.2 AD Agreement as welt as in various reviews, we consider that it overreached in considering zeroing to be in violation of Article 2.4 AD Agreement and possibly as inconsistent with Article 2.4.2, exceptional method. Finally, while the AB found zeroing in reviews violated Article 2.4.2 AD Agreement, we believe it would have been preferable for the AB to have limited its findings of inconsistency to Article 9.3 AD Agreement.","[Prusa, Thomas J.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Prusa, Thomas J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Prusa, TJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",,,,,,,,19,19,20,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2009,8.0,1,,,,,187,241,,10.1017/S1474745608004114,0.0,,,55,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,426GN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264696100012,0

It considers the role of kinship norms and the effect of labor force participation on married women's autonomy. The measure of autonomy is based on self-reported answers to an array of questions relating to decision-making authority in the household. They include own-clothing, child-related and personal autonomy, physical mobility, and economic autonomy. The analysis examines if variations in women's autonomy are due to the prevailing kinship norms related to marriage in the community. In keeping with the anthropological literature, the analysis finds that living in patrilocal communities reduces physical autonomy for married women, whereas living in uxorilocal communities improves personal and child-related decision-making autonomy. Estimation results show that labor force participation, higher educational attainment, and increases in household wealth all have positive effects on married women's autonomy in Indonesia.","[Rammohan, Anu] Univ Sydney, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Johar, Meliyanni] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Rammohan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Econ, Merewether Bldg,H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",A.Rammohan@econ.usyd.edu.au; m.johar@unsw.edu.au,,"Rammohan, Anu/0000-0002-9062-4508",,,,,47,34,49,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The establishment of food production systems using technology to maintain environmental preservation is very important. The assurance of good water quality and environmental protection are important problems to be solved. Efficient approaches to nutrient management should be developed to amend and protect water quality. For this reason, innovative techniques for production with low entropy by using non-thermal energy for ecosystemic agriculture have been investigated. Hydroponic culture nutrient solution systems can be considered environmental conservation cultivation techniques because they can utilize restricted water resources effectively. In this study, komatsuna (Brassica rapa L. nothovar) was cultivated hydroponically using a Quartz Porphyry (QP) treated nutrient solution. Quartz Porphyry with electrochemical energy was utilized in the fluidization treatment, which improved water quality, and the growth of komatsuna vegetable was improved by receiving a QP treated nutrient solution. Other chemicals and large power inputs were unnecessary, and the environmental loading was very small. Results showed that the absorption of total ions and water by komatsuna plants receiving QP treated nutrient solution were significantly greater compare to the control. Reduced solution viscosity and the raising of temperature were the important factors behind this improvement. The viscosity of nutrient solution was dependent on temperature, and by using QP treatment, the temperature of the nutrient solution increased (0.2 degrees C), and viscosity decreased, which might have caused easier absorption of nutrient ions by the plants, and ultimately, the increased growth of komatsuna plants. There was no significant relation between viscosity and concentration of nutrient solution. Therefore, this treatment method could be adapted as a technology for saving energy in plant production systems without detrimental effects on the environment.","[Yoshimura, T.; Azad, Md.

We found creative emergence and open-endedness of the practice in innovation teams serving as quintessentially embedded modalities and contingencies that supports the identification of opportunities for innovation as a potential outcome of scenario thinking. We also suggest a framework that specifies how specific team practices supporting scenario thinking (strategic conversation and human-material interactions, and reflexivity-in-practice) may operate in combination or serially, and which may lead in turn to the identification of opportunities for innovation.

We focus on the experiences in several infrastructure-bound sectors: spatial planning and transport, ports, and energy. We conclude that the ROA maturity levels of these different sectors are quite different, and we ascribe these differences to the political setting, the institutional setting and the organisational flexibility of the sectors and their stakeholders.

In this paper we present results from laboratory emissions markets designed to investigate enforcement and compliance when these markets allow permit banking. Banking is motivated by a decrease in the aggregate permit supply in the middle of multi-period trading sessions. Consistent with theoretical insights, our experiments suggest that high permit violation penalties have little deterrence value in dynamic emissions markets, and that the main challenge of enforcing these programs is to motivate truthful self-reports of emissions.

It is usually placed in the African savannah of the Pleistocene, long before our ancestors began to spread to other continents some fifty thousand years ago. Thus, later environments have not given rise to new traits through genetic evolution. This belief rests on two arguments: 1) such traits are complex and therefore evolve too slowly to have substantially changed over the past fifty thousand years; 2) because the same time frame has seen our species diversify into many environments, recent traits should tend to be environment-specific and hence population-specific, yet such specificity seems inconsistent with the high genetic overlap among human populations. Both arguments are weaker than they seem. New complex traits can arise over a relatively short time through additions, deletions, or modifications to existing complex traits, and genetic overlap can be considerable even between species that are morphologically, behaviorally, and physiologically distinct. There is thus no conceptual barrier to the existence of EEAs in post-Pleistocene times. Such a paradigm could shed light on such research topics as the visual word form area, reproductive strategy, predisposition to violence among young men, and personality traits. Eventually, a multi-EEA model may dominate evolutionary psychology, perhaps after an interim period of accommodation with the current model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We ask whether discriminatory liberalization of internal regulations under RTAs can fulfill the requirements of the GATT Article XXIV defense. In the presence of pre-existing RTAs with RTA national treatment clauses, the GATT Article XXIV defenses for violations of GATT Article I and GATT Article III resulting from preferential liberalization of internal regulations may not succeed because the 'necessity' requirement under the Turkey-Textiles Appellate Body test is not likely to be met. The necessity requirement would fail because the RTA party may adopt 'a reasonable alternative' of applying the measure non-discriminatorily to all WTO members.

The formalized discipline is less than five years old, but has already generated a plethora of research as well as extended our understanding of the evolved nature of the mind/brain. Here we briefly recapitulate the antecedents to an evolutionarily informed cognitive neuroscience, attempt to fit ECN into a broader evolutionary psychology framework that seeks to account for evolved adaptations to recurrent problems faced by our ancestors, and discuss the futures of this newly formed discipline by expounding on methodological techniques and theoretical accounts that may pervade our future. We believe, as the Nobel laureate Nikko Tinbergen has suggested, that a complete understanding of the evolved nature of behavior and cognition (i.e., evolved cognitive adaptations) can only come from investigations at both the proximate and ultimate levels and, thus here, we attempt to cast ECN as the proximate sister discipline to evolutionary psychology.

Oil price-augmented Phillips curves are estimated with linear and Markov regime-switching models. Markov regime-switching models reveal the asymmetric structure of oil pass-through and indicate the existence of two different regimes characterized as the high- and the low-inflation periods. We find evidence for asymmetric oil pass-through in the high- inflation regime for headline and food- and energy-excluded inflation measures. Our results suggest that Jarque-Bera core inflation is not affected by oil price variations under either inflationary environment. Hence, we suggest the Jarque-Bera indicator as an intermediate target in the analysis of the future trend of inflation.","[Catik, A. Nazif; Onder, A.

Based on these scenarios, the stakeholders formulated a vision for the city's preferred future. The vision is excellence in agro industry supported by qualified human resources.

This paper proposes an econometric approach to evaluate the CDM effect on sulfur dioxide emission reductions and assess its additionality indirectly. Our empirical model is applied to China's emissions at the prefecture level. We found that the CDM does not have a statistically significant effect in lowering sulfur dioxide emissions.

A consecutive sample (N = 251) of CHF patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were surveyed. Disease severity was proxied via a self-assessment scale, the EQ-VAS and the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI); however, validity was demonstrated only by the latter. Association and level of agreement between instruments in DASI-based severity groups were estimated with Pearson's r and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. Paired-samples t test was used to identify significant differences. In a linear regression model, the DASI was used as an anchor of disease severity to identify a potential crossover point between EQ-5D and SF-6D utilities. EQ-5D and SF-6D strongly correlated over the entire sample (r = 0.647, P < 0.001); however, their agreement was moderate (ICC = 0.484, P < 0.001). In the less severe DASI groups (i.e. higher functional capacity) EQ-5D was significantly higher than SF-6D (P < 0.001) and differences constituted minimally important differences (MIDs). Contrarily, in the more severe groups SF-6D was predominantly higher than EQ-5D. The regression model indicated a utility crossover point at 0.722 and predicted that individuals with a utility score less than this would score higher on the SF-6D than on the EQ-5D, and vice versa. The DASI score at crossover was calculated at 31.94. In subgroups of patients differing in CHF severity according to the DASI, mean EQ-5D and SF-6D indices differed significantly. Contrarily, in socio-demographic and clinical groups, these utility differences were not directly evident. According to the evidence, comparisons based on severity classification via a valid disease-specific external instrument may provide insight on instrument choice in cost-utility analyses.","[Kontodimopoulos, Nick; Argiriou, Michalis; Niakas, Dimitris] Hellen Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Patras 26222, Greece; [Argiriou, Michalis; Theakos, Nikolaos] Evangelismos Med Ctr, Dept Cardiac Surg 2, Athens, Greece",Hellenic Open University; Evangelismos Hospital,"Kontodimopoulos, N (通讯作者)，Hellen Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Bouboulinas 57, Patras 26222, Greece.",nkontodi@otenet.gr,,"Kontodimopoulos, Nick/0000-0003-4590-6634; Niakas, Dimitris/0000-0003-0528-755X",,,,,49,26,27,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Based on the conception of transdisciplinary research as a collaboration of academic as well as non-academic thought-styles, and based on the understanding of transdisciplinary research as research that develops a comprehensive, multi-perspective, common-good oriented and useful approach to a socially relevant issue, the question of progress is discussed for four view-points: (a) the people concerned about the issue are much less interested in the question of progress in transdisciplinary research than in a better handling of the real world problem; (b) members of a disciplinary, business, governmental or civil society's thought-style, who gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue through the transdisciplinary research process, are more interested in further elaborating the issue within their thought-style, than in general lessons on progress; (c) progress on the level of personal experience mainly means that members of academic or non-academic thought-styles realize that they are a member of a specific thought-style among others. Progress would be made by integrating this experience in general education and special training; (d) finally a lot of general lessons can be learned and elaborated as tools, cases studies and approaches form the perspective of a thought-style interested in how to understand and manage transdisciplinary research.

An element of the policy was the development of a commercial forestry and farm forestry culture. In this context, farm forestry was intended to provide the opportunity to integrate smaller-scale plantations into agricultural landscapes on private land. Against this background, a study was undertaken to analyse the socio-economic returns from farm forestry in a case study in south-east Australia. Financial information during 1993-2007 for livestock grazing and 8 ha of blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) was analysed to compare the profitability of farming and farm forestry. During this period, a full cycle of blue gum (14 years) to produce pulp logs was completed with a forestry company under a tree farming agreement. The blue gum was integrated with the livestock enterprise by planting the trees in belts that were mostly 10 rows or 30 m wide positioned 250-300 m apart and located strategically on productive agricultural land along land-class boundaries. For the blue gum farm forestry, the net present value to the farmer expressed in 1993 dollars was $1236/ha compared to $768/ha for livestock grazing during 1993-2007. The farmer reported they had successfully integrated farm forestry as a land-use, and that the farm forestry had provided important environmental benefits and social benefits. The farmer was committed to farm forestry being part of the diversified farming business into the future, with the management of a second crop of blue gum on the farm underway. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The need for more participative and inclusive decision making is due to the move from the technocratic nature of decision making towards more democratic processes, which is a result of the transformation of societies and situations as a result of various factors including globalisation, environmental concerns, more knowledge intensive work and lifestyle. The current paper addresses Future-oriented Technology Analyses (FTA) in the context of a better understanding of issues that ought to be considered by the FTA community so that it can support the quest for new forms of governance. The paper has been structured on the discussion of governance around three pillars: socio-cultural evolution, corporate industrial activity and government. Analysis of the relationship between governance and each of the three pillars poses a number of questions to the FTA community that reflect on the potential impacts of FTA activities in governance.

This article examines one such barrier, export restrictions, and how it impacts trade and global supply in selected strategic metals and minerals. The metals and minerals examined in the article are of particular interest for a number of reasons: they are generally geographically concentrated in a few countries, many are used in the production of high-technology goods in strategic sectors, and there are few substitutes for these raw materials given the present state of technology. For all these reasons, importing countries are dependent on a reliable supply of these raw materials. Export restrictions may be applied for a number of reasons: protection of the environment, preservation of natural resources, protection of downstream industries, or as a response to a number of different market imperfections. This article examines the motivations for using export restrictions and finds varying impacts on trade and global supply. In one case, the export restrictions put into place did not fulfil their objective of environmental protection. In another, the presence of export restrictions in one country put pressure on other exporters to apply restrictions, suggesting the potential for competitive policy practices in restricting exports. In a third case study, export restrictions were seen to impact investment decisions by potential suppliers worldwide by introducing an added element of risk in the industry. The impact of export restrictions on strategic metals and minerals is exacerbated in many cases because producing countries have a quasi-monopoly on supply. Since these metals and minerals are essential in the production of some high-technology products and are not easily replaceable in the medium term, industry participants in some importing countries are concerned about future access at sustainable prices.","[Korinek, Jane; Kim, Jeonghoi] OECD, Trade & Agr Directorate, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Korinek, J (通讯作者)，OECD, Trade & Agr Directorate, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,8,20,24,0,24,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Given their similarity in focus and substance, the global spread of private self-regulation in corporate governance is often attributed to the rise of institutional investors and seen as signalling a global convergence of standards among the traditionally divergent national corporate governance systems. Drawing on institutionalist approaches of Comparative Political Economy, we argue that national code developments are strongly shaped by national state-economy relationships, in particular by domestic 'key coalitions'. Comparing the emergence of corporate governance codes in the UK and Germany, our study reveals marked differences with respect to the formulation, substance and function of codes in national corporate governance. In the UK, the code largely reflects the demands of institutional investors for stricter standards.

This study analyses how local people make a living, focusing on the illegal collection of a forest's resources following its declaration as a Protected Area (PA). A household survey was conducted between October and December 2005, combining semi-structured individual household interviews and village level focus group discussions. Six sub-counties bordering the Rwenzori Mountain National Park in Uganda were chosen at random and two sample villages randomly selected from each. Through a participatory wealth ranking exercise, all the individual households in each sample village were assigned to one of three categories: rich, medium or poor. From this stratified list five individual households were randomly selected from each category for semi-structured interviews. Household livelihood outcomes were assessed and a fractional logit regression was used to estimate factors influencing dependency on forest income. Households with less access to assets exhibited greater dependence on forest resources. The average household was poor with a per adult equivalent unit income of 0.5 USD/day, with 18.6% of their income being derived from environmental resources. Based on income per adult equivalent unit, households were divided into poor and less poor. Both categories reported illegal collection of forest products. The poor households derived 32% of their environmental income and 12% of their total income from the park compared to the less poor at 18% and 4.5% respectively. The park resources reduced income inequality, as well as the incidence and depth of poverty by 2.8, 3.0, and 5.0 percentage points, respectively. Small reductions in the incidence of poverty suggest that forest resources may not be reliable as a pathway out of poverty, but the poverty depth measure shows that forest resources have a significant impact on helping to make the poor less poor. Under such circumstances, our observation is that increased law enforcement alone is unlikely to protect the park. Interventions that allow managed access to these resources in the short term, whilst creating operational opportunities outside the areas to cater for local peoples' rights and needs in the longer term may be more suitable.

Building on case studies that described complex environmental issues, we understood PNS actions to require a critical gaze at our disciplines and then a process for change. We used the idea of disrupting-or interrupting-the established ways of reading the literature and 'accepted stories' of what occurred. The interruption allowed the creation of a space in the academic discourse to question the interpretation- and discipline-based assumptions underpinning subject discussions. This opening of a place for questions about the various case study situations allowed students to act as extended peer communities and to acknowledge other stakeholders in to the discussion. The commonest interruptions were to recast the issue as part of a wider and more complex system, to acknowledge uncertainty and to consider the drivers and risks in scaling up and down within systems and sub-systems. We actively promoted interdisciplinarity and extending science as cornerstones to dissolving paradigms and to facilitating negotiation of innovative ways of 'seeing and knowing'.

How might the need to minimize the generation of such problems - and address them as effectively as possible when they emerge - help us think more clearly about the role that experts should play in environmental decision making? Using case material on industrial chlorine chemistry, this paper considers the limitations of the theory of post-normal science as a framework for identifying appropriate and inappropriate modes of scientific and technical expertise in environmental decision making. The analysis highlights the need for a model of sustainability expertise that (a) recognizes how prevailing frameworks of environmental decision making allow technologists to actively produce - and exploit - uncertainty and (b) normatively promotes development and deployment of expertise in ways that actively confront these tendencies while making environmental decision making more democratic.

For instance, the stronger the auditor reputation effect, the lower are the initial returns under a range-bound market, and the market momentum effect is stronger under a bullish market. In addition, the risk perception effect is stronger under a bearish market.

The basic claim is that consumer education needs to become empowering or emancipatory, and that this can be reached through emphasizing the futures aspect and skills concerning everyday futures work. The functions of traditional consumer education can be described as socializative, preventive and corrective. This is not enough in a rapidly changing world in which consumers face completely new challenges. Section 2 of this article studies changes focal to the individual consumer. In Section 3 I define the basic functions of a household as an economic unit, consumption and consumer education. In Section 41 continue the analysis of the functions of consumer education with the help of the neologism everyday futures work, which is grounded on the application of Joseph Nuttin's theory of action. I also argue that to fulfill an empowering function, consumer education has to emphasize the futures aspect. The core concept here is futures-will, which highlights the dynamic character of human action. In Section 5 I suggest relevant solutions for consumer education in relation to the challenges and functions of consumption described above as well as explain how the enhancing of everyday futures work skills could be applied in the framework of the cycle of human action. I conclude the article by discussing some recent topics in consumer education to show that consumer education thinking is in some measure - even if not often explicitly expressed - converging with futures education.

In this paper, we conceptually analyze corporate responsibility (CR) in forest-based industry by theoretically differentiating between three approaches driving CR: the trade-off hypothesis, the profit-maximizing corporate responsibility conjecture, and the corporate social impact hypothesis. We use a survey of existing studies to assess the current stage of CR adoption in forest-based industry and to form a basis for evaluating the wider importance of CR in business, as well as to formulate hypotheses for future research. In conclusion, companies covered in previous research in this study appear to have adopted CR activities mainly with the profit-maximizing assumption. As the continued growth of ethical markets and socially responsible investment (SRI) presents both a threat and an opportunity for forest industry companies, a lasting case for CR in business could only be made by embracing CR principles with radical changes in the fundamental values, policy principles and operational procedures through double-loop organizational learning.

Timor-Leste was chosen as a case study because of its contemporary policy significance to Australia and the considerable amount of resources that the Australian government has committed, both directly and indirectly, to its reconstruction. Outputs from the State of the Future Index (SOFI) are used to track some of the key variables that will be significant drivers of future change in Timor-Leste. Hence, Timor's progress at a national level can be monitored.

It argues that this image of genetic decision making, along with emerging socio-economic developmental traits in the West, will come under increasing pressure. This will generate the need for an up-scaled decision making complex, incorporating digital means and cognitive science in contexts increasingly outside of health care institutions. The handling of information, identity and decision making under changing and complex circumstances becomes central. Such developments raise concerns about, simultaneously, increasing surveillance, social inequality and exclusion, and emerging expert/lay relations.

Finding the right balance between economies of scale and responsiveness to local conditions requires an overarching manager's competence called emotional intelligence (E.I.). As the current global monetary imbalances and financial instability have created uncertainty for many workers, insurance companies offer them insurance, the form of risk management to hedge against the uncertain losses. In exchange for payment, insurance companies transfer the equitable risk of a loss. However, demanding customers and aggressive competition require a new sales approach for insurance services, which counts on agent's EI. The purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of the concept of intelligence and emotions and their impact on the workplace performance, specifically in the insurance industry. The primary objective of this research is to outline and test the relationship between El and work performance, particularly the relationship between investment in employees' education and improvement of their personal and professional competences. To meet stated primary objective, the approach used in this research is based on the 360 Degrees Feedback Reports and the statistical method of chi square testing. We hypothesized that investing in workers' education increases the efficiency in the workplace, though improvement of employee's personal and professional competences. The major results of this research lead to the conclusion that El intelligence can be a useful decisive factor for assessing non-managerial employees and managers in terms of development of their personal and professional competencies. The implication of this research is to support long-life learning about El and enable employees to develop their ability to perceive, identify, and manage emotion in the work environment.","[Kopecki, Dragan; Katavic, Ivica] VERN Univ Appl Sci, Trg bana Josipa Jelae 3-111, HR-10000] Zagreb, Croatia",,"Kopecki, D (通讯作者)，VERN Univ Appl Sci, Trg bana Josipa Jelae 3-111, HR-10000] Zagreb, Croatia.",dragan.kopecki@sb.t-com.hr; ivica.katavic@vern.h,"Katavic, Ivica/HGU-3249-2022",,,,,,29,0,0,0,7,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

That is why this study will answer the question, whether or not the government of the Slovak Republic realizes the need for the development of the knowledge economy, and what place this need has among its other priorities.","[Krajnakova, Emilia; Vojtovic, Sergej] TnUADT, Fac Social Econ Relat, Econ Fac TU Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia",,,emilia.krajnakova@tuke.sk,,,,,,,20,7,7,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-213-2183-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,147,156,,,,,,10,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BYZ55,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300799300017,0

Most of human reasoning is based on prototypes, framings and metaphors that are seldom explicit; although they can be forged, usually they are merely presupposed in everyday reasoning and debates. The background social imaginary offers explanations of how 'we' fit together, how things go on between us, the expectations we have of each other and outsiders, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie those expectations. We argue that although the 17th and 18th century scientific and social revolutions generated prototypes, metaphors, framings and related conceptions of time and space that pointed towards a global imaginary, there were deep-seated structural reasons for the 'nation' to become, at least temporarily, the central category of human existence and belonging. By the early 21st century, there are already widespread metaphors that envisage the human world as a whole from the 'global shopping mall' or 'global village' to the 'spaceship Earth'. Yet, compared to the rich poetics of national imaginaries, the proposed prototypes, metaphors and framings are often thin.

If so, straightforward public-good theory predicts that free-riding will reduce average involvement at larger schools. This study uses longitudinal data to follow families over time, as their children move from middle schools to high schools, thus netting out unobservable differences among families. Increases in school size result in significant reductions in parental involvement, although the magnitude of the effect is small. If parents experience a doubling in school size, they are 2 percentage points less likely to increase their contacts with the school, and 5 percentage points less likely to increase their volunteering. A continuous-treatment propensity-score method tests whether the results are driven by selection into treatment. The parental contact results are robust to this test, while the volunteer results are not. Also, there is some evidence that parents see their involvement as a substitute, rather than a complement, for perceived school quality. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Though these resources are generally not cost competitive with fossil fuels under current technology and market conditions, they are likely to generate numerous socioeconomic and environmental benefits to the entire nation. Since the positive externalities associated with wood-based bioenergy production are not fully accounted for in the market place, policy incentives could play an important role in its promotion in the future. Nonindustrial private forests (NIPFs) of the southern United States, representing a large percentage of timberlands in the nation, are often viewed as potential sources of woody biomass for future bioenergy production. It is therefore critical to understand landowners' policy preferences for promoting wood-based bioenergy. This study examines policy alternatives preferred by landowners for promoting wood-based bioenergy and utilizes binary logic models to identify the factors influencing these policy preferences. The results indicate that landowners in general prefer tax based policies over direct subsidy support. A significant relationship was observed between landowners' decision to support or not to support different policy instruments and their income, age, distance of residence from the forest, size of the forest owned, size of trees in the forests, forest management objectives, and previous experience of using government cost-share programs.

This symposium was designed to bring academic analysis together with voices representing low-paid workers. The community organisation Asian Women at Work, based in western and south western Sydney, believes that legislative reform will bring greater fairness at work only if it is accompanied by a concerted multilingual campaign to educate women of their legal rights at work, and their sources of redress. Employer education, union right of workplace entry, and an effective inspection regime are also crucial. The legislated minimum conditions in the National Employment Standards are seen as being set too low to offer real protection. Even if low-paid workers could access the new collective bargaining stream, the Individual Flexibility Arrangements that are mandatory in every collective agreement are likely simply to continue employers' power to dictate working arrangements. Whilst the Act improves the regulation of unfair dismissal, many migrant women will remain unprotected, because of small business exemptions.

Following the lifting of the restrictions in 1989 the immediate decrease in fertility was 30 percent. Women who spent most of their reproductive years under the restrictive regime experienced increases in life-cycle fertility of about 0.5 children. Less-educated women had bigger increases in fertility after policy implementation and larger fertility decreases following the lifting of restrictions. These findings suggest that access to abortion and birth control are significant determinants of fertility levels, particularly for less-educated women.","[Pop-Eleches, Cristian] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pop-Eleches, Cristian] Columbia Univ, SIPA, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Pop-Eleches, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420West,118th St,Rm 1022,IAB MC 3308, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cp2124@columbia.edu,,,,,,,35,22,28,0,16,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Tensions have been created because developed countries such as the United States insist that emerging economies such as China, India, and Brazil participate in sectoral negotiations and accept the final results of such negotiations. This demand has been persistently rejected by the emerging economies. This article analyses the impasse in the sectoral negotiations from the perspectives of the negotiating mandate and reciprocity in the results of the tariff reduction. It chooses the United States and China as samples for comparison and finds that insistence on the compulsory participation of developing members in sectoral negotiations is inconsistent with the mandate of 'non-mandatory' participation; and that the three US-led sectoral initiatives, that is, chemicals, industrial machinery, and electronics and electrical products, have led to deep additional tariff reductions, which are asymmetrical between developed and developing members. Due to a lack of reciprocity, these three sectoral initiatives have become part of the problem, instead of the solution, to the DDA NAMA negotiations. To solve the impasse, this article proposes some adjustment to the current sectoral initiatives to restore reciprocity and encourage the voluntary participation of developing members.",,,,fujingjie@mofcom.gov.cn,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper aims at describing forest land use changes during the last decades in Greece as well as analyzing the major regional and economic development implications. Particular attention is given to the analysis of possible driving forces with economic and social origin. The estimations are carried out through the use of a statistical model that employs ordinal regression analysis. Ordinal regression is a variation of ordinary regression which is used when the dependent variable is categorical and the explanatory variables are continuous, or categorical. An advantage of this type of regression is that requires fewer assumptions as regards the relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable.

In this contribution, however, we contend that while a traditional macroeconomic perspective goes some way towards explaining the nature of the employment relationship, it fails to acknowledge that commodification is a necessary but not sufficient condition for labour utilisation. Viewed through the lens of organisation theory, the main employer agenda regarding labour utilisation is that of 'human resource' objectification, rather than market commodification. We seek to demonstrate this by examining how, under contemporary 'human resource management' (HRM), labour management theory and practice have developed into a sophisticated project designed to psychologise the employee subject into a resource object.

This article starts with a discussion on the background for its establishment as well as the substantive and procedural requirements for investigations under TBI. In the next part, the article discusses how TBI has worked in practice by reviewing the Japan - Quantitative Restrictions on Laver case (hereinafter 'Japan-Laver case'), the only case that has ever been brought under the mechanism. Drawing from the lessons learnt from the Japan-Laver case, the article then offers suggestions on how the TBI might be improved in the future.

This paper examines and documents the way in which the structure of the Irish system is complicated when compared with other countries. Analysis is conducted in the context of the 'health basket' framework. A health basket describes which health care services, and which individuals, are covered by public funding, and to what extent. The Irish health basket is outlined along three dimensions of breadth, depth, and height, and compared with the health baskets of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Sweden and France. Results indicate that it is in the combination of breadth and height that distinguishes the Irish basket from others. The majority of Irish health care services are run on a cost sharing basis; user fees are higher than in other countries particularly in primary care; and the structure of entitlement restrictions are complex. It is difficult to identify other countries in which all these factors operate within one system. In addition, the way in which the Irish health basket is delivered in practice introduces further complexities into the breadth and height of coverage.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Smith, S (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",samantha.smith@esri.ie,,,,,,,26,22,22,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the Government of India in August 2002 and one of India's objectives in acceding to the Protocol was to fulfil the prerequisites for implementation of projects under the CDM in accordance with national sustainable priorities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of using large-scale forestry projects under the CDM in achieving its twin goals using Karnataka State as a case study. The Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process (GCOMAP) Model is used to observe the effect of varying carbon prices on the land available for A/R projects. The model is coupled with outputs from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to incorporate the impacts of temperature rise due to climate change under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2, A1B and B1. With rising temperatures and CO2, vegetation productivity is increased under A2 and A1B scenarios and reduced under B1. Results indicate that higher carbon price paths produce higher gains in carbon credits and accelerate the rate at which available land hits maximum capacity thus acting as either an incentive or disincentive for landowners to commit their lands to forestry mitigation projects.

It argues that although the use is well intentioned it draws its energy from the geophilosophical drive of the Western project. This project is imperialist in nature and bases its power on its ability to define. So although IF claims to be inclusive it actually establishes a self-referential dialogical relationship between itself and its interlocutor that privileges its position. This is clearly counter to the integral rhetoric of its most ardent exponents. It is argued that this imbalance is central to the entire Western philosophic project and is rooted in the geophilosophical gaze. Such a gaze is ultimately about assimilation not mutual discourse and should be set aside for more inclusive and less culturally aligned forms of cultural analysis such as Causal Layered Analysis which accounts for the primacy of context and local knowledge and finds agency in the working of those who constitute the multitude. Such work is process oriented and stands in real contrast to the definitional power (and terror) of the integral gaze. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of enclosure and efficient management of some resource pools on other open-access resource pools is poorly recognized. The problem is common to many congestion-prone facilities including roads, parks, fisheries, antibiotics, grazing lands and wilderness areas. In this paper, we analyze the optimality of price and quantity instruments in regulating resource use when there is uncertainty about congestion costs. Price instruments are found to be preferable to quantity instruments, and strictly so when demand is less than perfectly elastic. We also explore the effect of market power by resource owners on the relative efficiency of the two instruments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Especially important are the policy processes, where the effectiveness of the policy is determined by the commitment of the stakeholders to the selected policy. There are, however, different opinions as to what constitutes a successful participatory process. In this study, we analysed the stakeholder perspectives about proper participation process in Regional Forest Programme preparation in Finland using Q-methodology. We found four different perspectives: pragmatic consensus-seekers, reformers, expertise-oriented actors and participation sceptics. The pragmatists seek for consensus, but purely on traditional forestry issues. The reformers, on the other hand, wanted to introduce other aspects into the process and opposed the dominant position of the traditional forestry network in the RFP process. The expertise-oriented group was ready to discuss different aspects, but wanted to promote the power of experts. The sceptics wanted to allocate the minimum effort to participation. The results suggest that framing and organizing the process, reaching commitment, roles of different information, and the ways of taking into account the views of general public should be emphasized in future RFP's.

Adopting an issues management approach, we have discussed that understanding perceptions and expectations of various demographic segments about business performance along relevant social and environmental issues is a research gap in the broader field of CSR. This is particularly true for forest products industry in the US where there is very little research done in the field. For filling this gap, data was collected from the residents within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Results indicate that varying degrees of differences exist in different demographic categories (gender, education level, place of residence, and age). These results have important implications for the US forest products sector, especially as companies formulate their socio-environmental strategy and Communication. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed non-market benefits and opportunity costs associated with discontinuing timber harvesting in the PNAs using contingent valuation and wood supply modeling methods, respectively. The addition of 143,000ha of PNAs was estimated to provide non-market benefits of $58.63 per household per year, or $44 to $730 million in total present value terms over an 80-year horizon, depending on the assumed discount rates and restrictions imposed on benefits. Total present value costs over the same period were estimated to range from $37 to $289 million, depending on the assumed silvicultural budget and discount rate. Overall. we found that the net present value of the existing PNAs was positive for the majority of silvicultural budgets, discount rates, and benefit restrictions considered.

Therefore, institutional innovation should be actively performed, and the process of marketization should be promoted, thus the development of service sector will be accelerated. Furthermore, this paper discloses that the root leading to the low level of marketization is the irrational regulation policy.

Using rich data on tasks performed in occupations, we propose the concept of task-specific human capital to measure empirically the transferability of skills across occupations. Our results on occupational mobility and wages show that labor market skills are more portable than previously considered. We find that individuals move to occupations with similar task requirements and that the distance of moves declines with experience. We also show that task-specific human capital is an important source of individual wage growth, accounting for up to 52% of overall wage growth.","[Schoenberg, Uta] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gathmann, Christina] Univ Mannheim, CESifo, D-6800 Mannheim 1, Germany",University of London; University College London; Ifo Institut; University of Mannheim,"Schönberg, U (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",u.schoenberg@ucl.ac.uk,"Gathmann, Christina/AAA-3955-2020","Gathmann, Christina/0000-0002-9158-0375",,,,,52,267,328,5,61,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

The results show that using technical indices as neural network's inputs yields good performance in forecasting short-term prices, but this model cannot predict long-term prices well. To overcome this shortcoming we have exploited a fuzzy inference system based on analyzing the historical effects of macro economic variables on the stock markets' indices. Our forecasting models differ from the other ones in two main aspects: the first one is analyzing previous macroeconomics trends in order to build a Mamdani FIS and the second one is providing two different techniques for short-term and long-term predictions. These models allow decision makers to forecast prices by using minimum data and calculations. The good performance of the proposed model is confirmed by real stock market data.","[Shavandi, Hassan; Alizadeh, Parisa] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran",Sharif University of Technology,"Shavandi, H (通讯作者)，Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, POB 11155-9414, Tehran, Iran.",Shavandi@Sharif.edu,"Alizadeh, Parisa/AAW-9147-2020","Alizadeh, Parisa/0000-0002-8420-3838",,,,,34,6,6,3,38,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Results from the regression analysis suggest that providing a patent protection duration of twenty years positively impacts the R&D spending while providing patent protection for pharmaceuticals does not impact it.

J,"Dieter, M",,,,"Dieter, Matthias",,,Analysis of trade in illegally harvested timber: Accounting for trade via third party countries,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Illegally harvested timber; Timber trade; Input-output-analysis,,"The paper presents a model to analyse trade in illegally harvested timber with a particular focus on trade via third party countries. The model is deduced from the conventional input-output-analysis. In contrast to this type of analysis, inverse export coefficients are introduced to analyse the effect of a certain amount of country-specific supply, e.g., of illegally harvested timber, to the use of wood and wood products of all other countries, based on trade relationships. A database has been compiled especially for application of the model. It comprises data on industrial round-wood production in terms of industrial wood harvested and removed from the forest; recovered wood fibre in the form of recovered paper and waste wood; bilateral trade of 272 wood-based commodities in m(3) raw wood equivalent (rwe), and domestic use of those commodities. Two scenarios expressing high and low estimates of illegal harvesting for all countries have been employed in the model. The model reveals the trade linkages between all countries of the world and allows quantification of the global supply and use arising from illegal harvesting. Furthermore it allows calculation of the import of illegally harvested timber for each country of the world. And finally, the model likewise allows the quantification of domestic use of illegally harvested timber for each country of the world. The results show that international trade increases the global domestic supply of illegally harvested timber by more than 70% in each scenario. In particular industrial round-wood from Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar passes through many countries until it ends in form of finished wood products in the country of final destination. Not only due to suggested illegally harvested timber in the own country, but also due to strongly developed trade relationships, China holds the lead in total supply and use of illegally harvested timber. However this result must be seen against the background of the large population in China. This aspect also helps to explain the predominant position of China, Brazil and Russia with regard to the domestic use of illegally harvested timber. A comparison of import of illegally harvested timber on the basis of simple (covering only bilateral trade) and inverse export coefficients demonstrates the model's merit. The hitherto usually simple approach underestimates the real trade by a third up to a half. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Starting from the assumption of labor cost differentials in favor of the CEECs, the paper explores the CEECs' capacity and potential to supply outsourcable services to the EU-15. We analyze trends in trade flows and foreign direct investment in computer services and other business services. Although the available statistical data are deficient and excessively aggregated, the scattered evidence suggests that the CEECs are important suppliers of outsourcable services to the EU-15. Apart from labor cost differentials, other factors, such as the availability of skilled workforce as well as geographical and cultural proximity, might also contribute to EU-15 companies' preference for the CEECs when deciding on the location for international outsourcing of services. Increased specialization within the enlarged European Union could bring greater benefits from the international outsourcing of services, provided the European Union improves the functioning of labor markets and the competitiveness of the service sector, including the efficient implementation of the internal market for services.","[Rubalcaba, Luis] Univ Madrid, Madrid 3, Spain",,,metka.stare@guest.arnes.si; luis.rubalcaba@uah.es,"Rubalcaba, Luis/AAW-9204-2020; Rubalcaba, Luis/AAQ-8219-2020","Rubalcaba, Luis/0000-0001-5724-9091;",,,,,31,14,14,0,15,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Adaptive implementation strategies compensate for these obstacles by establishing strong networks and structural organizations in forest boundary communities.

The same phenomenon is also responsible for excessive investment in R&D and excessive outlays in rent-seeking contests. We propose a Partnership Solution to eliminate or at least mitigate these excesses. Each of N players joins a partnership in the first stage and chooses his effort in the second stage. Under the rules of a partnership, each member must pay his own cost of effort but receives an equal share of the partnership's revenue. The incentive to free-ride created by such partnerships turns out to be beneficial since it naturally offsets the excessive effort inherent in such problems. In our two-stage game, this institutional arrangement can, under specified circumstances, induce the social optimum in a subgame-perfect equilibrium: no one has a unilateral incentive (1) to switch to another partnership (or create a new partnership) in the first stage or (2) to deviate from socially optimal actions in the second stage. The game may have other subgame-perfect equilibria, but the one associated with the Partnership Solution is strictly preferred by every player. We also propose a modification of the first stage which generates a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium. Antitrust authorities should recognize that partnerships can have a less benign use.

While voluntary approaches are increasingly utilized as policy tools, the effectiveness of such programs is often questioned, and the impact of a voluntary program in tandem with a regulatory threat is not well understood. We examine the decision to participate in the SGP and, conditional on that decision, determine the effects that the SGP and regulatory threat had on facility emissions behavior. Participation in the program appears related to several forms of external pressure: the regulatory threat, industry trade association membership, the level of environmental giving in a state, and a number of neighborhood characteristics. However, over the entire study period, participation in the SGP yielded little, if any, additional reductions in emissions, while the regulatory threat is correlated with significant emission reductions by both participants and non-participants. Splitting our study period into two time periods reveals a more nuanced relationship between SGP participation and emissions behavior than is evident over the entire study period. While participants do not appear to take advantage of the program initially, they make greater strides in reducing emissions than non-participants in later years. The split sample results also indicate that both participants and non-participants react strongly to the initial threat of regulation and to an increase in its relative stringency.

Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a tool used by many governments to deliver such outcomes. With increased portable consumer battery consumption and greater dependence on portable technologies, EPR could be a way to achieve sustainable battery consumption. In the course of the discussion the article explores the nexus between trade and environment regimes. This is because the Australian market is largely supplied from overseas battery manufacturers. Given current trade flows in electronic waste these countries could also be the destination for battery wastes. The article considers whether Australia can navigate these two regimes in order to apply an EPR measure on portable consumer batteries. It examines the existing Australian hazardous waste framework and concludes with suggestions as to how the framework could be improved.","[Mani, Shawkat] Macquarie Univ, Dept Law, Div Law, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,,jennymbrown_au@yahoo.com; shawkat.alam@law.mq.edu.au,,"Alam, Shawkat/0000-0002-5351-2478",,,,,21,1,1,2,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Claims for a strong-form legal origin effect, which is time invariant and resistant to pressures for legal convergence, are not borne out by a growing body of historical evidence and time-series data.

Moreover, researchers have argued that delayed maternity is an important factor in reduced fertility. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), this paper contributes to the debate about maternity timing and reduced fertility in Germany by analyzing some of the factors determining the delay of motherhood. The results suggest that German women who have accumulated more years of education and longer work experience at the time of marriage delay motherhood more. On the other hand, women with higher labor income and a higher contribution to household income delay motherhood less. The results confirm that women consolidate their careers before motherhood in order to reduce career costs. Therefore, if fertility rates are to be increased in Germany further policies that aim to combine women's careers and motherhood need to be developed.","German Ctr Gerontol DZA, D-12101 Berlin, Germany",,"Gordo, LR (通讯作者)，German Ctr Gerontol DZA, Manfred von Richthofen Str 2, D-12101 Berlin, Germany.",laura.romeu-gordo@dza.de,"Romeu Gordo, Laura/AGP-4172-2022",,,,,,24,9,15,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This robot consists mainly of a roller pin conveyor, two machine vision systems, an NIR inspection system, a GPS, and a travelling device. One or two operators can operate this robot for harvesting, because the robot keeps a constant distance between operators and the robot by laser sensors as it travels. Harvested fruit are put into the roller pin conveyor through two gates, as information of growth in northern or southern canopy is added for the fruit canopy location. One vision machine inspects harvested fruit, while the other monitors tree leaf color and canopy size. An NIR inspection system measures internal sugar content and a GPS records robot location. It is possible to accumulate fruit color, size, shape, defect, sugar content, tree leaf color, and canopy size into a database corresponding to tree location. Adding to this robot's information, analysis of satellite images is conducted and field-server information is collected. The producers' operation records can be input to the database with the satellite and field-server information. This database is used both for farming guidance to conduct tree management and for food traceability in relationship to safety and security in food distribution.","[Kohno, Y.] Ehime Agr Expt Stn, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Nishi, T.] D Add Ninth Co Ltd, Okayama, Japan; [Kondo, N.; Taniwaki, S.] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Kurita, M.] SI Seiko Co Ltd, Dept Technol Dev, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Namba, K.] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Okayama, Japan",Ehime University; Okayama University,"Kohno, Y (通讯作者)，Ehime Agr Expt Stn, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,237,244,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100027,0

In northern Thailand mango is produced mainly in small to medium sized farms for the domestic market. 'Chok Anan' is an autochthonous variety of northern Thailand which is locally used for fresh consumption and small-scale processing. It is appreciated for its light to bright yellow color and its sweet taste. Most of the fruit development of on-season mango fruits takes place during the dry season. As mango trees are drought stress tolerant, production without supplementary irrigation is possible. However, where applied, irrigation ensures high yields and good fruit quality. As water is an increasingly scarce resource, water saving irrigation methods are being investigated with respect to their potential in increasing water use efficiency (WUE). So far, there are two methods of reduced irrigation for saving water in fruit production. One is regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) where a certain percentage of evapotranspiration (ET) is replaced by irrigation applied over the entire rootzone. The other is partial rootzone drying (PRD) where at each irrigation time only one side of the tree row is watered with the other side is left to dry, before being irrigated next. Stress responses of the plant's dry side are thought to reduce vegetative growth in favor of fruit growth and thus, increase WUE. Based on data from four years of field trials a yield response function to water availability for 'Chok Anan' mangoes was developed. Data about the fruit size distribution were recorded and graded according to locally used systems. The increase in farmers' income due to irrigation was estimated as a function of yield quantity and quality in terms of fruit size. The costs for different irrigation systems were calculated based on data from local sellers for surface, drip and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. Break even points and pay-back period for the installation costs were calculated. Maintenance of the irrigation system, water price and pumping costs were calculated as variable costs of irrigation. Three different scenarios in terms of water price and price of energy have been calculated in order to evaluate applicability of deficit irrigation strategies.","[Satienperakul, K.] Mae Jo Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Manochai, P.] Mae Jo Univ, Dept Horticulture, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Ongprasert, S.] Mae Jo Univ, Dept Soil Resources & Environm, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Spreer, W.; Mueller, J.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Engn, Stuttgart, Germany",Maejo University; Maejo University; Maejo University; University Hohenheim,"Satienperakul, K (通讯作者)，Mae Jo Univ, Fac Econ, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",,"Spreer, Wolfram/B-4000-2014; Spreer, Wolfram/HKN-6845-2023; Müller, Joachim/G-1279-2011","Spreer, Wolfram/0000-0001-5924-1560; Müller, Joachim/0000-0003-4623-5879",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was financed by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the collaborative research program Sustainable rural development in mountainous regions of Southeast,,29,4,5,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,293,300,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.831.34,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700034,0

The model employs various indicators to measure the gendered impacts, including income poverty (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke [FGT] Indices), time poverty (leisure), capability poverty (literacy and infant mortality), and welfare (Equivalent Variation [EV]). The simulation results show that revenue-neutral trade liberalization in Pakistan increased women's employment in unskilled jobs and increased women's real wage income more than men's for all types of labor, but kept the division of labor biased against women. The study finds that Pakistan's trade liberalization adversely affected women in relatively poor households by increasing their workload, deteriorating capabilities, and increasing relative income poverty.

This article examines whether the structure of merit pay affects the types of teachers who support it. We develop a model of the relative utility teachers receive from merit pay versus the current fixed schedule of raises. We show that if teachers are risk averse, teachers with higher base salaries would be more likely to support a merit pay program that allows them to keep their current base salary and risk only future salary increases. We test the predictions of the model using data from a new merit pay program, the Minnesota Q Comp program, which requires the approval of the teachers in each school district. Consistent with the model's predictions, we find that districts with higher base salaries and a higher proportion of teachers with master's degrees are more likely to approve merit pay.","[Wiswall, Matthew] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Nadler, Carl] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",New York University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wiswall, M (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",mwiswall@nyu.edu,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The Turkish case is particularly challenging since Turkey has one of the most volatile stock markets among emerging economies and the turnover ratio as a measure of liquidity is very high for the market. These facts can be considered to highlight the great risk and, therefore, the extra need for hedging in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE).

Individuals with brighter prospects for future schooling attainment may engage in less drug and alcohol use and risky sexual activity because they have more to lose if such behaviors have harmful effects in their lives. If teens correctly predict that higher college costs make future college enrollment less likely, then adolescents facing different expected costs may choose different levels of risky behavior. I find that lower college costs in teenagers' states of residence raise their subjective expectations regarding college attendance and deter teenage substance use and sexual partnership. Specifically, a $1,000 reduction in tuition and fees at 2-year colleges in a youth's state of residence (roughly a 50% difference at the mean) is associated with a decline in the number of sexual partners the youth had in the past year (by 26%), the number of days in the past month the youth smoked (by 14%), and the number of days in the past month the youth used marijuana (by 23%). These findings suggest that the often-studied correlation between schooling and health habits emerges in adolescence because teenagers with brighter college prospects curb their risky behavior in accordance with their expectations. The results also imply that policies that improve teenagers' educational prospects may be effective tools for reducing youthful involvement in such behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This creates exogenous variation in the availability of upper secondary schooling, which allows estimating the causal effect of education on health behaviors. Using the number of academic track schools in a state as an instrumental variable for years of schooling, we investigate the causal effect of schooling on health behavior such as smoking and related outcomes such as obesity. We find large and robust negative effects of education on smoking for women. These effects can mostly be attributed to reductions in starting rates rather than increases in quitting rates. We also find large negative effects of education on smoking for men. However, the precision of these is not robust to sample specification changes and results for men should thus be interpreted with caution. We find no causal effect of education on reduced overweight and obesity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we examine the impact of class size on student evaluations of instructor performance using a sample of approximately 1400 economics classes held at the University of Munich from Fall 1998 to Summer 2007. We offer confirmatory evidence for the recent finding of a large, highly significant, and nonlinear negative impact of class size on student evaluations of instructor effectiveness that is robust to the inclusion of course and instructor fixed effects. Beyond that, we run a survey based on the contingent valuation method and a representative sample of all Munich students of management science to quantify the welfare surplus of preferred class size. We find the average monetary value students ascribe to their preferred class size to lie between 5 and 300 Euros per semester and student. In an upper bound scenario, implied Hicksian surpluses can reach values of close to 500 Euros per semester and student.

Group marketing has often been cited as one way through which farmers can increase their access to markets by improving their negotiation/bargaining power and the competitiveness of their production as well as reduce transaction costs. However, these suppositions need to be verified especially as some of them are solely based on theory. This study uses data on producers' perceptions of expected benefits attainment through group sale initiatives to analyse the case of two NTFP producer groups in Cameroon. Results show that by joining groups, farmers can reduce some transaction costs while other costs may increase. Although overall negotiation power may increase following interventions from group activities, certain elements of negotiation are fundamental to success like bargaining better prices commensurate to efforts put in by members to meet quality standards set by traders. By using transaction cost theory, the study identifies certain elements hidden in the attributes of the transactions between producer groups and traders such as the nature of products and roads, or dispersed settlement of producers that may frustrate group market initiatives and may account for differences in performance between one group and another.

The use of forests as carbon sinks is increasingly recognized as a mitigation option. Emission trading frameworks throughout the world have emerged as the chosen means to manage emissions. This is also evident within the large area, high emission countries of Australia and the United States which both incorporate the use of forest sinks within existing or proposed emission trading frameworks. This paper evaluates and compares the frameworks in each country and reviews the corresponding literature to identify knowledge gaps that currently exist regarding forest sink development. While extensive work has been carried out to understand the potential contribution of forest sinks, little has been done in a uniform manner to clarify the likely uptake and implementation of forest sinks by forest owners. Using innovation theory to understand the interactions between the relevant actors and institutions influencing the development of carbon sinks and as a means to frame the required research, this paper highlights why knowledge of the intentions of the forest owner is integral to the success of forest sinks as a mitigation option. The Theory of Planned Behavior is suggested as a means of examining and understanding the intentions of forest owners to implement forest sinks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The first step is to look at the baseline model of tax competition on which most of the literature implicitly or explicitly builds. The key feature is that governments in a context of open borders will engage in wasteful competition for mobile economic assets and activities through tax reductions. The second step is to focus more closely on tax-induced cross-border mobility. Do tax payers actually shift assets and activities across borders in response to differences in taxation? The main message of the literature is that the scope for tax arbitrage depends crucially on the legal rules governing the taxation of cross-border activities and that the intensity of tax arbitrage varies greatly across different taxes. The final step is to analyze government reactions to tax arbitrage. Do they engage in competitive tax cutting as predicted by the baseline model? The literature discusses various strategies of tax competition and demonstrates that different governments use them to different degrees across different taxes. It also shows, however, that governments increasingly engage in tax cooperation to reign in tax arbitrage and competition. While off to a slow start in the 1960s, tax cooperation has gained momentum in recent years, especially after the financial crisis in 2008.","[Genschel, Philipp; Schwarz, Peter] Jacobs Univ Bremen, SHSS, Bremen, Germany",Jacobs University,"Genschel, P (通讯作者)，Jacobs Univ Bremen, SHSS, Bremen, Germany.",p.genschel@jacobs-university.de,,,,,,,102,146,152,6,100,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This paper looks at the way creativity itself is being transformed in the West, from the individualistic/atomistic view of Modernity towards a more contextual, collaborative, complex approach. It explores the potential and possibilities for this more participatory creativity to help go beyond the crisis of the future, and argues that the centrality of creativity must go beyond the mythology of genius and inspiration to inform philosophy, ethics, and action. Philosophical reflection and the imagination of desirable futures can emerge from a creative ethic that stresses the value of generative interactions and contexts that support creativity.

Our results provide evidence that migraine headache negatively impacts human capital accumulation.

To test previous results, I estimate a dose-response function after balancing on the generalized propensity score, a relatively novel approach for estimating the effect of continuous treatments.

More specifically, expert evaluations expressed in 2-tuples were summarized aggregated by employing 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging (TOWA) operator and thus a new method, namely MULTIMOORA-2T G, was offered. The method enables to summarize expert assessments when information about their significance is completely unknown. The numerical example successfully exhibited the possibilities for application of the MULTIMOORA-2T G method. In this particular case the committee consisting of five experts ranked the potential suppliers by applying the new method with respect to different criteria identifying the potential of the considered suppliers.

Agriculture was supported with heavily subsidised inputs, guaranteed markets and extension workers operating in each village. The removal of these support systems resulted in a significant decline in agricultural productivity, with a serious detrimental impact on food security. In the horticulture sector, the demand was met almost exclusively by overseas producers. Most fresh vegetables sold in Dili's supermarkets, hotels and restaurants came from Australia. Local farmers tended to produce indigenous varieties to meet household needs and to sell any surplus in the local market. A USAID funded program has encouraged more sustainable consumption practices in Dili providing an opportunity for smallholder farmers to increase production and to generate some income. Development Alternatives has been operating in Timor-Leste since 1999. In 2005, DAI initiated the Dezenvolve Setor Privadu (private sector development - DSP) program with the aim of facilitating the creation of a supply chain for fresh vegetables between smallholder producers and high-end consumers. This involved linking farmer groups to distributors and supermarkets. For this endeavour to be successful, all aspects of the supply chain through seed selection, growing, harvest, handling, transport, storage and distribution had to be addressed. A key element of this work has been the provision of extension services to farmers to help them meet the exacting standards of end users.","[Browne, M.

Data for 2007-8 support previous findings (in Canada and Austria) indicating that lesbians face hiring discrimination. The study finds that the estimated probability of lesbian applicants receiving an invitation for an interview is 27.7 percent lower than that for heterosexual women applicants. More importantly, the study shows that entry wage differentials assigned are inconsistent with the ascendant empirical claims (from the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) that lesbians have higher market earnings. The study concludes that the negative effect of lesbian sexual orientation on wage outcomes in Greece is 6.1 percent. Given that legal actions in Greece have the potential to affect sexual-orientation minorities, it is important to understand the relationships between sexual orientation and the labor market.","[Drydakis, Nick] Univ Patras, Lab Econ, GR-26110 Patras, Greece; [Drydakis, Nick] Univ Crete, Iraklion, Greece",University of Patras; University of Crete,"Drydakis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Lab Econ, GR-26110 Patras, Greece.",,"Drydakis, Nick/AAI-1102-2021","Drydakis, Nick/0000-0001-9827-6678",,,,,15,56,67,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Due to different forms of European cooperation, different systems of public and private law in European member states, decentralization policies, new tasks and forms of new public managements they are developing. They do not fit well in the traditional tools of governance as they are of very different institutional structure and might form a traditional public office or a public or mixed enterprise as an institutional public-private partnership (hereinafter PPP). We present many differing definitions used in literature, which we find not comprehensive. Therefore, we try to define quangos, and discuss in which forms they do appear in different countries of the European Union (EU) and how do they differ or equal already existing institutions. There we find that an already existing economic definition of a public economic unit can be applied to quangos. They are economic units producing services and goods in order to accomplish public goals and they are at least partly owned by a jurisdiction. They may occur in an independent form of law thus constituting an own juridical subject. On the other hand they may be a dependent part of the administrations of a jurisdiction, however differing from other economic units of the jurisdiction in such a way that they are own organizational bodies, possess allocated own resources and a scope of decision making for its management at least referring to marketing and production decisions. In literature many efforts are devoted to the question how their dependencies and scope of autonomy can be defined and measured These approaches use mostly statistical methods using different variables and factors that should show their degree of dependencies. Other ways are to discover legally dependencies and concentrating on strategies decisions which are under the governance of the quango management. Many old controversies with respect to owner and public enterprise relations are repeated, which deal with principal agent relations. Therefore we suggest applying a simple theory of public office management, where the public office is an economic unit and public enterprise theory. Our discussions show that there are not so many new findings possible, but the discussion about these forms of institutions opens insights into appropriate organization building under different legal systems, systems of government and cooperation we find in the EU. Especially the need for appropriate theoretical models to discuss quango behaviour becomes stressed and approaches to quango theory get suggested.","[Friedrich, Peter; Ukrainski, Kadri] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 4-A213 Narva Rd, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Friedrich, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 4-A213 Narva Rd, EE-51009 Tartu, Estonia.",Peter.Friedrich@mtk.ut.ee; Kadri.Ukrainski@mtk.ut.ee,"Ukrainski, Kadri/ABA-5968-2020",,Estonian Science Foundation's [8580]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [0180037s08],"Estonian Science Foundation's; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)",Authors acknowledge the support of the Estonian Science Foundation's Grant No. 8580 and target financing of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research No. 0180037s08.,,60,0,0,0,8,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

This result is easy to show with indifference curves, but many instructors of introductory courses do not introduce this analytical technique. As a consequence, a result that many students find quite interesting is seldom presented.

For the 178 farmers who participated in the survey, most respondents believed that a quality assurance system would lead to better internal traceability, an improved awareness of food safety and reduce the risk of contamination. The main barriers towards the implementation of a quality assurance system were the increased amount of paperwork and the bureaucracy, the lack of any financial incentive, their ability to sell their grain without a quality assurance system, the lack of time, the high annual cost of certification, the high cost of implementation, and the belief that their customers did not require a quality assurance system.","[Liu, A.] Nanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Liu, A (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,"LIU, AIJUN/Y-4014-2019",,,,,,20,2,2,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-89-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,895.0,,,,,,159,166,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR09,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323845300020,0

Field investigations were undertaken in late 2006 - early 2007 and again in 2008. One commune in each zone had good road infrastructure and associated market access, while the other had poor road access and was more distant from the market. Two rural households were selected from poor, medium and high wealth categories in each commune, providing 36 case households. Sixteen of the 36 case households were undertaking some form of value adding through processing or marketing of crops or livestock. Improved production technologies for basic food crops that underpin food security led to the release of production resources which were then allocated to commercial crops. Entrepreneurial households typically reached out towards markets to first sell their own produce and then began trading the outputs of, and in some cases selling inputs to, fellow households, while still retaining their own production activities. These households often gained first mover status through a special skill set, but then had to provide either lower cost or additional services such as credit to protect their competitive advantage. Successful traders typically required access to working capital, some form of transport, access to market information and trading networks. Input supply chains tended to develop in parallel to, but more slowly than output supply chains. Factors influencing supply chain development included road access and telecommunications, plus commodity-specific factors. Rice supply chains were impacted by non-market institutional factors. In the mountain communes, there were particular issues relating to poverty, ethnic minorities, environmental sustainability, land tenure and physical distance from markets.","[Quan, T.

The vast majority of economic literature on license buyback programs focuses on the changes to economic efficiency of the fleet, often citing changes to the composition of fleet size. However, managers have little guidance in deciding how to structure a buyback auction, despite the fact that the auction structure plays a key role in determining which licenses are retired and in the composition of the remaining fleet. With the Texas Park and Wildlife Department's Inshore Shrimp License Buyback Program as a basis for auction design, this research uses three experimental treatments to analyze how individuals respond to various reverse auction structures. In terms of the quickest license expiration, our experiments suggest that fisheries managers should select a binding auction with no sequential quality. However, we find that managers would see higher average bids from fishers in comparison to the two sequential auctions. The results are also relevant to other environmental programs in which environmental services are purchased over time in a sequential reverse auction.","[Freeman, Matthew A.] Louisiana State Univ AgCtr, Dept Agr Econ, 101 Agr Adm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Freeman, Matthew A.] Louisiana Sea Grant, 101 Agr Adm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Woodward, Richard T.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Freeman, MA (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ AgCtr, Dept Agr Econ, 101 Agr Adm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.;Freeman, MA (通讯作者)，Louisiana Sea Grant, 101 Agr Adm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mfreeman@lsu.edu; r-woodward@tamu.edu,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Fisheries Initiative grant [NA04NMF4330080]; Texas AgriLife Research; Cooperative State Research, Education & Extension Service, Hatch Project [TEX8604]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Fisheries Initiative grant; Texas AgriLife Research; Cooperative State Research, Education & Extension Service, Hatch Project","We gratefully acknowledge the support for this research provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Fisheries Initiative grant #NA04NMF4330080.

In this article we start from the assumption that for a better understanding of the future ethical implications of genetic susceptibility screening we need to address the interaction between technological and moral developments in society. We introduce a techno-ethical scenario approach and show how it may help us to explore more systematically potential future interactions between technological and moral developments in the field of genetic susceptibility screening. The first step is a historical account of population screening, focussing on the ways in which emerging practices of (genetic) screening have been mediated by an evolving moral landscape in our society. Based on this history we present a techno-ethical scenario of the future, showing how technological developments may shape conditions in our society in which the introduction and use of genetic susceptibility tests more and more become a matter of private decisions, reinforcing claims to individual self-determination as a deeply rooted value in the moral landscape of our society.

Systematic analysis of results shows a pattern of differences between economically oriented institutions and those entrusted with providing basic services to the general population. Consistent differences in institutional quality also emerge across countries, despite similar levels of economic development. Implications of the results for theory and for methodological practices of future studies in this field are discussed.","[Portes, Alejandro; Smith, Lori D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Portes, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",port44@princeton.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD047879] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,83,11,11,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We find that volatility is time-varying in all countries, which indicates substantial variation in the degree of risk across time. However, we do not find empirical support that this time-varying volatility significantly explains expected returns, except in the case of Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and the MENA region portfolio. Our findings show that stock return volatility is negatively correlated with stock returns in these three markets under the assumption of investor risk aversion.

All firms improved many practices in forest management, environmental protection, community relations, public affairs, economic, and environmental management systems in order to receive certification, with an average of 27 changes reported per firm that received forest certification. The amount of changes were fairly evenly distributed among forest management practices, social and legal aspects, and economic and system impacts. Most firms certified by FSC received several conditions or corrective action requests, but these represented only about one-third of the 27 changes those firms made to receive or maintain certification. Certification appeared to prompt similar changes in Argentina and Chile, and with FSC and CERTFOR. Certified firms usually hired only one or two new employees for certification, but did shift job responsibilities so that about 5% to 10% of personnel time was spent on certification. Individuals at interviewed firms were generally very satisfied with certification and all firms except one intended to re-certify. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In response to this challenge, this paper unifies the Leitbild concept with a spatial explicit planning procedure and introduces a case study application for describing and classifying landscape visions based on a transdisciplinary, holistic concept. The general assessment system of planning a vision is adapted to the natural, cultural, political and economic conditions of the given case study area in the Federal States Upper Austria and Salzburg (Austria). The assessment system includes exercises that identify the assets of the planning procedure and encourage stakeholders, scientist and local people to collaborate in planning and implementation processes.

In Louisiana, substantial reductions in segregation between 1965 and 1970 were accompanied by large increases in per-pupil funding, which allowed funding in integrated schools to be leveled up to the level previously experienced only in white schools. Desegregation also brought increased exposure of blacks to whites. Analysis of new data on levels of segregation, resources and educational attainment from 1960-75 suggests that the increase in funding associated with desegregation improved educational attainment for blacks. A 42 percent increase in funding led to a 15 percent increase in high school graduation rates, and the estimated present value of the additional education exceeded the additional cost.","[Reber, Sarah J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Publ Affairs, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Reber, Sarah J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Reber, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Publ Affairs, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",sreber@ucla.edu,,,,,,,25,55,79,0,15,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

We show that a previous discussion in the literature rests on a problematic estimation of the relative scale factor. The implications are illustrated with data from Cummings et al.

Moreover, we propose a concrete methodology for how to analyze cases where it is difficult, or even impossible, to estimate the relative scale factor due to informational limitations, such as when there is no variation of the bid. We conclude that it is valuable to be able to separate behavioral differences into variance differences and parameter differences in the underlying objective function.

Some have argued that lender subsidy cuts would reduce loan supply or cause lenders to exit the student loan market. If lenders get economic rents due to overly generous subsidies, a simple model of the student loan market suggests that small changes in subsidy levels should not affect loan supply. Empirical results based on a variety of generalized method of moments panel estimators suggest that evidence of links between higher special allowance payment margins and higher loan volumes is weak or inconclusive for both the 1988-94 and 1996-2006 periods. Subsidy reductions, according to this analysis, had no discernable effect on student loan volumes. Results also suggest that higher real borrower interest rates reduce student loan volumes for public colleges and universities. Changes in the federal student loan program in the wake of the credit crunch that began in August 2007 are briefly discussed, along with current proposals to shift all new loans to a direct lending program.","Congress Res Serv, Washington, DC 20540 USA",,"Austin, DA (通讯作者)，Congress Res Serv, 101 Independence Ave SE, Washington, DC 20540 USA.",austin.andrew@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Using data on US metros, we identify regions that are transformative in terms of achieving a new equilibrium or reversing their path dependency. We then use discriminant analysis to identify the factors behind this resiliency. Regional resilience is rare, and changing a region's path is easier than achieving a new equilibrium. Among the most important factors behind regional transformation are the ability to attract immigrants, retain manufacturing, and innovate a high-tech economy. The diversity of outcomes suggests that a simple strong versus weak market dichotomy is insufficient to characterize regional resiliency, and a wide array of policies will be necessary.","[Chapple, Karen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lester, T.

Debates tend to focus around what proportion of the annual harvest should be devoted to markets as opposed to long-term contracts. To give a guide to policy makers, we surveyed forest firms from New Zealand and Sweden where this decision is based purely on a commercial basis. On average, mills source fifty percent of their fibre from the market. However, using a fractional logit model, we test whether theories from transaction cost economics influence this decision. Results are consistent with transaction cost economics; firms decrease the proportion of fibre sourced from a market with increasing fibre specificity, capital intensity, forest ownership concentration and uncertainty.

Governance of the global political economy and society is increasingly being shaped by private actors, institutions and processes that operate transnationally, linking local and global orders through complex laws and regulatory arrangements. These private governance arrangements are legitimized through their claims to possess expert knowledge and authority. However, adopting the lenses of critical theory, this paper seeks to problematize the tendency to defer unquestioningly to expert opinion. It argues that uncritical deference to experts is symptomatic of deeper conditions that are linked to the dominant form that law takes under contemporary capitalism. This paper examines the nexus between knowledge and power and the specific place that experts have in the legitimization of private modes of governance under contemporary conditions of post-modern legality and late capitalism. It advances critical theory as an approach to understanding the significance of technological rationality and expert systems of knowledge in the reproduction of transnational capitalism and in the creation of space for greater reflexivity in governance and the enhancement of individual autonomy.","Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Victoria,"Cutler, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.",ccutler@uvic.ca,,,,,,,89,54,59,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Its burden is expected to remain significant in the coming years, although it is mostly a preventable disease. Prevention and screening programmes will play an important role in the fight against CRC. A national formal screening programme was introduced in the 2003-2005 and 2005-2007 national health programmes, leaving the planning and implementation, respectively, to each region and local health unit. In 2007, screening programmes covered 46.6% of the eligible population, with a higher coverage in the North (71.6%) and in the Centre (52.1%) than in the South (7%). The majority of programmes used the guaiac faecal occult blood test (FOBT) as first-line test. Only few programmes used the flexible sigmoidoscopy, or a combination of both tests. The quality and efficacy of the screening programmes are evaluated using ad hoc indicators with acceptable and desirable targets. In Italy, there are formal guidelines for population-based and opportunistic screening, diagnosis, surgery, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments and surveillance, differentiating colon cancer from rectal cancer and advanced CRC. Guidelines are updated yearly. Overall, Italy is well positioned in the fight against CRC.

The mathematic model is based on fuzzy logic, a multivalent logic which offers a better way in economic terms, or more relevant, to assess the degree of a company's impact on environment.

In order to reflect the political targets regarding the use of renewable energy a wood-for-energy scenario was developed and compared with a business-as-usual base-scenario up to the year 2020. The analysis shows that the rising fuelwood demand in the wood-for-energy scenario would clearly lead to a much stronger competition for small roundwood (pulpwood) and sawmill residues. Compared to the base scenario, this competition would increase pulpwood prices and - to some extent - forest product prices (especially sawmill residues and pulp). In general, forestry and sawmills would be the winners, the panel and paper industries would be the losers of a wood-for-energy policy. The panel and paper industries would face decreased gross profits, because of two developments happening at the same time: a decrease in production and an increase in costs (roundwood and sawmill residues) beyond the increase of forest products prices. The analysis also reveals that the additional demand for fuelwood could only be met by an additional supply from the Austrian forests - if the fuelwood price was attractive enough (by 2020 more than 50% higher than in the base-scenario) for the forest owners.

We find that positive benefits of fishery self management an increase in fishery revenue and reduction in cost are perceived by member fishermen, which is a good start considering the average number of years since the establishment of these self-management groups is only about seven. Empirical results of the magnitude of change in profit showed some consistent results, although the estimates were not as robust.

The causes of unfair primary distribution mainly include: The total wages growth rate (the average wage growth rate) is lower than the economic growth rate (staffs' productivity growth rate), which leads to proportion of labor reward in GDP declining. Monopoly industries get higher wages with the pegged economic benefits to wages. Wage growth speed of lower position is slower than that of higher position. There is huge income gap among staffs due to different forms of employment. Therefore, we should control the unfair primary distribution as the following. Firstly, keep the total wages growth rate from exceeding the economic growth rate, and keep the average wage growth rate from exceeding staffs' productivity growth rate. Secondly, monopoly industries must determine their wages in consideration of competitive industries' wages. Thirdly, we should improve wage adjustment measures to staffs of different status.

A parametric approach is used to model grain-yield distribution for samples and the goodness-of-fit test is used to choose the best appropriate yield distribution. Parameters of the selected yield distribution are estimated through the maximum likelihood estimation approach. The Burr distribution is found to be the most appropriate parametric distribution to model grain-production risks for the six provinces of the main grain-producing areas in China. Findings also show that log-logistic distribution, normal distribution, logistic distribution and Johnson SB distribution are the best appropriate model for the different remaining provinces. The grain-production loss ratios of the provinces of the main grain-producing areas are between 5 and 15 percent, which is considered medium range in most regions.

The paper finds that at this stage, Doha promises greater security of access to markets but not any additional liberalization. Uruguay Round commitments are on average 2.3 times more restrictive than current policies. The best offers submitted so far as part of the Doha negotiations improve on Uruguay Round commitments by about 13% but remain on average 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies.

However, the idea remains very much at the level of hypothesis as few empirical studies have confirmed the transition. Part of the problem is the multi-dimensional character of governance itself, which includes traditional 'government' as one of many possible governance modes. By providing a three dimensional picture of these potential governance modes, including overlapping institutional, political and regulatory dimensions, this article analyses the complex and incomplete character of moves towards any new governance mode in a high-profile land use planning exercise in British Columbia, that of the Great Bear Rainforest protected area strategy on the province's mid-coast region in 2006. Little evidence of such a shift is uncovered, despite much rhetoric to the contrary. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A better analogy would be Leif Ericksson. He and his fellow Norsemen reached North America five centuries before Columbus by travelling in the most remarkable sailing vessels of their time. Not until Columbus, however, did Europeans have at their disposal a robust maritime technology that would allow them to not only reach the Western hemisphere but also to sail back and forth to Europe reliably. Over the last forty-five years, the United States has developed space launch vehicles that can carry astronauts to near-Earth orbit and even to the moon. It has failed, however, to develop the space ship that can do for the United States what the caravel did for Columbus. The current program to build a new suite of launch vehicles simply recycles old technology. It builds longships, not caravels. To achieve its goals for manned spaceflight, NASA must first build a safe, reliable, and economical launch vehicle. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike most peer studies, I identify the peers and the teachers that each student has had in every classroom. This enables me to handle the simultaneity and selection problems. which are inherent in estimating peer effects in the educational production function. I use a value-added approach with lagged peer achievement to avoid simultaneity and extensive fixed effects to rule out selection. To be specific, it is within-student across-subject variation with additional controls for time-invariant teacher characteristics that is exploited. Moreover, I identify students that are attending classes in which they have no peers from previous education which otherwise might bias the result. I find positive peer effects for the average student but also that there is a non-linear dimension.

First, six latent location factors were identified based on a survey of lumber industry members using factor analysis. An exploratory analysis of sawmill location identified deviations from complete spatial randomness, suggesting the formal incorporation of a spatial dimension in an econometric model. A Bayesian spatial autoregressive approach was used to model the presence of the lumber industry at the county level in the U.S. South. Empirical results are congruent with theory. The strength of the spatial process is weak in the presence of descriptors with a direct geographic dimension. Counties that provide cost advantages, available labor, and appropriate road access are more likely to host the lumber industry. The model was used to identify counties where lumber industry developments could occur with a high probability of success. This research framework can be extended to other industries and regions.

The article suggests that the general obligations of the CATS are expected to have a marginally beneficial impact on the provision of basic social services, to the extent they are implemented and integrated with the domestic reform agenda. This benefit is expected due to an increase in transparency and public availability of information. Second, making specific commitments in basic social services is likely to be marginally harmful, to the extent that Member countries lack regulatory capacity. This negative impact is expected due to restrictions on policy space. Third, scheduling basic social services under the CATS is quite de-linked from both - the problems Jilted in improving provision of basic social services, and the solutions that are suggested to address them. Finally, for a more complete picture of how the CATS may impact basic social services, there is need to look elsewhere, into the schedules of other sectors such as insurance and financial services, since poorly executed commitments can hamper policy space to introduce interventions in these allied sectors that affect the provision of basic social services.",,,,,,,,,,,54,2,2,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This holds especially true for the problem identification and structuring (initial) phase of a transition project, which aims at supporting goal formation based on a sound understanding and representation of the system's current state and its dynamics. Throughout this phase, it is important that all relevant perspectives in terms of expertise and interests are considered and adequately fed into a process of knowledge integration. This paper presents in its first part the structuring for complex transitions (SCT) procedure aiming at this requirement. The procedure has been specifically designed for problem structuring in socio-technical systems in the initial phase of a transition project. The results of the procedure provide sound inputs for the next project phases and the transition methods applied therein, but can themselves already be used as fruitful orientations in strategy development. The second part of the paper briefly outlines the application of the SCT procedure to Swiss waste management. This application involved 48 participants who reached consensus on relevant impact factors and developed a shared vision for managing a complex transition process in the area of waste management.

The economic impact of stroke is clearly seen, as it is the largest single cause of bed occupancy in hospitals in England and accounts for 6% of hospital costs. This analysis is the first to quantify the economic consequences of a blood pressure lowering regimen based on the PROGRESS study (perindopril-based regimen), for reducing future cardiovascular events. Design A Markov decision analytical model was used to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of blood pressure lowering in the treatment of patients presenting with a cerebrovascular event. The health states are based upon Barthel indices for which resource utilisation and health benefits have previously been estimated. Setting The participants for the economic analysis were obtained from the PROGRESS study database. 6,105 clinical study participants were recruited through both primary and secondary care centres. Participants The mean age was 64 years; 70% were male in the original study. Interventions In the PROGRESS study, blood pressure lowering by a perindopril-based regimen was compared to standard care. Main outcome measures Cost per quality adjusted life year for the duration of the study (4 years) and for a time span of 20 years. Results Using only direct hospital medical costs, the cost per QALY for a perindopril based regimen is 6,927 pound for the base study period and 10,133 pound for a 20-year time period. These results are sensitive to the cost of perindopril, the cost of the stroke unit, length of stay, and to a lesser extent, the cost of indapamide. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates a cost-effective treatment for patients suffering a cerebrovascular event with a blood pressure lowering regimen. The findings of this study are in line with Current decisions and guidance by the national institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE) in England.","[Tavakoli, Manouchehr] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland; [Pumford, Neil] Nurseplus Ltd, Auchterarder, Scotland; [Woodward, Mark] Mt Sinai Sch Med, New York, NY USA; [Doney, Alex; MacWalter, Ronald] Univ Dundee, Ninewells Hosp & Med Sch, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland; [Chalmers, John; MacMahon, Stephen] Univ Sydney, George Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of St Andrews; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; University of Dundee; University of Sydney,"Tavakoli, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland.",mt@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Woodward, Mark/L-6817-2017; Woodward, Mark/D-8492-2015; Doney, Alexander/P-7437-2017","Woodward, Mark/0000-0001-9800-5296; Chalmers, John/0000-0002-9931-0580; MacMahon, Stephen/0000-0003-2064-7699; Doney, Alexander/0000-0002-6210-5620",,,,,52,5,7,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The research employs cointegration, Granger causality tests and innovation accounting techniques in order to capture the relationship between stock prices and gross domestic product, consumer price index, money supply, interest rates and real exchange rates. The signs of variables in the cointegrating vectors are consistent with economic reasoning: the consumer price index is positively related to stock prices, while the real exchange rate exhibits an opposite behaviour, except for Romania. Real interest rates in Czech Republic, Poland and Romania are positively correlated with stock prices, which may be cautiously interpreted as a lack of liquidity in financial markets. The impulse response analysis points towards a number of similarities among these countries: shocks in macroeconomic variables generate innovations in stock prices over the short-run; the responses of stock prices to shocks in themselves are negative over the short-run and positive, except for Romania, over the long-run; shocks in GDP determine positive responses of stock prices in all countries.","[Horobet, Alexandra; Dumitrescu, Sorin] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Horobet, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Horobet, Alexandra/D-2301-2010","Horobet, Alexandra/0000-0001-5821-0244",,,,,18,6,6,0,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

These differences can be explained by farmers' social capital, and its formation in the course of time. Therefore it is important to evaluate social capital development possibilities in regions. Three social capital development scenarios could be applied in Zemgale region: creation of 1) Single Information centre; 2) Co-operation system and 3) Lifelong education system for farmers. In the current situation farmers do not have additional stimuli to develop social capital. In addition, groups' social capital development has additional benefits on other groups and on regional development as well as it influences the success of entrepreneurship.

In addition, we find evidence of heterogeneous effects by prior educational attainment.

During this same period, President Hugo Chavez implemented several education reforms. We focus on a major university education reform known as Mission Sucre and its potential impact on returns to university education. First, we show that returns to education decreased significantly in Venezuela from 2002 to 2008. Subsequently, we explore the impact of the program on non-program participants and provide evidence that a substantial part of the falling returns at the tertiary level can be linked to Mission Sucre. Our results suggest that the reform created a negative externality on students who did not participate in the program, leading to a 2.7 percentage point decline in returns to university education for non-Mission Sucre students in the 23-28 age cohort.

J,"Yegorov, Y; Wirl, F",,,,"Yegorov, Yuri; Wirl, Franz",,,"Gas transportation, geopolitics and future market structure",FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENERGY,"Recent studies have shown the important role of geography, politics and technology for the evolution of markets for natural gas. Gas market differs from other markets due to high share of transport and infrastructure costs. Since investment is location specific, it involves also geopolitical aspects as a consequence. Future market structure becomes path dependent on the investment decisions, particularly in gas infrastructure (pipelines and LNG). Another important aspect that shapes future gas market is heterogeneity in reserve-production ratios across gas producing countries that will eventually lead to the emergence of narrow oligopoly formed by countries with the largest reserves: Russia, Iran and Qatar. The goal of this paper is to analyse a long run gas game. There exist several time scales, and by backward induction we arrive at the conclusion that some time during the 21st century (we name it long run) there will be an oligopoly consisting of only three major gas reserve holders: Russia (26%), Iran (15%) and Qatar (14%). They will face the demand from three major gas importers: EU, USA and Core Asia. While the development paths and market structures are highly uncertain in the middle run (when temporal competition with rivals having 3% or less of gas reserves is feasible), the cloud of uncertainty shrinks in the long run. But investment strategies of major players in the middle run will determine the topology of gas infrastructure in the long run. All the players have a vector of strategic choices where geography, politics and technology set their limitations. Putting it in a simple formal framework, we can say that players choose: intensity of exploitation and shares of investment in transport infrastructure (LNG and location-specific pipelines). Geographical analysis of gas fields of Russia shows that it has moderate flexibility, but still can control the future share of LNG and pipeline flows to Europe and Asia. Pipelines to EU are slightly preferred to pipelines to Asia but political aspects may play crucial role. Qatar is likely to invest only in LNG, but has the flexibility in the speed of its field exploitation (it may be lower that for Russia). Iran has the highest technological and geographical freedom in choices. Future market structures for gas can vary from oligopolistic to monopolistic-monopsonistic relationship, with possibly different prices.

Banking liberalization and corporate governance restructuring significantly enhance profit gains from loan and asset diversification.

This pilot study for the first time estimates the values of China's forest resources and calculates its forest green GDP. It relies primarily on existing data on previously published information by the government in China. Our estimates indicate that the total stock value of forestlands and standing timber in 1999 was 4564.43 billion Yuan (RMB) in China, in 2003 was 5273.05 billion Yuan, and the sum of flow values of forest resources from 1999 to 2003 was 11,072.36 billion Yuan annually. In the value of forest ecological services, the value of water conservation was largest, and the value of air pollution and dust purifying was least. The nation's eaGDP (environmentally adjusted GDP) for forest in 1999 was 9281.55 billion Yuan, Larger than GDP of 8967.71 billion Yuan, the eaNDP (environmentally adjusted NDP) for forest was 9280.73 billion Yuan, was about 1.05 times that of the NDP. In 2003 both of the eaGDP and eaNDP for forest calculated by the production method at the marketing price exceeded the conventional GDP and NDP, but the annual average growth rate of eaNDP for forest was 10.68%, less than the annual average growth rate of NDP 11.27% during the accounting period, which mostly caused by the increased depreciation value of the planted forest, and the loss of forest resource assets and degradation of forest environment assets since the greater economic development in recent years in China. We propose that forest compensation should be enhanced, and the legal protection of forests should be strengthened, as well as the economic activities which cause deterioration in forest service functions should be avoided or at least minimized.

Using panel data on Maryland elementary and middle schools from 2003 to 2009, I find that the scope of failure matters: Academic performance suffers in the short run in response to school-wide failure. However, schools that meet achievement targets for the aggregate student group, yet fail to meet at least one demographic subgroup's target see between 3 and 6 percent more students in the failing subgroup score proficiently the following year, compared to if no accountability pressure were in place.

Despite the recognition, numerous geographers have criticized the Report for its failure to engage with ideas from outside economics, particularly those associated with 'second-order' (for example social, political) factors that influence economic development. This paper details three of these missing geographies and demonstrates how urban-regional development is influenced by socio-spatial factors, context-specific mobilities, power asymmetries and the quality of a region's ties to transnational production networks. Beyond highlighting these factors, the paper argues for improved policies through the integration of economists and geographers' perspectives on the role of density, distance and division in development.","Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Murphy, JT (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 S Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jammurphy@clarku.edu,,,,,,,84,5,5,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

We present evidence on teacher opinions with regard to performance-based pay from teacher interviews conducted in the context of an experimental evaluation of a program that provided performance-based bonuses to teachers in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. We report four main findings in this paper: (1) over 80% of teachers had a favorable opinion about the idea of linking a component of pay to measures of performance, (2) exposure to an actual incentive program increased teacher support for the idea, (3) teacher support declines with age, experience, training, and base pay, and (4) the extent of teachers' stated ex ante support for performance-linked pay (over a series of mean-preserving spreads of pay) is positively correlated with their ex post performance as measured by estimates of teacher value addition.

For Functowicz and Ravetz contemporary issues in which 'facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent' necessitate PNS. PNS deals with the postnormal character of contemporary challenges by bringing the contextualised insights of non-scientific stakeholders to bear through the formulation of 'extended facts'. However, while the contextual content of 'extended facts' caters to the indeterminate character of postnormal issues this remains in tension with an implicit assumption that outcomes reflect the quality of the 'facts' informing them. This paper takes the claim that postnormal times involves 'that we abandon...ideas of 'control and management'' seriously by arguing that science should be the servant of outcomes framed in, primarily, societal terms, rather than the other way around. This argument is illustrated using the example of fashioning an effective response to climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This article reports the results in six areas of current policy interest. How should education aid be distributed? Is school choice a good thing? Does school finance reform work? What has accountability wrought? Can school policies close the black-white achievement gap? And how should teachers be compensated? Our findings identify areas of substantial agreement as well as areas where there is disagreement. For example, there is considerable agreement that state and federal governments should provide additional funding for disadvantaged students but disagreement on how to measure school finance adequacy.","[Stiefel, Leanna; Schwartz, Amy Ellen] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Stiefel, Leanna; Schwartz, Amy Ellen] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Rotenberg, Anne] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, Bronx, NY 10463 USA",New York University; New York University; New York University,"Stiefel, L (通讯作者)，NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",leanna.stiefel@nyu.edu; amy.schwartz@nyu.edu,"Stiefel, Leanna/K-9392-2019",,,,,,51,4,4,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

We select a sample of 38 innovating countries and study how knowledge related to energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies flows across geographical and technological space. We demonstrate that higher geographical and technological distances are associated with lower probabilities of knowledge flow. Next, we use previous estimates to construct internal and external knowledge stocks for a panel of 17 countries. We then present an econometric analysis of the supply and demand determinants of innovation accounting for international knowledge spillovers. Our results confirm the role of demand-pull effects, proxied by energy prices, and of technological opportunity, proxied by the knowledge stocks.

I focus on two dimensions, the duration of study and the probability of actually graduating with a degree. To determine the impact of financial student aid, I estimate a discrete-time duration model allowing for competing risks to account for different exit states (graduation and dropout) using individual level panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 1984-2007. My findings suggest that the duration of study is responsive to the type of financial support a student receives. There are three main results. First, student aid recipients finish faster than comparable students who are supported by the same amount of parental/private transfers only. Second, although higher financial aid does on average not affect the duration of study, this effect is (third) dominated by the increased probability of actually finishing university successfully.

Analyzing and learning from the strategic use of new modes of governance in Germany and Bulgaria,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,National Forest Programmes; Advocacy Coalition Framework; Policy change; Governance; Participation; Policy learning,POLICY CHANGE; PARTICIPATION,"National Forest Programmes (NFPs) have been widely discussed as being potential instruments for concretizing the abstract international consensus on sustainable forest management at a national level. Furthermore, they were expected to enhance governance principles such as public participation, holistic and inter-sectoral coordination, decentralisation and long-term iterative and adaptive planning. In our paper, we offer a slightly different perspective on NFPs: Drawing on two empirical case studies (Germany and Bulgaria), we first show that the NFPs in both countries met the aforementioned governance principles. However, when it comes to their potential to trigger forest policy change and to concretize sustainable forest management on the ground, NFPs turned out to be less effective in both countries. Moreover, our analysis, drawing on the Advocacy Coalition Framework, embeds the development of NFPs in long-lasting struggles between actor coalitions of diverging beliefs and allows for an interpretation in which the NFPs in both countries were used by powerful actors to serve certain strategic goals. We argue that in the case of Germany, an important motivation for the forestry coalition to develop the NFP was to occupy their counterpart, the nature conservation coalition, with a long-lasting negotiation process that had no substantial influence on the national forest policy. In Bulgaria, vital reasons for launching the NFP were, on one hand, to satisfy the demands of international donors and, on the other hand, to incorporate beliefs of powerful actors into the national forest policy. These findings, according to our conclusion, notably diminish expectations regarding the potential of NFPs as instruments for policy learning and policy change. Our paper concludes with recommendations for further research. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In previous analyses, I proposed that a proper view of development should consider the conjecture of an optimum competitive area. Far for requesting a clear-cut mathematical exposition, the use of optimum means an analytical search for the most favourable conditions of competitive development on a regional basis, that is, an area sufficiently large to allow for efficient levels of production, but fittingly small to show adaptability in absorbing economic shocks.

It is the task of this paper to shed light on these issues in the form of a critical exploration of the existing literature and empirical evidence.

This paper reports on the limitations in current supply chain practices identified through a rapid supply chain appraisal of the UK mango chain. Under an Australian government aid initiative, considerable investments in improving post-harvest practices, market feedback and capacity building have been made, which have resulted in improved product appearance and fruit quality. Unfortunately, there has been no appreciable improvement in market prices or commitment from the exporters involved. The reasons behind this include the large number of exporters, the costs associated in changing the current system, and the inability to quantify the benefits arising from the implementation of 'best practice'.","[Dunne, A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Syst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Dunne, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Syst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66050-89-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,895.0,,,,,,107,112,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.895.13,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BGR09,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000323845300013,0

Although computer manufacturers are working to build green computers, a large part of limiting such hazardous wastes rests with consumers when purchasing them. Hence, the purpose of the study was to determine if information presented to consumers would influence their attitudes regarding green computing and purchases. A self-administered questionnaire was developed to determine comsumer' attitudes toward the environment, attitudes toward green computing, and demographic characteristics.

An important issue of organizational innovation was, however, less considered and analyzed: it is the relation between different factors of organizational innovation and the performance of innovative activities, for which every organization spends important resources and puts into practice impressive strategies. Our study has as starting point a number of questions for which it intends to find answers or at least suggest possible solutions. The main question is: what elements (factors, variables, expenses and effects type) can be considered into the equation by a company in order to stimulate innovation and obtain a certain level of innovational performance? As an acceptable postulate for our approach, we considered that the innovational performance of an organization has to be associated with those novelties (products, services, activities, knowledge) recognized by the market, and which bring additional value to that organization, through commercialization. As immediate result, the study suggests a few logical relations between the construct of organizational innovation performance and the main influence factors.

J,"Dascalescu, FD",,,,"Dascalescu, Florin Dorian",,,The European Commission's Practice on Exporters Found Not to Dump in the Aftermath of WTO Mexico Rice,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The WTO Panel has found in Mexico Rice that, as set forth by Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, there shall be 'immediate termination' of an anti-dumping investigation where the authorities determine that the dumping margin of individual exporters is de minimis. The only way to 'immediately' terminate an investigation of such exporters is to exclude them from the scope of the anti-dumping order. In addition to the Panel's holding in Mexico Rice, the legal doctrine supports the Panel's logical conclusion that an exporter found not to dump in the original investigation cannot be subject to a 'changed circumstances' (or 'interim') review. Indeed, reviewing such exporters would actually result in them being subject to the initial anti-dumping order. However, at EU level, the anti-dumping legislation provides that there shall be 'immediate termination' where it is determined that the dumping margin is de minimis, provided that it is only the 'investigation' that shall be terminated, while exporters found not to dump remain subject to the 'proceeding' and may be 'automatically' reinvestigated in 'any subsequent review' with respect to the country concerned. Consequently, it appears that the EU anti-dumping legislation is contrary to the WTO case law. This conclusion is supported by the Commission's findings in Welded Tubes (December 2008), in which the Commission seemed to accept the rationale behind Mexico Rice. However, the Commission's interpretation of the Mexico Rice decision in Ironing Boards (October 2009) generates contradictory results, as it opens the gate to the initiation of new anti-dumping investigations limited to exporters found not to dump, while the initial anti-dumping measures are still in force. The present article examines the Commission's approach in Welded Tubes and scrutinizes whether initiating the Ironing Boards case was indeed in accordance with the Panel's decision in Mexico Rice.","Van Bael & Bellis, Brussels Off, Brussels, Belgium",,"Dascalescu, FD (通讯作者)，Van Bael & Bellis, Brussels Off, Brussels, Belgium.",f.d.dascalescu@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The present paper aims to present ways to analyse the location of forest conflicts, based on systematic screening and location of cases, and examines the focus of academic research as well as ENGOs regarding forest conflicts. A large sample of 300 identified forest conflicts are located, categorised according to conflict type and analysed using kernel associations. The results revealed a high concentration of forest conflicts (hotspots) in richly ecological regions of South-East Asia, Central Africa and several areas of South America. Additional areas in Central Europe and North America were also identified. Concerning the focus areas, there were important differences in the areas covered by the ENGOs and the academic literature, in terms of location, as well as conflict type. Although more cases are possibly needed to get more solid conclusions, the methods and results of this paper can serve as a basis of further research, in order, for example, to identify common socio-economical factors that can be linked with the conflicts.

In the past few years, this issue has moved to center stage because of the foreign exchange policies of China. Numerous public officials and commentators argue that China has engaged in impermissible 'currency manipulation', and various proposals for stiff action against China have been advanced. This paper considers the relationship between exchange rate policy and international trade, and addresses the questions of whether and how currency manipulation should be addressed by the international trading system. Our conclusions are at odds with much of what is currently being said by proponents of multilateral or unilateral actions against China. In particular, we question whether China's practices can be adjudicated to be 'manipulation' under international law, and doubt that their trade effects can be identified with the degree of confidence necessary to ascertain whether the practices 'frustrate the intent' of WTO/GATT commitments. The difficulty of identifying the trade effects of currency practices undermines the ability of the WTO dispute resolution system to address them, and calls into question the wisdom and legitimacy of unilateral countermeasures that have been proposed in various quarters.","[Staiger, Robert W.; Sykes, Alan O.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Staiger, Robert W.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Staiger, RW (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rstaiger@stanford.edu,,,,,,,52,66,75,1,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2010,9.0,4,,,,,583,627,,10.1017/S1474745610000340,0.0,,,45,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,674PA,,Green Published,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000283758400002,0

It is also indispensable for the application of preferential trade commitments including national and most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, among others. This article examines the relevant provisions to ascertain whether there are any defects in origin rules for services of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and, if so, how they could possibly be handled. It concludes, first, that there is the twofold typology for the origin rules: general origin rules and special origin rules. Second, four defects exist in general origin rules for commercial presence, particularly the ownership or control requirement. They are insufficient to determine the origin for juridical persons of equal or scattered shareholding structure or services co-supplied by providers of different nationality. Neither are they always capable of identifying the economic service suppliers and the ultimate owner or controller of suppliers. Third, the application of the,general interpretation rule leaves the meaning ambiguous. A substantial input test based on the value added criteria could be adopted as the supplementary means of interpretation.","SW Univ Polit Sci & Law SWUPL, Ctr Law Int Investment & Finance, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Southwest University of Political Science & Law - China,"Wang, H (通讯作者)，SW Univ Polit Sci & Law SWUPL, Ctr Law Int Investment & Finance, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",stonewh6@gmail.com,"Wang, Heng/S-8117-2019","Wang, Heng/0000-0003-2410-6144",,,,,8,4,6,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The pattern of pension wealth accrual creates sharp incentives to work until eligible for early or normal retirement, often in one's early fifties, and to separate shortly thereafter. We estimate the effect of pension wealth accrual on teacher separation decisions using a new longitudinal data set of Arkansas teachers and find a significant impact. We then simulate the response to eliminating early retirement and raising the service requirement for normal retirement. We also simulate a shift to a constant accrual retirement plan. The response to both reforms is complex, as some would leave earlier and others stay longer. A constant accrual plan smoothes the pattern of retirement behavior as individuals tailor decisions to their own preferences instead of those built into the pension formula.","[Costrell, Robert M.; McGee, Josh B.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Costrell, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, 201 Grad Educ Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",costrell@uark.edu; jmcgee@walton.uark.edu,"McGee, Josh B./GON-8187-2022","McGee, Josh B./0000-0003-2068-2072",,,,,16,35,46,1,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Yet, research on the economic impacts of these costs is inconclusive. There has been much focus on functional assumptions and the significance of parameters, but very little on the quality and precision of the cost measures upon which most results hinge. Reviewing the indirect and direct measurement methods commonly used, the author argues that direct quantitative methods, rarely used in research, are much needed to complement more popular indirect measures. A recent survey experiment conducted in Australia illustrates this point.","[Freyens, Benoit Pierre] Univ Wollongong, Dept Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Freyens, Benoit Pierre] Univ Canberra, Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Canberra,"Freyens, BP (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Dept Econ, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",ben.freyens@anu.edu.au,,"FREYENS, Benoit Pierre/0000-0002-5280-1382",,,,,78,2,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0020-7780,,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

The analysis suggests that the specification of the import function should partially, if not completely, be the result of a simple discussion about the spending and import behaviors of the household, firm, and government sectors. The analysis also indicates that instructors who use certain import functions that are in some introductory textbooks will inadvertently impose restrictions on the model and potentially confuse students. The author examines several implications of the specification proposed by Robert Cherry (2001) and shows how the restrictions imposed by Cherry's specification make it difficult for instructors to present certain types of economic events and policies. The import function discussed here avoids these restrictions and allows instructors to present more easily certain types of examples.","Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Findlay, DW (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",dwfindla@colby.edu,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Because established pest and disease infestations grow and spread over time their introduction has intertemporal consequences. In a dynamic economic model, an efficient trade policy balances the costs of SPS measures against the discounted stream of the costs of control and social damages that are avoided by using SPS measures, where future growth of any established infestation is accounted for. We examine when phytosanitary trade policy makes good economic sense, when it is efficient to provide full protection against pests and diseases, and when restrictive, but not fully protective trade policy is efficient.

Their results show that resource exports are no longer significant while value of subsoil assets has a significant positive effect on growth. But the World Bank measure of subsoil assets is proportional to current rents, and thus is also endogenous. Furthermore, their results suffer from an unfortunate data mishap, omitted variables bias, weakness of instruments, violation of exclusion restrictions and misspecification error. Correcting for these issues and instrumenting resource exports with values of proven reserves at the beginning of the sample period, there is no evidence for resource curse either and subsoil assets are no longer significant. However, the same evidence suggests that resource exports or rents boost growth in stable countries, but also make especially already volatile countries more volatile and thus indirectly worsen growth prospects. Ignoring the volatility channel may lead one to erroneously conclude that there is no effect of resources on growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This analysis gauges the potential use of these international financial standards in a potential future dispute settlement involving the domestic regulation of financial services. It demonstrates their relevance in WTO law as well as their both considerable and contested role in the institutional practice of the organization, thereby highlighting the incentives for regulatory harmonization that are embedded in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (CATS). The difficulties are mainly centred on the Basel Committee due to its limited membership, therefore not meeting the conditions of validity for the recognition of external standards laid down in the CATS, and also leading to the reluctance of some developing countries unwilling to endorse standards to which they have not previously agreed. More broadly, this study reflects on the potential tensions between plurilateral regulatory strategies and the multilateral context of the WTO and highlights the insufficient coordination between the international legal frameworks for the regulation and for the liberalization of financial services.","Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France",,"Bismuth, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France.",regis.bismuth@gmail.com,"Bismuth, Regis/JJF-9488-2023",,,,,,59,11,11,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Drawing on developments based on Integral Theory, it then looks at how an emerging Integral Sustainability (IS) promises to enhance theory and practice in the sustainability field. In particular, the paper looks at how IS makes sense of sustainability challenges from an ontological position based on perspectives in place of objects (and their systems). A framework is outlined for understanding how various sustainability perspectives are constructed. This framework is then used to analyse a range of general perspectives the authors have identified that relate to nuclear power as a response to climate change. The strength of the IS approach is considered in the context of ongoing debate in Australia over the appropriateness of developing a local nuclear power industry as a response to climate change.

Previous studies have estimated compensating differentials using hedonic modeling, an approach potentially undermined by district-wide salary schedules and the lack of labor market competitiveness. To address this problem, we build hedonic wage models for both public and private schools using data from the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey and the 2000 Census. Empirical estimates suggest that both public and private schools compensate teachers for some working conditions, but there also appear to be differences between public and private schools in the magnitude of the compensating differentials, particularly for teaching low-income students.

Economic information on probable structure losses can help guide efficient wildfire management, policy, and investments. However, no single existing modeling tool is capable of accurately predicting existing wildland fire ignition risk to WUI residences, nor are there broadly accepted models to calculate needed investments to reduce risk to WUI structures. To fill this void, a representative set of rural residences in western Montana was selected to estimate a baseline, 30-year wildland fire ignition hazard and the cost effectiveness of optional investments to reduce risk from wildfire damage to these residences. The study applied a modeling system combining outputs from a structure ignition assessment model (SIAM) with wildland fire probabilities from an ecological disturbance model (SIMPPLLE). Results indicate that the probability of structure damage to a home when a fire visits a residence is 1.0 under conditions of extreme wildland fire weather. This contrasts with the low probabilities (0-0.05) that wildland fire will reach vegetation surrounding the residence. Cost-effectiveness analysis of two suites of preventative mitigation strategies demonstrated that home mitigation zone investments (modifying houses or fuels within 30.5 m (100 ft) of a residence) are generally more cost effective in reducing risk to WUI structures than investments in silvicultural operations in surrounding forests (within 2.4 km (1.5 ml) of homes). The effectiveness of the mitigation options in modifying average home loss due to wildfire ranges from negative 19.6% to positive 63% (some silvicultural treatments did increase the probability of wildfire in simulations). While both home ignition zone mitigations and silvicultural treatments can markedly reduce wildland fire hazard estimates, the former appear to provide a more pronounced reduction in hazard as correlated with expenditures.

On the evidentiary issues, the Appellate Body upheld the Panel's conclusions, although it modified certain of the Panel's reasoning. Probably the most interesting aspect of the case was the substantial deference showed by the Appellate Body to the Panel's consideration of causation and non-attribution issues. This deference was striking compared to the lack of deference that the Appellate Body has given to national authorities on those issues.

The analysis documents clear gender inequalities in the allocation of household tasks among girls and boys and their parents, but finds more mixed evidence regarding gender favoritism in human capital investment.

These projections were used as input in the GFPM simulations. The IPCC also makes projections of forest area, which were integrated in the timber supply sub-model of the GFPM. The IPCC scenarios also predict bioenergy production.

In particular, scenario A1B would induce a nearly 6-fold increase in the world demand for fuelwood by 2060. As a result, the real price of fuelwood would rise and converge towards the price of industrial roundwood by about 2025. At that point. industrial roundwood, which was used in the past to manufacture sawnwood, panels, and pulp, would begin to be used for energy production. The price of all wood would then continue to rise steadily up to 2060,and the price of manufactured product would increase in concert. The high fuelwood harvest would imply ecologically stressed forests in several countries, even under scenario A2 with a nearly 3-fold increase in fuelwood production by 2060. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the UK, and the second and third leading cause of new cancer cases in women and men, respectively. These figures have increased over the past decade and, coupled with poorer survival rates compared to the European average and an ageing population, have recently led to the implementation of national screening in 2007-2009. Staffing adjustments are being made in preparation for national CRC-related demands, and national treatment guidelines are currently being revised. Access to new targeted treatments, however, is very limited due to negative NICE guidance and access is granted to only a select few. Targets have been created with regards to time to diagnosis and treatment, which are generally being met by the majority of hospitals. Overall, the focus on screening activities in the UK will hopefully result in fewer end-stage CRC cases and associated costlier treatments.","[Schurer, Willemien; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Schurer, W (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.w.schurer@lse.ac.uk; p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Following the Russian '98 crisis first Brazil in Jan'99 and then Turkey in Oct'00 and in Feb'01 experienced liquidity crises. These crises led to major devaluations, which resulted in the free float of respective exchange rates. Until very recently both countries had been implementing IMF-backed stabilization programs. Fat tails of both indices are examined using bivariate extreme value analysis and results show that joint extremes of both indices have dependency both in the right and left tails. Considering the time zone difference between these two stock markets, the dependency increases when Turkey is studied as the leading country compared to the case where Brazil is considered as the leading country.","[Unal, Gozde] Bogazici Univ, Sch Appl Disciplines, Dept Int Trade, Hisar Campus, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Onay, Ceylan] Bogazici Univ, Sch Appl Disciplines, Dept MIS, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University; Bogazici University,"Ünal, G (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Sch Appl Disciplines, Dept Int Trade, Hisar Campus, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",gozde.unal@boun.edu.tr; ceylano@boun.edu.tr,"Onay, Ceylan/I-5076-2015; Unal, Gozde/I-3874-2012",,Bogazici University Research Fund [07N301],Bogazici University Research Fund(Bogazici University),This research is supported by Bogazici University Research Fund (07N301).,,18,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

After illustrating these ideas in a simple setting, the article formulates a general linear model with adaptive centering and random effects and derives efficient estimates and standard errors.

The community forest user groups of lowland in Nepal have practiced low pricing strategy for high value forest products considering the access of socio-economically poor households. However, the study suggests that even though the low pricing strategy was designed considering poor households, rich households greatly benefited from the forest benefits. The study further enlightens that the low price for high value forest products particularly timber is counterproductive for equitable benefit sharing among the user households in the areas of heterogeneous socio-economic conditions.

The paper also examines econometrically the effect of stock market development on the importance of debt relative to external equity in the balance sheet of Ghanaian firms. The results show that the average listed Ghanaian firm finances its growth mainly from short-term debt. The stock market, however, is the most important source of long-term external finance. Stock market development tends to shift the financial structure of Ghanaian firms toward more equity and less debt. Overall, the evidence suggests that the stock market is a surprisingly important source of finance for funding corporate growth.","[Yartey, Charles Amo] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Yartey, CA (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",cyartey@imf.org,,,,,,,16,7,7,1,10,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We use a duopoly model of vertical product differentiation in which two firms simultaneously choose to produce either a high (environmentally friendly) quality or low (standard) quality variant of a good, before engaging in price competition. In this simple setting, we show that a Nash equilibrium of the game featuring the low-quality good can be Pareto dominated by a different strategy profile, in which both firms opt in favour of the green product. Our analysis demonstrates that, in such a case, both firms stand to profit from the introduction of a rule penalizing any firm refusing to produce the environmentally friendly product. We also find that consumers themselves may benefit from such regulations. This is always the case when shifting from low quality to high-quality production brings about a cost-efficiency improvement.

The proposed policies, including an approximation to the Kyoto protocol, are shown to differ greatly in how they mitigate climate change, support economic growth, and allocate rents across generations. Benefits of alternative policies, relative to the status quo, do not necessarily accrue to the generations that bear the costs. The results also show that the chosen rent distribution rule has a profound effect on policy evaluation. In particular, policies which allocate rents on a per-capita basis are shown to be systematically welfare-preferred to situations where emissions rights are grandfathered to emitting firms. This implies that both the optimal level of emissions and the welfare cost of reaching a given target of emissions or atmospheric concentration would be lower under a per-capita allocation of emissions permits or carbon tax revenues.

The result has been complexity, experimentation, fragmentation and incoherence with largely negative implications for territorial equity and justice.

For example, in 2004, alumni at private liberal arts colleges generated nearly 43% of total voluntary support and funded 21.5% of total institutional expenditures. This paper uses 15 years of detailed data on alumni donations to a private liberal arts college to explore a full range of potential determinants of giving. Results suggest that wealthy alumni who live in states that allow charitable tax deductions are more generous than otherwise similar alumni in states without such subsidies. Alumni contributions also increase in years when the college has achieved greater athletic prestige but fall when academic prestige rises. Furthermore, recent alumni are more influenced by institutional prestige than older graduates. With regard to other determinants, females tend to be more generous, as do alumni living in wealthier neighborhoods within 250 miles of the college. Alumni who have close alumni relatives tend to give more as do alumni who participated in campus activities during their college years. Undergraduate major and occupational sector are also strong predictors of giving behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, this paper examines the impact of attitudes toward using paid domestic labor, an area that has not been investigated previously. The findings suggest that resources and objective demand provide the parameters within which employing household help is made possible or necessary, but beliefs about the appropriateness of this strategy also play a role in determining whether Australian households use paid domestic labor. The paper concludes that understanding whether Australian households pay for domestic help is dependent not just on the level of resources and objective demand but also on whether individuals view paid domestic help as an appropriate strategy for undertaking domestic work.","[Baxter, Janeen] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hewitt, Belinda] Univ Queensland, Social Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Western, Mark] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Baxter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Level 8,Michie Bldg,Chancellors Pl, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.baxter@uq.edu.au; b.hewitt@uq.edu.au; m.western@uq.edu.au,"Western, Mark C/C-4757-2008; Baxter, Janeen/A-6793-2013","Western, Mark C/0000-0001-5399-6911; Baxter, Janeen/0000-0002-8723-9000",,,,,33,37,43,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The novel device consists of three horizontal rotors. Their brushes remove up to one third of flowers in slender spindle trees. By selecting a range of combinations of brushes, rotor speed, and tractor speeds the amount of removed flowers can be precisely determined from 0 to 33%. Results from three years (2005-2007) on apple varieties including 'Elstar', 'Braeburn', 'Gala', and 'Golden Delicious' showed that the novel device can precisely remove flowers, not only in the tree periphery, but also close to the tree trunk where fruit of lesser quality otherwise develop. Rotor speeds of between 300 to 420 rpm showed the best efficacy of flower thinning using tractor speeds of between 5 to 7 km/h. Damages to branches and leaves were less than 8% at the maximum employed rotor speed of 420 rpm. The device saves labor cost otherwise required for hand thinning in the order of 15 to 30 hours/ha, equivalent to ca. $100-200 US/ha. The cost of the novel device per hectare is estimated at ca. 100 US $/ha/year based on a life span of ten years and an area of 20 ha to thin each year. The novel device may be an alternative for both organic and integrated fruit growers, particularly as chemical thinning agents become less available for environmental reasons. The novel device with its precise thinning mode may also have a market potential not only for apple, but also for certain stone fruit and Mediterranean fruit crops, where thinning and achievement of a high fruit quality is required for successful economic returns.","[Damerow, L.] Univ Bonn, Inst Agr Engn, Nussallee 5, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Blanke, M.

Despite numerous attempts to establish a certified seed system, the most practical solution is to import clean foundation seed of the desired variety and physiological age. With imports from Europe and North America proving to be too expensive, Western Australia (WA) is emerging as a potential source of high quality seed. While seed imports from WA are unique in that the varieties imported have been selected by researchers in Vietnam as being suited to the agro-ecological environment in the Red River Delta (RRD), no assessment of the economic benefits to smallholder potato farmers from the use of WA potato seed has been undertaken. In 2006/07, the yield and profitability of two potato varieties, KT3 and Eben, in two locations were compared where the crops had been derived from new seed imported from WA, seed derived from crops cultivated in the RRD after one generation (VN1) and seed derived from crops cultivated after two generations in the RRD (VN2). Although there was no significant difference in total yield and marketable yield by location, significant differences by variety and seed source were observed. For KT3, the yields declined sharply from 33.0 t/ha (WA) to 26.5 t/ha (VN1) and 23.3 t/ha (VN2). For Eben, the yields declined from 26.9 t/ha (WA) to 20.3 t/ha (VN1). For KT3, the marketable yields declined from 68.7% (WA) to 53.0% (VN1) and 44.6% (VN2) and for Eben from 57.7% (WA) to 44.5% (VN1). Although farmers paid significantly more to secure better quality seed, the additional income generated more than offset the increase in costs. For KT3, WA seed produced the highest net income (VND 42.0 m/ha) which declined to VND 29.4 m/ha for VN1 and VND 19.5 m/ha for VN2. For Eben, WA seed produced a net income of VND 27.8 m/ha compared to VND 16.5 m/ha for VN1.","[Hue, D. T.; Batt, P.

Using both econometric and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, we examine the conceptual and computational challenges associated with this class of problems and present findings on promising solution avenues. We demonstrate the relevance of accounting for congestion effects in recreation demand with an application to lake visits in Iowa. Our econometric and CGE results confirm that, for some plausible counterfactual scenarios, substantial differences exist between partial and general equilibrium welfare estimates. We conclude the paper by describing tasks that are needed to move forward research in this area. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper responds to growing evidence of failures of this assumption, particularly in the context of stated-preference methods widely used in environmental policy analysis. It proposes a non-paternalistic concept of consumer sovereignty that does not assume preference coherence, is satisfied by competitive markets, and can be applied to the provision of public goods. A key implication is that decisions should reflect valuations revealed 'at the point of consumption'. Such valuations, which can be inferred from hedonic prices, may be less susceptible to willingness-to-accept (WTA)/willingness-to-pay (WTP) disparities than those elicited by stated-preference methods.

Using a unique dataset of transactions and list prices between hospitals and insurers in the years 2005 and 2006, we estimate the influence of buyer and seller concentration on the negotiated prices. First, we use a traditional structure-conduct-performance model (SCP-model) along the lines of Melnick et al. (J Health Econ 11(3): 217-233, 1992) to estimate the effects of buyer and seller concentration on price-cost margins. Second, we model the interaction between hospitals and insurers in the context of a generalized bargaining model similar to Brooks et al. (J Health Econ 16: 417-434, 1997). In the SCP-model, we find that the market shares of hospitals (insurers) have a significantly positive (negative) impact on the hospital price-cost margin. In the bargaining model, we find a significant negative effect of insurer concentration, but no significant effect of hospital concentration. In both models, we find a significant impact of idiosyncratic effects on the market outcomes. This is consistent with the fact that the Dutch hospital sector is not yet in a long-run equilibrium.","[Halbersma, R. S.; Mikkers, M.

A notable illustration of the grousing importance of export restrictions was the establishment of a panel by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in December 2009 to examine complaints brought by the United States, the European Union (EU), and Mexico concerning China's export restriction policies. While export restrictions undermine the stability of the multilateral trading system by distorting global markets, the WTO law regulating this field arguably represents a case of 'under-regulation' or 'regulatory deficiency'. Hence, stricter WTO regulation in this area of apparently large 'policy space' is needed. However, various reform proposals submitted to the WTO face strong opposition mainly from developing countries. In this context, this article attempts to illustrate how a sufficiently 'differentiated' reform agenda on export restrictions could help maintain the stability of the multilateral trading system while addressing the legitimate concerns of developing countries.","Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Karapinar, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",baris.karapinar@wti.org,,,,,,,31,19,21,1,16,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Flat rate pensions and widespread home ownership have ensured relative equality in older life. However, in response to perceived fiscal pressures generated by population ageing, Australia has increasingly shifted its policy settings, encouraging private savings over public risk pooling. Private savings are increasingly supported by public subsidy through tax policy. This has led to overlapping policy priorities, as public subsidies are used both as incentives to promote savings and as social policy instruments to promote adequate living standards in retirement. This conflict is evident in recent policy reviews of taxation, public spending and pension policy This article explores the development of this conflict and how it manifests in proposals for reform. We argue that the conflation of welfare and taxation goals increasingly creates a dual welfare state that promotes private provision at the expense of both equity and efficiency We suggest that more explicit identification of the roles of tax policy, and the welfare implications of tax changes, would help to improve policy design.","[Spies-Butcher, Ben; Stebbing, Adam] Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Spies-Butcher, B (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",Benjamin.Spies-Butcher@mq.edu.au; Adam.Stebbing@mq.edu.au,,"Spies-Butcher, Benjamin/0000-0002-0427-5082; Stebbing, Adam/0000-0003-3476-2436",,,,,55,15,15,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

A. Juss are multipurpose trees widely used in Africa, but endangered in their natural environments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to define and promote conservation strategies for these key species. In this study we analyzed the current patterns of their use preferences by means of a cultural importance index. Local ecological knowledge on their conservation was investigated among local people living around Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in Benin. In total, 160 informants belonging to four ethnic groups (Gourmantche, Waama, Berba and Peulh) were interviewed in twelve villages. Male and female informants, aged between 20 and 90 years, were randomly selected in each ethnic group. For each species, a cultural importance index was calculated combining frequency and importance of use. This index allowed us to identify differences in use intensity within and among ethnic groups. Traditional ecological knowledge was tested as a dependent variable of ethnicity. A. africana was widely used as medicine, fodder and crafting by most communities, whereas P. erinaceus was the preferred source of fodder for all local people. K senegalensis was mostly used as medicine and fuel wood by most communities, except by the Peulh who preferably used it as fodder. The use of these trees as source of fuel wood was mostly reported by women while religious uses of these species were reported by old men from the Gourmantche ethnicity. Medicinal and fodder use of A africana, fodder use of P. erinaceus and medicinal use of K senegalensis had the highest overall cultural importance index value. Knowledge related to local extinction of the target species and their sustainable use varied among socio-cultural groups. The findings of the present study should be considered in future management plans towards an effective conservation of these tree species. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The common characteristic is that domestic and foreign capital seem to be complementary.

In contrast to the aggregate-level findings in the United States, earnings yield forecasts the time series of aggregate stock returns in emerging markets. We consider aggregate earnings not as normalizing variables for stock price but as predictive variables in their own right. Aggregate earnings covary with the market returns; hence, it is not just the mean reversion of stock prices that is responsible for the forecasting power of earnings yield. These results are robust across different estimation methods and after controlling for small-sample bias and macroeconomic variables.","[Demirtas, K.

J,"Fudge, N",,,,"Fudge, Nathan",,,Walter Mitty and the Dragon: An Analysis of the Possibility for WTO or IMF Action against China's Manipulation of the Yuan,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Given the recurring debate over whether China's monetary policies constitute currency manipulation actionable under the World Trade Organization (WTO) or International Monetary Funds (IMF) Agreements, a legal analysis of these possibilities is prudent. As shown in this article, China's policies do not run afoul of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing measures, as they do not constitute a financial contribution under Article 1.1(a)(1) nor are they 'specific' within the meaning of Article 5. These policies are also not prohibited by General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT,) Article XV, primarily because they are not covered by a proper interpretation of the scope of this Article. Finally, Article IV of the IMF Agreement is not violated because the necessary wrongful intent is not present and/or cannot be demonstrated. There is therefore no legal basis for action against China under these Agreements. Over the past year renewed calls for China to re-value its currency against the threat of legal action have been made in legal and economic periodicals, international conferences, and, perhaps most effectively, the US Congress. Considering the dismal state of the American and indeed the world economy, such a demand is not surprising. As one oldie world's largest markets, China's economic and political policies have a major impact on the global economy. If in fact the yuan - the basic denomination of the Renminbi (RMB) - is undervalued, it is generally agreed that Chinese exports would be favoured while international imports would be penalized. Thus, a strong argument exists for China to remedy this imbalance by re-valuing their currency. Despite this, commentators overshoot the mark when they demand legal action under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, GATT Article XV, or the IMF Articles of Agreement. The fact of the matter is that while a case may be made for the finding if a violation of one or more of these regimes, it is ultimately unlikely to succeed. The main reasons for tins are that the relevant articles are not intended to rover a situation where a country artificially keeps the value of its currency low, and that even if they can be read to, the facts do not support the finding of a violation in this case. Moreover, assuming that a violation could be found, serious difficulties arise with regard to implementing remedies. While there is an abundance of commentary on this issue, most authors focus on economic or political discussions and they are not necessarily incorrect for doing so. This paper, however, intends to fill the gap through an in depth analysis of whether China's policy is actionable under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the GATT, and/or the IMF Articles of Agreement. It will further be considered whether and what kind of remedies would be available in the event that a violation of one or more of these agreements is found. In the end, though, it will be seen that in this case it is better to simply let the dragon lie.",,,,n.l.fudge@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,5,6,0,18,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Despite all the efforts over the past 15 years since the Rio Summit, we have seen no improvement in the state of biodiversity; in fact, if anything, the decline has accelerated. The paper argues that problematic institutional incentive structures are an important contributing factor that aggravates biodiversity crisis worldwide. In this, countries do differ from each other, but in essence biodiversity loss has become more severe because of the empty status function for biodiversity and the organised irresponsibility allowed by erroneous natural resources policies not able to reasonably and efficiently address the interlinkedness of human and ecological systems. The paper uses Finland, Peru, and Russia as examples. The paper concludes by offering an explanatory hypothesis how slowly acknowledged significance of ecosystem functions and, consequently, ecosystem approach is initiating changes in the governance principles of forest resources in these three countries - and why.

Countries in transition (hereafter the countries of Eastern Europe and former Yugoslav countries that are still not members of euro zone), with their emerging economies, fuelled the growth with foreign capital and investments mostly in non-tradable sectors. Their exchange rates were anchored; commonly to exchange rate or inflation, aimed to fulfil the price stability goal. That is why the countries from our sample are divided in two groups: one is consisted of currency board countries and the other of those with more flexible regimes. The financial crisis opened many old questions but offering new answers because of the changed international economy. In the centre of our interest is the relationship of a chosen exchange rate regime with the consequences of a crisis, primary in terms of the sustainability of the regime and the key macroeconomic variables. Analysis is based on the (possible) connection between the consequences of the crisis and the chosen regime. Another important part of the research is the dilemma between monetary sovereignty and monetary integrations. The core question is the cost benefit trade off in terms of monetary sovereignty on one and monetary integrations on the other side. The official policies from countries of our interest have the same, ultimate goal: full membership in the European economic and monetary union. However, the recent crisis shed new light on it, with growing euroscepticizm. Paper ends in discussion on pros and cons of monetary sovereignty and monetary integrations. Some attention in the final part, in the context of the subject, is also given to the fiscal policies and its possible positive effects on solving the crisis.","[Kordic, Gordana] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg J F Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Kordic, G (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg J F Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",,"Kordić, Gordana/T-9764-2019; Kordic, Gordana/AAX-1526-2021","Kordić, Gordana/0000-0002-1914-2784;",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Both Web and Internet have created vast new opportunities, providing an infrastructure that enables buyers and sellers to find each other online. Companies can now offer many products, services and information easily and with lower costs. It becomes more and more difficult for customers to find quickly what they are looking for. Nevertheless, recommendation systems are playing a major role. Collaborative filtering (CF), or recommender system based-CF, has appeared as one methodology designed to perform such a recommendation task. These systems allow people to use expressed preferences of thousands of other people in order to find the product they desire based on the level of similarity between tastes. The concept has appeared from convergent research on search browsers, intelligent agents and data mining, and it allows to avoid the difficult question of why consumers prefer this or that product or brand. Early studies of electronic markets tools and recommender systems took a simplistic view of consumers as economic agents whose behavior was guided by the search for the lowest cost transactions. Moreover, most studies take into account only technical aspects of these systems like algorithms' development and computational problems. No study had been interested in recommendation's efficiency of collaborative filtering-based systems. This article explores the current state of research in recommender systems-based collaborative filtering and proposes an experiment to find if such electronic recommendations are better than human recommendations.","[Militaru, Dorin] Grp Sup Co Amiens Picardie, ESC Amiens, Dept Mkt, F-80038 Amiens, France; [Zaharia, Costin] MCF Univ Mans IUT GEA, F-75007 Paris, France; [Zaharia, Costin] IAE Paris 1, ENSAM Paris, ESTP Cachan, Paris, France",Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology,"Militaru, D (通讯作者)，Grp Sup Co Amiens Picardie, ESC Amiens, Dept Mkt, 18 Pl St Michel, F-80038 Amiens, France.",dorin.militaru@supco-amiens.fr; Costin.Zaharia@univ-lemans.fr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Because of this, plus an apparent lack of financial capital, it is difficult for smallholder farmers to meet the large volume demands imposed by institutional buyers and wholesalers. The small volume and the large variation in quality puts smallholder farmers at a significant disadvantage when it comes to arranging transport and marketing. However, smallholder farmers can engage in collaborative cluster farming in order to meet the demands of the market and to bolster production volume. In the cluster, the farmers carry out production planning and marketing activities collectively. Utilizing the case study method and the 8-step clustering approach formulated by the Catholic Relief Services, this paper will present key success factors and several challenges faced by the Small Farmers Association of Quirogpang (SFAQ) in Marilog, Davao City, Philippines. At the same time, it will identify important institutional supports and strategies that may enhance the success of this and other clusters. The paper highlights key success factors such as the social connections shared by the cluster members and leadership.

Specifically, the study attempts to examine the relevance of the tourism-led growth hypothesis using data from Tanzania. In an attempt to avoid the problem of omission bias that is always associated with a bivariate causality analysis, the study incorporates the real exchange rate in the bivariate model between tourism development and economic growth thereby creating a simple trivariate causality framework between tourism, real exchange rate and economic growth. The empirical results show that whilst tourism development and economic growth Granger-cause each other in the short run, in the long run, it is economic growth that drives the development of the tourism sector in Tanzania. The results also show that there is a short run bidirectional causality between tourism development and exchange rate, and between economic growth and exchange rate in Tanzania. The long run results, however, show that there is a distinct unidirectional causality from exchange rate to tourism development.","Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Odhiambo, NM (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",nmbaya99@yahoo.com,,"Odhiambo, Nicholas .M./0000-0003-4988-0259",,,,,31,37,39,2,20,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Drawing on ethnographic research done between 2006 and 2008, the paper tracks how medical-scientific architects of these donation programs (NGO and pharmaceutical executives, tropical medicine experts, Ministries of Health) understand the labor of the drug recipients, how they imagine community participation, and how they value their own participation in the program. The paper incorporates interviews with past and present pharmaceutical company employees, elaborating their understandings of the relationships and values created by the donations, and their obligations within the programs. Scientist-administrators involved with the program envision community participation as being joyful and self-interested, and they show great excitement and pride in the power of their donated drugs. In contrast, interviews with farmers and local health volunteers drawn from a research trip to the Morogoro region of Tanzania show the ambivalent, conflicted, and sometimes resentful understanding of labor involved with the drug donation programs, labor which arrives in the form of distribution tasks and hygienic strictures associated with free, powerful drugs. The local scene provides a critical counterpoint to positive imaginations of community ownership and participation in health interventions, and points to systemic misunderstandings within the reciprocal relationship between African drug recipients and the American and European scientist-administrators who design and direct these programs.","[Samsky, Ari] Univ Iowa, Global Hlth Studies Program, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Samsky, A (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Global Hlth Studies Program, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",ari-samsky@uiowa.edu,,,Princeton University's Center for Health and Wellbeing; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies; Princeton Center for Migration and Development; Office the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University,Princeton University's Center for Health and Wellbeing; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies; Princeton Center for Migration and Development; Office the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University,"The author gratefully acknowledges the research support of Princeton University's Center for Health and Wellbeing, the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies, the Princeton Center for Migration and Development, and the Office the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University.

Until 2009, the fishery was managed by a regulated open-access system with clear symptoms of the race for fish. We argue that the new regime has stopped the race for fish, reduced the number of vessels participating in the fishery, and prolonged the fishing season. Furthermore, the IVQs appear to have improved profitability in the fishery and increased value-added production in the Peruvian anchovy value chains. This provides support that developing countries with presumed weaker institutions can reap benefits of such management systems. However, there appears to have been setbacks in 2010, as the number of participating vessels has once again increased. This indicates that the institutions that regulate and monitor the fishery must be further strengthened.","[Paredes, Carlos E.] Univ San Martin de Porres, Inst Peru, Lima 27, Peru; [Peina-Torres, Julio] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Econ y Negocios ILADES, Santiago, Chile; [Tveteras, Sigbjorn] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica, Lima 33, Peru",Universidad de San Martin de Porres; Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Tveteras, S (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica, Jr Daniel Alomia Robles 125, Lima 33, Peru.",stveteras@pucp.pe; carlos.paredes@institutodelperu.org.pe; jpena@uahurtado.cl,"Tveteraas, SIgbjorn/Y-2283-2019; Tveteras, Sigbjorn/A-9724-2012",,,,,,28,39,50,0,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

I find that the change from affirmative action to the Top 10% Plan in Texas decreased both retention and graduation rates of lower-ranked minority students. Results show that both fall-to-fall freshmen retention and six-year college graduation of second-decile minority students decreased, respectively, by 2.4 and 3.3 percentage points. The effect of the change in admissions policy was slightly larger for minority students in the third and lower deciles: fall-to-fall freshmen retention and six-year college graduation decreased, respectively, by 4.9 and 4.2 percentage points. Moreover, I find no evidence in support of the minority mismatch hypothesis. These results suggest that most of the increase in the graduation gap between minorities and non-minorities in Texas, a staggering 90%, was driven by the elimination of affirmative action in the 1990s.

Also, domestic workers have to make much harder trade-offs between their family's livelihood and daily care needs.

We show that in many cases it is optimal for the decision maker to allocate all resources to the most promising alternative in each time period.

I have no quarrel with Sardar's conclusion that these times are postnormal, nor do I disagree with many of his observations, but our standpoints regarding implications are somewhat contradictory. Paradoxically, rather than jump into an old paradigm form of debate with Sardar's interpretations of postnormalcy, this rejoinder is a playful postformal response. I celebrate our complementary views as expressions of the complex truths of multiperspectivality. First I question the meaning of normal and postnormal in the context of such notions as the pathology of normalcy. Secondly I begin to explore the postnormal circumstances from a postformal perspective. This involves discussion of notions of progress, development, evolution and co-evolution from different points of view as an opener to coming to terms with complexity. I then explore how concepts such as complexity and paradox can be understood as paths to wisdom; how active imagination can be engaged in the service of life; and how engaged imagination can unfold new normative narratives of alternative futures. Such imaginaries of hope are vital for the wellbeing of young people. The essay closes with a call to embrace the richness of complexity and play with rather than fear the paradox of planetary pluralism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of increased outpatient care on hospital costs and efficiency using Finnish specialty-level data from years 2003-2006 to which we applied stochastic frontier analysis. The results reveal that outpatient services have a smaller impact on total costs than inpatient services. At the same time, increased outpatient activity appears to have an adverse effect on estimated cost efficiency. This counterintuitive finding is probably due to the low weight given to outpatient activities by the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) system. A common weighting for inpatient and outpatient services is required in order to assess accurately the impact of outpatient care on efficiency.","[Vitikainen, Kirsi; Linna, Miika] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf THL, Ctr Hlth & Social Econ CHESS, Helsinki 00271, Finland; [Vitikainen, Kirsi; Street, Andrew] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare; University of York - UK,"Vitikainen, K (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Hlth & Welf THL, Ctr Hlth & Social Econ CHESS, POB 30, Helsinki 00271, Finland.",kirsi.vitikainen@thl.fi,,"Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364",,,,,22,15,18,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Three states out of 6 states in the study area were purposively selected to cover 3 ethnic groups. A state was selected to cover at least one ethnic group. 4 villages were randomly selected in each state to make a total of 12 sample villages. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire from 20 randomly selected rural women in each sample village to make a total of 240 respondents. Interview schedule was used to get information from 3 key informants in each sample village. The results of the study showed that rural women have restricted access to the exploitation of firewood and forest fruits on communal and family lands in the study area. They however have free and independent access to exploit fodder among the 3 ethnic groups while rural women have free access to exploit snails and mushrooms among the Yoruba ethnic groups in the study area. Chi-square test (p<0.05) shows that a significant association exists between total income earned by rural women and the income they earned from the exploitation of forest resources in the study area. This means that if the access of rural women to the exploitation of forest resources in the study area is improved, income earned by rural women will also increase. The results further showed that the impacts of the access of rural women to the exploitation of forest resources on rural household welfare include provisions of income, food and medicinal materials as well as money rural women spent on their children's education, health care and household feeding.

Problems with the SRAS curve are shown first for the AD/AS model that casts the AD curve as identifying the equilibrium level of output associated with each price level (as found in most intermediate macroeconomics textbooks). Problems are then shown for the AD/AS model in which the AD curve is more modestly assumed to capture the relationship between the price level and aggregate expenditures (as found in principles of economics textbooks).,"James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",James Madison University,"Elwood, SK (通讯作者)，James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",elwoodsk@jmu.edu,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

This paper examines different types of trader behavior at the close before and after institution of the new mechanism. The results show that, since the new mechanism was introduced, individuals have shifted their trades away from the closing interval to the preclosing interval, which worsens market liquidity at the close. This paper also finds that institutional investors try to influence closing prices for window dressing at quarter ends, whereas foreign institutions attempt to influence closing prices on the expiration days of index futures. After the new mechanism's introduction, neither the expiration-day effect nor the quarter-end-day effect disappeared. Despite this finding, the new mechanism does make it more difficult and costly for traders to attempt to influence the stock price.","[Huang, Yu Chuan] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chan, Shu Hui] Cheng Shiu Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chan, Shu Hui] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Cheng Shiu University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",ychuang@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw; u9327908@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,29,9,10,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The report rests on data from a recent Production Assessment where a wide range of measures to increase short and long term forest growth for the company were identified. The measures examined are the use of genetically improved materials, fertilisation, maintenance of ditches, improved seedling quality, treatment against beetles (Hylobius abietis L.) and introduction of lodgepole pine (Pious contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm). The majority of the silvicultural measures proved profitable. Changing species from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to lodgepole pine and the use of genetically improved regeneration materials were found to be very profitable due to low investment costs and considerable increase of forest growth. Fertilisation proved highly profitable but the measure has a drawback of being expensive. However, fertilisation has an advantage of an earlier effect on timber harvest due to a short investment period. Linear programming was used to determine the optimal mix of measures with varying budgets. At present the company's silvicultural budget is around 100 million SEK annually. Increasing the silvicultural budget by 5 million SEK would result in an increase in net present value of almost 24.2 million SEK. This represents 48% of the increase of net present value if all the profitable measures are carried out. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Students' nuisance is defined by students' pestering the professors for better grades. This paper contains two parts: the game theoretic model and the empirical tests. The model shows that the potential threat of students' nuisance can induce the professors to inflate grades. Ceteris paribus, a student is more likely to study little and to pester the professor for a better grade if: (1) the professor is lenient; (2) the studying cost is high; (3) the reward from pestering is high; (4) the cost of pestering is low. My original survey data show that 70%+ of professors think that students' nuisance is annoying and costly in terms of time, effort, and energy. Regression results indicate that the more the student values the grade, the higher the studying cost, and the more likely the student is to pester the professor.(1) (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Franz, WJI (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",wfranz@uci.edu,,,,,,,18,22,33,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

The open enrollment program in Massachusetts is unique in testing the strategic competition thesis because it allows students to attend public schools located outside their home district. For each student who transfers out, funds are deducted from the sending district's local aid distribution and added to the receiving district's local aid. Thus, school districts no longer have the assurance of a ready supply of students and funding, instead they have to compete with neighboring districts, and enact strategies that will help retain as well as attract more students. A spatial econometric framework is applied to disentangle the correlation due to strategic interaction from the one that is simply due to spatially correlated error shocks. The results show that public school districts respond positively to the expenditure decisions of neighboring districts, thereby acting strategically when setting their own spending levels.

In addition to its dialectical process side, CSM offers computational capabilities for devising and figuring out change scenarios.

Reaching beyond volumes, I explore the effect of European emerging economies' recent institutional trade liberalization on extensive (i.e., the set of imported goods) versus intensive import margins (volumes per imported good) with highly disaggregated data. Differentiating goods categories by use, I find robust evidence of stronger extensive import margin effects of liberalization for intermediate and capital goods compared to consumer goods. This identifies an important channel for the link between reforms and growth in transition. The results also support new models of heterogeneous firms and trade, which predict that extensive import margin effects of a country's institutional trade liberalization should-through lowering fixed costs for rest-of-the-world exporters-increase with decreasing substitutability among products.","[Frensch, Richard] Osteuropa Inst Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; [Frensch, Richard] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, D-8400 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Frensch, R (通讯作者)，Osteuropa Inst Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.",frensch@osteuropa-institut.de,,,,,,,33,20,22,3,17,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",1540-496X,,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Social constructionists and organizational theorists have indicated that the future of an organization can be enacted by its constituents. Yet it is apparent that scenario planning techniques, used by organizations to plan for their future, tend to emphasize a future that the organization must react to instead of create. By emphasizing a future that the organizations must react to, it may ignore and completely miss the opportunity it has to create or enact the future it wants to have. Scenario planning, however, can evolve to support a creative foresight and approach to the future by recognizing the power behind enactment theory and applying a goal-oriented approach to the scenario planning process. Using goal-oriented scenario planning an organization can match the world it wants with the world it expects to see. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Secondly, there are different long-term effects and short-term effects that fixed-asset investment drives on employment in three industries; Thirdly, domestic loans and employment of the secondary industry was positively correlated; self-financing and other funds is related to employment of tertiary industry; state budget funds is associated with employment of primary industry.","[Li Jing; Fan Fan] Yangtze Univ, Inst Econ, Jinzhou 434000, Peoples R China",Yangtze University,,skyli8406@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54629-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,379,383,,,,,,5,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300067800059,0

A demographic anticipation model based on the difference between rural and urban areas, different ages and different sexes is established. For the analysis on agricultural labor demand in the future, regression analysis model has been adopted. Lastly, data comparison analysis method has been used to get the final conclusion that is although the rural labors' nonagricultural transferring stock will have some increase, rural surplus labors will be zero, and the rural labor's supply will be less than its demand in the following ten years.

The policies selected represent actual policies enacted by federal and state governments to provide incentive to biomass utilization and are aimed at addressing particular challenges in the production lifecycle of trees to final product. Policies were modeled to compare financial impacts on a per-acre project basis for three scenarios of harvest intensity in southwestern ponderosa pine stands classified as being at high risk of wildfire. This allowed for identification of key cost nodes and how particular policies might better allocate limited resources. Effects of limiting the size of trees harvested and access to biomass markets were also modeled. This analysis showed that the co-location of processing facilities that results in shorter distances traveled is the single most important strategy for reducing costs for all three scenarios modeled. Per acre subsidies and certified product premiums were the next highest ranked in providing economic incentive, followed by production tax credits and cost-share programs. Fuel surcharge waivers and transport tax credits provided the least gains. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It was found out that the annual value can range between 2.35 and 19.9 million Euros depending on the assumption with respect to who are the beneficiaries of the project. This value is important since old growth trees are used less for active recreation but has an important role in the heritage of the country. As such they should be allocated funds to be preserved.

This could be particularly true in Turkey, where inter-provincial mobility is high and where striking differences in educational resources and therefore educational success across regions persist. Using the 1990 and 2000 Turkish Censuses, this study exploits variations over time in the inflow of internal migrants across provinces to identify the causal effect of internal migration on natives' educational outcomes. The evidence suggests that the inflow of migrants lowers natives' completion rates for middle school and high school. Evidence also indicates that while the negative effects appear to be greater among native children from low-SES households, native high-SES households are able to mitigate these adverse effects for their children. Furthermore, the estimated effects exhibit some differences by children's gender and migrant status. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

First it argues for a metric: maximizing the probability that humans and their technology in space someday reach what Rostow called the economic takeoff' point where autonomous growth becomes possible, not bound by the rate of growth on earth. Next it discusses three concrete requirements to reach that point: benefits to earth which exceed costs to earth, large and diverse enough exports from space to earth, and advancements in technology and infrastructure. Energy from space (ES) is now one of the most promising export possibilities, based on what was learned in the last open US government effort on that topic, JIETSSP, led jointly by NSF and NASA. I review several options for ES, and propose a new one which, while slightly riskier, offers real hope of electricity at a price that could compete with coal and fission-plus-enrichment.

J,"Desta, MG",,,,"Desta, Melaku Geboye",,,Accession for What? An Examination of Ethiopia's Decision to Join the WTO,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Ethiopia, a founding member of many of the international and regional organizations today and the second most populous country in the UN list of least-developed countries (LDCs), is currently in the early stages of negotiating its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). This article asks the basic questions of why Ethiopia uncharacteristically stayed out of such an important multilateral endeavour for so long and why it wants to join now, and what the potential implications of the decision to join the system will be for the legal, institutional and economic policy landscape of the country both during the accession process as well as after achieving membership. The Ethiopian Government argues that WTO accession would help facilitate economic growth, attract foreign investment, secure predictable and transparent market access, and allow it to have a say on the direction of globalization. While many of these are in line with the conventional explanations about the benefits of WTO accession, this article argues that the balance of rights and obligations contained in the WTO legal framework and its enforcement mechanism mean that Ethiopia's ability to make use of the system to realize these ambitions is, at best, limited. However, the article concludes with a positive note that, if the accession process is handled carefully and final membership obligations carried out in good filth, WTO accession is likely to contribute to those goals indirectly through, inter alia, the review and reform of national laws and policies, the establishment of objective, impartial and effective administrative procedures and implementing institutions, and its potential overall contribution to the establishment of a system of rule of law, administrative transparency and accountability in the country.","[Desta, Melaku Geboye] Univ Dundee, CEPMLP, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Desta, Melaku Geboye] Univ Addis Ababa, Sch Law, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Dundee; Addis Ababa University,"Desta, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, CEPMLP, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",m.g.desta@dundee.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Modal narratives concern themselves with contingency and determinism: with questions of possibility and necessity. While scenarios are future-oriented, focused on what might yet be, counterfactuals are narratives of what might have been. Despite this fundamental temporal difference, consideration of the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of modal narratives as a genre enables us to elucidate some critical issues concerning scenarios as a foresight methodology. In particular, the scenario literature has tended to avoid extended discussion of its implicit assumptions concerning causation, necessity, possibility and contingency. By confronting the modal nature of foresight methodologies more explicitly, the futures community may begin to lay more secure philosophical foundations for their deployment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Of all federal agencies in the United States, the Forest Service prepares the most Environmental Impact Statements under NEPA. The U.S. Forest Service manages the National Forest System. public forestlands comprising approximately 9% of the United States land area. The overall objectives of this study were to (I) determine the litigants, success rates, and management activities disputed for NEPA litigation involving the Forest Service from 1970 to 2001 and (2) examine differences and patterns in cases among the U.S. District, Circuit, and Supreme Courts. Methods include a historical analysis of published court cases and results show an increasing trend in the number of NEPA-Forest Service cases in the federal courts. Environmental groups were the most common litigants in NEPA-Forest Service cases and timber harvesting, management plans, and endangered species were the subject of the majority of cases in both the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Forest Service won a preponderance of cases in which they were involved with success rates of 60% in U.S. District Court, 57% in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and 100% in the U.S. Supreme Court.

An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds-testing procedure and Granger causality within vector error-correction models (VECM) are applied to the period after the liberalization of capital flows (August 1989-August 2006). The results of the ARDL bounds test support the theory that exchange market pressure is in a long-run equilibrium relation with the three hypothesized variables over the sample period. On the other hand, the results of the short-run and long-run Granger causality tests indicate the existence of Granger causality running from the three variables to exchange market pressure.

Key respondents from academia, government and the seed industry were interviewed and the literature reviewed to document the role of plant breeding in this transformation. The main contributions from the public sector were to evaluate and characterize germplasm and to develop breeding stocks and improved OP cultivars. On the other hand, the private seed companies' main contributions were to supply sufficient quantities of high quality seed and to develop commercial hybrids that combined superior quality with yield, tropical adaptation and pest resistance. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the diverse roles of plant breeding in shaping the vegetable industry. In the future, plant breeding will be shaped by such factors as climate change, and shifts in consumption patterns and retail marketing. Research will be constrained by the decline in public sector activity, reduced access to germplasm and declining output of trained plant breeders by universities. A seed company in the future will be offering a more diverse menu of agricultural inputs and services, in addition to selling seeds.","Univ Philippines Mindanao, Davao 8000, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Mindanao,"Rasco, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines Mindanao, Davao 8000, Philippines.",,"Rasco, Eufemio/KBP-7767-2024",,,,,,33,0,0,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,35,54,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300002,0

The first agriculture typology has reached high levels of productivity but it is also a big producer of negative externalities. On the contrary, traditional agriculture is based on virtuous and sustainable productive activities but lacks in terms of productivity. In this article, we will develop a theoretical framework which encompasses the different patterns of endogenous development in both agriculture typologies. For this reason, initially we will refer to the theory of rural endogenous development. This theory searches phenomena of self-centred and conservative development, which can occur in less favoured agricultural areas excluded by the modernised processes (such as mountainous areas). In regards to the European dualistic model, the paradigm of rural endogenous development will be extended to typologies of modernised agriculture. Finally, we will analyse the neoclassic doctrine of the economic growth and its evolutionary course, stressing the pros and cons of such doctrine by explaining rural endogenous development phenomena.","[Sortino, Antonio; Fa, Margherita Chang Ting] Univ Udine, Dept Biol & Agroind Econ, I-33100 Udine, Italy",University of Udine,,antonio.sortino@uniud.it,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,8,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,111,117,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700014,0

We use data from the recent U.K. Labour Force Surveys which provide a sufficiently large sample to consider the effects of the subject studied, class of first degree, and postgraduate qualifications. Ordinary Least Squares estimates show high average returns for women that does not differ by subject. For men, we find very large returns for Law, Economics and Management but not for other subjects. Degree class has large effects in all subjects suggesting the possibility of large returns to effort. Postgraduate study has large effects, independently of first degree class. A large rise in tuition fees across all subjects has only a modest impact on relative rates of return suggesting that little substitution across subjects would occur. The strong message that comes out of this research is that even a large rise in tuition fees makes little difference to the quality of the investment - those subjects that offer high returns (LEM for men, and all subjects for women) continue to do so. And those subjects that do not (especially OSSAH for men) will continue to offer poor returns. The effect of fee rises is dwarfed by existing cross subject differences in returns.

We propose a generalisation of the mixed logit enabling the degree of skew of marginal utility distributions to be estimated. The implementation is Bayesian with the marginal likelihood used as an arbiter of model performance. We find strong evidence of skew in the distributions of marginal utilities for most attributes. Models incorporating skew are preferred in all cases. The irrelevance of an attribute to significant numbers of respondents is a possible cause of such skew. We test alternative empirical accommodations of self-reported attribute non-attendance (ANA) and continue to find strong evidence of skew in the distributions of marginal utilities even having accounted for ANA. We find that, contrary to some recent findings, respondents who report having ignored an attribute typically do indeed have a zero marginal utility for that attribute. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the paper considers the recasting of the former Labour government's work incentives and welfare disincentives amidst mounting pressures on public expenditure. The reorientation of state assistance towards work, coupled with the proposed simplification of working-age benefits and tax credits, is argued to present a particular challenge to the financial security and autonomy of women, signalling the end of the process of modernizing the welfare system that was forged around the single earner family model in the period of post-war austerity.","Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"MacLeavy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",julie.macleavy@bristol.ac.uk,,"MacLeavy, Julie/0000-0001-8158-0665",,,,,65,117,127,1,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The model illuminates a central tension between the congestion externality familiar from conventional club theory and the free-riding externality familiar from the theory on private provision of public goods. We compare three common program sponsors governments, industry, and environmental groups. We find that if monitoring of the club standard is perfect, a government constrained from regulating club size may prefer to leave sponsorship to industry if public-good benefits are sufficiently low, or to environmentalists if public-good benefits are sufficiently high. If monitoring is imperfect, an important question is whether consumers can infer that a club is too large for its standard to be credible. If they can then the government may deliberately choose an imperfect monitoring mechanism as a way of regulating club size indirectly. If they cannot then this reinforces the government's preference for delegating sponsorship. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

While the miracle of management - its structures, processes and techniques - has provided humankind with quantum advances in standard of living, there is an emerging theme in the literature to suggest that Management 1.0 founded within the industrial age paradigm has reached the limits of its relevance. This paper proposes that it is time to consider a new conceptualization - Management 2.0 - based on the global, information age paradigm in which modern businesses compete. This paper examines six forces which are currently redefining the future of management, as follows: the virtualization of work, the rise of open-source work practices, the decline of organizational hierarchy, the transcendence of Generation Y values, the tumult of global markets and the imperative of business sustainability. An organizational case study is provided in response to each force as an exemplar of modern management evolution. Scenarios for the future of the workplace are proposed.

At the age of 12 Dutch students can enrol in tracked schools or in comprehensive schools. The comprehensive schools postpone enrolment into tracked classes by one or two years. OLS- and IV-estimates, using regional variation in the supply of schools as instruments, show that early tracking has a detrimental effect on completion of higher education for students at the margin of the Dutch high and low tracks. The negative effects of early tracking are larger for students with relatively high ability or students with a higher socioeconomic background. In addition, we find no negative effects of comprehensive classes on higher ability students. These results suggest that increasing participation in comprehensive classes would increase graduation from higher education. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the initially positive results, the Forest Department decided to continue and scale up this participatory approach to all Benin's protected areas. Focusing on the relationships between the actors involved, this paper seeks to explain the dynamics of the participatory management process in the Oueme Superieur and N'Dali forests in Northern Benin. The analysis is based on data gathered from interviews with the different actors involved. The study shows that social cohesion between people involved in CBNRM, the Forest Rangers and local communities was built at the beginning of the process, but then disappeared and was followed by conflict. Stakeholders interpreted and made sense of formally declared participatory management rules (formal institutions) and gradually developed informal relationships, rules and routines (informal institutions) that facilitated the collaboration process and resulted in social cohesion. Conflicts and distrust emerged when replacement CBNRM officers did not respect the informal rules of conduct. The case shows that it is the state of informal rules and relationships that determines the success of a collaborative process rather than formally declared institutions; hence this should be recognized.

Although there are a few appraisal methods that consider negative long-term influences on forest regeneration, hitherto no approach has addressed the financial consequences of lost admixed tree species. A homogenised species composition may lead to an increased financial risk of a forest. Based on financial return and risk ratios of mixed forests, this paper derives the financial compensation that would be necessary to make acceptable the increased risk of pure forest for forest owners. In this conceptual case study we consider a two-species mixed forest (Norway spruce, Picea abies [L.] Karst. and European beech, Fagus sylvatica L.) and calculate a tree species composition with maximum financial return per unit of risk. The financial indicators were generated via 1000 Monte Carlo scenarios, which consider natural hazard risks as well as timber price fluctuations. In case of an assumed reduction of European beech in different mixed forests by 30 percentage points, a compensation rate for ungulate browsing of between 16 and 23 (sic) ha(-1) yr(-1) was estimated. Compared to the annual gains of mixed-forest between 89 and 113 (sic) ha(-1) yr(-1) for admixtures of beech between 70 and 30 percent, we consider this amount substantial and conclude that the appraisal of game browsing effects should include the changed risk profiles between homogenised and mixed forests.

The purpose of this study was to identify the utility or disutility of three injection-related attributes (dose frequency, dose flexibility, injection site reaction) that may influence patient preference. Patients with type 2 diabetes in Scotland completed standard gamble (SG) interviews to assess the utility of hypothetical health states and their own current health state. The EQ-5D, PGWB, IWQOL-Lite, and QIDS were also administered. Construct validity and differences among health states were examined. A total of 151 patients completed interviews. Of the three injection-related attributes, dose frequency was the only attribute with a statistically significant impact on utility (in a multiple regression model, p = 0.01). Weekly injections were associated with an average added utility of 0.023 in comparison to everyday injections. Flexible dosing and injection site reactions resulted in somewhat smaller utility shifts that were in the expected directions (+0.006 and -0.011, respectively). SG utility of current health (mean = 0.897) demonstrated construct validity through statistically significant correlations with patient-reported outcome measures. The three injection attributes were associated with small utility shifts in the expected directions. Dose frequency appears to be the most important of the three attributes from the patients' perspective. The vignette-based SG approach was feasible and useful for assessing added utility or disutility of injection-related attributes associated with treatments for type 2 diabetes.","[Matza, Louis S.; Walter, Kimberly N.; Van Brunt, Kate; Palsgrove, Andrew C.] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Boye, Kristina S.; Tynan, Aodan] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",United Biosource Corporation; Eli Lilly,"Matza, LS (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",louis.matza@unitedbiosource.com,,,,,,,80,96,99,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The analysis uses fifteen years of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to demonstrate that conclusions about the relationship between education and labor market risk are sensitive to how extreme values of labor income are treated. The untrimmed estimates imply that college graduates experience 75% less transitory labor market risk than high school dropouts. However, applying commonly used trimming procedures results in estimates of a one standard deviation transitory labor market shock for high school dropouts being reduced by between $2700 and $4500, or 14% and 24% of annual earnings.

In addition, the effects of equity price shocks appear to be similar for emerging Asia and Latin America, but credit shocks are more important in Latin America. Moreover, shocks to the lending rate have a pronounced and negative impact in emerging European markets.

This study reports that heaping is present in monthly earnings reports for publicly listed companies in Taiwan. We find that Taiwanese firms tend to report monthly earnings in increments of 5 in the first two places (digits) of the earnings numbers. Furthermore, we observe predominantly more zeros in the third through fifth places of monthly earnings numbers, suggesting that monthly earnings tend to be reported in increments of 10 in the first three, first four, and first five places. Reporting of monthly earnings in Taiwan is discretionary, and our findings suggest that managers of Taiwanese firms are susceptible to heuristic bias when reporting monthly earnings.

The results of these studies generally find substantial variations in health-related patterns between both population groups. In this study, we use the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique to explore to what extent disparities in the probability of using medical care use can be attributed to differences in the determinants of use due to, e.g. a different demographic structure of the immigrant collective, rather than to a different effect of health care use determinants by nationality, holding all other factors equal. Our findings show that unexplained factors associated to immigrant status determine to a great extent disparities in the probability of using hospital, specialist and emergency services of immigrants relative to Spaniards, while individual characteristics, in particular self-reported health and chronic conditions, are much more important in explaining the differences in the probability of using general practitioner services between immigrants and Spaniards.","[Jimenez-Rubio, Dolores] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business Sci, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Hernandez-Quevedo, Cristina] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Observ Hlth Syst & Policies, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Granada; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Observatory on Health Systems & Policies,"Jiménez-Rubio, D (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Campus Univ Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",dolores@ugr.es,"Hernandez-Quevedo, Cristina/AAX-5316-2021","Jimenez-Rubio, Dolores/0000-0001-7274-1893",,,,,33,47,49,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

As a business opportunity and a chance for survival in conditions of crisis, there is the cost management. Within this area, which many authors define as a focused action toward lowering costs and achieving greater business profits, measuring of the dynamic of economy can be successfully applied with the developed analytical instrument. Analysis of the economy, as the relationship between realized returns and resources expended, is very important because, on the basis of the results, business decisions can be made that managers would try to use to direct the company towards achieving outlined objectives.

Using advanced panel data methods on European Community Household Panel (ECHP) data for 1994-2001, this study finds women's employment to be negatively associated with informal caregiving to the elderly across the European Union. For the countries included in the study, the effects of informal caregiving seem to be more negative in Southern Europe, less negative in Nordic countries, and in between these extremes in Central Europe. This study explains that since eldercare is a choice in countries with more formal care and less pronounced gendered care norms, the weaker impact of eldercare on women's employment in these countries has to do with the lesser degree of coercion in the caring decision.",,,,,,,,,,,49,73,79,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Test results strongly reject source aggregation; however, source-wise dependence could not be rejected. Furthermore, source-aggregated demand was significantly more price-elastic when compared to source-wise dependent demand.

The European Union (EU) has not always supported the co-financing of projects devised as PPP. In 2003 European Commission, through Directorate General for Regional Policy, published Guidelines for Successful Public-private partnership and in 2004 Green paper on public-private partnerships and Community law on public contracts and concessions. European Union encourages a wider application of this form of financing that demonstrates a huge potential in accomplishing public services, that is, projects intended for the public. Croatia has just begun with implementation of PPP projects as they are seen as capable of ensuring faster construction and better management of business facilities that would have a number of positive effects on the economy in general. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the global financial and economic crisis during the past two years has affected the cooperation of public and private sectors and the implementation of PPP projects. The approach used implies comparison between the number of contracted partnership projects in the EU and Croatia before and during the global crisis and analysis of economic conditions in the countries of the EU and Croatia. As the results of the research, conclusion whether global crisis has accelerated or stopped the implementation of PPP projects will be drawn. Also, some suggestions that will facilitate and accelerate the implementation of PPP projects and possible exit from the global crisis will be proposed.","[Peric, Marko; Dragicevic, Daniel] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Naselje Ika 51410, Opatija, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Peric, M (通讯作者)，Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Naselje Ika 51410, Opatija, Croatia.",markop@fthm.hr; danield@fthm.hr,"Dragičević, Daniel/O-2272-2018; Peric, Marko/Q-6495-2018","Dragičević, Daniel/0000-0001-7115-8380; Peric, Marko/0000-0002-2828-4709","Ministry of Science, Educations and Sport of the Republic of Croatia; [116/1162459-2456]","Ministry of Science, Educations and Sport of the Republic of Croatia;","This article was written as part of the scientific project Quality Models and Public Private Partnership in Croatian Tourism (project no. 116/1162459-2456), conducted with the support of the Ministry of Science, Educations and Sport of the Republic of Croatia.",,33,0,0,0,10,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

It deals with the past and future of fishery economics. A short historical account (or pedigree) shows that while fisheries have been mentioned by historians of old economies, their writings chiefly covered only the fish trade. This was also true of early economists, such as Petty and Adam Smith. It was marine biologists who were to show the way. Around the time of the Great War the first bits of genuine fishery economic analysis appeared. These, however were generally disregarded until Scott Gordon's 1954 article caused what Thomas Kuhn calls a revolution. My own paper appeared a year later. There followed what looked like decades of comparative calmness in ocean economics. The advent of individual catch quotas has now widened and deepened the interest in fishery problems and those paradigms related to them, such as those appropriate to fishery self-government. The new problems and possibilities have drawn in lively and creative participants. They work in the front ranks of applied economics, and the author is proud to have been honoured by them.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Scott, A (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Room 997,Buchanan Tower,1873 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",adscott@interchange.ubc.ca,,,,,,,45,5,6,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

After accounting for other liquidity-related factors, we present strong evidence that the level of corporate governance is positively related to firm liquidity. An increase of 1 percent in corporate governance index (total 100 percent) is on average associated with a 1.2 percent increase in a firm's annual turnover ratio over the subsequent year. Results from examinations of subindices of corporate governance provide further support for the positive governance-liquidity relation.

This contribution deals with the level of satisfaction of students and their results. The analysis is based on a survey which investigates the appreciation of different subject by the students from the centers of distance studies of the Czech University of Life Sciences. The most important in the investigation are the student's views on the contribution of subjects for themselves, their motivation for study and their way to self study. We compare the results of the students from the centers of distance studies and regular students and have not found really remarkable differences. The good (not worse) results of students from the centers of distance studies can be explained by more intensive motivation (mainly ambition for better job) which implies more intensive and more responsible preparation for exams.

Chen and West (2000) predict that voters' attitudes towards selective vouchers (SV) may be different. They claim that voters are indifferent between the no-voucher and SV regimes, unless competition leads to a reduction in the education price. I show that, when public schools are congested, the majority of voters are in favour of SV. Furthermore, SV induces a Pareto improvement. In equilibrium, the introduction of SV induces a reduction in income stratification at school, with some relatively poor students attending private schools. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In our sample, the proportion of science majors has remained steady over the sample period; however, the number entering our college intending to major in STEM fields has fallen. In this paper we use administrative data from the graduating classes of 2001-2009, roughly 5000 graduates, from a northeastern liberal arts college to model the progression of students through STEM majors. The results suggest that absolute and sometimes relative grades are important, as is the intended major (as reported on the admissions application). AP credits are also strongly correlated to taking a first course, but diminish in the more selected samples. Simulations suggest that if science grade distributions were more like the college average, there would be roughly 2-4% more students progressing in STEM departments. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the purposes of Wild Cards is to test the ability of a system - usually a large organisation - to react to unforeseen but high-impact events. The work presented in this article was undertaken in the context of the project on 'Spatial Scenarios' for the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) Programme. In this project, four Wild Cards were introduced: an era of energy scarcity, the demise of Europe's social security system, the gulf stream stops, and the dollar goes down the drain. These Wild Cards were introduced to investigate how external events may have asymmetric impacts across the European territory, to include some reflections on themes that were not included in the integrated scenarios, and to raise awareness of the fact that today's policy choices have to be evaluated not only in the light of current policy goals but also in the light of possible, sometimes dramatic, future events. In this way the Wild Cards helped to highlight the potential impact of external events on the territorial development of Europe and their particular impact on the internal disparities between the regions.

The missing role of the IHR in trade responses against A/H1N influenza has meant that the newly established mechanism does not effectively discourage the occurrence of excessive trade measures. In this regard, arguably, neither can the World Trade Organization (WTO) effectively deal with disputes involving the rapid spread of-a virus.

First, it analyzes the influence of corporate income taxes on the cost of external finance to firms in imperfect financial markets, and second, it evaluates the transmission of monetary and tax shocks in this framework. A model is proposed providing evidence on two opposite effects of corporate tax on a firm's external financing cost: a positive effect is induced by the traditional tax shield channel, while a negative effect comes from the firm's balance sheet channel. The dominance of one of these effects depends on firms' financial health. In a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, the presence of taxes amplifies the macroeconomic reaction of the real variables to monetary shocks, thus amplifying the financial accelerator role of the firm's balance sheet. As in the case of monetary shocks, the balance sheet channel acts equally in the model as an accelerator for the transmission of tax shocks.","[Badarau-Semenescu, Cristina] Univ Orleans, Lab Econ Orleans, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Semenescu, Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania",Universite de Orleans; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Badarau-Semenescu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, Lab Econ Orleans, F-45067 Orleans, France.",badarau.cristina@yahoo.fr; asemenescu@yahoo.com,"Semenescu, Ileana Andreea/C-2390-2011; Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea/AAI-9627-2021","Curmei-Semenescu, Andreea/0000-0001-9367-3965",,,,,27,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

J,"Liebl, F; Schwarz, JO",,,,"Liebl, Franz; Schwarz, Jan Oliver",,,Normality of the future: Trend diagnosis for strategic foresight,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ISSUES; SIGNALS; CONTEXT,"Foresight processes and activities are confronted with the task of making sense of the present, in particular by interpreting weak signals of change in the organizational environment. Although trends are considered to be important drivers of environmental discontinuities which may lead to strategic surprises, there is no operationalization from a strategic point of view. In this paper we are going to conceptualize trends as (sociocultural) innovations. This leads to important implications. If the nature of innovation is taken seriously, then strategic trend diagnosis has to deal with two different aspects, invention and diffusion. First, we are going to present a framework for identifying the invention aspect of a trend (i.e., the new) which is based on the fact that the new results from a transgression of contextual boundaries. Second, we are going to operationalize the diffusion of the new as a threefold process of normalization - i.e., an unusual practice becomes social convention. Taken together, these two aspects provide a theoretical link between trends and market creation. In addition, by relating the above operationalizations to an entrepreneurial strategy-making framework, strategic issue diagnosis can be improved and more seamlessly linked to strategy formulation.

J,"Nelson, R",,,,"Nelson, Ruben",,,Extending foresight: The case for and nature of Foresight 2.0,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This a programmatic paper with all of the frustrations thereof [1]. We point beyond the well-tilled ground of foresight as commonly practiced (called Foresight 1.0) to an emerging understanding of the work and character of foresight (called Foresight 2.0). By definition, as of today, this new territory is not well mapped, much less carefully worked-over. The question that drives this commitment to Foresight 2.0 was the heart of the 2007 Strathclyde Organizational Foresight Conference-Learning the Future Faster: Can foresight as commonly practiced enable us to learn the future fast enough to meet and deal with the unique strategic challenges of the 21st Century? The view taken is that Foresight 1.0 cannot meet this challenge: that it leads to small victories and major disasters. An explanation is offered: Foresight 1.0 was developed, and is still largely practiced, with the eyes and mind of management, whereas sustained success in the unique conditions of the 21st Century requires Foresight 2.0-seeing, thinking and acting with the eyes and mind of Leadership. This distinction is explained. Evidence is offered that futures research and foresight are slowly moving towards this new practice. The hope is expressed that, if we grasp the need for it, the nature of it and have explicit mental maps of the journey to it, we who are professional foresight researchers and practitioners will move faster and more effectively to develop Foresight 2.0. Several steps towards this end are outlined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, academia has identified corporate foresight and innovation as key success factors. While, content-wise, the contribution of futures research methods to the innovation process has already been researched, this study strives to explore the status quo of organizational development stages of both concepts. To do so, we developed a portfolio-approach, the so-called 'Future-Fitness-Portfolio', which enables companies to qualitatively compare amongst others and identify organizational improvement potential. In addition, we conducted expert interviews to explore future organizational development trends in corporate foresight and innovation management. As our research revealed, five strategic clusters can be identified within the portfolio. Consequently, we propose specific strategies for each individual cluster. We conclude that there will be two main organizational development trends for corporate foresight and innovation management in the future: in traditional industries with conventional business models and long product-life-cycles, companies will follow a different development path than companies in dynamic industries with innovative business models and short product-life-cycles.

It is interesting to single out the controlling factors for participation in or absence from the labour market after 50 and the link between poor health and employment status. The prevalence of functional limitations in everyday activities leads to a more pronounced exclusion of those over 50 years old from the labour market. Some of those aged between 55 and 59 on disability benefits become unemployed and do not look for work; in other words, they are potentially exempted from job-seeking. This would confirm the hypothesis that some of those exempted from job-seeking are in poor health.","Univ Paris 12 Val de Marne, Fac Econ Sci & Management, ERUDITE,CNRS 3126, Res Team Use Individual Temporal Data Econ,TEPP, F-94000 Creteil, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Barnay, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 12 Val de Marne, Fac Econ Sci & Management, ERUDITE,CNRS 3126, Res Team Use Individual Temporal Data Econ,TEPP, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94000 Creteil, France.",barnay@univ-paris12.fr,"BARNAY, Thomas/F-6338-2015","BARNAY, Thomas/0000-0002-5107-6027",,,,,31,13,15,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper examines such terms as 'futurology' and 'foresight', and argues that to emphasise plurality and diversity the study of the future is best served by the moniker 'futures studies'. It suggests that remembering the history of futures discourse is necessary to resolve the crisis of identity and meaning, and frequent fruitless reinvention, of the field. Finally, it presents Sardar's four laws of futures studies: futures studies are wicked (they deal largely with complex, interconnected problems), MAD (emphasise Mutually Assured Diversity), sceptical (question dominant axioms and assumptions) and futureless (bear fruit largely in the present).

On the other hand, production at the lowest possible cost, cooperative marketing, good relations with government, liquidity adaptation of new technology, and experience sharing are perceived as the most important risk management strategies.

Using the combined data sets of survey and the Act's implementation plan, this paper provides logit estimation results to examine empirically how political perceptions or attitudes of firms influence corporate noncompliance with the Act. According to a corporate personnel manager survey, affirmative action was initially pursued as a campaign pledge by the liberal party (the Korea Democratic Party) to attract women's votes, and took on a looser shape as the government compromised with the business sector after an election. A weak enforcement structure ultimately diluted the effects of the Act. A logit analysis indicates that noncompliance is more probable in companies that perceive affirmative action as part of a design to achieve political goals, and compliance is more probable in companies that feel it is likely to improve corporate management.","[Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Human Resources Dev Ctr, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Human Resources Dev Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Cho, Joonmo/B-7368-2012",,,,,,52,19,21,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Using survey data from the Iowa Lakes Project, we test this supposition. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian treatment effect model in which the degree of perceived consequentiality, measured as an ordinal response, is permitted to have a structural impact on willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical environmental improvement. We test whether the estimated WTP distributions are the same for each value of the ordinal response. In our survey data, a subsample of individuals were randomly assigned supporting information suggesting that their responses to the questionnaires were important and will have an impact on policy decisions. in conjunction with a Bayesian posterior simulator, we use this source of exogenous variation to identify the structural impacts of consequentiality perceptions on willingness to pay, while controlling for the potential of confounding on unobservables. We find evidence consistent with a knife-edge result, namely that the willingness to pay distributions are equal among those believing the survey to be at least minimally consequential, and different for those believing that the survey is irrelevant for policy purposes.

I then gradually relax the model by allowing for delayed adjustment of price to fundamentals, as well as by introducing lagged LHS variables. The pattern of results suggests that while prices were not initially driven by marginal abatement costs, this inefficiency was largely corrected after the accounting of 2005 emissions in April 2006.

In this study we examine the characteristics of forest owners and their properties that indicate the owners' willingness to participate in the programme. In addition, we analyse factors affecting the real compensation claims. The study uses a dual set of data from the pilot project, i.e. one data set supplied by the authority and another collected from the owners involved in the project. The results suggest that to increase the participation rate, information on the conservation project should be targeted in particular to the forest owners who either emphasize financial investment as a motive for forest ownership, have positive attitudes toward nature protection, or own large amounts of forest property. Additionally, owners' positive environmental preferences would decrease and high harvesting value and high ecological quality of a preserved forest stand would increase compensation claims. The voluntary programme could not, however, circumvent owners' strategic behaviour with respect to the claims. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, we asked who is pushing SMEs towards a stronger shareholder-value orientation and how they respond to these changes. Although the direct impact of capital market actors on German SMEs is still limited, we find a diffusion of advanced management tools, which is linked in the literature to the shareholder-value concept, and a redefinition of firm-bank relationships without embracing the arms'-length, equity market-oriented mode of finance.

The nature of the tax examined would aim to charge imported goods the equivalent of what their producers would have had to pay if the goods had been produced in the importing country. This paper argues that attempting to 'level the playing field' by imposing a carbon tax on imports from countries with less stringent multilateral carbon reduction obligations would be wintry to the international recognition of 'common but differentiated responsibility' for climate change. By taking into account tins principle in particular, reflected in the UN Climate Change Convention, a WTO panel may find in favour of a complainant against such a carbon tax under Article III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 and also find that We measure is not justified under Article XX.",,,,julia.obrien@dfat.gov.au,,,,,,,8,11,11,0,6,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The governance of community forestry in Nepal,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Deliberation; Doxa; Forest governance; Symbolic violence; Community forestry; Nepal,RESOURCE,"The search for effective strategies to protect forests and improve livelihoods of the people dependent on them has led to several participatory approaches to governance over the past few decades globally. However, an important factor that hinders effective governance in most situations is the prevalence of complex interplay of power and knowledge among diverse groups of actors with unequal access to deliberative interactions related to governance. This means that improving governance must meet the challenges of modifying deep rooted, complex patterns of power that affect deliberative processes. Drawing on the concepts of deliberation (following Habermas) and symbolic violence (following Bourdieu), this paper explores the possibility and challenges of deliberative governance, taking the case of community forestry in Nepal. The central question this study seeks to address is how and to what extent various actors engage (or do not engage) in deliberative processes while enacting governance practices. It shows how a national forest governance programme is enacted as a complex economy of practices by a wide array of participants and analyses how certain groups continue to dominate the decision-making practices despite the growing rhetoric of participatory governance. Symbolic violence for our purpose occurs when claims to superior knowledge are used to legitimate closure in deliberation on forest governance practices and accepted by those excluded from effective deliberation. In the field of forest governance, we identify patterns of symbolic violence that limit the possibility of deliberation: creating boundaries in social field, cultivating internalised beliefs among governance actors, and sustaining unequal access to symbolic capital. The paper following Bourdieu, stipulates crisis as a necessary condition for the development of demands for increased deliberation by subordinated participants, and then explore sociological conditions for the development of crises into the situation of symbolic violence.

The resultant proposed framework provides an alternative perspective on risk, whereby it is argued that risk is induced across repressed ambiguities; with the latter also resulting in truncated or limited knowledge. Conversely, risk is mitigated across the full expression of these same ambiguities, which in turn leads to enriched or complexified knowledge. This perspective argues that as long as we fail to recognise and embrace the myriad of dyadic pairs or ambiguities which both surround us and are inherent within us as human beings, we strongly increase the likelihood of both validating and reinforcing Beck's [U.

These assumptions are (1) manipulability, (2) no interference between units, (3) interval scale metric, (4) homogeneity of effects, (5) strongly ignorable assignment, and (6) functional form. We discuss the plausibility of these assumptions and the consequences of their violation. In particular, because the consequences of violations of the last three assumptions have not been assessed in prior literature, we conduct a set of simulation analyses to investigate the extent to which plausible violations of them alter inferences from value-added models.

Faced with an unprecedented economic crisis and few options, the Cuban government, reluctantly returned to international tourism as the foundation for economic salvation. Since then international tourism has multiplied fifteen-fold. While reintroducing tourism may have saved Cuba from a political and economic catastrophe - foreign tourists, mostly from capitalist countries, have enabled Cuba and the Revolution to survive - this use of capitalism to save socialism has also produced formidable challenges. In particular, the emergence of a consumer culture and the subsequent dollarization of the economy, pose a grave threat to Cuban society as products are increasingly evaluated, purchased, and consumed on the basis of their symbolic content and meaning for social status. Nonetheless, it will be argued in this paper that since Cuban society remains anchored by highly functional, stable, well-organized neighborhoods and a flourishing, innovative informal economy, embedded values of cooperation may serve as a counteractive force to the rise of a culture of consumerism and materialism. Based on this premise, the paper concludes with an examination of three possible scenarios for the future of tourism in Cuba.

An effect that has received little attention is that inefficiency can exacerbate environmental impacts. This effect is particularly important if environmentally damaging inputs are overused. In addition to increasing firms' costs, such inefficiency can also increase the environmental impact of the firm's activity. This makes the degree of inefficiency in an industry an issue for environmental regulators. In this paper, we estimate technical and allocative efficiency for a sample of Norwegian salmon farmers. Our results show that both technical and allocative inefficiency on average are significant in explaining the level and variation in farm costs, and that the main environmental impact due to inefficiency from the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry has its origin in technical inefficiency.

LIS data allow a comparison of tax rates that attempts to take different starting rates, thresholds and exemptions into account. Our study supports the argument others have made that the USA has more progressive taxes than the European countries. However, we find that Britain's tax structure is more regressive than those of the continental welfare states, making the mapping of tax structure onto the 'three worlds of welfare' imperfect We also show that it is a mistake to assume that income and property taxes are always progressive: regressive examples of both are common in the data. But sales taxes are regressive wherever they are found, and we suggest that the proportion of tax revenue raised through sales taxes can serve as an index of overall progressivity in situations where the detailed data examined here are not available. We close by outlining several possible explanations for the inverse correlation between tax progressivity and welfare state effort.","[Prasad, Monica] Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Prasad, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",m-prasad@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,55,68,76,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Paul",,,Role of foresters' perspectives in orienting agroforestry programmes,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest Department; Tree growing; Training; Forester; Perspectives; Himachal Pradesh,PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT,"The foresters' perspectives of agroforestry is an important aspect that can influence strategies concerned with agroforestry uptake by the farmers. Keeping this in view the empirical studies of foresters' perspective of agroforestry have gained considerable importance. Present study, therefore, investigates foresters' perspectives on different aspects related to agroforestry. This study was conducted in Mandi district located in Indian Western Himalayan province of Himachal Pradesh. Not only the traditional forest management but also agroforestry training of foresters has remained oriented towards learning silvi-technical (plantation management and nursery management) rather than extension (social) and agricultural aspects. Consequently. there was a felt need amongst foresters for training in extension and agricultural aspects for effective implementation of agroforestry programmes. This provides a window of opportunity for reorienting their training curriculum towards learning extension (social) and agricultural besides the silvi-technical skills. For effective implementation of agroforestry programmes the manpower requirement, particularly that of extension specialist and well trained agroforesters, of the department needs to be estimated and strategy should be devised to minimise political interference. The study emphasises a need for interaction between foresters and farmers, mechanism for better co-ordination with other departments and absolving agroforesters of their policing role for effective planning and implementation of agroforestry programmes. There were significant variations in the opinion of forestry staff about the effectiveness of various strategies to meet farmers tree-based needs, increase tree cover in the state and expected plantation survival rate. There were significant variations in the opinion of foresters about the different factors discouraging private tree growing but 'restriction on felling green trees growing on private land and selling them in the market' was viewed as the most important factor. Provision of incentives to the villagers for tree growing on private land was the major factor from the foresters' perspective that will encourage tree growing on private land. As there was a lack of congruence of foresters' perception on majority of issues pertaining to agroforestry, a need to incorporate the uniform understanding of issues pertaining to agroforestry amongst the foresters was emphasised. This study also identifies a need to investigate the perspectives staff of agriculture, horticulture departments for better planning and execution of agroforestry programmes, and their uptake by the farmers.

The silvicultural process of forest conversion in ageing pine plantations is associated with active management aimed at inducing, steering or accelerating stand development. The aim of the present study was to investigate owner-specific factors - socio-demographic and forest-related characteristics, and motivation of ownership - influencing NIPF owners' active engagement in silvicultural conversion (henceforth referred to as 'conversion activity'). The study relies on a survey of non-industrial private owners (n = 276) of pine plantations on poor sandy soils in Flanders (northern Belgium). The study revealed that NIPF owners, in general, make only minor contributions to forest conversion. Conversion activity (including thinning, making space for broadleaves, removing invasive species, clear-cut. planting) was rather low, but positively influenced by a number of factors. Private forest owners with clear motivations of ownership were more likely to engage in conversion activity. However, the nature of motivation was not very decisive as most of the items listed (with exception of land investment goals) had a positive influence. Furthermore, the conversion activity of owners called 'economists' did not significantly differ from those of 'recreationists', but 'passive owners' (those with unclear motivations of ownership) were less active. We thus suggest that it is the absence of clear motivations of ownership, rather than a particular ownership goal that would explain low conversion activity. Socio-demographics like age, gender and education. and also forest size had only marginal influence. But frequency of forest visits and proximity to the forest had a significant influence. As an overall conclusion from this study, we emphasize the importance for active forest management, and silvicultural conversion in particular, of forest owners being connected to their forest. In this sense, mental connectedness (motivation of ownership), as well as physical connectedness (living close to the forest and visiting it frequently) do matter. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, the increase in university participation came at the expense of college participation in most cities. Furthermore, not everyone benefited equally from new universities in terms of university enrolment.

As a result, the main comparison in this paper is very specific - the effect of reduced sized kindergarten classrooms on test performance in second grade. The main result of the paper is that the effect of classroom size reduction is small, especially when compared to the other determinants of student achievement at the second grade level. There is a very small effect of classroom size reduction on student achievement in reading and math, and no effect in language and spelling. Of the two offsetting effects of CSR controlling for spending - the direct effect of smaller classes and the indirect effect on teacher quality, the class-size effect is larger. Over time. the negative effect on teacher quality is reduced as new teachers gain experience and credentials. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We allow preferences for policy attributes to vary systematically with the scenario design, with the source of risk and type of health threat, and with respondent characteristics. Using a willingness to pay (WTP) framework similar to that used for studies of individual risk, we find that omission of illness information leads to an upward bias in estimates of the value of avoided premature deaths and that individuals view avoided deaths and avoided illnesses as substitutes. We also find evidence of strongly diminishing marginal utility in policy scope. Differences in marginal WTP from different sources of risk or types of illness appear very small relative to differences associated with respondent characteristics and/or perceptions.

Although the response to outside innovations is greater within the transitory component, it is short-lived; conversely, though there is a high level of persistence in the trend, new information has only a lesser effect on the permanent component. Jump variance can also affect total variance, though the effect is far lower than the variance for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity. Accordingly, the market risk appears small. The reaction to news is heterogeneous within the Shanghai and Shenzhen indices; this may be the result of various market characteristics. During event periods, the permanent component, transitory components, and jump intensity are larger than their averages. After an upward trend, markets return to regular conditions over time. In sum, the total long-run risks within China's market seem low, though speculators can use the sizable transitory component of market fluctuation to engage in arbitrage activities. However, from the viewpoint of asset allocation regarding the trading noise in the Shenzhen B market, we suggest that rational investors deploy more funds in this market and less in the Shanghai A market to avoid a high degree of risk.","[Chiang, Shu-Mei] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Gueishan, Taiwan; [Chiu, Chien-Liang] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei Cty, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Chiang, SM (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Gueishan, Taiwan.",shumei@mail.lhu.edu.tw,,"Chiu, Chien-Liang/0000-0001-9508-7206; Chiang, Shumei/0000-0002-7087-6257",,,,,15,13,13,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It makes a critical reading of epistemological postures adopted by these postmoderns, revealing a number of internal incoherencies. And it finds their substantive analyses as unhelpful to radical political action in the here and now, as it is to utopian prefiguration of a just and sustainable future. The author argues from the perspective of an 'embodied materialist ecofeminism' and makes two claims. First, the postmodern preoccupation with methodologies of discourse analysis becomes counterproductive by deflecting attention from activism. Secondly, Haraway's quasi-celebration of capitalist patriarchal technoscience with it iconic cyborg, presents a dystopia that confuses the political focus of feminists, just as an aggressive neoliberal form of globalisation colonises and consumes the support systems of all life on earth.

Using a nationally representative sample of public school teachers, I find that teachers who graduate from the most selective undergraduate institutions have salaries that are between 7% and 14% higher than those who graduate from the least selective colleges. An empirical investigation of the source of these returns reveals that the majority of this difference is due to high-ability teachers sorting into higher paying districts, though a non-trivial amount arises from within-district deviations from the salary schedule.

This paper extends that line of research, estimating both autoregressive and regime-switching models of real interest rates to determine certainty-equivalent discount rates in Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK. It is found that the regime-switching model is a better model of past interest rate behavior for all four countries. This model tends to produce a more rapid decline in certainty-equivalent discount rates. The paper provides applications to the economics of climate change and nuclear power. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a simple economic model that we use to analyze the market structure and environmental externalities that were most relevant to this case. We start by analyzing Brazil's policies in a model in which tyre retreading generates a positive production externality through the delay it provides society before a used tyre becomes a waste product with the potential to harm society through its adverse impact on human health and the environment. We examine the different welfare implications of (i) a production subsidy for retreading of once-used Brazilian tyres, (ii) a tariff on imports of retreaded tyres, and (iii) a ban on imports of retreaded tyres. While a production subsidy is the first-best instrument to address this type of externality, there are reasons to believe that it might be infeasible. The welfare implications of the other measures depend importantly on the magnitude of the positive production externality. From the lens provided by this economic analysis, we draw three primary insights. First, we identify the critical piece of empirical information that the Panel and Appellate Body require to make a rational judgment of the utility of the Brazilian policies contested in the dispute - i.e., the size of the underlying externality associated with retreading. Second, if the Justification for the original import ban on retreaded tyres was based on the argument that it was a second-best Brazilian policy designed to combat a large externality, then Brazil's failure to enforce a ban on used-tyre imports has the troubling result of eroding those potential welfare gains through a reduction in equilibrium production (and consumption) of Brazilian retreaded tyres. Third, the Brazilian policy that exempted from the ban retreaded imports from MERCOSUR partners also has the same troubling feature. The second and third points are congruent with the reasons for the Appellate Body's determination that the Brazilian policy did not qualify under the chapeau of Article XX. We examine the WTO jurisprudence of Article XX(b), in order to compare the methodology developed under this jurisprudence to the type of examination of changes to total welfare from implementing one policy relative to a postulated alternative policy that most economists would follow. We find that the WTO jurisprudence in this area is internally incoherent, and also fails to evaluate the types of concerns that an economic-welfare analysis would evaluate.","[Bown, Chad P.] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Trachtman, Joel P.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Brandeis University; Tufts University,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",,"Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020","Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,11,44,46,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2009,8.0,1,,,,,85,135,,10.1017/S1474745608004096,0.0,,,51,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,426GN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264696100008,0

We question this diagnosis using three lines of argument. First, effective restructuring of the supply side in the core advanced industries was carried out by the private sector using institutions of the coordinated economy, including unions, works councils and block-holder owners. Second, the implementation of orthodox labour market and welfare state reforms created a flexible labour market at the lower end. Third, low growth and high unemployment are largely accounted for by the persistent weakness of domestic aggregate demand, rather than by the failure to reform the supply side. Strong growth in recent years reflects the successful restructuring of the core economy. To explain these developments, we identify the external pressures on companies in the context of increased global competition, the continuing value of the institutions of the coordinated market economy to the private sector and the constraints imposed on the use of stabilizing macroeconomic policy by these institutions. We also suggest how changes in political coalitions allowed orthodox labour market reforms to be implemented in a consensus political system.","[Carlin, Wendy] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Soskice, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Soskice, David] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Soskice, David] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC USA",University of London; University College London; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Duke University,"Carlin, W (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.",w.carlin@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,100,107,2,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The U. S. consumption of avocados has increased considerably within recent times, from a per capital level of 0.69 kg in 1998 to 1.48 kg in 2007. Several factors are responsible for the increased U.

There are, however, concerns that the U. S. avocado market is becoming saturated, which could have dire consequences for avocado prices.

The estimation was based on 'on-the-move' monitoring of soil-tire interface pressure and the composite contact length determined from the contact pressures and the depths and widths of ruts formed in the soil. The volume of compacted soil was investigated on the face of one lug and on an under tread region between two lugs of a tire in a soft clay soil. The tire was instrumented with six miniature pressure transducers, amplifiers, and a wireless data communication system. The instrumented tire was run at a constant forward speed of 0.27 m/s, 23% slip on a soft soil, 0.48 MPa cone index, 25.6% d.b. moisture content with specific values of load, and inflation pressure. The volume of compacted soil enabled volumetric changes of compacted soil to be identified and magnified at the tire contact patch as one of the main causes of the degradation of soils after traffic pass. The volume of the compacted soil on the lug face was substantially greater than the volume of compacted soil on the under tread. The volume of compacted soil for the overinflated treatment was more concentrated at the tire lug centerline and middle position than at the edge of the tread. The volume of compacted soil for the underinflated treatment was more concentrated at the tire lug edge and middle position than center of the tread. The soil-tire interface contact pressure distributions results showed that as inflation pressure increased in overinflated treatment or load increased in the underinflated treatment, the stresses near the center and edge of the tire were increased in the respective treatments and transferred to the soft clay soil as a compaction increase sensed with the cone penetrometer and indicated as a significant effect on soil strength. As a result, these soil conditions can delay root extension or even prevent penetration into the subsoil, especially for root crops and, therefore, changes in the management of vehicles and their running gear will have both direct and indirect effects on the overall profitability of whole-farm enterprises.","[Mohsenimanesh, A.; Ward, S.

A hyperspectral image contains enormous spectral waveband information in each pixel. Especially, ground-based hyperspectral imaging can obtain a high-resolution image with both spatial and spectral information. The objective of this study was to develop unified methodology for agricultural hyperspectral imaging. The methodology was based on the low-cost image capturing system and the object-oriented software framework developed in this study, and it can be employed for multipurpose use. First, in order to acquire a hyperspectral image, two image-capturing systems were developed. The portable image capturing system is a small system equipped with an electric driven pan head and can be used both in-room and in outdoor fields. The field-scale image capturing system with running vehicle can acquire large-scale images in-field. Then, a versatile software framework for hyperspectral imaging was designed and developed. The methodology in this study can be applied to various hyperspectral imaging projects. For each project, an individual estimation model has to be developed. Therefore, the methodology also included the concept of model development. Moreover, versatile script code library for model creation was developed with statistical computing software R. This study also showed the application examples of hyperspectral imaging projects that tried several agricultural sensing.","[Okamoto, H.; Suzuki, Y.; Kataoka, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Sakai, K.] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Symbiot Sci & Technol, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan",Hokkaido University; Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology,"Okamoto, H (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",,"Sakai, Kenshi/F-9248-2013","Sakai, Kenshi/0000-0002-7887-1709",,,,,13,8,9,1,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,49,56,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.824.5,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100005,0

Moreover, several related concepts, such as adaptability, exist that have an overlap in meaning or are simply used synonymously. This article presents a framing of flexibility, and three concepts with which it bears a close family resemblance, for the use in the context of infrastructure constellations. The definitions proposed in this frame draw inspiration from existing literature, though they are not based upon a classical literature review. Rather, a usable set of definitions is proposed for the intended context. The definitions all have the same structure to better appreciate how the concepts are related and how they differ. To verify whether the definitions correspond to their practical use, a data-mining exercise is performed on over 11,000 scientific articles that use the concepts of flexibility. After the corpus of articles is identified that is close to the intended field of application (infrastructure constellations), a co-occurrence analysis is carried out in order to clarify the differences between the concepts and to give nuance to the meaning conveyed in the definitions.

These new planning approaches have been put forward in response to the challenges of deep uncertainty about the future. These approaches emphasize the need for flexibility of the system in order to enable the plan to adapt to changing conditions. However, these adaptive approaches up till now have seen little real word applications. One important reason for this lack of application is that the efficacy of these approaches has not been established yet. In turn, this is largely due to the problem that there is no agreed upon method for proving the efficacy of a new planning approach. In this paper, we will draw an analogy to medical research and development in order to outline a methodology for establishing the efficacy of new planning approaches. We discuss how the well-established methodology for evaluation new medical treatments can be adapted to evaluating new planning approaches. We illustrate the resulting evaluation methodology by outlining an evaluation strategy for a specific new planning approach. It is concluded that the well-established methodology from medicine can successfully be used to inform the evaluation of infrastructure planning approaches.

The objective of this paper is to add empirical knowledge to this ongoing debate. In particular, we examine the effects of allowing interest groups to participate at WTO Ministerial Conferences (MCs) during 1996-2009 by analyzing a novel dataset of 1992 interest organizations that attended seven MCs. The data we present demonstrate that, in contrast to what many expected, the WTO did not attract a more diverse population of interest groups since these organizations were allowed to participate at MCs. Moreover, we observe an increasing overrepresentation of some specific issue-related interests, especially agriculture, and a strong presence of Northern American and European interest organizations attending MCs. Another important observation is that MCs are not particularly dominated by business interests at the expense of NGOs (non-governmental organization), who are also consistently well represented at the WTO meetings. Yet, the high levels of volatility observed at the level of individual organizations suggests that, although it is rather easy to start lobbying at WTO MCs, only a relatively small number of interest organizations keep a long lobbying presence at this level.","[Hanegraaff, Marcel; Beyers, Jan; Braun, Caelesta] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Beyers, Jan] Univ Agder, Agder, Norway",University of Antwerp; University of Agder,"Hanegraaff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",marcel.hanegraaff@ua.ac.be,,,,,,,64,41,43,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2011,10.0,4,,,,,447,472,,10.1017/S1474745611000310,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,848DD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000297028300002,0

Using women in political science as a case study, we show that this change has disproportionately affected women in two ways. First, women have increased the rate at which they co-author journal articles faster than their male counterparts. Second, the lowered communication costs have made women more willing to take jobs at smaller departments because it is now easier to work with colleagues at other universities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We used the concept of attributable fractions based on German prevalence data and relative risks from US studies as well as routine statistics. We estimated obesity- and overweight-attributable deaths, years of potential life lost (YPLL) and quality-adjusted life years lost (QALY) for various diseases associated with obesity and overweight. Direct costs were estimated for inpatient and outpatient treatment, rehabilitation and non-medical costs. Indirect costs were estimated for sickness absence, early retirement and mortality using the human capital approach. We estimated 36,653 obesity- and overweight-attributable deaths with 428,093 consecutive YPLL and 367,772 QALYs lost. Obesity caused 4,854 million EUR in direct costs corresponding to 2.1% of the overall German health expenditures in 2002 and 5,019 million EUR in indirect costs. Forty-three percent of direct costs resulted from endocrinological diseases like diabetes and obesity itself, followed by cardiovascular diseases (38%), neoplasms (14%) and digestive diseases (6%). Sixty percent of indirect costs resulted from unpaid work, and 67% of overall indirect costs were due to mortality. Obesity and overweight are connected to considerable morbidity and mortality as well as societal costs. Improvement and further development of effective strategies for preventing and dealing with obesity and overweight are necessary.","[Konnopka, A.; Koenig, H. -H.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Med Sociol & Hlth Econ, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Konnopka, A.; Boedemann, M.; Koenig, H. -H.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Psychiat, Hlth Econ Res Unit, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Leipzig University,"Konnopka, A (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Med Sociol & Hlth Econ, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",alexander.konnopka@medizin.uni-leipzig.de,"König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018",,,,,,43,65,69,2,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this article it is argued that, as a universally acclaimed human right, collective bargaining should be considered a minimum condition for everyone employed under standardised conditions of work. The government policy of offering workers a choice to bargain or to refrain from bargaining, in effect in countries such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, does not meet that standard. Just as the equity goal of governments is the absence of inequality based on traits such as sex and colour, the government bargaining policy goal should be universal collective bargaining. Anything short of universality should be considered a social problem in search of a more effective policy solution.","[Adams, Roy J.] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Adams, Roy J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",McMaster University; University of Saskatchewan,"Adams, RJ (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",adamsr@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,22,4,7,1,10,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Even after income and other socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for, the employment status remains an important determinant of happiness, pointing to non-pecuniary functions of work. But what effect does labour market policy have? Can the psychosocial functions of work be fulfilled by activation measures, offsetting the detrimental life satisfaction effect of unemployment? Analysing panel data, this paper shows that the biggest German activation programme 'One-Euro-Job' is connected to a level of life satisfaction that is significantly higher than the one of respective unemployed welfare benefit recipients. This effect is especially strong if participants perceive the measure to match their personal skills and to increase their future employment chances, but vanishes if participants perceive it as degrading. In total, satisfaction scores of participants do not match the level of the regularly employed. In contrast to these pronounced differences in cross-sectional analyses, longitudinal models show similar effects but are less statistically robust, pointing to certain selection biases.","Univ Bremen, Collaborat Res Ctr Transformat State, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Wulfgramm, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Collaborat Res Ctr Transformat State, Bremen, Germany.",melike.wulfgramm@sfb597.uni-bremen.de,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018","Wulfgramm, Melike/0000-0001-9436-2771",,,,,49,48,48,2,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This paper investigated some implications of this stochastic nature of interest rates. Markov decision process (MDP) models, used previously to integrate stochastic stand growth and prices, can be extended to include variable interest rates as well. This method was applied to Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. An MDP model was used to find the harvest decisions that maximized the forest value of a stand in a particular state, given the price level and interest rate. This optimal policy was compared with the policy that would hold in the same context but with an interest rate fixed at its historical average. The results showed that when the interest rate was lower than its historical average, the best decision differed for 52 of the 192 possible combinations of stand state and price level. Assuming a fixed interest rate underestimated the forest value by 4% to 16% depending on the initial condition. However, applying the harvest policy derived with a fixed interest rate led to a loss of no more than 7% depending on the initial condition. Taking explicit account of the variability of interest rate in setting harvest policies had some unexpected ecological benefits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These narratives generate an imaginary, poetic geography that haunts the abstract city of street maps and development plans, and makes it socially meaningful. This paper is concerned with one particular kind of story-telling - science fiction - and its relationship with the city, urban planning, and questions of community engagement. The paper argues that the 'cities of the imagination' generated by science fiction and other forms of narrative provide a powerful means of understanding, communicating and enriching the connections to place in urban communities. Moreover, science fiction is often characterised by its ability to explore the future of cities. This gives the genre a fascinating and potentially useful resonance with urban planning as a discourse and set of practices; and, in particular, strategies for engaging communities in the design process and, thus, designing for future social sustainability. These ideas will be tested through a reading of near-future urban spatiality in the cyberpunk stories of William Gibson. The theorisation of the relationship between urban space and narrative in the work of de Certeau and other theorists will be used to help frame this discussion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, I use two technique: from Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005) to address the issue of selection on unobservables The first is a sensitivity analysis showing how the coefficient on diversity changes whet different values of the correlation are imposed in a system of equations that consists of a selection equation and an outcome equation. The second is estimation based upon at assumption that selection on unobservables equals selection on observables, which, along with the OLS results, gives estimates of bounds on the effect. Single-equation estimate suggest a possible positive effect of diversity on satisfaction with the racial climate at the college attended and a negative effect on community service, but I do not find an effect or other outcomes. Moreover, the estimates are very sensitive to the assumptions made about selection on unobservables. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results suggest that household types with the highest initial consumption share of fiber-rich products-i.e., households without children (seniors, couples without children, and single women without children)-experience the highest increase in fiber intake from these reforms. However, they also experience high increases in unhealthy nutrients from the reforms, making the net health effects difficult to evaluate. Seniors and couples without children also gain most financially, paying less food taxes and facing, depending on the reform, either a lower price level than before the reform or a lower increase in the price level than the average household. These household types also face the lowest initial price level. Households with the lowest initial consumption share of fiber-rich products-families with children-appear to gain the least financially from the reforms: they pay more food taxes and face relatively high increases in price levels. Further, in general they experience an increase in fiber intake smaller than that of the average household. However, they do generally see reductions in the intake of added sugar, and in many cases saturated fat, which positively affects the health of families with children, who often overconsume these nutrients.","[Thunstrom, Linda] Swedish Retail Inst, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; Lund University,"Thunström, L (通讯作者)，Swedish Retail Inst, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden.",linda.thunstrom@hui.se,"Nordström, Jonas/AAR-6623-2020; Nordström, Jonas/E-7708-2015","Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976; Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976",,,,,32,9,9,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Consequently, the firm's profits are higher, its wage rates remain unchanged, and the distribution of earnings is compressed.","[Stark, Oded] Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Stark, Oded] Univ Klagenfurt, Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Stark, Oded] Warsaw Univ, Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Hyll, Walter] Univ Klagenfurt, Halle Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria",University of Bonn; University of Klagenfurt; University of Vienna; Warsaw School of Economics; University of Warsaw; University of Klagenfurt,"Stark, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, D-5300 Bonn, Germany.",ostark@uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,37,32,34,4,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Although the contribution of future studies to management is in theory all but self-evident, the practice in organizations is that futures knowledge is hardly used, or at most, is used selectively and strategically ('politically'). This article acknowledges that gap and claims that it is a fundamental divide between to very different domains. However, out of that re-conceptualization of the relation between futures studies and management, a new direction for an integrated praxis arises. In an empirical case study, we show that by means of an intelligent process-design and professional balancing of several key-dilemmas, futures studies can be connected to management processes and organizational development. The future can be brought back into the everyday practice of management. However, in order to do so, the futures field needs to set aside some of its methodological claims and move towards the field of strategic management. Not because futurists need to abandon their specific knowledge and expertise, but to make the most of it. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

First, that the scientists concerned were doing 'normal science', not coping with uncertainties, and then that the 'extended peer community' had come into power on the critical blogosphere. There was already a current of criticism of PNS, seeing it as contributing to the supposed corruption of climate science through its denial of Truth. One important essay in that tendency is reproduced here. In my reply to my critics, I argued that we are on the same side, committed to the integrity of science; and I reviewed the progression of my own ideas on climate change.

Data used for this examination were derived from two qualitative, case study-based inquiries: the Ford Foundation's Community-Based Forestry Demonstration Program and a status report on CBF developed for the U.S. Endowment for Forests and Communities. Additional information on CBF learning and governance change was gleaned from the research literature and the authors' ongoing observations and participation with CBF groups. We found that CBF groups and coalitions are engaged in a wide variety of learning strategies simultaneously, frequently blending social and policy learning in order to determine if proposed strategies worked or require changes, and if their core beliefs are being attained. Most learning tends to involve single-loop learning, where the effect and effectiveness of strategies are measured against expected outcomes; in a small number of cases, we found evidence of double-loop learning, where the assumptions about causal relationships were questioned and adapted. Triple-loop learning of CBF governing values and structures, as well as the values and structures governing U.S. forest policy as a whole, is largely absent. CBF learning primarily focuses on operational-level governance, where management plans and strategies are altered to incorporate the linked goals of sustaining healthy forests and healthy communities. A small number of CBF advocacy coalitions are engaged in policy learning and change at the collective- and constitutional-choice levels; policy changes are generally at the collective-choice level, changing rules and structures that affect operational-level governance. Given the high cost of changing collective- and constitutional-choice governance and the generally long time to achieve policy change, CBF groups and coalitions must find ways to sustain the resources and energy necessary to stay engaged to affect long-term forest governance change.

This paper examines China's growing involvement in major WTO dispute settlement activities and concludes that China's participation has been a gradually evolving process. This article explains that China's defensive and derisive positions are generally balanced and argues that China seems to approach WTO disputes on a case-by-case basis rather than by applying any preset litigation avoidance strategy. When faced with negative rulings, China has so far been quite restrained in its reactions and has generally maintained a good record of compliance, but China's future behaviour in this regard may not always be as consistently positive. As to overall performance, this paper demonstrates that China's record has been typical of the bigger WTO Members. Finally, it would be unfair to assess this record only with reference to the global ranking of China's trade volumes and economic size while ignoring China's short period of WTO membership and lack of historical experience in international dispute settlement proceedings.","[Huang, Cui] WTO, Geneva, Switzerland; Zhejiang Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Huang, C (通讯作者)，WTO, Geneva, Switzerland.",huangcui@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,42,36,38,0,17,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This new system is an answer by organic producers to unsustainability of capital intensive agriculture, characterized by mass production, specialization, product standardization and high labour productivity that results in a weaker relation of agriculture to natural conditions and many negative consequences, especially in ecological, social and economic spheres. Development of organic production enabled development of the organic food market. Another incentive for organic food market development is consumers' increased interest in nutrition, health and environment protection. The first segment of this paper will present an overview of research related to definitions and perceptions of organic food. The second segment will present the empirical research of Croatian consumer's perception of organic food. Most research participants are familiar with the term 'organic food', mainly participants from the north of Croatia. Our research results are in alignment with findings published in literature worldwide and indicate that the most familiar with organic food are participants with at least college education and those with higher monthly incomes. The study also investigated whether consumers understand the definition of organic food and where from do they get information about it. Most of research participants think of organic food as of products produced without use of pesticides, artificial fertilizers, genetically modified organisms and other chemical additives. That is incorrect and indicates that consumers are not sufficiently informed about organic production and that the promotion of organic products is insufficient. In addition, paper compares consumer's perception of organic products and the conventional ones. The research findings indicate that consumers acknowledge the difference between organic and conventional products and find organic food healthier, tastier and more expensive than the conventional food. Finally, this paper contributes to the organic food literature by presenting findings from Croatian market and enabling comparison of organic food perceptions in Croatia with other markets. The research reveals new information necessary for evaluation of organic food market potential in Croatia, relevant for both producers and retailers.","[Brcic-Stipcevic, Vesna; Petljak, Kristina; Guszak, Irena] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, J.F Kennedy 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Brcic-Stipcevic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, J.F Kennedy 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",vbrcic@efzg.hr; kpetljak@efzg.hr; iguszak@efzg.hr,"Petljak, Kristina K./A-8408-2013",,,,,,27,4,4,0,12,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

The first approach involves incorporating the analysis of time as a key component of HSAs, making it possible to explore aspects of unpaid housework without the influence of monetary valuation. The second develops a new methodology that captures information on both housework and market work, overcoming some of the limitations of current databases used in the calculation of HSAs and allowing an analysis of the various interrelationships that exist between the two types of work.","[Carrasco, Cristina; Serrano, Monica] Univ Barcelona, Econ Theory Dept, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Carrasco, C (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Econ Theory Dept, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Serrano, Mònica/H-6489-2015","Serrano, Mònica/0000-0003-1190-5406",,,,,81,2,2,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In the second part, we compare the changes between labour productivity measured by the adjusted number of students in the period 2004-2009 and the changes between average wages adjusted of average inflation rate. While the increase in nominal wages is similar to the increase in number of students, the real wages increased quite slowly in comparison to an increase in real labour productivity.

Various authors and researchers approach regulation from diverse angles, but the common denominator to the most is that restrictive regulation in retailing is most commonly related to market access and retail operations. The purpose of this paper is to explore what are the main areas or forms of retail regulation in selected European countries, how their retailing companies react to ever changing regulation, and to compare the findings with the Croatian retailing market. The focus is on one of the most controversial areas of retail regulation: below cost selling or in competition law terms - predatory pricing. Accordingly, the proposition autors seek to analyse is that regulation of below cost selling in Croatia had no influence on retail development processes. However as of 2010, the new competition regulation might influence retailers' selling below cost/predatory pricing behaviour. To find sufficient arguments that would corroborate or challenge the above proposition, extensive literature overview and analysis was conducted. All relevant journal articles, internet resources, as well as original national laws were consulted. The analysis results indicate that levels of regulation vary between West European countries. France has one of the most restrictive systems, in 2006 Ireland revoked acts prohibiting below cost selling, but Germany in 2007 and Croatia in 2008 introduced restrictions to below cost selling in their retail regulation. The findings could be used to identify European best practices and benchmark Croatian retail regulation against them, pointing at the potential regulation alterations that would contribute to further retail development in Croatia.","[Guszak, Irena; Jagic, Tea] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,iguszak@efzg.hr; tjagic@efzg.hr,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Using farm-level survey data from the Brazilian Amazon, I estimate a production function to assess the value of forest fallow and test whether it provides local externalities to agricultural production. Soil quality controls, instrumental variables, and spatial econometric approaches help address endogeneity issues. I use GIS data on external forest cover at the farm level and model the hydrological externality as an upstream-to-downstream process. The estimated parameters indicate that fallow contributes significantly to productivity both on farm and downstream. In addition, most farms allocate sufficient land to fallow, accounting for both the value of hydrological spillovers and the opportunity cost of land left out of cultivation. These results suggest that farming communities may have some self-interest in preserving forest cover locally-a finding that may bolster policy efforts aimed at conserving tropical forests for their global public goods.

In the past ten years pharmaceutical incomes have almost doubled. That trend has made the pharmaceutical industry the most profitable one. The pharmaceutical industry is highly affected by globalisation and deregulation. Both processes caused increased competition among companies and, consequently, consolidation. Due to the specific characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry, such as high level of risk in R&D, profound capital dependence and high marketing expenses, the major pharmaceutical companies are searching for the sources of growth. Mergers and acquisitions are the most common growth strategies. Croatian pharmaceutical companies are faced with strong international competition. International pharmaceutical companies, thanks to liberal import policies of Croatian government, sell the same drugs as the local firms, but at lower prices. In addition, local companies are takeover targets for several multinational pharmaceutical corporations. Business practices investigated for this paper indicate that takeovers may have some negative consequences for the target companies, for example, reducing production, shortening production lines, cutting off staff or relocating research facilities. The aim of the paper is to investigate the limitation factors of the sustainable growth of Croatian pharmaceutical companies and to propose the measures for the elimination of those factors. A survey was conducted for that purpose. Questionnaires were mailed to all pharmaceutical companies in Croatia. The results have been analyzed and presented in the paper in order to understand and determine the level of the present development and to emphasize the key obstacles to accomplishing a more satisfactory growth and competitiveness. The central hypothesis in this paper is that strategic alliances could have a positive effect on enhancing sustainable growth of Croatian pharmaceutical companies.","[Martinovic, Marija] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,,marija.martinovic@unidu.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Information security risk management is a concept of increasingly widespread, covering a wide range of issues. According to Wespi these issues can be grouped into static security risk management and dynamic security risk management In the case of dynamic risk management the response to identified risks should occur immediately. So it is imperative to adapt classical models of risk management.

Thus, the Croatian economic growth over a few previous years has also been largely driven by construction. However, the global crisis, which started in the year 2008, in combination with internal structural problems has affected a lot of industries and institutions, and the Croatian construction industry has not been an exception. The construction industry in Croatia has faced its toughest challenges in the past twenty years. The state has drastically decreased investments in infrastructural projects, and private investors have been postponing investment decisions, causing cuts in jobs and in demands for building materials. As a result, salaries have been falling, affecting the buying power of potential homeowners and investments in commercial buildings. On the other hand, companies have been struggling with the crises, and there has been no need for additional office space. The impact of this situation looks to be getting worse before it might be getting better. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the recent global financial crisis combined with internal structural problems on the construction industry in Croatia, and to put forward proposals for the future of the construction industry in Croatia. The primary objective of this paper is to identify key lessons for the construction industry in Croatia by reflecting the global financial crisis. To meet their primary objective, the authors have conducted the qualitative research using content analysis (analysis of documents and materials). Due to the lack of previous researches on the topic, economic data and industry leaders' facts have been used. The major results of the research are related to actions that will contribute to the sustainable economic recovery from the current crisis.

The focus of this paper is to insists on the contribution that the new educational technologies may have on deculturalization minimization and on the.former's turning into calm technologies.","[Tugui, Alexandru] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,altug@uaic.ro,"TUGUI, Alexandru/D-5939-2012","TUGUI, Alexandru/0000-0001-8689-337X",,,,,8,0,0,0,6,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI, FACULTY ECONOMICS & BUSINESS ADMINSTRATION",IASI,"22 CAROL 1ST BLVD, IASI, 700505, ROMANIA",,,978-973-640-658-4,,,,2011,,,,,,,439,442,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BZM22,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000302002900074,0

The current H1N1 and potential H5N1 flu pandemics could have a much greater impact. Using a multi-sector single country computable general equilibrium model of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and The Netherlands, together with disease scenarios of varying severity, we examine the potential economic cost of a modern pandemic. Policies of school closure, vaccination and antivirals, together with prophylactic absence from work are evaluated and their cost impacts are estimated. Results suggest GDP losses from the disease of approximately 0.5-2% but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects. Increasing school closures from 4 weeks at the peak to entire pandemic closure almost doubles the economic cost, but antivirals and vaccinations seem worthwhile. Careful planning is therefore important to ensure expensive policies to mitigate the pandemic are effective in minimising illness and deaths.","[Keogh-Brown, Marcus Richard; Smith, Richard D.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, Hlth Policy Unit, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Edmunds, John W.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis CHERMID, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Antwerp,"Keogh-Brown, MR (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, Hlth Policy Unit, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",Marcus.keogh-brown@lshtm.ac.uk,"smith, james/HTQ-1933-2023; Smith, Richard/HMD-4857-2023; Smith, Richard/JZD-2895-2024; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Smith, Richard/0000-0003-3837-6559; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Keogh-Brown, Marcus/0000-0002-7556-0016",,,,,21,107,117,0,57,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Local school boards, however, still retain control over key aspects of the provision of education. Historically, these boards were organized at the community level so as to meet the wants of the local community. Today, states and provinces have become more interested in consolidating school boards and moving to a more centralized funding scheme. Do these changes result in improved student achievement? This paper attempts to answer these questions by examining the school board consolidation and funding changes instituted by the province of Ontario. We differentiate the effects of the policy changes based on observed differences in the school boards prior to consolidation. We show that students in previously high wealth school boards perform worse after the policy change compared to students in previously low wealth school boards. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

If there is in fact a utopian tradition imagining perfect bodies, what new alternatives are conceivable? Should utopian writers pursue any or all of them? Attempts to provide an answer provide critics with perhaps their most penetrating objections to the utopian project since imagining and reproducing perfect bodies entails an intrusiveness even greater than political or economic perfection. But the very intimacy of the body as a site also offers insights into the utopian imagination. Just as certain practices are excised in utopias (private property or money, for instance) and certain ones enhanced (education), so too are utopian bodies, which can be imagined as liberated prisons or improved forms. The utopian body, itself a complex site, becomes the most vivid focus for imaging the nature of perfection itself. New bodies, dramatically enhanced ones such as cyborgs or dramatically reduced ones such as cyber bodies, offer an intense examination of what perfection means and what lengths are worth pursuing to achieve it.

The authors develop a measure of implicit redistribution of pension wealth among teachers at varying ages of separation. Compared with a neutral system, we find that often about half of an entering cohort's net pension wealth is redistributed to teachers who separate in their fifties from those who separate earlier, and we also identify some variation across six state systems. This implies large costs for interstate mobility. We estimate that teachers who split a thirty-year career between two pension plans often lose over half their net pension wealth compared with teachers who complete a career in a single system. Plan options that permit purchases of service years mitigate few or none of these losses. It is difficult to explain these patterns of costs and benefits on efficiency grounds. More likely explanations include the relative influence of senior versus junior educators in interest group politics and a coordination problem between states.","[Costrell, Robert M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Podgursky, Michael] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Podgursky, Michael] So Methodist Univ, George W Bush Inst, Dallas, TX 75205 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Southern Methodist University,"Costrell, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, 201 Grad Educ Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",costrell@uark.edu; podgurskym@missouri.edu,,,,,,,34,27,35,0,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The region covers one sixth of the land mass of Australia with a population of only 200 000 people. One third of this population is indigenous and just over half of the land is under Aboriginal land title (mostly communal ownership). The landscapes in this region are still in a relatively good condition yet a large proportion of the indigenous population that reside within them are seen to be living with major social and health problems. The governance of the region is a complex mixture of Federal, Territory, and local Government, as well as indigenous and non-indigenous land ownership. To date, planning has largely been ad hoc and influenced by external factors, with little regard for Aboriginal aspirations for the future. Currently there is growing interest in developing the region which would appear to be associated with a drought that is adversely affecting the agricultural potential of southern States of Australia. This paper discusses some of the issues associated with the lack of a shared vision for the future of the NT. It recommends the use of an integrated holistic approach to planning, as defined by a Leitbild, as a strategy for creating a shared vision and working towards successful sustainable landscape planning. Other strategies put forward include placing an economic value on the ecological and cultural significance of the region, in particular providing real jobs on remote Aboriginal communities through developing enterprises based on sustainable use of wildlife and payment for the ecosystem services that Aboriginal land management provides, and applying more empowering methods of participation in scenario modelling for the future using Geographic Information Systems and other visualisation technology.

In examining these issues, the paper also analyses, through quantile regression, how the returns vary across the earnings distribution. The impact that education-job mismatch, both education level and field, has on earnings is also taken into consideration. The results derived indicate that, relative to the base case, there are higher returns to Medicine & Veterinary, Education, Engineering & Architecture, Science and Computers & IT. Small but significant returns were found for some of the competencies analysed, in particular technical skills. The quantile regression analysis reveals that both field and competency returns vary across the wage distribution and that, apart from Medicine & Veterinary and technical skills, field and competency-specific returns diminish as one moves up the earnings distribution.

The hiring decision is made at the school level by the principal or at the school district level. According to the data, efficiency is the highest in districts where hiring is decentralized. Hiring practices are decided by the school district, and linear estimates of the effect of decentralized hiring on efficiency may be biased because of non-random selection. First, I approach this problem by including a large set of controls in a school district level analysis, which does not alter the qualitative result. Second, I perform a school level analysis with district fixed effects. The results indicate, as expected, that the effect of decentralization is stronger for schools facing excess teacher supply than for schools without excess supply. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to address this question, I develop a model of human capital accumulation in which agents differ by race. I calibrate the model to reflect the U.S. system of education financing since the mid-1950s, and find that more than half of the black-white wage gap in the U.S. in the early 1990s can be accounted for by differential human capital accumulation by race. This indicates an increased role for policy in addressing racial inequality in the U.S. The results of the policy experiments conducted in this paper indicate that a conditional cash transfer program and a policy of decreased reliance on local property tax revenue would be effective in reducing the black-white skill and wage gaps.

Although they contribute to foster international trade, their misuse is likely to distort competition in the marketplace. In order to prevent competition being based on the amount of support received by the domestic Export Credit Agencies more than on price and quality of goods traded, states developed international rules within the framework of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and World Trade Organization (WTO). However, the manner in which those rules have been written creates an unbalanced playing field between developing and developed countries. During the Doha Development Round, some countries proposed amendments in the current WTO norms in order to modify items (j) and (k) of the Illustrative List of Annex I of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement and reduce die unbalances due to the financial and risk conditions of developing countries against developed countries.

Under monopsony, price is unavailable to clear the market; time of contract becomes the currency for working out market forces. Roth's matching serves to shore up the monopsony and would be unnecessary if the monopsony were removed; a superior solution is to end the monopsony.","Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Priest, GL (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",a.manning@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,20,8,8,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,,,J LABOR ECON,J.

In majoritarian systems, however, where the legislature consists of geographically distinct electoral districts, the majority party (at the national or state level) favors home districts; depending on the location of polluting industries and the associated damages, the majority party may therefore impose sub-optimally high or low pollution taxes due to a majority bias. Majority bias can influence the social-welfare ranking of alternative environmental tax policies. in some cases, majority bias may make decentralized or federal uniform taxation the preferred solution.

A 2-year non-randomised prospective observational cohort study was conducted in unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis patients scheduled for TKR (n = 431) or UKA (n = 102). Costs were identified using administrative databases and health outcomes were measured using the SF-36 and the Oxford knee score (OKS) 1 week before, 6 months after, and 2 years after surgery. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) for TKR versus UKA was calculated and its 95% confidence interval estimated using a nonparametric bootstrapping technique. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed from different perspectives. On average, from the societal perspective, the ICUR was US $65,245 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In the scenario with costs calculated from the perspective of patients, the ICUR was $60,382/QALY. This value decreased to $4,860/QALY in the scenario with costs calculated from the governmental perspective. However, the 95% confidence interval of ICURs cannot be defined because more than 5% bootstrapped samples fell into the upper left quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane from all three perspectives. Based on the 2-year data, TKR gained more QALYs at higher costs compared to UKA.

The strategy uses market prices, thereby avoiding some of the measurement problems associated with the constructed or prosy prices used in common valuation methods. A charter fee hedonic equation is estimated using data from the market for offshore charter fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The marginal value of,sportfishing harvest is identified using spatial variation in harvest rates and fish sizes. A two-stage minimum distance estimator is used to address potential omitted variables and cluster-sampling issues. Our results demonstrate that valid estimates of the marginal value of sportfishing harvest can be derived directly using market prices. The estimated marginal value per fish is consistent with published estimates using alternative methods. Thus, the hedonic approach suggested in this article offers promise as an independent validation of the typical methods used to value sportfishing harvest.","[Carter, David W.; Liese, Christopher] NOAA, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Carter, DW (通讯作者)，NOAA, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",david.w.carter@noaa.gov; christopher.liese@noaa.gov,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The first approach serves to demonstrate that emerging markets are deeply affected from global influences such as external shocks or signals and at least with neural network models the inclusion of exogenous variables from well established global markets significantly improves the forecasting performance of the emerging market model. However, one-value-ahead forecasting of price levels is not as useful as the shape of middle-term up and down movements, due to their inherent short-term randomness. The second approach proposes a novel one-subsequence-ahead forecasting framework that allows the prediction of stock index movements in a more robust way, focusing on predicting one price subsequence rather than one price level at a time.","Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Math Econ, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Georgescu, V (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Math Econ, Craiova, Romania.",v_geo@yahoo.com,"Georgescu, Vasile/AAE-7661-2021",,,,,,10,5,5,0,12,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In order to quantify the impact of discrimination on poverty, it proposes the construction of a counterfactual distribution of wages where discrimination against women has been removed. Using this new wage distribution, the study computes total household income and compares poverty rates in the absence of discrimination to those actually observed. The results show that, in general, discrimination against women plays a determinative role in the current levels of poverty in EU countries, although results by country show that this role differs in intensity and pattern. Further, the study finds that in EU countries the effect of discrimination on poverty risk dramatically increases for individuals in households that largely depend on working women' earnings.","[Gradin, Carlos; del Rio, Coral] Univ Vigo, Off Equal Opportun, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Gradín, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Off Equal Opportun, Vigo, Spain.",,"Cantó, Olga/E-7883-2016; del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; GRADIN, CARLOS/AAH-9326-2019","Cantó, Olga/0000-0003-0780-3212; del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; GRADIN, CARLOS/0000-0001-7744-0707",,,,,34,20,24,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The paper highlights significant variations in practice across the 17 countries. Common themes emerge from each of these practices and standards in terms of political interest in policies and awareness of CRC (both of which need to be enhanced), affordability (in terms of scarcity of resources in some countries and out-of-pocket payments for parts of the overall treatment process), access (in terms of the significant variation that has been observed within and across countries with regard to diagnostics, treatment and certain pharmaceuticals) and quality of CRC services (which may arise due to variations in treatment and pharmaceutical guidelines as well as minimal monitoring). When considering policy options for the future, it is important to, first, improve data collection both within as well as across countries through international co-operation; second, it is critical to have greater national and international support for cancer screening activities proven to be effective and cost-effective; third, endoscopy capacity in individual countries needs to be improved, also allowing more choice to ensure timely diagnosis, regardless of screening activities; fourth, public and political awareness needs to be enhanced as it is the key to improving CRC outcomes; fifth, where appropriate, to give consideration to the principles of equity, human dignity and disease severity, among others, when deciding on the uptake of new (targeted) treatments, rather than base decisions solely on cost-effectiveness criteria; and sixth, to firm up national guidelines including screening, diagnosis, treatment, pharmaceutical treatments and surveillance, with a view to enhancing their timeliness, evidence-base and free access to all.","[Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kanavos, Panos; Schurer, Willemien] London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk; g.w.schurer@lse.ac.uk,"Ellis, Christopher G/G-8649-2013","Ellis, Christopher G/0000-0002-7760-1846",,,,,72,41,41,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This situation does not comply with democratic political systems. The PRIFORT project tries to provide a better understanding of the characteristics of private forest owners in the region. Prevailing interest group theories are scrutinized by surveys of private forest owners and in-depth interviews of forest policy decision makers. The results indicate that although the number of private forest owners is large, there are good preconditions for creating independent private forest owners' interest associations (PFOAs). There is a clear demand of forest owners in an interest organization for services in sustainable forest management and better representation of their interests in national forest policy. Furthermore, many private forest owners in each country are prepared to engage themselves in the formation of independent interest groups.

Then we discuss the relationship between technological innovation capability maturity and innovation mode, and analyse the choosing of innovation mode according to technological innovation capability maturity level characteristics and their Key Process Areas. Our research finds that, enterprises may choose different innovation mode or innovation mode combination based on different technological innovation capability maturity. The enterprises with high maturity of technological innovation capability can choose a variety of innovation modes and their combination. On the other hand, the enterprise with low maturity can only choose simple mode of innovation.","[Qin Dezhi; Hu Hong] Yunnan Univ, Sch Business & Tourism Management, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China",Yunnan University,,qindezhi@vip.sina.com; huh999@yeah.net,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,7,AUSSINO ACAD PUBL HOUSE,MARRICKVILLE,"PO BOX 893, MARRICKVILLE, NSW 2204 00000, AUSTRALIA",,,978-1-921712-08-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,151,154,,,,,,4,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering,BVE87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291328700030,0

We analyzed 24 alternative spruce budworm protection scenarios for outbreaks on Prince Albert Forest Management Area (PAFMA) in Saskatchewan and Crown License I in New Brunswick. Scenarios included two outbreak severities (moderate and severe), three protection frequencies (very aggressive-protecting every year of the outbreak; aggressive-protecting the peak 3 years of outbreak; and semi-aggressive-protecting every second year of outbreak). and four protection program sizes (10,000 ha, 25,000 ha, 100,000 ha, or 150,000 ha). Under a severe outbreak. the largest (150,000 ha), very aggressive protection scenario provided the highest net CO2 protected at 24.95 million metric tons (Mt) in PAFMA and 29.19 Mt in License 1. This protection scenario also provided the highest net present value at $64.23 M and $91.36 M in PAFMA and License 1, respectively. On the other hand. benefit/cost ratios were maximized under the smallest (10,000 ha) protection size at 11.90 and 15.37 using the aggressive and semi-aggressive protection frequencies in PAFMA and License 1, respectively. Finally, the discounted cost per ton of CO2 protected was minimized at $0.48 and $0.37 using the smallest aggressive and semi-aggressive protection frequencies in PAFMA and License 1, respectively. The comparable costs and benefits from the moderate outbreak scenarios were similar, but generally less than, the severe outbreak scenarios. These results provide forest managers with important information needed to justify such carbon sequestration programs on economic grounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Slaney, G.

Even when they are, the properties of the data that make a test IRT scalable may not be the properties we seek to represent in an achievement scale, as shown by the lack of surface plausibility of many scales resulting from the application of IRT. An alternative, ordinal data analysis, is presented. It is shown that value-added estimates are sensitive to the choice of ordinal methods over conventional techniques. Value-added practitioners should ask themselves whether they are so confident of the metric properties of these scales that they are willing to attribute differences to the superiority of the latter.","Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Nashville, TN 37205 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Ballou, D (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Org, Nashville, TN 37205 USA.",dale.ballou@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,22,47,70,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This article studies the year-to-year variability in value-added measures for elementary and middle school mathematics teachers from five large Florida school districts. We find year-to-year correlations in value-added measures in the range of 0.2-0.5 for elementary school and 0.3-0.7 for middle school teachers. Much of the variation in measured teacher performance (roughly 30-60 percent) is due to sampling error from noise in student test scores. Persistent teacher effects account for about 50 percent of the variation not due to noise for elementary teachers and about 70 percent for middle school teachers. The remaining variance is due to teacher-level time-varying factors, but little of it is explained by observed teacher characteristics. Averaging estimates from two years greatly improves their ability to predict future performance.","[McCaffrey, Daniel F.; Lockwood, J.

We find that some of the discrepancy might be explained by the size of a ranch's herd and the amount of public forage the ranch can access. We find little evidence that the ranching lifestyle accounts for the difference between WTP and WTA for public forage, as asserted by some ranch economists.

We examine selectivity bias in both state-level and school-level SAT and ACT averages. The degree of selectivity may differ importantly across and within schools, and across and within states. To identify within-state selectivity, we use a control function approach that conditions on scores from a representative test. Estimates indicate strong selectivity of test-takers in ACT states, where most college-bound students take the ACT, and much less selectivity in SAT states. To identify within- and between-school selectivity, we take advantage of a policy reform in Illinois that made taking the ACT a graduation requirement. Estimates based on this policy change indicate substantial positive selection into test participation both across and within schools. Despite this, school-level averages of observed scores are extremely highly correlated with average latent scores, as across-school variation in sample selectivity is small relative to the underlying signal. As a result, in most contexts the use of observed school mean test scores in place of latent means understates the degree of between-school variation in achievement but is otherwise unlikely to lead to misleading conclusions.

The components of flexicurity are presented in more detail, followed by a review of,real worlds of flexicurity' in selected European countries, with Denmark and the Netherlands as the most prominent examples. The third section considers the transferability of flexicurity policies across borders.

Simulated tax incentives involved increasing capital cost allowance and investment tax credit and reducing corporate income tax. The production technology was specified as a function of capital, labor, energy, sawlogs, and a time dependent technological progress variable. A translog multilateral index number model was applied to measure and analyze TFP. Two analytical phases were followed. In the first phase, without the tax incentives, we analyzed annual levels and growth rates of TFP1; and parametrically examined effects of output growth and time dependent technology on the growth of TFPI. Over the study period, the average annual growth rate of TFP1 was 2%; and the parametric results revealed that the marginal effects of each of output growth and technological progress on TFPI growth were highly significant. The second phase involved recalculation of the rental price of capital to estimate effects of the simulated tax incentives on capital formation and growth of TFP (=TFP2). As expected, the average annual share of capital in total cost with the tax incentives rose to 12% from 9% without the tax incentives. The average annual capital intensity also rose to real $15,263.70 with the incentives from real $10,402.91 without the incentives. Most importantly, higher capital formation, motivated by the tax incentives, raised aggregate quantity of the inputs significantly, leading to a slightly lower TFP2 than TFP1, because output was unchanged. In short, the data validated the hypothesis that tax incentives do indeed spur capital formation and TFP growth. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Clearly, economic rights of different kinds are now part of the human rights arena. A prediction is that a great variety of assets, shares, obligations, futures, factoring, etc. will in the future gain from not only diplomatic protection, but also from direct personal applicability of human rights. The human rights protection according to ECHR, PAP Article 1 - the rights of which should be Practical and effective - sets forth a complicated, intertwined, three-step determinative process: (1)The principle of peaceful use of one's possession[s], which requires the injured party to demonstrate that his interest qualifies as a 'possession.' (2) A legally valid expropriation and state interference or intervention that turns into a deprivation when it exceeds a minimum level of intensity. In concreto the deprivation must be in the public interest and must have taken place subject to the conditions provided for by law, and by the general principles of international law. Illegal takings do not require a showing of formal, i.e. de jure expropriation. It is sufficient that a de facto deprivation affects the party's peaceful enjoyment of his or her possessions in a manner that is equal to expropriation. (3) The deprivation must be carried out in the cause of public interest. To be justified or legally justifiable, a deprivation should strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the state's duty to protect the individual's fundamental rights. If the agencies fail to conduct such a deliberation, the plaintiff has a solid claim. Where the government does not deliberate the merits of the conflicting community and individual claims, it has demonstrably never initiated the balancing process in the first place, which in and of it self breaches plaintiff's human rights.","Univ Tromso, N-9001 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Orebech, PT (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, N-9001 Tromso, Norway.",,,,,,,,7,1,1,1,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Worldwide, in the European Union and so in Latvia the features of ongoing socioeconomic crisis force drawing attention to activisation around decentralisation, and focus on the questions of regional development more intense, particularly searching solutions for the research and analysis of a more efficient economic potential and its use in regions and counties. Whilst carrying out an analysis of the current situation, it is clear to see that during the years of gaining the independence of Latvia, fundamental changes have been made that form the base for the regional development. Nevertheless, the regional development strategy lacks elaboration foreruns that would be targetly implemented on different public levels - starting from the smallest state units - families, different social groups, and local governments, to the other side - supreme state administration institutions, thereby harmonising, strengthening and improving the instruments and support measures for attaining regional development that would be not only formally created in a format of documents but would also be practically enforceable in regions, and in certain region this measure would be relevantly necessary (providing essential input in the regional development). It is necessary to give a greater possibility to regions to convey their real specific potentialities for development, and to be able to choose scenarios of a more rational and effective economic (regional) development. A lot has been done in solving and implementing Latvia's regional development issues, nevertheless it is clear that the accomplished work lacks a view at passing of a resolution like a process of solving dilemmas. Economic development is the goal not only in Latvia, but also worldwide, in particular, in peripheries, in ulterior territories of countries - in regions. Ireland can be mentioned as a positive state economic and regional development example, as it is also located in a remote part of Europe, nevertheless with the help of a proper macroeconomic policy and ability to create favourable economic relations with other countries (also outside the EU), it is one of the most developed countries in the EU. In the development period of Ireland three main directions of economic policy can be marked: fiscal stabilisation, open conditions of trade and investments, and industrial policy that also applies to attraction of foreign investments (especially in IT field). The experience of Ireland witnesses that participation in the EU has given additional potentialities for economic and regional development. It ensured the increase of investments and capital flow, new jobs, greater stability and wherewith higher welfare. The success of this state to a great extent depended on the way it used the EU offered opportunities. The is no doubt that the creation of counties carried out in accordance with the Administrative-territorial reform increases the possibilities of build up the financial resources and offers a possibility to uptake them efficiently, and to develop a certain state municipality's territory, in such a way increasing its economic potential, and thereby attracting new residents and creating favourable environment for entrepreneurship and development. The economic potential of counties forms like a combined structure in every field of the county's activities and competencies mostly depending on the action and activities of a certain county, managerial, strategically far-reaching and reasonable use of the available nature, infrastructure, financial social, and other resources. Looking in perspective, in Latvia, just like in other EU countries, municipalities will have the most important role in the development of regions. Nevertheless it is necessary to define also the concept of municipalities' development, taking into consideration the real available economic potential of a certain region, or territory to obtain ultimate impact.","[Cingule, Sanda] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,,,,,,,,,11,5,5,0,9,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-9937-2-0,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2009,,19,,,,,294,306,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BUR80,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000290182700039,0

The highly complex nature of such procedures is detailed, actual applications are highlighted, and a first glimpse of where we are going with this technology in the near future is revealed.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Coppin, P (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Kasteelpk Arenberg 20, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",,"Coppin, Pol/HJB-2341-2022; Coppin, Pol/A-5201-2013",,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,23,28,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.824.2,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100002,0

The objectives were to assess the impact of improved vegetable varieties and associated cultivation technologies on small farmers' livelihoods, as well as the factors accounting for successful diffusion and adoption. Ten case study hybrid varieties were selected, based on the extent of adoption. For each variety, at least five case study locations were selected in order to reflect varying conditions. Rapid appraisals were conducted in each location, which comprised of farmer discussions and diagramming techniques on the history of adoption and the factors which were most influential. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with at least 30 farmers in each location to estimate changes in net income from cultivating the case study hybrid. Where possible, comparable farmers cultivating traditional varieties were also interviewed. Based on perceived changes over time, the median increase in surveyed farmers' income was estimated to range between 0 and 180%, depending on the variety studied. In some instances, the increase was reported to be as high as 400%, but many farmers also reported declines in their income. The most commonly reported constraint for farmers to cultivate a new variety and adopt the associated technology was the lack of credit to finance the higher input costs. It is also clear that farmers receive information about new technology packages primarily through the marketing and demonstration activities of seed companies. The results suggest that public policy should consider opportunities for supporting this diffusion process through enabling actions such as credit programs or infrastructure and more innovative extension activities. Seed companies may also benefit from an improved understanding of the mixed experiences of farmers.","[Eaton, D.; Wiersinga, R.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2502 LS The Hague, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Eaton, D (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, POB 29703, NL-2502 LS The Hague, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-721-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,809.0,,,,,,77,90,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.809.5,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAR76,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305323300005,0

The last thirty years, however, the Swedish consumption has decreased from approximately 90 to 50 kilograms per person and year. The potato has lost market shares to substitutes like pasta, rice and various sorts of bread, one often stated explanation being an increase in convenience food. While other vegetables, like tomato, pepper and lettuce, have become highly differentiated during the last decade, the potato has remained an undifferentiated commodity, mainly associated with low price, unstable quality and low status. This paper aims at describing Swedish consumers' attitudes to potato. In our study, 202 respondents were interviewed. The results show that Swedish consumers prefer to buy unpackaged potatoes. However earlier studies show that the consumers tend to say they prefer unpackaged fruit and vegetables to packaged ones, but in a real buying situation, given the choice, they picked the packed ones. The reasons for not buying packaged potatoes were that the existing packages are too big, sealed paper bags. Our study indicates that the range of potato varieties could be increased in shop; both as packaged and unpackaged products. Packaging could provide benefits to the consumers, like improved printed information and additional features such as packages prepared for cooking in microwave ovens or even semi-prepared potatoes. Changes in consumer behaviour and a rapidly changing market for fruits and vegetables (potato included) put the potato growers and wholesalers in a new situation where it will be necessary to transform the potato from a low status bulk product into a differentiated product meeting consumer demands.","[Fernqvist, F.; Ekelund, L.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Econ & Environm Psychol, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Fernqvist, F (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Econ & Environm Psychol, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",,"Fernqvist, Fredrik/B-8969-2015","Fernqvist, Fredrik/0000-0002-6534-3587",,,,,12,6,6,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,313,317,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.831.37,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700037,0

Las Vegas has one of the largest food service industries in North America and has emerged as a restaurant destination for tourists due to the growth in quantity and quality of gourmet restaurants. Many of these gourmet restaurants were opened by chefs who have a history of using locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables. These chefs have been known to pay as much as US$ 16 per kg of fresh vegetables shipped overnight from markets in California, Arizona, Utah and the Midwestern U. S. Virtually all of the food imported into Las Vegas comes from distances greater than 250 miles with more than 99% of it coming from another state. Every dollar spent on imported food is one dollar lost from the local economy. The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association estimate that if every family in Maine spent $ 10 dollars a week on local food, it would put $ 104 million into their local economy. Southern Nevada has little history of production agriculture because of its reliance on tourism and subsequent large service industry, the lack of a land grant (agricultural) university, and the region's geographic isolation and harsh, desert climate. Although prices and local acceptance by chefs for locally produced fresh fruits and vegetables potentially make production in southern Nevada economically feasible, two primary barriers have yet to be surmounted: local production of sufficient quantities of high quality food by inexperienced growers and adequate marketing or distribution channels. A research and demonstration program area of the University of Nevada has aimed at stimulating local production of fresh food by rural producers in close proximity to Las Vegas and assisting these producers in developing marketing channels for their fresh, high value products into Las Vegas.","[Morris, R.

However, informal knowledge transfer via unofficial networks proceeds horizontally as well as vertically at all levels. The findings are important, both to senior management and to researchers and other team members, because the effect of tight coupling among the working processes is usually ignored, and an analysis that treated these processes individually would lack an important attribute. In order to improve knowledge transfer within the ARO it is necessary to reduce the reward effect and minimize the trust gap. In addition, specific measures should be introduced, to enhance the knowledge transfer process.

Better understanding the interaction of harvesting machines and tree canopy during harvest, by measuring and analyzing the force distribution of fruit in the canopy under real harvesting conditions, could help to improve the existing canopy harvesting machines. The goal of this study was to measure the force experienced by different sizes of oranges in different parts of the canopy during harvest with a tractor driven, canopy-shaking harvesting machine. Multi-node, ZigBee-based wireless sensors equipped with three-axis accelerometer sensors were developed for this study. These sensors were placed on many fruits of different sizes and locations in tree canopies. These tests were conducted in trees in different groves. The force experienced by these fruits was measured, and the force distribution within the tree canopy was analyzed. The force exerted on the fruit was dependent on the location of the fruit in the canopy. The average maximum detachment force for 'Hamlin' was 25.3 kg-f and 23.9 kg-f for 'Valencia' oranges. In addition to the amount of force, the duration for which there is significant force is an important factor that determines fruit removal. The distribution of force over time on each fruit was found to be a Gaussian distribution. The duration for the significant force was taken to be the time interval for the first standard deviation interval.","[Udumala, S.

This article discusses the origin of the concept of stranded capital, its use in other policy settings, preconditions, measurement, and remedies for addressing it. Our main finding is that rationalization of fisheries is unlikely to generate significant processing stranded capital. Most capital involved in fisheries processing is malleable and not likely to be devalued as a result of rationalization. If policy makers nevertheless judge it desirable to consider compensation, a legitimate process would lie compensation to anticipated or demonstrated capital losses. Current policies proposed on the U.S. West Coast to transfer harvester quota are arbitrary and unsupported by empirical estimates of the magnitude of the problem. They are likely to generate important spillover effects that could negate some of the intended benefits of rationalization.","[Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Nat Resources Policy Anal, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Wilen, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,33,13,20,0,6,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

In view of the deadlock in current multilateral trade negotiations, the hortatory character of the provisions of the Convention, and the US stance on the treatment of cultural goods and services in international economic exchanges, US FTAs are to prove the main source of legal constraints as to states' ability to pursue cultural policies.","Bishops Univ, Dept Polit Studies, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",Bishops University,"Gagné, G (通讯作者)，Bishops Univ, Dept Polit Studies, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.",ggagne@ubishops.ca,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,11,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The estimated marginal rate of return generally rises in the former education level, and reaches the maximum at 15 years of the former level (therefore 16 years of education after reinvestment), where an additional year of investment is associated with a rise in real hourly rate of pay by approximately 20%. Evidence also shows that, while the level of individuals' risk tolerance affects significantly the probability of returning to school, correcting for sample selectivity makes little difference in the results. Findings in the current paper survive a variety of robustness tests. The current cohort-based evidence is more helpful than existing evidence from cross-sectional data to individuals making schooling decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternatively, the allocative efficiency hypothesis argues that schooling alters the input mix chosen to produce health. This suggests that the more educated have more knowledge about the health production function and they have more health knowledge. This paper uses data from the 1997 and 2002 waves of the NLSY97 to conduct an investigation of the allocative efficiency hypothesis by analyzing whether education improves health knowledge. The survey design allows us to observe the increase in health knowledge of young adults after their level of schooling is increased by differential and plausibly exogenous amounts. Using nine different questions measuring health knowledge, we find weak evidence that an increase in education generates an improvement in health knowledge for those who ultimately attend college. For those with high school as the terminal degree, no relationship is found between education and health knowledge. These results imply that the allocative efficiency hypothesis may not be the primary reason for why schooling impacts health outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In Milwaukee County, the Learnfare procedures were poorly implemented and the random-assignment process failed to produce balanced baseline traits. However, in the nine remaining counties, Learnfare increased school enrollment by 3.5 percent (effect size = 0.08) and attendance by 4.5 percent (effect size = 0.10).

A detailed understanding of this industry is important because U.S. environmental policies seek to substantially expand ethanol use. Evidence of market power may alter the types of policies pursued by lawmakers. I find that ethanol shipment prices are lower for more competitive routes. I also find evidence that railroads price discriminate based on environmental regulation at route destinations. Monopolist prices for shipments to carbon monoxide non-attainment areas are 3% higher than shipments to other destinations. This price premium falls sharply with increased competition.

While the value of nature-related tourism has been assessed, little is known about the effect of invasive plants on recreational choices. This study uses non-market valuation techniques for the first time to quantify the net benefit of managing invasive plants in upland areas. We surveyed 1436 Florida residents to determine their preferences for state parks using discrete choice experiment questions with various levels of invasive plants and other attributes that impact visitation. Results imply that residents would be willing to pay $5.41 per-visit to reduce the coverage of invasive plants, $3.72 to improve facilities, $3.73 to increase the diversity of native plant species, and $6.71 to increase the diversity of native animal species. Using score variables to capture interaction effects, demographic variables were found to influence the marginal willingness-to-pay for invasive species control by -$1.13 to +$0.97 per visit. Those who have taken action against or are more knowledgeable about invasive species were also found to influence a respondent's willingness to pay (+$2.47 and +$0.83, respectively). Respondents who consider invasive species to be beneficial (e.g., since many species were imported for their esthetics) would be willing to pay an additional $0.80 per visit to a park with increased coverage. Using annual attendance data from 115 Florida state parks, we calculated statewide willingness-to-pay to manage invasive plants in upland parks. Park users would be willing to spend $89.4 million annually to reduce the level of invasive plants in the parks, which provides a baseline for evaluating control programs. Since current levels of funding ($32 million annually) are insufficient to control invasive plants, additional management may be warranted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Policies to boost renewable energy front agriculture feedstocks, for example, are widespread in the United States and the European Union (EU), despite the uncertainties concerning their impacts on commodity demand, trade flows, water use, and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. This article argues that there is a relationship between market-distorting farm policies and the respective level of environmental impact. This is particularly true in the case of policies that are not decoupled from production. Because the problems involving agriculture production and trade are global and systemic in nature, WTO rules play an important role in securing that new forms of agriculture protectionism, justified by legitimate policy objectives, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, do not jeopardize agriculture trade liberalization.","King & Spalding LLP, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Dantas, A (通讯作者)，King & Spalding LLP, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",adantas@kslaw.com,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,12,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The approach follows Durkheim's focus on the social functions of religion. It is hypothesized that economic prosperity leads to an exchange of the mediators of social activities, rather than to an increase in existential security or rationalization: With income development individuals increasingly engage in consumption-related practices. In turn, traditional religious activities, contexts and symbols lose their significance as mediators for social action. This hypothesis is tested, in competition with the 'updated secularization hypothesis' of Norris and Inglehart, via multilevel analyses. Data are drawn from the European Social Survey and the Eurobarometer, relying on micro and macro units on 82 (NUTS1) regions from 20 European countries. In accordance with the consumption hypothesis, results indicate that increases in gross domestic product lead to religious decline primarily by supplanting the dominant modes of social action.","Fernuniv, Dept Sociol, Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Hirschle, J (通讯作者)，Fernuniv, Dept Sociol, Hagen, Germany.",jochen.hirschle@fernuni-hagen.de,,"Hirschle, Jochen/0000-0003-3654-4619",,,,,65,17,19,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Facilities with environmental management systems (EMS) certified to ISO 14001 are 40% more likely to assess their suppliers' environmental performance and 50% more likely to require that their suppliers undertake specific environmental practices. Further, government programs that encourage voluntary EMS adoption indirectly promote GSCM practices. These programs increase the probabilities that facilities will assess their suppliers' environmental performance and require suppliers to undertake specific environmental practices by 7% and 8%, respectively.

Capitation refers to distributing funds based on the entire student enrollment. We find that disability rates tended to fall following capitation reforms, primarily in subjectively diagnosed categories and in early and late grades. The association appears immediately in less severe categories but gradually in severe categories. More frequent program exiting partly accounts for falling disability rates among high school students. Capitation also is associated with a rising local share and a falling state share of funding. The evidence supports an increased use of outside school placements among severe disabilities, consistent with an incentive-based response. We find weaker evidence of a relationship between capitation and higher request rates for dispute resolution. Finally, we present evidence of differential effects based on both the pre-reform funding system and the presumed strength of the policy change.","[Dhuey, Elizabeth] Univ Toronto, Ctr Ind Relat & Human Resources, Toronto, ON M5S 2E8, Canada; [Lipscomb, Stephen] Math Policy Res Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of Toronto; Mathematica,"Dhuey, E (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ctr Ind Relat & Human Resources, Toronto, ON M5S 2E8, Canada.",elizabeth.dhuey@utoronto.ca; slipscomb@mathematica-mpr.com,"Dhuey, Elizabeth/E-4886-2012","Dhuey, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2833-4323",,,,,33,15,27,1,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",1557-3060,,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

I investigate the impact of Proposal A on the distribution of resources and educational outcomes. I analyze the differential effects on the lowest-spending and the highest-spending districts, highlighting the role of local discretion, which has so far been neglected in the literature. I also provide important evidence on the effect of spending on academic performance. Proposal A was quite successful in reducing interdistrict spending disparities. There was also a significant positive effect on student performance in the lowest-spending districts as measured in state tests.

There is an increasing acceptance that consumers' preferences, traders' requirements and farmers' acceptability must be the driving force behind developing appropriate varieties and technologies, but their perceptions are rarely explored and considered. This study was conducted to identify the relevant attributes of some vegetables as perceived by consumers, traders, farmers and plant breeders as a relevant input for redefining plant breeding programs. The similarities and differences in preference between consumers, traders, farmers and scientists were compared. Significant differences were observed between consumers and traders in the case of cabbage. Significant differences were also observed between farmers and scientists for cabbage, potato and tomato.

Using datasets representative of the population of the US and Korea, this contribution shows that gender differences in the workers' observed characteristics and the unobserved component reduce gender earnings gaps in union jobs in both the US and Korea. Fringe benefits in the union sector attract women workers with higher labor market qualifications into the union sector and thereby reduce the gender earnings gap in this sector. The study finds that this self-selection process in the union sector is stronger in Korea than in the US, but the seniority-based wage system that prevails in the Korean union sector widens the gender earnings gap.","[Cho, Donghun] Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, Chuncheo City 200702, South Korea; [Cho, Donghun] Hallym Univ, Econ Res Inst, Chuncheo City 200702, South Korea; [Cho, Joonmo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Hallym University; Hallym University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Cho, D (通讯作者)，Hallym Univ, Dept Econ, 39 Hallymdaehak Gil, Chuncheo City 200702, South Korea.",hooncho@hallym.ac.kr; trustcho@skku.edu,"Cho, Joonmo/B-7368-2012",,,,,,28,16,19,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

It is within teacher's ability to open learners' will to speak and interact so learners would be involved in creating process of their own expressions. Playing games, filling the quizzes and asking classmates peculiar questions just to win the word puzzle are just few examples. Introducing riddles or idioms is another way how to enhance sense for culture and foreign language.

Labour tax burden is measured using standard OECD practice of the tax wedge for a single earner. Analysis deals with three Western Balkan states: FYR Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. All three countries apply uniform proportional tax rate in personal income taxation and rates vary between 8% and 10%. Also, all three countries were a part of former Yugoslavia which means that they historically come from the same system of labour taxation. Of all three countries, only Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to complicated constitutional framework, does not have a unified income-related fiscal policy at the state level. Income tax reforms started at different times with dfferent policies applied at entity levels, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska as well as Brcko District(5). One of the reasons why countries apply income tax reforms is to decrease the level of labour tax burden. In this paper, it will be shown that all analysed countries apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina did reforms with the aim of reducing the tax wedge. B&H's income tax reform did not have any effects on decreasing the level of tax wedge.","[Kreso, Sead; Lazovic-Pita, Lejla] Sch Business & Econ, Trg Oslobodjenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Kreso, S (通讯作者)，Sch Business & Econ, Trg Oslobodjenja 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",sead.kreso@efsa.unsa.ba; lejla.lazovic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Lazovic-Pita, Lejla/AAP-4342-2021","Lazovic-Pita, Lejla/0000-0001-9421-1842",,,,,16,0,0,1,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

This study applies the Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem (GCCT) developed by Lewbel (1996), to test the aggregation of French household demand of salmon. The results indicate that demand for salmon can be aggregated based on product form (i.e., fresh, frozen, and smoked salmon). These composites can be further aggregated into a single salmon category. Salmon demand can, therefore, be estimated using a system which only includes salmon equations. The composite demand elasticities estimated by the AIDS model suggest that fresh and smoked salmon significantly substitute each other in the French salmon market. This means that the estimation of an import demand system that does not include smoked salmon cannot really explain real consumer demand. The results also suggest that wild salmon is playing in a different market niche than farmed salmon.","[Xie, Jinghua; Myrland, Oystein] Univ Tromso, Tromso Business Sch, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Xie, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Tromso Business Sch, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",xie.jinghua@uit.no; oystein.myrland@uit.no,,,,,,,18,35,35,0,14,"MRE FOUNDATION, INC",KINGSTON,"PO BOX 1828, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA",0738-1360,,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Forest companies and local farmers sell pulpwood to these mills. The real pulpwood price data was collected from two paper mills in the northern part of Iran. These mills buy most pulpwood in this area. Game theory has been used in order to investigate the market structure in this region. Game theory is the study of interacting decision makers. Game theory has been widely used in economics. Most economic behaviour can be viewed as a special case of game theory. A game model includes a set of players, a set of strategies and a set of payoffs. This study focuses on the theory of dynamic duopsony games. When pulpwood is sold, the different mills use mixed strategies to give sealed bids. In each transaction, each mill (player) has two different possible strategies (decisions): a high (H) or a low (L) prices. Which price should you set? What is the optimal price of the other player? Here the situation is a noncooperative game. Nash equilibrium and dynamic properties of the system are determined. Each mill continuously observes the frequencies of the other mills action. The expected marginal profits are calculated based on this information. In case the marginal profit of mill A is strictly positive (zero or strictly negative), mill A increases (leaves unchanged, decreases) bids. In case the marginal profit of mill B is strictly positive (zero or strictly negative), mill B increases (leaves unchanged, decreases) bids. It is found that the decision probability combination of the different mills follow a special form of attractor and that centers should be expected to appear in unconstrained games.

The concept of naturoid has been introduced in the last decade or so, for referring to man's attempts to reproduce natural phenomena. The development of naturoids may be viewed as a special class of technological activity, distinct from the general class of technology. The concept of naturoid should be useful for methodological research aimed at finding possible common rules, potentialities and constraints characterizing the human effort to reproduce natural objects. Tacitly, many designers think that the continuing improvement of a naturoid consists in its ever-growing overlap with the natural instance, and that the holy grail, as it were, is the complete reconstruction of a natural object of process, from its external appearance to its inner workings. This paper tries to show that a naturoid is always the result of a reduction of the complexity of natural objects, due to an unavoidable multiple selection strategy. Nevertheless, the reproduction process implies that naturoids take on their own new complexity, resulting in a transfiguration of the natural exemplars and their performances, leading to a true innovation explosion. As a matter of fact, the core performances of contemporary naturoids improve, but, paradoxically, the more a naturoid develops, the further away it moves from its natural counterpart. Therefore, naturoids will more and more affect our relationships with advanced technologies and with nature, but in ways quite beyond our predictive capabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

At the time, college admissions were highly selective and applicants were ranked with respect to their formal merits. Admissions were given to those ranked higher than some threshold value. At the margin, applicants were sometimes randomly assigned to college. Exploiting this Regression-Discontinuity design, individuals who were admitted in 1982 are estimated to have about 0.20 years longer college education in 1996. However, the earnings effects for applicants at the margin of admission are insignificant. Controlling for the college admission determinants, the OLS-estimates of the return to college is 1.4 percent in 1991-96. The IV-estimates are not significantly different from the OLS counterparts.

Carina H.; Lidestav, Gun",,,Swedish forest commons - A matter of governance?,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest common; Forest policies; Forest governance; Sweden,,"Around 100 years ago, when Crown land in the interior of northern Sweden was privatized, part of the forest and was set aside as forest commons. Today, there are 33 such forest commons jointly managed and owned in common mainly by private forest owners. The forest commons may be looked upon as a means by which the state controls the production of and returns from the forests belonging to small and less affluent forest owners. Further, an attempt has been made to use the forests as a tool to move the self-interests of these small forest owners closer to providing public goods. Forest commons thus hold a contested status, as private lands under public control and as a partly deregulated form of ownership. This paper examines the extent to which forest commons are currently managed directly by the government, comparing this with the general trend in forest policy towards governance and less prescriptive measures, which often take account of market and participative goals. Building upon Appelstrand (2007), this paper describes the major policy instruments relevant for forest commons from 1861 to 2005. We conclude that direct government management remains dominant, with the major legislation pertaining to forest commons dating back to the 1950s. While governance may seem to be inherent in the forest commons concept, the development of governance has not been fully realised given the relatively strict government-steered framework.

Web-based systems of collaboration between and within firms and their customers, as well as customer engagement in product innovation, have underscored claims about the evaporation of traditional labour markets and labour processes as well as about (weakening) divisions between production and consumption. This has led to (exaggerated) debates about the contribution of 'free' or 'immaterial' labour to contemporary economies. This paper argues that while significant restructuring has changed traditional organisational forms, capital markets remain centralised and digital labour remains as regulated as other labour. As such, while labour cannot be fully commodified, digital labour is neither free or immaterial, because it is not the content of labour itself, but rather its relationship with capital that gives it 'weight' and value.","Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Discipline Work & Org Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"van den Broek, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Econ & Business, Discipline Work & Org Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",diane.vandenbroek@sydney.edu.au,,"Van Den Broek, Diane/0000-0001-9618-2272",,,,,45,8,9,2,21,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES-CENTRE APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH,SYDNEY,"ECONOMIC & LABOUR RELATIONS REVIEW, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RES CTR, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA",1035-3046,,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Concentration indices are most commonly calculated using individual-level survey data. Incomplete data is a pervasive problem faced by most applied researchers who use survey data. The default analysis method in most statistical software packages is complete-case analysis. This excludes any cases where any variables are missing. If the missing variables in question are not completely random, the calculated concentration indices are likely to be biased, which may lead to inappropriate policy recommendations. In this paper, I use both a case study and a simulation study to show how complete-case analysis may lead to biases in the estimation of concentration indices. A possible solution to correct such biases is proposed.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhong, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 S Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",haizhong@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,25,8,12,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Crop values are compared with the Faustmann value, the benchmark for forest valuation in New Zealand. The increase in forest value can be substantial when log prices are low and close to the exercise cost. Gains quickly diminish and become small, both as an absolute difference and as a percentage of forest value, as price increases. However, results are very sensitive to the log price model adopted. Assuming log prices are mean reverting gives higher values than Faustmann for all log prices. Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Binomial Option Pricing (BOP) give very similar results. They evaluate the same harvest/defer harvest/never harvest options. A new Abandonment Adjusted Price approach gives results that have a similar pattern but are consistently lower than SDP and BOP. This approach only considers whether to harvest or not in the optimal year and does not allow the option of deferring harvest. At the present time, option valuation approaches have limited relevance for the practice of forest valuation in New Zealand. Practical issues (determination of the log price model, estimation of volatility, allowing for multiple log grades and modelling at the estate-level) need to be addressed before option value approaches can be routinely used for forest valuation.

On average, petrochemical firms in our sample experience a drop in their market value of 1.3% over the two days immediately following the disaster. Using multivariate analysis, we show that this loss is significantly related to the seriousness of the accident as measured by the number of casualties and by chemical pollution: each casualty corresponds to a loss of $164 million and a toxic release to a loss of $1 billion.

In the particular case of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, failing prices and declining profit margins have led to reduced participation in the limited-entry fishery. This study conducts a formal examination of market interactions between the aquaculture and commercial fishery sectors by adapting the Homans and Wilen (1997) model of regulated open access to the context of restricted access fisheries. The econometric model reveals that limited entry regulations were initially successful in extracting rents from the Bristol Bay fishery: however, these rents were gradually dissipated as a result of overcapacity and the effect of falling ex-vessel prices. The emergence of aquaculture provides a strong rationale in favor of right-based approaches to fisheries management in Alaska. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Second, are there circumstances under which exceptional methodologies, i.e. 'zeroing', can better achieve the stated objectives of the agreement than the standard methodologies explicitly stated in the agreement? We argue that the institutional structure and foundational norms of the WTO imply the need for Panels to be bound by the prior decisions of the Appellate Body. Our economic analysis describes the costs and benefits of legal systems with and without precedent. Regarding methodology, we argue that any analysis of the suitability of a methodology (i.e. 'zeroing') must be undertaken jointly with an analysis of the underlying objective of the agreement (i.e. remedying injury).

The Appellate Body's reasoning makes clear that the primary purpose of the SPS Agreement is to discipline discriminatory regulation, and not the level of protection. We argue that the case clarifies that de facto protection (market segmentation) created by an SPS measure must be motivated by demonstrating that the measure is addressing a market failure, as reflected in the existence of some scientific basis for a health or safety concern. The scientific-basis requirement is a means for determining the intent of an SPS measure. While this is a factor that is ostensibly not relevant in GATT national-treatment cases, the need for scientific justification is not a move away from a concern with preventing illegitimate discrimination against imported products.","[Trachtman, Joel] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,,bhoekman@worldbank.org,"Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020",,,,,,0,12,12,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2010,9.0,1,,,,,151,180,,10.1017/S1474745609990280,0.0,,,30,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,586BO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276876100007,0

Based on household survey data, this paper analyzes the increasing trend of wage inequality over time in China. Our analysis shows that the evolution of labour institutions, in particular changes in wage policies which enables wage determination to be more market based play a role in widening the wage gap between different levels of education and skills. Our study in the paper also reveal that the change in wage policy is not the only factor for the rise in the wage gap, other factors such as discrimination against female workers and migrant workers, as well as institutional barrier like `HuKou System' were also responsible for the widening of the wage inequality.","[Hu Yongjian] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,,Tjhuy2009@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,7,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54629-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,223,237,,,,,,15,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300067800036,0

Since there are lots of methods to calculate Gini coefficient, it is easy to use various data, and it is easy to make international comparison. But when we use Gini coefficient for income disparity comparison we should combine it with Lorenz curve to inspect. The computational method of the coefficient of variation is mature and easy to understand. But it needs the detailed personal income data or the grouping data. The data request is quite high. The income share of certain number population measure methods can be calculated the by using grouped data, or even part of them is incomplete, not requiring detailed personal data. Generalized entropy index is origin from the information theory and Atkinson index has a social welfare standard view. There best advantage is that they can be decomposed, we decompose population into groups and analyze them. We also points out that a single index has certain limitations. We can choose an index system which include a key index and supplemented by some secondary indices to measure income disparity much comprehensively and profoundly.","[Huang Xiaoli] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Dianzi University,,huangxiaoli88@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 5-11 QUEENS RD,, MELBOURNE, VC 3004, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-646-54629-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,268,272,,,,,,5,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYS99,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300067800041,0

Since the end-users may belong to different administrative domains, they are usually selfish; resulting in degradation of the aggregate throughput (welfare) of the network. Thus, the main challenge in order to design the mechanisms for such networks is exploiting the inherent selfishness of the end-users in such a way that the total welfare is maximized. This paper presents an economical model for multi-service overlay networks based on producer-consumer theory in which each offered service can be thought of as a good and the origin servers and the users who relay the service to their downstream nodes can thus be thought of as firms of the economy. Also, the end-users can be viewed as consumers in the economy. By leveraging the concept of Walrasian general equilibrium, the proposed model tunes the price of the services in such a way that the total demand equals the total supply. The bandwidth allocation by the proposed mechanism results in Pareto optimality of the system in the sense that the total welfare is maximized.","[Rezvani, Mohammad Hossein; Analoui, Morteza] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Rezvani, MH (通讯作者)，Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran.",rezvani@iust.ac.ir; analoui@iust.ac.ir,"Rezvani, Mohammad Hossein/J-6889-2019; analoui, morteza/T-1093-2018","Rezvani, Mohammad Hossein/0000-0002-0292-7008; analoui, morteza/0000-0001-6792-760X",,,,,20,2,2,0,4,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

However, in doing so, they have paid very little attention to the behavior of men. This paper addresses that oversight. Using data from the 1970 British Cohort Study-a study conducted at a time when gendered specialization was the normative household arrangement for families with small children and when economic theories of marriage and divorce were first being developed-this study considers whether and how fathers' contributions to unpaid work are associated with divorce. Information on fathers' involvement in domestic work and childcare permits a deeper exploration of the relationship between mother's employment and divorce. Contrary to what gains from specialization and trade predict, the findings suggest that fathers' home production stabilizes marriage regardless of mothers' employment statuses.","[Sigle-Rushton, Wendy] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sigle-Rushton, W (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,"Sigle, Wendy/0000-0002-8450-960X",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-225-25-2001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,42,45,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In heterosexual-couple households, gender inequalities in the distribution of paid work and care, working hours, and responsibility for children's schedules mean that mothers experience pressure on time and their ability to work, care, and manage households. Via qualitative interviews conducted in 2005-6, this contribution explores the time strategies of a sample of low-waged mothers in England whose choices around unpaid and paid work are most constrained as a result of the UK's limited policies. The authors discuss alternative policy scenarios, finding that respondents supported policies that challenge gender inequalities in work time, enhancing their time in paid employment and their partners' time for unpaid work. Higher-quality part-time work, shorter full-time hours, and parental leave for fathers would begin to address time inequalities in the UK and elsewhere.","[Warren, Tracey; Pascall, Gillian; Fox, Elizabeth] Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Warren, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",tracey.warren@nottingham.ac.uk; gillian.pascall@nottingham.ac.uk; elizabeth.fox@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Warren, Tracey/0000-0002-1485-4969",,,,,68,24,29,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The SPS Agreement also provides a forum - the SPS Committee - for debate over the health and safety concerns among Member States. This article reviews how the work of the SPS Committee fits into the recent WTO accountability debate. It examines how the SPS Committee provides for an accountability mechanism between Member States, thereby facilitating participation and promoting transparency. Furthermore, it focuses on the role of international standards, established by international standard-setting organizations, and addresses debates over the legitimacy of international standard-setting processes. Tins article also examines how 'international regime complexity' (or 'regime interactions') between the WTO and international standard-setting organizations relates to the questions of legitimacy and accountability.

It also analyzes the role of a number of important policy-related factors, such as infrastructure investment, macroeconomic instability, and imports, on total factor productivity (TFP) by performing cointegration and impulse response analyses. The results suggest that both TFP and capital accumulation were crucial sources of growth during the sample period. Nevertheless, TFP growth displayed enormous variation from 1960 to 2004. The descriptive and empirical evidence suggests that TFP is positively affected by imports and public infrastructure investment and negatively affected by macroeconomic instability.","[Ismihan, Mustafa] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Metin-Ozcan, Kivilcim] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Ismihan, M (通讯作者)，Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",ismihan@atilim.edu.tr; kivilcim@bilkent.edu.tr,,"METIN OZCAN, KIVILCIM/0000-0002-9310-3492",,,,,17,17,19,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Although it concluded an unprecedented number of free trade agreements, their labour clauses are largely devoid of meaningful enforcement mechanisms - suggesting a closer connection with general foreign policy objectives than with concern for workers' rights. Furthermore, the work of the Federal Advisory Committee on Labor Diplomacy was eventually suspended.","[Candland, Christopher] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Candland, C (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Quantitative matrices that were borrowed from landscape ecology were first used to measure the variety and spatial arrangement of open space plots and landuses around houses. Amenity values of those measures were then evaluated in a hedonic regression that was corrected for identification problem caused by the endogeneity of landuse variables. Empirical estimates from this research reveal that urban residents positively valued the varieties of open space but negatively valued the diversity within developed land uses in their neighborhoods. Similarly, open space plots with square shape and smooth, straight edges were preferred to those with more complex shapes and irregular edges. Further, residents preferred open spaces in few larger plots to many smaller pieces that are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Findings from this study will be useful in enhancing the quality and amenity value of open spaces and conceivably increase local property tax base. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

First, do California community colleges differ in their missions? Second, if they do, can inter-college differences in missions be explained? We address the first question by developing college-specific measures of curriculum mix, which we use to characterize colleges as to their curriculum emphases and specializations. We find that colleges differ in the extent to which they offer a transfer specialization or a nontransferable voc-ed specialization. Turning to the second question, we attempt to explain inter-college differences in curriculum emphasis and specialization with institutional variables including student demographics, labor market characteristics, and community characteristics. While not strong, we view our results as suggesting that curriculum emphases and specializations are related to student demographics and community needs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Technological developments in electronics and sensors in precision farming create the possibilities for a more precise production system that takes into account the natural variability of biological production and its environmental influences. The aim of this study was to test different active and passive sensor technologies to monitor nitrogen (N) status in broccoli leaves and to derive suitable N fertilization strategies based on sensor measurements. A field study was conducted with two different common broccoli cultivars 'Parthenon' and 'Marathon' and six different N fertilization treatments consisting of 0, 76, 152, 200, 248, and 304 kg N ha(-1). Space timing of N application was set to the start of cultivation at setting and after a four-week growing period. Sensor measurements started three weeks after setting and were carried out once a week until final harvest of broccoli heads. Sensor technologies used included the passive sensors SPAD-Meter (Minolta), N-Tester (Yara), digital imager (Leica) and one active sensor. The investigation of the spectra from 380 to 1300 nm indicated that wavelength bands around 500-600 nm seem to be well suited for the identification of N status in broccoli plants. Further, the results indicated that sensor technologies make it possible to monitor and control the N demand in broccoli plants and to adapt N fertilizer requirements during the growing season. By detailing this data to small areas within a field, through the application of spatial data, the data can be transformed into powerful management tools. This will enable growers to target their production and fertilizer input to soil variability, to market and quality related issues, and to deliver broccoli with optimal quality attributes.","[Graeff, S.; Claupein, W.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Prod & Grassland Res 340, Stuttgart, Germany; [Pfenning, J.; Liebig, H. -P.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Special Crop Cultivat & Crop Physiol 370, Stuttgart, Turkey",University Hohenheim,"Graeff, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Prod & Grassland Res 340, Stuttgart, Germany.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-370-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,824.0,,,,,,133,139,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAV48,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305621100014,0

To help growers evaluate the economics of organic production, a calculation project was initiated by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. Cost price calculations were made for four types of farms: 1) A small organic farm growing various vegetables on a total of 1 ha; 2) a slightly more mechanised and specialised organic farm with vegetables on 3 ha; 3) a highly specialised organic or conventional farm growing two vegetable crops on 40 ha; and 4) an organic or conventional agricultural farm growing vegetables on contract to the food industry. These calculations were primarily aimed as starting points for growers to use when calculating the outcomes of their own crops, but also provide a picture of the current production costs of vegetables. For the large, mechanised, type 3 farms, the production costs of organic vegetables are between 45% (carrot) and 85% (cabbage) higher than for conventionally produced due to higher yield and lower labour requirement in conventional production. The production costs for the small, diversified, type 1 grower are between 46% (cabbage) and 113% (onion) higher than for the large, type 3 grower. Much more manual labour is used on the small farm due to less mechanisation. For large-scale organic production to be viable, the cost price must be 50-100% higher than for conventional products. The small producers cannot compete on this market and they usually sell their products directly to consumers in their own farm shops or on the local markets.","[Hakansson, B.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Ascard, J.] Jordbruksverket, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Soderlind, M.] LRF GRO, SE-24321 Hoor, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Håkansson, B (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,47,54,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700005,0

The experimental field had 146 pear trees, var. 'Pera d'agua', distributed on a 1.24 ha area. Four harvesting methods were used based on the fruit maturity, and only the ripe fruits were harvested each time. In each harvest, the weight of all mature fruits per plant was computed and these data were then added to obtain the total yield. The analyzed soil attributes included: P, K, Ca, Mg, Al3+, pHCaCl(2), C, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and base saturation, and the plant attributes were: fruit length and diameter. Yield had low correlation with soil attributes. Levels of spatial dependence were found to be low for fruit length, moderate for P, K, Ca, Mg, pHCaCl(2), Cu, Zn, Fe, base saturation and diameter, and high for C, Mn, and yield.","[Konopatzki, M. R.

The quarantine's removal made Japanese bulb growers face international competition in the markets. Since then the imports of bulbs, mainly from Holland, increased rapidly and bulb prices tended to decline gradually, while the Japanese production of bulbs did not decrease. The imports also introduced new varieties of bulbs to Japan. The demand for tulip bulbs increased greatly until the late 1990s; but in the 2000s, the Japanese bulb markets stagnated. Bulb prices decreased, and the domestic production of bulbs decreased sharply, which caused a great reduction in the number of bulb farmers. Consequently, the rate of self-sufficiency for producing tulip bulbs in Japan decreased from 80% in 1988 to 20% in 2006, even though the volume of imported bulbs decreased in the 2000s. This paper analyzes the demand and supply conditions of tulip bulbs, and reports estimates of the Japanese demand and supply functions for tulip bulbs by regression analysis. Demand depends upon the real price (in terms of consumption goods) of tulip bulbs negatively and the real national income positively, and shows that the demand curve shifted forward until 2001, and then shifted backwards. Domestic supply depends upon the prices of tulip bulbs and the rice prices positively.","Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Toyama 9308555, Japan",University of Toyama,"Niisato, Y (通讯作者)，Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama 9308555, Japan.",,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-429-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2009,831.0,,,,,,285,292,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAW33,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000305708700033,0

In accordance with several authors, fruit qualities (taste, size and colour) seemed to be the major attributes influencing the choice of apple independently of people's age and gender. However, the size of fruit had lower importance with increased age. Generally, females gave higher importance ratings for most attributes than males. The price was getting more important for consumer's choice with age which can be connected with their socio-economic situation.

To improve the position location accuracy, a new system was developed during the second year of this study. In this system, the embedded controller which was slow to perform all the necessary computations in real-time was replaced with a higher speed controller. Moreover, a pulse width control module (PWM) and solenoid actuated nozzles were also included to provide precise application rate on demand.

This gearing of Russia towards Asia will have great consequences on world energy, the global economy, and geopolitics in the coming years. This paper analyzes the growth potential of Russia's diversification strategy and the impact this policy would have on sales to Europe. As the most likely scenario is for total gas exports to grow at a moderate rate from 2010 to 2030, any increase in sales to Asia could make difficult the raising of exports to Europe. Our thesis is that this trade-off will depend primarily on domestic consumption trends, geographic targeting of investments, and commercial and financial alliances with foreign partners.

In this paper, two inter-related policies designed to raise the quality of pharmacy services in Ireland are considered. The first was to restrict the opening of new pharmacies, the second to increase the quality of pharmacy services through contract specification. While the first policy restricted entry and raised returns to existing pharmacies, there is no evidence it raised service quality. Equally, the second policy appears to have had little effect on the quality of pharmacy services. The contractual provision itself is largely unenforceable, does not recognize the conflicting motivations of a pharmacist and results in no measurable output. Drawing on this experience, several lessons as presented as to how service quality can be improved, which are likely to have application beyond Ireland.","Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",paul.gorecki@esri.ie,,,,,,,28,7,9,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It considers how a more pluralistic and decent red understanding of regulation may improve compliance. This understanding is then applied to examine the various ways in which the federal labour inspectorate - the Fair Work Ombudsman - has sought to supplement and strengthen its existing compliance and enforcement mechanisms by harnessing or 'enrolling' non-state stakeholders, such as employer associations, trade unions, top-level firms and key individuals.(1)","Melbourne Law Sch, Ctr Employment & Labour Relat Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Hardy, T (通讯作者)，Melbourne Law Sch, Ctr Employment & Labour Relat Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",hardyt@unimelb.edu.au,,"Hardy, Tess/0000-0003-3499-1706",,,,,79,19,19,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The 2009 Harmer Pension Review directed attention to the adequacy of the pension, an issue that has not been systematically examined in Australia for several decades. This article reviews alternative definitions of adequacy and shows that its basic features have been consistently recognised in official reports conducted over a long period. The deprivation approach is then described and shown to produce estimates that have a direct bearing on this conception of income adequacy. Using the results from two recent surveys, conducted in 2006 and 2010, the article compares levels of deprivation among groups defined on the basis of their principal source of income, including those dependent on an Age Pension and several other forms of social security payment. The results indicate that the adequacy of the Age Pension in 2006 was above that of payments awarded on the basis of disability, unemployment or sole parenthood, and also that the pension increase awarded following the Pension Review reduced deprivation among those who received it. However, the increase was not well targeted to those groups who required further assistance, as indicated by the levels of deprivation they were facing. Further application of the deprivation approach would provide new insights into the nature and extent of existing income inadequacies.(1)","[Saunders, Peter; Wong, Melissa] Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Saunders, P (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",p.saunders@unsw.edu.au; melissa.wong@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,35,16,17,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The current study explores whether this relationship is attributable to unmeasured individual heterogeneity in the form of personality by using non-migraine headache as a placebo. In addition, it explores the degree to which the negative relationship between migraine headache and educational attainment can be explained by reverse causality using mother's migraine status as an instrument.

We usually observe pay-for-performance programs, but alternatives, such as pay-for-participation in improvement activities and pay-for-compliance with clinical guidelines, have also been implemented. Here, we assess the influence of different programs that ensure extra payments to GPs for containing avoidable hospitalisations. Our dataset covers patients and GPs of the Italian region Emilia-Romagna for the year 2005. By separating pay-for-performance from pay-for-participation and pay-for-compliance programs, we estimate the impact of different financial incentives on the probability of avoidable hospitalisations. As dependent variable, we consider two different sets of conditions for which timely and effective primary care should be able to limit the need for hospital admission. The first is based on 27 medical diagnostic related groups that Emilia-Romagna identifies as at risk of inappropriateness in primary care, while the second refers to the internationally recognised ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. We show that pay-for-performance schemes may have a significant effect over aggregate indicators of appropriateness, while the effectiveness of pay-for-participation schemes is adequately captured only by taking into account subpopulations affected by specific diseases. Moreover, the same scheme produces different effects on the two sets of indicators used, with performance improvements limited to the target explicitly addressed by the Italian policy maker. This evidence is consistent with the idea that a tunnel vision effect may occur when public authorities monitor specific sets of objectives as proxies for more general improvements in the quality of health care delivered.","[Bruni, Matteo Lippi; Ugolini, Cristina] Univ Turin, Ctr Household Income Labour & Demog Econ CHILD, Turin, Italy; [Fiorentini, Gianluca; Bruni, Matteo Lippi; Ugolini, Cristina] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Iezzi, Elisa] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Turin; University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Bruni, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Ctr Household Income Labour & Demog Econ CHILD, Turin, Italy.",matteo.lippibruni2@unibo.it,"Lippi Bruni, Matteo/AAI-2496-2019; Iezzi, Elisa/AAI-6253-2020; Iezzi, Elisa EI/D-3615-2011","Iezzi, Elisa/0000-0002-6288-2999; Lippi Bruni, Matteo/0000-0002-1575-0352; Fiorentini, Gianluca/0000-0003-4197-9924; UGOLINI, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8453-674X",,,,,28,32,33,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The OBA's changes to the ESA arc an attempt to manage a crisis of employment standards (ES) enforcement, arising from decades of ineffective regulation, by entrenching an individualised enforcement model. The Act aims to streamline enforcement by screening people assumed to be lacking definitive proof of violations out of the complaints process. The OBA therefore produces a new category of 'illegitimate claimants' and attributes administrative backlogs to these people. Instead of improving the protection of workers, the OBA embeds new racialised and gendered modes of exclusion in the ES enforcement process.","[Grundy, John] York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [Mirchandani, Kiran; Perry, J.

The need for effective and ongoing community engagement (CE) has been highlighted by this ongoing contention and the ensuing desire for plantation management companies to maintain a social licence to operate. CE activities are required under various regulations governing forest management practices within Australia. In recent years, voluntary governance mechanisms, particularly forest certification, have further promoted stakeholder engagement as an integral component of modern forest management. This paper reviews the influence of the introduction of forest certification on CE practice in the field. The effectiveness of operationally-based CE activities conducted within Australian plantation management was examined through a qualitative study of plantation managers and community members in conjunction with a document analysis of relevant regulations, codes of forest practices and forest certification standards. Whilst arguing that forest certification is positively impacting on CE practice, the research indicates that a number of regulatory, corporate and social influences impact on the capacity of forest certification to promote positive changes in CE practice. The impact of forest certification is limited by existing CE requirements within both mandatory and voluntary regulations; the narrow commercially-oriented foci promoted by corporate realities and organisational ethos; poor practitioner skills and understanding of fundamental CE concepts; and the presence of pre-existing negative perceptions of firms or individuals. Regardless of these limiting influences, our research has shown that forest certification is positively affecting engagement practices within operational plantation management. Such improvements are infrequently acknowledged as they are typically not obvious in terms of changes in CE techniques or improved social relations. Instead, we suggest that forest certification is promoting a longer term, cumulative change in CE practice. The capacities of plantation managers and communities to effectively engage with each other are improving due to the forest certification requirement for continual improvement that results in plantation managers continually reflecting on engagement outcomes and adapting practices based on prior learnings.

This has profound potential implications for forestry, since operations such as harvesting and fertilization tend to reduce the quality of ground and stream water in affected catchments. The aim of this study is to assess the implications for forestry of limiting the concentrations of chemical substances reaching lakes and streams. A forest planning model with a horizon of 100 years that includes requirements regarding water concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), methyl mercury (MeHg) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was applied to three intensively-studied sub-catchments at Balan in the boreal part of northern Sweden. Limiting maximum increases in concentrations of these substances to 10% above reference values resulted in an economic loss of ca. 20% or 35%, depending on whether the limits were applied to the whole area or to each sub-catchment individually. The results were also highly dependent on the assumptions, especially regarding the flux of MeHg. The results should be interpreted with caution as there are still major uncertainties concerning the cause and effect relationships. We also need to consider additional aspects to those addressed here, such as acidification, erosion and the biological effects of the operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The article builds on studies that estimate the economic returns to international immigrants of being fluent in the major language of the destination country and studies that estimate the economic returns to proficiency in the national language among groups of people who speak a minority language. Importantly we control for potential endogeneity bias in the estimates of the effect of language fluency on earnings. We find that for migrants as a whole, there are considerable economic return to speaking standard Mandarin. We also find gender differences. While the coefficient or fluency in standard Mandarin is statistically significant and large for females, the coefficient on fluency is statistically insignificant for males. One possible explanation for this finding in that female migrant workers are engaged more in occupations which have greater contact with urban locals and hence the return to investment in language skills is higher.

This paper examines the situation of Ecuadorian women selling cosmetics through a multilevel direct sales organization in which earnings are dependent on the amount of product sold and the number of sellers recruited. This relatively new type of gendered, paid employment promises to help women achieve balance between paid work and family responsibilities. Using ethnographic methods to explore direct-selling mothers' identities, strategies, and struggles, this study finds that such a balance remains elusive for these women sellers, despite the purported flexibility of direct sales work. It discusses the finding that women think about their paid work and family roles as connected and examines the myth prevalent among direct sellers that successfully balancing paid work and family comes from oorganizing yourself.o.","Univ Cincinnati, Womens Gender & Sexual Studies Dept, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"de Casanova, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Cincinnati, Womens Gender & Sexual Studies Dept, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",,,,,,,,66,8,9,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Contrary, our paper tries, by making an analogy with the human body, to define a more complex situation that can occur at firm's level, namely: a syndrome, and to establish some of its characteristics. Through bankruptcy's syndrome we will define a state of complex associate symptoms, which, unsupervised, can evaluate and lead to firm's bankruptcy. Further, based on an empirical analysis conducted on 76 firms, several types of syndromes are identified and characterized, along with their influence on firm's actual and future state.","[Delcea, Camelia; Simion, Cecilia] Bucharest Univ Econ, Econ Cybernet Dept, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Delcea, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ, Econ Cybernet Dept, Bucharest, Romania.",camelia.delcea@yahoo.com; ceci_ms@yahoo.com,"Delcea, Camelia/C-4343-2011","Delcea, Camelia/0000-0003-3589-1969",Romanian Education and Research Ministry - CNCSIS - UEFISCDI [CNCSIS IDEI 810/2008]; European Social Fund through the Sectorial Operational Program for Human Resources Development,Romanian Education and Research Ministry - CNCSIS - UEFISCDI; European Social Fund through the Sectorial Operational Program for Human Resources Development,"This paperwork is one of the results of the research activity funded by the Romanian Education and Research Ministry - CNCSIS - UEFISCDI through the grant CNCSIS IDEI 810/2008 The Development of Theoretical Fundaments of Knowledge Ecosystems and Their Applications on Economy and Healthcare.; This article is one of the results of the research activity carried out under the frame of the project Doctoral program and PhD students in the education research and innovation triangle.

Not surprisingly, the question was soon raised whether citations are a good measure of scholarly merit. Are women at a disadvantage in male-dominated fields, such as economics? Studies had shown that authors tended to cite a larger proportion of publications by authors of the same gender. This paper examines whether women's disadvantage in garnering citations has been reduced by the increasing representation of women in economics and finds that this has been the case in both labor economics and economics in general, albeit not to the same degree.","[Ferber, Marianne A.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ferber, Marianne A.] Midwest Econ Assoc, St Louis, MO USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ferber, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,,14,57,59,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The author briefly reviews six related advances that profoundly extend and deepen economic analysis: game-theoretic modeling, collective-action problems, information economics and contracting, social preference theory, conceptualizing rationality, and institutional theory. He offers suggestions for incorporating these into the undergraduate classes at various levels. He argues that game-theoretic representation of collective-action problems offers a unifying framework, on par with supply and demand, for political economy. Blending in the other developments deepens our micro-level understanding of internal and external contract enforcement, with implications on nonclearing markets, power, and distribution. At the macro level, these concepts illuminate the role of institutions in economic development and long-term growth. Undergraduate curricula should incorporate these new approaches.","Grinnell Coll, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA",,"Ferguson, WD (通讯作者)，Grinnell Coll, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",ferguso1@grinnell.edu,,"Ferguson, William Duncan/0000-0001-8115-6207",,,,,83,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The study describes the evolution of CES, drawing attention to an increasing reliance on econometric modeling that reflects a shift in focus away from systems. An inventory of research on women and gender that has appeared in CES journals and textbooks finds little on topics other than formal labor markets in transition economies. The study contrasts this literature on women and gender in transition economies to research on this topic by women from transition economies, a literature that CES journal authors do not reference. It concludes by proposing a feminist economics approach that focuses on gender-differentiated impacts of economic systems, analyses of households, and equity as a measure of progress.","[Hopkins, Barbara E.] Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Duggan, Lynn S.] Indiana Univ, Labor Studies Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Hopkins, BE (通讯作者)，Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, 3640 Col Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",barbara.hopkins@wright.edu; lduggan@indiana.edu,,,,,,,105,6,7,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The method which can be considered an advanced development of the well known direct search method of Rosenbrock [28] uses an advanced inexact line search sequence to improve convergence speed and numerical accuracy. Scaled trial steps in every dimension of the search space are considered and every iteration the search directions are changed using Palmer's [24] improved orthogonalization procedure. In the numerical evaluation section the algorithm's performance is compared with other search approaches recently evaluated in Hvattum and Glover [15]. The numerical results show that the algorithm is very competitive in terms of convergence speed. The overall balance between convergence speed, reliability and small arithmetic complexity makes the present routine one of the methods of first choice for employment as local search procedure inside hybrid metaheuristic algorithms.","Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Padureanu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",andrei.i.padureanu@gmail.com,,,Doctoral Programme in Economics at European Knowledge Standards (DOESEC) [POSDRU/88/1.5./S/55287]; Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies; West University of Timisoara,Doctoral Programme in Economics at European Knowledge Standards (DOESEC); Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies; West University of Timisoara,"This article is a result of the project POSDRU/88/1.5./S/55287 Doctoral Programme in Economics at European Knowledge Standards (DOESEC).

Our estimates for the southeastern countries support the hypothesis of an increase in stock exchange indices in the period of transition, due to the opening of the market economy followed by large capital inflows. The observed countries that are already in the EU wing (Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia) or those in the process of joining (Croatia and Montenegro) were found to be more dependent on the global financial markets and more exposed to adverse co-movements than other transitional southeastern countries (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia).","[Pesa, Anita Radman] Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Zadar, Croatia; [Festic, Mejra] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Zadar,"Pesa, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Zadar, Croatia.",anita.pesa@unizd.hr; mejra.festic@bsi.si,"Peša, Anita Radman/G-2626-2013","Peša, Anita Radman/0000-0003-3767-0676",,,,,26,1,1,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.
