Adjustment cost could be explained in a certain degree that why countries tend to adopt constrained market liberalization policy, and trade protection in certain industries is necessary. Meanwhile, it provides a new angle in trade negotiation, that it will be easier to arrive at partial and gradual agreement if every partner deduces trade barrier in industries with least adjustment cost. This paper focuses on typical land-intensive products, including wheat, rice, soybean and plant oil and typical labor-intensive products, such as meat products, aquatic products, vegetable and fruits, utilizing trade data from 2001 to 2008 after China's accession into the WTO. This paper also estimates and makes comparative analysis of adjustment cost and adjustment pressure caused by China's various agricultural products labor-intensive products, serving as a reference for future market liberalization and protection policy development.","[Zhang Shu; Zhu Jing; Cao Li-juan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,,,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,771,778,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100106,0

As in the standard linear cointegrating regression model, the regressor and the dependent variable are jointly dependent and contemporaneously correlated. In nonparametric estimation problems, joint dependence is known to be a major complication that affects identification, induces bias in conventional kernel estimates, and frequently leads to ill-posed inverse problems. In functional cointegrating regressions where the regressor is an integrated or near-integrated time series, it is shown here that inverse and ill-posed inverse problems do not arise. Instead, simple nonparametric kernel estimation of a structural nonparametric cointegrating regression is consistent and the limit distribution theory is mixed normal, giving straightforward asymptotics that are useable in practical work. It is further shown that use of augmented regression, as is common in linear cointegration modeling to address endogeneity, does not lead to bias reduction in nonparametric regression, but there is an asymptotic gain in variance reduction. The results provide a convenient basis for inference in structural nonparametric regression with nonstationary time series when there is a single integrated or near-integrated regressor. The methods may be applied to a range of empirical models where functional estimation of cointegrating relations is required.","[Wang, Qiying] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Phillips, Peter C.

The method uses contamination families based on Legendre polynomials. It has been shown that in general after a few steps accurate approximations are obtained. In this paper selection of the adequate number of steps is considered, and estimation of the unknown parameters within the chosen contamination family is established, thus obtaining an estimator of the unknown copula density. There should be a balance between the complexity of the model and the number of parameters to be estimated. High complexity gives a low model error, but a large stochastic or estimation error, while a very simple model gives a small stochastic error, but a large model error. Techniques from model selection are applied, thus letting the data tell us which aspects are important enough to capture into the model. Natural and simple estimators of the involved Fourier coefficients complete the procedure. Theoretical results show that the expected quadratic error is reduced by the selection rule to the same order of magnitude as in a classical parametric problem. The method is applied on a real data set, illustrating that the new method describes the data set very well: the error involved in the classical Gaussian copula density is reduced with no fewer than 50%.

This is used to obtain the critical value function needed to implement the CLR test, and reasonably comprehensive graphical versions of this function are provided for practical use. The analogous functions are also obtained for the case of testing more than one right-side endogenous coefficient, but in this case for a similar test motivated by, but not generally the same as, the likelihood ratio test. Next, the exact power functions of the CLR test, the Anderson-Rubin test, and the Lagrange multiplier test suggested by Kleibergen (2002) are derived and studied. The CLR test is shown to clearly conditionally dominate the other two tests for virtually all parameter configurations, but no test considered is either inadmissable or uniformly superior to the other two. The unconditional distribution function of the likelihood ratio test statistic is also derived using the same argument. This shows that both exactly, and under Staiger/Stock weak-instrument asymptotics, the test based on the usual asymptotic critical value is always oversized and can be very seriously so when the number of instruments is large.","[Hillier, Grant] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Hillier, G (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",ghh@soton.ac.uk,,"Hillier, Grant/0000-0003-3261-5766",,,,,27,5,5,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

They reduce both cardiovascular risks and RA disease activity. Objective: To evaluate the potential long-term effects of statin therapy among patients with RA, and to determine their associated cost effectiveness by incorporating both the cardiovascular and the anti-rheumatic benefits. Methods: A Markov decision-analytic model was developed to simulate cardiovascular and RA disease profiles over time. The impact of statin therapy was estimated by adjusting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and changes in the RA Disease Activity Score (DAS28), based on the results of a randomized trial. The benefits (QALYs) and costs (in year 2005 values) were evaluated from a US payer perspective. A full uncertainty analysis, including a value-of-information (VOI) analysis, was undertaken to evaluate the importance of individual parameters. Results: Using a 10-year time horizon, the additional cost and QALYs of statin therapy were estimated to be $US4690 and 0.44 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US 10 650 per QALY (95% CI 1525, 156 565). The QALY gain associated with statin therapy depended more on the anti-rheumatic effects of statin therapy than on its cardiovascular prevention effect. The VOI analysis found the long-term benefit of statin therapy (i.e. >= 12 months) and the consequent impact on quality of life to be the most uncertain and, therefore, influential parameters. Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that the dual anti-inflammatory/cardiovascular benefits of statins could make this therapy highly cost effective in RA. However, uncertainties remain in the available data, warranting further research on refining the precise RA disease-activity benefits and health-utility changes associated with statin therapy, at least over a 12-month period.","[Choi, Hyon K.] Univ British Columbia, Arthrit Res Ctr Canada, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol,Vancouver Gen Hosp, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L7, Canada; [Bansback, Nick; Anis, Aslam] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Bansback, Nick; Ara, Roberta; Ward, Sue] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Anis, Aslam; Choi, Hyon K.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Healthcare & Epidemiol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L7, Canada",University of British Columbia; St. Paul's Hospital; University of Sheffield; University of British Columbia,"Choi, HK (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Arthrit Res Ctr Canada, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, 895 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L7, Canada.",hchoi@partners.org,,"Ward, Sue/0000-0002-3344-0913; Bansback, Nick/0000-0002-1510-3462",,,,,46,23,25,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,1,,,,,25,37,,10.2165/00019053-200927010-00004,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,420EZ,19178122.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000264273000004,0

Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic profile of HDT with PBSCT support relative to standard CHOP therapy as first-line treatment in adults with aggressive NHL. Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the French Public Health Insurance perspective, restricted to hospital costs (C, year 2008 values). The clinical effectiveness criterion was censured overall survival (OS) difference after a median follow-up of 4 years for the entire cohort. A total of 197 patients were included (CHOP, n = 99; HDT, n = 98). Uncertainty was assessed using non-parametric bootstrap simulations and various scenario analyses. Results: Five-year OS did not differ significantly between groups for the entire cohort. Nevertheless, subgroup analyses appeared to be more relevant for decision making: among patients with a high-intermediate risk according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI), HDT yielded a significantly higher 5-year OS than CHOP (74% vs 44%; p=0.001). Among these patients, the mean censured OS survival, adjusted for time discounting and quality of life (QOL), increased with HDT by 1.20 years (95% CI 1.19, 1.21). The cost per life-year saved with HDT was estimated as (sic)34 315 (95% CI 32 683, 35 947) in this subgroup. Conclusion: Results suggested that HDT with PBSCT support might be considered a cost-effective strategy among patients with high-intermediate-risk NHL according to the age-adjusted IPI. Its place and its cost effectiveness potential versus, or in combination with, rituximab still need further research.","[Fagnoni, Philippe; Limat, Samuel; Nerich, Virginie; Woronoff-Lemsi, Marie-Christine] Univ Hosp Besancon, Dept Pharm, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Fagnoni, Philippe; Limat, Samuel] Univ Bourgogne, INSERM, EPI 106, Dijon, France; [Milpied, Noel] Univ Hosp Bordeaux, Dept Haematol, Pessac, France; [Deconinck, Eric; Nerich, Virginie; Woronoff-Lemsi, Marie-Christine] Univ Franche Comte, INSERM, U645, EA 2284,IFR 133, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Deconinck, Eric] Univ Hosp Besancon, Dept Haematol, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Foussard, Charles] Univ Hosp Angers, Dept Haematol, Angers, France; [Colombat, Philippe] Univ Hosp Tours, Dept Haematol, Tours, France; [Harousseau, Jean-Luc] Univ Hosp Nantes, Dept Haematol, Nantes, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; CHU Besancon; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Bourgogne; CHU Bordeaux; Universite de Franche-Comte; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Franche-Comte; CHU Besancon; Universite d'Angers; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers; CHU Tours; Nantes Universite; CHU de Nantes,"Woronoff-Lemsi, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Besancon, Dept Pharm, Blvd Fleming, F-25030 Besancon, France.",marie-christine.woronoff-lemsi@univ-fcomte.fr,"LIMAT, Samuel/AAC-4762-2022; DECONINCK, ERIC/AAF-3647-2021","DECONINCK, ERIC/0000-0002-6006-8088; Milpied, Noel/0000-0002-5177-014X; NERICH, Virginie/0000-0002-0351-6040",,,,,35,10,10,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,1,,,,,55,68,,10.2165/00019053-200927010-00006,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,420EZ,19178124.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000264273000006,0

Objectives: To evaluate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different antiviral treatment strategies including the German guidelines, for chronic hepatitis C. Methods: A validated lifetime Markov model was used to project life expectancy, QALYs and lifetime costs for the following strategies: (i) no antiviral therapy (NoAVT); (ii) interferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (IFN + R); (iii) peginterferon-alpha-2b plus weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks (PEG + R); (iv) peginterferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin according to German guidelines with genotype-dependent treatment duration, dosage and 12-week viral response evaluation (GUIDE). Clinical and resource utilization data were derived from a clinical trial, the published literature and a survey of German hepatologists. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated adopting the German societal perspective. Costs (in E, year 2005 values) and health outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with NoAVT, PEG + R increased undiscounted life expectancy by 5.0 life-years (5.2 QALYs) and GUIDE increased undiscounted life expectancy by 4.9 years (5.1 QALYs). Compared with PEG + R, GUIDE saved 13% of hepatitis C virus-related lifetime costs per patient. GUIDE dominated IFN + R. Compared with NoAVT, discounted ICERs were epsilon 1500 per QALY for GUIDE and epsilon 3200 per QALY for PEG + R. Conclusion: Administering GUIDE should allow tailoring treatment efficiently to genotype, bodyweight and early viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C, and appears cost effective compared with other well accepted medical interventions.","[Siebert, Uwe] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth Med Decis Making & Hlth Technol As, Eduard Wallnoefer Ctr 1, A-6060 Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe; Sroczynski, Gaby] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Inst Technol Assessment, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe; Sroczynski, Gaby] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Program Hlth Decis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Aidelsburger, Pamela; Wasem, Juergen] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hlth Serv Management, Essen, Germany; [Rossol, Siegbert] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Krankenhaus Nordwest, Med Clin 1, Frankfurt, Germany; [Manns, Michael P.] Med Sch Hanover, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Hannover, Germany; [McHutchison, John G.] Scripps Clin, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Clin Decis Making,Tufts New England Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02111 USA","UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Such variables, also known as 'constructed variables' or 'generated predictors', occur quite frequently in econometric and applied economic analysis. The impact of using predicted rather than observed values on the properties of estimators has been extensively studied in the fully parametric context. The results derived here are applicable to the general situation in which the predictor is estimated using a consistent non-parametric method with standard convergence rates. Therefore, the presented results are, generally speaking, the asymptotics for semi-non-parametric two-step (or plug-in) estimation problems.

In the existing SEMs, the unknown coefficients in the measurement and structural equations are assumed to be constant with respect to time. This assumption does not always hold, as the relation among the observed and latent variables varies with time for some situations. In this paper, we propose nonlinear dynamical structural equation models to cope with these situations, and explore the nonlinear dynamic of the relation between the variables involved. A local maximum likelihood-based estimation procedure is proposed. We investigate a bootstrap resampling-based test for the hypothesis that the coefficient is constant with respect to time, as well as confidence bands for the unknown coefficients. Intensive simulation studies are conducted to show the empirical performance of the proposed estimation procedure, hypothesis test statistic and confidence band. Finally, a real example in relation to the stock market of Hong Kong is presented to demonstrate the proposed methodologies.","[Zhang, Wenyang] Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Lee, Sik-Yum] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Bath; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, WY (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Math Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",W.Zhang@bath.ac.uk,,,Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; People's Republic of China [CUHK 4346/01H],Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); People's Republic of China,"This research is partially supported by a grant from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China (Project No. CUHK 4346/01H).; We thank the referees for their comments, which have helped us to improve the paper significantly.",,28,5,6,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Utility maximization becomes well posed again representing payoffs as measures on the sample space, including those allocations singular with respect to the physical probability. The expected utility of such allocations is understood as the maximal utility of its approximations with classical payoffs-the relaxed expected utility. This paper decomposes relaxed expected utility into its classical and singular parts, represents the singular part in integral form, and proves the existence of optimal solutions for the utility maximization problem, without conditions on the asymptotic elasticity. Key to this result is the Polish space structure assumed on the sample space.","[Guasoni, Paolo] Boston Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Biagini, Sara] Univ Pisa, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",Boston University; University of Pisa,"Guasoni, P (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Math & Stat, 111 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",guasoni@bu.edu,"Biagini, Sara/H-4835-2012; Guasoni, Paolo/J-3464-2013","Guasoni, Paolo/0000-0002-8562-3658","National Science Foundation [DMS-0532390, DMS-0807994]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [0807994] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank Alberto Abbondandolo, Luigi Ambrosio, and Giuseppe Buttazzo for stimulating discussions, and the two anonymous referees for their careful reading of the paper.

For the semiparametric model, the latent error is explicitly allowed to be correlated.

A systematic literature search was performed in the databases PubMed, Current Contents, EM BASE, EconLit, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness), NHS EED (Economic Evaluation Database) and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) of the UK NHS Centre for Review and Dissemination (July 2002 to March 2010). Only fully published studies using decision trees, Markov models, individual simulation models or sets of mathematical equations were included. Most of the 11 studies identified used Markov models (n = 9) and two employed were based on decision trees. Based on the Hoehn & Yahr (HY) scale, authors evaluated the cost effectiveness of drug treatments (n = 6), surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation (n = I) or striatal cell grafting (n = 1), and diagnostic procedures such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) testing (n = 3) over a time horizon of 1 year to lifetime. Costs were adapted to address a societal and/or healthcare provider/third-party payer perspective. All but one of the interventions investigated were considered cost effective or cost saving. Cost-effectiveness modelling in PD between 2003 and 2010 showed only minor improvement when compared with our earlier review of models published from 1998 up to 2003. Cost-effectiveness modelling recommendations were complied with to only a limited extent, leaving room for quality improvement. More advanced modelling approaches may, so far, be under-represented, but may be used in the future, driven by the research question. Adverse events of treatment, under-represented or disease complications are not yet sufficiently included in the models to adequately represent clinical reality.","[Dams, Judith; Reese, Jens Peter; Oertel, Wolfgang H.; Dodel, Richard] Univ Marburg, Dept Neurol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Philipps University Marburg; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

In particular, such expansions show how the convexity in volatility, measured by the Black-Scholes volga, and the sensitivity of delta with respect to volatility, measured by the Black-Scholes vanna, impact option prices in the Heston model. The general method for obtaining the expansion rests on the construction of a set of new probability measures, equivalent to the original pricing measure, and which retain the affine structure of the Heston volatility diffusion.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we compare and discuss three retirement decision models: the two-thirds replacement ratio benchmark model, the option-value of continued work model and a newly-developed one-year retirement decision model. Unlike defined benefit (DB) pension plans where economic incentives create spikes in retirement at particular ages, all three retirement decision models suggest that the retirement ages of DC participants are much more smoothly distributed over a wide range of ages. We find that the one-year model possesses several advantages over the other two models when representing the theoretical retirement choice of a DC pension plan participant. First, its underlying theory for retirement decision-making is more feasible given the distinct features and pension drivers of a DC plan. Second, its specifications produce a more logical relationship between an individual's decision to retire and his/her age and accumulated retirement wealth. Lastly, although the one-year model is less complex than the option-value model as the DC participants' scope is only one year, the retirement decision is optimal over all future projected years if projections are made using reasonable financial assumptions.

This review analysed the available clinical and economic data on these three drugs. Irrespective of which of the three agents is considered, the magnitude of the benefit in newly diagnosed cases (transplanted or non-transplanted) tends to be between 10 and 20 months per patient in terms of progression-free survival or survival; the survival benefit is smaller in relapsed or refractory disease. In addition, a single-institution observational analysis evaluated the outcomes in nearly 3000 consecutive patients examined between 1971 and 2006. The survival in patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2006 was longer than that observed in patients diagnosed between 1994 and 2000. This finding supports the conclusion that novel agents provide a survival improvement compared with traditional therapy. Formal cost-effectiveness studies on these three agents are still lacking. A MEDLINE search retrieved only four short papers or letters and no full-length analysis. Hence, the cost effectiveness of these agents needs further investigation, with separate assessments of the different therapeutic settings. In a simplified analysis, we tried to contrast the average cost of treatment for each of the novel agents versus their respective benefit, expressed in quality-adjusted survival. Despite its preliminary nature, our assessment indicates that the cost effectiveness of these three agents is likely to be within commonly accepted pharmacoeconomic thresholds.","[Messori, Andrea; Maratea, Dario] Area Vasta Ctr, Lab Pharmacoecon, Florence, Italy; [Nozzoli, Chiara; Bosi, Alberto] Univ Florence, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Messori, A (通讯作者)，ESTAV Ctr, Via Guimaraes 5-7, I-59100 Prato, Italy.",andreamessori@interfree.it,"Messori, Andrea/U-6903-2019","BOSI, ALBERTO/0000-0002-5486-4838",,,,,90,9,9,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,4,,,,,269,285,,10.2165/11585930-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,746TV,21395348.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289271500001,0

The first tests for structural change in the parametric component, based on the cumulative sums of gradients from a single semiparametric regression. The second tests for structural change in the parametric and nonparametric components simultaneously, based on the cumulative sums of weighted residuals from the same semiparametric regression. We derive the limiting distributions of both tests under the null hypothesis of no structural change and for sequences of local alternatives. We show that the tests are generally not asymptotically pivotal under the null but may be free of nuisance parameters asymptotically under further asymptotic stationarity conditions. Our tests thus complement the conventional instability tests for parametric models. To improve the finite-sample performance of our tests, we also propose a wild bootstrap version of our tests and justify its validity.

A SIMULATION ANALYSIS,ASTIN BULLETIN,,,English,Article,,,,,,Quantile; Extreme Value; Monte Carlo Methods; PML; VAR; Reinsurance,,"When analyzing catastrophic risk, traditional measures for evaluating risk, such as the probable maximum loss (PML), value at risk (VaR), tail-VaR, and others, can become practically impossible to obtain analytically in certain types of insurance, such as earthquake, and certain types of reinsurance arrangements, specially non-proportional with reinstatements. Given the available information, it can be very difficult for an insurer to measure its risk exposure. The transfer of risk in this type of insurance is usually done through reinsurance schemes combining diverse types of contracts that can greatly reduce the extreme tail of the cedant's loss distribution. This effect can be assessed mathematically. The PML is defined in terms of a very extreme quantile. Also, under standard operating conditions, insurers use several layers of non proportional reinsurance that may or may not be combined with some type of proportional reinsurance. The resulting reinsurance structures will then be very complicated to analyze and to evaluate their mitigation or transfer effects analytically, so it may be necessary to use alternative approaches, such as Monte Carlo simulation methods. This is what we do in this paper in order to measure the effect of a complex reinsurance treaty on the risk profile of an insurance company. We compute the pure risk premium, PML as well as a host of results: impact on the insured portfolio, risk transfer effect of reinsurance programs, proportion of times reinsurance is exhausted, percentage of years it was necessary to use the contractual reinstatements, etc. Since the estimators of quantiles are known to be biased, we explore the alternative of using an Extreme Value approach to complement the analysis.","[de Alba, Enrique] ITAM, Div Actuarial Sci Stat & Math, Mexico City 01080, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"de Alba, E (通讯作者)，ITAM, Div Actuarial Sci Stat & Math, Rio Hondo 1, Mexico City 01080, DF, Mexico.",dealba@itam.mx; jzuniga@gnp.com.mx; marco_ramirez_corzo@hotmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,547,568,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061127,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700005,0

While the initial aim of this article was to review the arguments for abandoning the $US50000 threshold, it quickly turned to questioning whether we should maintain a fixed threshold at all. Our consideration of the relevance of thresholds was framed by two important historical considerations. First, cost-effectiveness analysis was developed for a resource allocation exercise where a threshold would be determined endogenously by maximizing a fixed budget across all possible interventions and not for piecemeal evaluation where a threshold needs to be set exogenously. Second, the foundations of the $US50000 threshold are highly dubious, so it would be unacceptable merely to adjust for inflation or current clinical practice. Upon consideration of both sides of the argument, we conclude that the arguments for abandoning the concept for maintaining a fixed threshold outweigh those for keeping one. Furthermore, we document a variety of reasons why a threshold needs to vary in the US, including variations across payer, over time, in the true budget impact of interventions and in the measurement of the effectiveness of interventions. We conclude that while a threshold may be needed to interpret the results of a cost-effectiveness analysis, that threshold must vary across payers, populations and even procedures.","[Bridges, John F.

Our results point to a conflict between the subadditivity and robustness of risk measurement procedures and show that the same risk measure may exhibit quite different sensitivities depending on the estimation procedure used. Our results illustrate, in particular, that using recently proposed risk measures such as CVaR/expected shortfall leads to a less robust risk measurement procedure than historical Value-at-Risk.

There is currently no consensus on the optimal treatment of cartilage lesions. ChondroCelect (R) (CC) is a cell-based therapy approved for use in autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACT) to treat symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle. Its capacity to safely restore good-quality cartilage was demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) versus the surgical procedure microfracture (MFX). Objective: This study investigated the cost utility of CC used in ACI compared with MFX to treat symptomatic knee cartilage lesions in Belgium. Methods: A decision tree model comparing CC with MFX over a 40-year horizon was developed in TreeAge PrO (TM). The key timepoints of the model were (i) clinical assessment 5 years after initial intervention (success or no success, with or without re-operation); (ii) development of OA at 15 years (yes/no); (iii) need for TKR at 20 years (yes/no); and (iv) need for prosthesis revision at 35 years (yes/no). Clinical data provided by the RCT of CC versus MFX were the clinical success (response) rate based on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 36 months (82.9% vs 62.0%; p = 0.048) and the proportion of good structural repair/presence of hyaline cartilage based on International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS II) visual item at 12 months (44.9% vs 23.2%; p = 0.023). Utility scores by surgery outcome were derived from the SF-36 questionnaire responses collected in the RCT. Conservative assumptions related to the incidences of OA, TKR and prosthesis revision relied on a literature search. A patient chart review (n = 82) provided follow-up costs by surgery outcome. National tariffs were applied to direct medical resources used (healthcare payer perspective, year 2008 costs). Annual discounting was applied to costs (3%) and effects (1.5%) as recommended by the Belgian pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Results: The incremental cost per QALY gained for CC compared with MFX was (sic)16 229, with a difference in costs of (sic)20 802 and 1.282 QALYs gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the key model drivers were the proportion of patients with hyaline cartilage and the correlation between hyaline cartilage formation and later avoidance of OA. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed robustness of the results, with 80% of the simulations below the usual UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) threshold of (sic)22 000 per QALY. Conclusions: Assuming a good correlation between high-quality cartilage repair and avoidance of OA at a later stage, the benefits of the cell therapy CC over MFX in terms of QALYs gained and OA-related costs avoided appear real. Further research is required to explore long-term effects of cartilage repair and reduce uncertainty on quality of life of patients with OA before and after joint replacement.","[Gerlier, Laetitia; Lamotte, Mark] IMS Hlth Consulting, Vilvoorde, Belgium; [Wille, Micheline] TiGenix NV, Louvain, Belgium; [Kreuz, Peter C.] Univ Med Ctr Rostock, Rostock, Germany; [Vanlauwe, Johan] Univ Hosp Pellenberg, Louvain, Belgium; [Dubois, Dominique] Patient Value Solut, Huldenberg, Belgium; [Meurgey, Francois M.] Oukelos SPRL, Brussels, Belgium",University of Rostock; KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven,"Gerlier, L (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth Consulting HEOR, Medialaan 38, B-1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium.",Lgerlier@be.imshealth.com,"Vanlauwe, Johan/S-7326-2019","Vanlauwe, Johan/0000-0003-0593-5414; Gerlier, Laetitia/0000-0003-0061-0194",TiGenix NV; Flanders Research Foundation,TiGenix NV; Flanders Research Foundation(FWO),"This study was sponsored by an unrestricted grant from TiGenix NV.; Laetitia Gerlier, Mark Lamotte, Francois Meurgey, Dominique Dubois and Johan Vanlauwe acted as consultants for TiGenix NV, for which they received payment.

A different formulation of the question asks how heavy the tails of the financial returns are. The available empirical evidence can be, and has been, interpreted in more than one way. The apparent paradox, which has puzzled many a researcher, is that the tails appear to become less heavy for less frequent (e.g. monthly) returns than for more frequent (e.g. daily) returns, a phenomenon not easily explainable by the standard models. Inspired by the prelimit theorems of Klebanov, Rachev and Szekely (1999) and Klebanov, Rachev and Safarian (2000), we provide an explanation of this paradox. We show that, for financial returns, a natural family of models are those with tempered heavy tails. These models can generate observations that appear heavy tailed for a wide range of aggregation levels before becoming clearly light tailed at even larger aggregation scales. Important examples demonstrate the existence of a natural scale associated with the model at which such an apparent shift in the tails occurs.","[Samorodnitsky, Gennady] Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Samorodnitsky, Gennady] Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grabchak, Michael] Cornell Univ, Dept Stat, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Samorodnitsky, G (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gs18@cornell.edu,,,NSF at Cornell University [EMSW21-RTG]; ARO at Cornell University [W911NF-07-1-0078],NSF at Cornell University; ARO at Cornell University,Mr Grabchak's research was supported in part by NSF grant EMSW21-RTG at Cornell University.

Objective: To examine the cost and frequency of antiretroviral prescribing errors among a sample of privately insured patients with HIV disease. Methods: Data were obtained from the MarketScan(R) Commercial Claims and Encounter Database created by the Medstat Group Inc The MarketScan(R) database contains claims data for inpatient care, outpatient care, physician services and prescription drugs in benefit plans sponsored by >50 large employers in the US. This Study compared data from the 1999-2000 MarketScan(R) database with those from the 2005 MarketScan(R) database. The 2005 MarketScan(R) database includes 12226 HIV enrollees who received antiretroviral drugs This Study compared the claims experience of HIV patients who filled a prescription for a drug combination that is not recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents with the claims experience of patients who did not receive such a prescription. Results: In the 1999-2000 database the most common inappropriate drug combination involved the co-administration of a protease inhibitor (PI) and the lipid lowering, drug simvastatin, and 1% of patients experienced this type of error. In the 2005 database, only 0 4% of patients (46 of 12 226) experienced an inappropriate combination of simvastatin and a PI while 5 3% of patients (644 of 12226) received atazanavir and tenofovir without ritonavir (referred to herein as 'boosting errors') Patients who experienced a boosting error incurred hi-her annual costs than patients who took ritonavir along with tenofovir and atazanavir ($US20 927 vs $US16 704). Because atazanavir was approved by the US FDA in June 2003, medication errors involving atazanavir were not relevant in 1999 and 2000 Overall, it Was found that HIV patients were three times as likely to experience an inappropriate drug combination in 2005 than they were in either 1999 or 2000 (5 9% vs 1.9%). and that this increase is attributable to boosting errors In addition, the prevalence rate of HIV in the 2005 MarketScan(R) database was almost triple that in the 1999 MarketScan(R) database (0 14% vs 0 05%) Conclusion: This Study indicates that those who provide care to HIV patients must be vigilant in their efforts to provide patients with a drug therapy regimen that minimizes the chance of an adverse reaction and maximizes the potential to control viral replication","[Hellinger, Fred J.; Encinosa, William E.] Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Ctr Delivery Org & Markets, Rockville, MD 20850 USA",Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality,"Hellinger, FJ (通讯作者)，Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Ctr Delivery Org & Markets, 540 Gaither Rd, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",,,,,,,,47,14,16,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,1,,,,,23,34,,10.2165/11313810-000000000-00000,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,559XH,20014874.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274862600003,0

Win I strategy have its Intended consequence or win it have the unintended outcome of reducing the Nile at which the population burden of disease is reduced? The perspective of this review IS a country Such as Australia. Canada or the UK that has universal health insurance and a drug reimbursement process that is Informed by economic evidence. A review of the literature was performed and the views of both the proponents and the opponents Of Such strategies and the mechanisms by which they Could be Implemented Were summarized The debate is based largely on hypothesized responses by firms to changes in incentives rather than empirical evidence The main ponit of contention is whether a changed mix of new molecular entities (NMEs) increases or decreases the total amount Of clinical innovation launched each year. The argument presented in this article is that, despite the limited empirical evidence. it is possible to Improve Our assessment of the likely costs and consequences of a proposed Strategy by appealing to economic theory and observations about the reimbursement process First, the empirical evidence supporting the view that changing a mix of drugs win Improve clinical innovation is based on the average launched drug. not the marginal Innovative drug otherwise not developed, and therefore Could be misleading. Second, the dynamic and complex nature of evidence of clinical innovation win reduce the feasibility of using contractually based mechanisms to implement such a strategy Also, a single country IS unlikely to have,in Impact on R&D decisions, and variation in the per capita economic value of new drugs would make multi-jurisdiction contracts with one firm difficult to implement Third. the quality of evidence of the clinical Innovation of the lead drug Could be reduced if there are Fewer or no follow-on drugs Finally. the existing inefficiencies in the process of displacement to finance new, technologies from a capped budget reduces the efficiency with which any additional potential clinical Innovation from NMEs win be translated to reduced population burden of disease. The article concludes that it is possible that such a strategy Could be costly to implement. and the impact on global burden of disease uncertain in both direction and magnitude. This is likely to be the case even if the average clinical innovation content of innovative NMEs is higher than for me-too NMEs and the mechanisms designed to change the mix of NMEs are effective. Other options to improve the effectiveness with which pharmaceutical clinical innovation reduces burden of disease Should be explored, including improved efficiency of both firm R&D and the process of disinvestment to finance new technologies.","Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Pekarsky, B (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Discipline Publ Hlth, Mail Drop DX650 545, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",,,,,,,,49,16,17,2,32,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,1,,,,,1,17,,10.2165/11318770-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,559XH,20014872.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274862600001,0

Let P denote the distribution of the observed data. The class of models we consider is defined by a population objective function Q(theta, P) for theta is an element of Theta. The point of departure from the classical extremum estimation framework is that it is not assumed that Q(theta, P) has a unique minimizer in the parameter space Theta. The goal may be either to draw inferences about some unknown point in the set of minimizers of the population objective function or to draw inferences about the set of minimizers itself. In this paper, the object of interest is Theta(0)(P)=argmin(theta is an element of Theta)Q(theta, P), and so we seek random sets that contain this set with at least some prespecified probability asymptotically. We also consider situations where the object of interest is the image of Theta(0)(P) under a known function. Random sets that satisfy the desired coverage property are constructed under weak assumptions. Conditions are provided under which the confidence regions are asymptotically valid not only pointwise in P, but also uniformly in P. We illustrate the use of our methods with an empirical study of the impact of top-coding outcomes on inferences about the parameters of a linear regression. Finally, a modest simulation study sheds some light on the finite-sample behavior of our procedure.","[Romano, Joseph P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shaikh, Azeem M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ & Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Stanford University; University of Chicago,"Romano, JP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Sequoia Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",romano@stanford.edu; amshaikh@uchicago.edu,,"Romano, Joseph/0000-0002-9685-8372",Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1007732] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,21,108,137,0,15,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2010,78.0,1,,,,,169,211,,10.3982/ECTA6706,0.0,,,43,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,553TD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274388800006,0

In particular, they have shown how these convex bounds can be used to derive closed-form approximations for several of the risk measures of such a sum. In this paper we investigate to which extent their general results on convex bounds can also be applied to sums of log-elliptical random variables which incorporate sums of log-normals as a special case. Firstly, we show that unlike the log-normal case, for general sums of log-ellipticals the convex lower bound does no longer result in closed-form approximations for the different risk measures. Secondly, we demonstrate how instead the weaker stop-loss order can be used to derive such closed-form approximations. We also present numerical examples to show the accuracy of the proposed approximations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bloom, Nicholas] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Bloom, Nicholas] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-107-28-1001] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,67,2463,2859,38,508,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2009,77.0,3,,,,,623,685,,10.3982/ECTA6248,0.0,,,63,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,448MW,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000266267700001,0

As a main contribution we provide a simple and practical optimal credibility weight for combining the chain-ladder or individual loss ratio reserve (grossed up latest claims experience of an origin period) with the Bornhuetter-Ferguson or collective loss ratio reserve (experience based burning cost estimate of the total ultimate claims of an origin period). The obtained simple optimal credibility weights minimize simultaneously the mean squared error and the variance of the claims reserve. We note also that the standard Chain-Ladder, Cape Cod and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods can be reinterpreted in the credible context and extended to optimal credible standard methods. The new approach is inspired from Mack (2000). Two advantages over the Mack method are worthwhile to be mentioned. First, a pragmatic estimation of the required parameters leads to a straightforward calculation of the optimal credibility weights and mean squared errors of the credible reserves. An advantage of the collective loss ratio claims reserve over the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserve in Mack (2000) is that different actuaries come always to the same results provided they use the same actuarial premiums.","FRSGlobal Switzerland, CH-8027 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Hürlimann, W (通讯作者)，FRSGlobal Switzerland, Bederstr 1, CH-8027 Zurich, Switzerland.",werner.huerlimann@frsglobal.com,,,,,,,5,5,5,0,3,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2009,39.0,1,,,,,81,99,,10.2143/AST.39.1.2038057,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,464HJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267495700004,0

The alternative hypothesis is non-parametric. A random function is a form of infinite-dimensional random variable, and the test presented here a generalization of the familiar Cramer-von Mises test to an infinite dimensional random variable.

However, if the low scores of a contractor's attributes given by experts are entirely removed when the overall score is calculated, it may lead to that a contractor with some latent risks to the project will win the bid and the project may not be executed and completed in accordance with the contract agreement. In this paper, an outlier detection model, which is one of the methods of Knowledge Discover), in Data (KDD), based on similar coefficient sum was developed to address the aforementioned issue of the Marking Scheme method. An early risk warning system of tender evaluation for construction projects based on this model was implemented. With this system, the outliers could be found on the basis of the historical data of tender evaluation for the construction projects, according to which risk early warning could be carried out. Subsequently, an empirical survey was conducted in Tianjin, China, and the survey results confirmed that the proposed system could effectively detect latent risks. Finally, the paper provides suggestions to the employers could be presented to prevent some latent risks and help them increase the success rate of bidding projects.","[Cheng, Tiexin; Guo, Tao] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Coll Management, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China",Tiangong University,,tiexincheng@vip.sina.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1191,1196,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600203,0

In fact, major financial and economic changes of global character have introduced a large amount of noise in time series data, particularly, in socioeconomic indicators used for real time economic analysis. The aim of this study is to construct a cascade linear filter via the convolution of several noise suppression, trend estimation, and extrapolation linear filters. The cascading approach approximates the steps followed by the nonlinear Dagum (1996) trend-cycle estimator, a modified version of the 13-term Henderson filter. The former consists of first extending the seasonally adjusted series with ARIMA extrapolations, and then applying a very strict replacement of extreme values. The nonlinear Dagum filter has been shown to improve significantly the size of revisions and number of false turning points with respect to H13. We construct a linear approximation of the nonlinear filter because it offers several advantages. For one, its application is direct and hence does not require some knowledge on ARIMA model identification. Furthermore, linear filtering preserves the crucial additive constraint by which the trend of an aggregated variable should be equal to the algebraic addition of its component trends, thus avoiding the selection problem of direct versus indirect adjustments. Finally, the properties of a linear filter concerning signal passing and noise suppression can always be compared to those of other linear filters by means of spectral analysis.","[Dagum, Estela Bee; Luati, Alessandra] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Dagum, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",estela.beedagum@stat.unibo.it,,"LUATI, ALESSANDRA/0000-0001-6407-9385",MIUR-Cofin 2004,"MIUR-Cofin 2004(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We would like to thank two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on earlier versions of this article.

Under a slightly more restrictive framework than Lee (2007), we show that this model is generally identified when at least three different sizes of peer groups are observed in the sample at hand. While unnecessary in general, homoscedasticity may be required in special cases, for instance when endogenous and exogenous peer effects cancel each other. We extend this analysis to the case where only binary outcomes are observed. Once more, most parameters are semiparametrically identified under weak conditions. However, identifying all of them requires more stringent assumptions, including a homoscedasticity condition. We also develop a parametric estimator for the binary case, which relies on the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane (GHK) simulator. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the influence of group sizes on the accuracy of the estimation, in line with the results obtained by Lee (2007).","[Davezies, Laurent; D'Haultfoeuille, Xavier; Fougere, Denis] CREST INSEE, F-92245 Malakoff, France; [Fougere, Denis] CNRS, F-94204 Ivry, France; [Fougere, Denis] CEPR, London EC1V 0DG, England; [Fougere, Denis] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Davezies, L (通讯作者)，CREST INSEE, 18 Blvd Gabriel Peri, F-92245 Malakoff, France.",laurent.davezies@insee.fr; xavier.dhaultfoeuille@ensae.fr; fougere@ensae.fr,,,,,,,32,29,35,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

However, less is known about the impact of delayed appropriate coverage in complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs). Objective: To evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes associated with early versus late use of vancomycin in the management of patients hospitalized for cSSSIs. Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed using an inpatient claims database of >500 US hospitals in 2005. Using prescription claims, patients with primary or secondary cSSSI admissions were classified into three groups: 1=early vancomycin monotherapy; 2=early vancomycin combination therapy; 3=late vancomycin therapy. Outcomes studied included LOS and inpatient hospital costs. One-way analysis of variance was used for unadjusted analysis and multivariate regression methods were used to control for co-variates. Results: A total of 34942 patients (27.78% of all patients with cSSSIs) were treated with vancomycin. Mean age was 54.7 years and 54.3% of the patients were males. Mean unadjusted total LOS was 8.46, 9.44 and 13.2 days, and hospital costs in 2005 values were $US10211.94, $US12361.94 and $US 18 344.00 for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In-hospital mortality rate was highest in group 3 (4.18%) and lowest in group 1 (.75%). Generalized linear models used to control for potential confounding variables between early versus late vancomycin use suggest that among cSSSI patients late vancomycin use is an independent predictor of higher LOS and costs. Conclusion: In this large inpatient database, later vancomycin use in patients with cSSSIs appears to be significantly associated with higher LOS and total costs.","[Itani, Kamal M.

According to a heuristics-and-biases-program approach, this implies that the hurdle-rate rule is a biased heuristic. This work shows that the hurdle-rate rule may be interpreted as a fruitful strategy of bounded rationality, where several domain-specific and project-specific elements are integrated and condensed into an aspiration level.

The relationship is particularly ambiguous within a GARCH-M framework. This paper demonstrates that such a conflict can be attributed primarily to the downward bias of standard estimators that neglect additive outliers (AO) commonly observed in financial returns, and proposes a feasible estimation method (RGMME) for the GARCH-M model based upon a robust variant of the GMM. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that AOs cause more serious bias in the ML and GMM estimates of the relationship coefficient than previously expected. Therefore, in the presence of AOs, the RGMME appears superior to other standard estimators in terms of the root mean square error criterion. There is strong evidence favouring the RGMME over standard estimators based on its empirical application. In particular, it is substantially evident from the results of the RGMME that there is support for a positive relationship between excess returns and conditional volatility for all three major equity markets.","Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Park, BJ (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, 44-1 Jukjeon Dong, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",bjpark@dankook.ac.kr,,,Korea Research Foundation [KRF-2003-041-B0017],Korea Research Foundation(National Research Foundation of Korea),"An earlier version of this paper was partially written while I was a visitor at Duke University.

A further objective was to identify studies on the cost effectiveness of RLS treatments. A systematic literature search was performed. Two researchers independently assessed the relevance of each publication. Studies published before August 2008 were included if they assessed quality of life in patients Suffering from RLS, determined total or patient-related costs attributable to RLS. and/or evaluated the cost effectiveness of treatment options for RLS. A total of 725 references were identified, including 100 full-text articles. Fifteen of these publications met all of the selection criteria and were included in the present review. Seven abstracts that focused on the economic burden of RLS and/or the cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies in RLS patients were also included. RLS was associated, in the included studies, with reductions in quality of life similar to those seen in patients with other chronic conditions. The cost-of-illness studies were heterogeneous but indicated that RLS was associated with a substantial economic burden, resulting in high direct and indirect costs to society. Although effective and cost-effective treatments appear to be available, further research is warranted, especially regarding the economic burden of RLS and the cost effectiveness of available treatment options.","[Reinhold, Thomas; Mueller-Riemenschneider, Falk; Willich, Stefan N.; Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Charite Univ Med Ctr, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, D-10098 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Brüggenjürgen, B (通讯作者)，Charite Univ Med Ctr, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, D-10098 Berlin, Germany.",bernd.brueggenjuergen@charite.de,,"Muller-Riemenschneider, Falk/0000-0003-1402-7477; Reinhold, Thomas/0000-0001-5169-7029",,,,,37,38,39,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,4,,,,,267,279,,10.2165/00019053-200927040-00001,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,482DM,19485424.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268864300001,0

The present paper shows that aggregating moment conditions that are formulated in differences provides an orderly mechanism for preserving information and signal strength in autoregressions with some very desirable properties. In first order autoregression, a partially aggregated estimator based on moment conditions in differences is shown to have a limiting normal distribution that holds uniformly in the autoregressive coefficient rho, including stationary and unit root cases. The rate of convergence is root n when vertical bar rho vertical bar < 1 and the limit distribution is the same as the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), but when rho = 1 the rate of convergence to the normal distribution is within a slowly varying factor of n. A fully aggregated estimator (FAE) is shown to have the same limit behavior in the stationary case and to have nonstandard limit distributions in unit root and near integrated cases, which reduce both the bias and the variance of the MLE. This result shows that it is possible to improve on the asymptotic behavior of the MLE without using an artificial shrinkage technique or otherwise accelerating convergence at unity at the cost of performance in the neighborhood of unity. Confidence intervals constructed from the FAE using local asymptotic theory around unity also lead to improvements over the MLE.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Currently, regime-switching models are commonly used to simulate asset returns. Under a regime switching model, simulating random asset streams involves three steps: (i) estimate the model parameters given the number of regimes using maximum likelihood, (ii) choose the number of regimes using a model selection criteria, and (iii) simulate the streams using the optimal number of regimes and parameter values. This method, however, does not properly incorporate regime or parameter uncertainty into the generated asset streams and therefore into the price of the guarantee. To remedy this, this article adopts a Bayesian approach to properly account for those two sources of uncertainty and improve pricing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It has however become well accepted to utilize a Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) paradigm to model the individual OpRisk loss processes corresponding to the Basel II Business line/event type. In this paper we derive a novel class of doubly stochastic alpha-stable family LDA models. These models provide the ability to capture the heavy tailed loss processes typical of OpRisk, whilst also providing analytic expressions for the compound processes annual loss density and distributions, as well as the aggregated compound processes' annual loss models. In particular we develop models of the annual loss processes in two scenarios. The first scenario considers the loss processes with a stochastic intensity parameter, resulting in inhomogeneous compound Poisson processes annually. The resulting arrival processes of losses under such a model will have independent counts over increments within the year. The second scenario considers discretization of the annual loss processes into monthly increments with dependent time increments as captured by a Binomial processes with a stochastic probability of success changing annually. Each of these models will be coupled under an LDA framework wit h heavy-tailed severity models comprised of alpha-stable severities for the loss amounts per loss event. In this paper we will derive analytic results for the annual loss distribution density and distribution under each of these models and study their properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Terminal guarantees are on benefits payable upon death, survival and surrender. The latter are adapted after exercising the options. A model framework including these features and an algorithm to jointly value the premium payment and surrender options is presented. In a first step, the standard principles of risk-neutral evaluation are applied and the policyholder is assumed to use an economically rational exercise strategy. In a second step, option value sensitivity on different contract parameters, benefit adaptation mechanisms, and exercise behavior is analyzed numerically. The two latter are the main drivers for the option value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model identifies the size of government and the composition of government spending which maximize the rate of growth and the long run level of per capita income. Transitional dynamics to the steady state can be rather long. This reinforces the need for short-medium term analysis such as in this work. Given the size of the government, different allocations of public resources lead to different growth rates in the transition dynamics, depending on their elasticity. We argue that neglecting the hypothesis of non-monotonicity and the different impact different kinds of public spending have on economic performance results in models which suffer from mis-specification.

The objective of the management is to select the dividend policy that maximizes the expected total discounted dividend payments to be received by the shareholders. We study two different cases: bounded dividend rates and unbounded dividend rates. These cases generate, respectively, problems of classical stochastic control with regime switching and singular stochastic control with regime switching.

We propose a tractable principal-agent model of coercion, based on the idea that coercive activities by employers, or guns, affect the participation constraint of workers. We show that coercion and effort are complements, so that coercion increases effort, but coercion always reduces utilitarian social welfare. Better outside options for workers reduce coercion because of the complementarity between coercion and effort: workers with a better outside option exert lower effort in equilibrium and thus are coerced less. Greater demand for labor increases coercion because it increases equilibrium effort. We investigate the interaction between outside options, market prices, and other economic variables by embedding the (coercive) principal-agent relationship in a general equilibrium setup, and studying when and how labor scarcity encourages coercion. General (market) equilibrium interactions working through the price of output lead to a positive relationship between labor scarcity and coercion along the lines of ideas suggested by Domar, while interactions those working through the outside option lead to a negative relationship similar to ideas advanced in neo-Malthusian historical analyses of the decline of feudalism. In net, a decline in available labor increases coercion in general equilibrium if and only if its direct (partial equilibrium) effect is to increase the price of output by more than it increases outside options. Our model also suggests that markets in slaves make slaves worse off, conditional on enslavement, and that coercion is more viable in industries that do not require relationship-specific investment by workers.","[Acemoglu, Daron; Wolitzky, Alexander] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Acemoglu, Daron] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr,E52-371, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",daron@mit.edu; wolitzky@mit.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Penjore, Dorji/C-8476-2014",,,,,,46,99,126,0,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2011,79.0,2,,,,,555,600,,10.3982/ECTA8963,0.0,,,46,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,720YI,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000287318200006,0

A complete description of game forms where all coalition improvement paths lead to strong equilibria is obtained: they are either dictatorial, or voting (or rather lobbing) about two outcomes. The restriction to minimal strategy changes ensures the convergence of coalition improvements to strong equilibria in every game form generated by a voting by veto procedure.","Russian Acad Sci, Dorodnicyn Comp Ctr, Moscow 119333, Russia","Federal Research Center Computer Science & Control of RAS; Russian Academy of Sciences; Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre, RAS","Kukushkin, NS (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Dorodnicyn Comp Ctr, 40 Vavilova, Moscow 119333, Russia.",ququns@inbox.ru,,"Kukushkin, Nikolai/0000-0001-9200-7901",Leading Scientific Schools [NSh-2982.2008.1]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [08-07-00158]; Russian Foundation for Humanities [08-02-00347]; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [SEJ 2007-67135],Leading Scientific Schools(Leading Scientific Schools Program); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government); Russian Foundation for Humanities; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government),"Financial support from a Presidential Grant for the State Support of the Leading Scientific Schools (NSh-2982.2008.1), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project 08-07-00158), the Russian Foundation for Humanities (project 08-02-00347), and the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (project SEJ 2007-67135) is acknowledged.

Comparison under uncertainty of incremental cost, effects and cost effectiveness across more than two strategies is conceptually and practically very different from that for two strategies, where all evidence can be summarized in a single bivariate distribution on the incremental cost-effectiveness plane. Alternative methods for comparing multiple strategies in HTA have been developed in (i) presenting cost and effects on the cost-disutility plane and (ii) summarizing evidence with multiple strategy cost-effectiveness acceptability (CEA) and expected net loss (ENL) curves and frontiers. However, critical questions remain for the analyst and decision maker of how these techniques can be best employed across multiple strategies to (i) inform clinical and cost inference in presenting evidence, and (ii) summarize evidence of cost effectiveness to inform societal reimbursement decisions where preferences may be risk neutral or somewhat risk averse under the Arrow-Lind theorem. We critically consider how evidence across multiple strategies can be best presented and summarized to inform inference and societal reimbursement decisions, given currently available methods. In the process, we make a number of important original findings. First, in presenting evidence for multiple strategies, the joint distribution of costs and effects on the cost-disutility plane with associated flexible comparators varying across replicates for cost and effect axes ensure full cost and effect inference. Such inference is usually confounded on the cost-effectiveness plane with comparison relative to a fixed origin and axes. Second, in summarizing evidence for risk-neutral societal decision making, ENL curves and frontiers are shown to have advantages over the CEA frontier in directly presenting differences in expected net benefit (ENB). The CEA frontier, while identifying strategies that maximize ENB, only presents their probability of maximizing net benefit (NB) and, hence, fails to explain why strategies maximize ENB at any given threshold value. Third, in summarizing evidence for somewhat risk-averse societal decision making, trade-offs between the strategy maximizing ENB and other potentially optimal strategies with higher probability of maximizing NB should be presented over discrete threshold values where they arise. However, the probabilities informing these trade-offs and associated discrete threshold value regions should be derived from bilateral CEA curves to prevent confounding by other strategies inherent in multiple strategy CEA curves. Based on these findings, a series of recommendations are made for best presenting and summarizing cost-effectiveness evidence for reimbursement decisions when comparing multiple strategies, which are contrasted with advice for comparing two strategies. Implications for joint research and reimbursement decisions are also discussed.","[Eckermann, Simon] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Hlth Serv Dev, Australian Hlth Serv Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Willan, Andrew R.] SickKids Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Willan, Andrew R.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Wollongong; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto,"Eckermann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Ctr Hlth Serv Dev, Australian Hlth Serv Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",Simon_Eckermann@UOW.edu.au,,,,,,,38,23,23,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,7,,,,,563,577,,10.2165/11587100-000000000-00000,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,793CC,21671686.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000292797000003,0

We present three results. An optimization problem is defined in a space of stochastic integrals with value function EH(center dot). Extending the method of Follmer and Leukerte, it is shown how to construct an optimal strategy. The optimization problem EH(center dot) as criterion to select a hedge, is of a minimax type. In the second, and main result of this paper, a dual-representation formula for this value is presented, which is of a maxmax type. This leads us to a dual optimization problem. In the third result of this paper, we apply some key arguments in the robust convex-duality theory developed by Schied to construct optimal solutions to the dual problem, if the loss functional L(center dot) has an associated convex risk measure L(center dot) which is continuous from below, and if the European option H is essentially bounded.","[Hernandez-Hernandez, Daniel; Trevino-Aguilar, Erick] Ctr Invest Matemat AC, Guanajuato, Mexico",,"Hernández-Hernández, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest Matemat AC, Guanajuato, Mexico.",dher@cimat.mx,,"Trevino-Aguilar, Erick/0000-0002-2543-8469",Conacyt [61423]; Concyteg [08-02-K662-119],Conacyt(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Concyteg,D.H.-H. was partially supported by Conacyt under Grant 61423 and E.T.-A. was partially supported by Concyteg under Grant 08-02-K662-119.,,21,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

FLUCONAZOLE; INFECTIONS; PREVENTION,"Posaconazole (Noxafil (R)) is an oral, second-generation, extended-spectrum triazole whose approved indications include prophylaxis of invasive fungal disease (IFD) in immunocompromised patients. In pivotal head-to-head trials, posaconazole was significantly more effective in preventing IFD than standard azole therapy (i.e. oral fluconazole or itraconazole) in chemotherapy-induced neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and was noninferior to treatment with fluconazole in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who were receiving intensive immunosuppressive therapy following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In both indications, prophylactic posaconazole was associated with signficantly lower rates of IFD-related mortality. The overall tolerability profile of posaconazole was generally similar to that of the other prophylactic treatments. The large body of modelled cost-effectiveness analyses from a healthcare payer perspective on the use of prophylactic posaconazole suggest that it is a dominant or cost-effective option relative to prophylaxis with standard azole therapy in neutropenic patients with AML/MDS, and fluconazole in patients with GVHD. Based on clinical trial data in these patient groups, antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole was predicted to be a dominant or cost-effective option relative to prophylaxis with standard oral azoles, with regard to the incremental cost per QALY gained, life-year (LY) gained and/or other outcomes in cost-effectiveness analyses in numerous countries. In those analyses in which posaconazole did not dominate the comparator, posaconazole was considered cost effective, as the incremental cost per QALY or LY gained with posaconazole was lower than assumed willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses consistently demonstrated that these results were robust to plausible changes in key model assumptions. In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with posaconazole is clinically effective in preventing IFD in neutropenic patients with AML/MDS and patients with GVHD. Available pharmacoeconomic data from several countries, despite some inherent limitations, support the use of posaconazole as a dominant or cost-effective prophylactic antifungal treatment relative to prophylaxis with standard oral azoles in these patient populations at high risk of developing IFD.","Adis, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"Lyseng-Williamson, KA (通讯作者)，Adis, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,,"Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine/0000-0002-5104-1158",,,,,38,18,20,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,3,,,,,251,268,,10.2165/11206800-000000000-00000,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,730RD,21309616.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000288050900008,0

Objective: Our objective was to quantify patients' benefit-risk preferences for RCC treatments and relative importance of attributes in a common metric. Methods: US residents aged >= 18 years with RCC completed a web-enabled, choice-format conjoint survey that presented a series of 12 trade-off questions, each including a pair of hypothetical RCC treatment profiles. Each profile was defined by efficacy (PFS, when overall survival held constant), tolerability effects (fatigue/tiredness, diarrhoea, hand-foot syndrome [HFS], mouth sores) and serious adverse events (liver failure, blood clot). Trade-off questions were based on a predetermined experimental design with known statistical properties. Random-parameters logit was used to analyse the data. Results: A total of 138 patients completed the survey. PFS was the most important attribute for patients over the range of levels included in the survey, while remaining attributes were ranked in decreasing order of importance: fatigue/tiredness, diarrhoea, liver failure, HFS, blood clot and mouth sores. In order to increase PFS by 11 months, patients would be willing to accept a maximum level of absolute blood clot risk of 3.1% (95% Cl 1.5, 5.3) or liver failure risk of 2.0% (95% CI 1.0, 3.3). Conclusion: A 22-month change in PFS was shown to be the most important improvement for patients. Severe fatigue/tiredness and diarrhoea were rated as the most troublesome tolerability effects of RCC treatment. Patients were likely willing to accept significant treatment-related risks of 2-3% for liver failure and blood clot to increase PFS by 11 months.","[Mohamed, Ateesha F.; Hauber, A.

There are two key issues in long-term strategic asset allocation, namely, the presence of inflation risk and the impact of changes in (macro)-economic conditions on model dynamics. In this article, we take into account the two key issues in our model formulation and develop a quantitative model for long-term strategic asset allocation. A continuous-time, regime-switching market with the presence of inflation risk is considered. There are three tradeable assets in the market, namely, a fixed interest security, an ordinary share and an inflation-linked bond. We assume that the nominal rate of interest on the fixed interest security, the expected rate of return from the ordinary share and the appreciation rate of inflation are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, hidden Markov chain. The states of the chain represent different states of an economy.

In particular, the lagged correlation for the volatility is slowly decreasing with increasing lags. This paper characterizes its decay. First, Monte Carlo simulations are used to select the best volatility and correlation estimators for this task. Second, the empirical lagged correlations are studied over a set of 225 daily time series, and for the DJIA with a sample size of one century. The results strongly favor a log-decay shape, while an exponential and power law decay do not describe the data well. The implications for the description of financial time series by processes are important, as these findings exclude hyperbolic decay, but favor volatility cascade and multi-component ARCH processes. Third, the analysis of the decay coefficient shows that time series related to emerging countries have a shorter memory, in agreement with an analysis of the Hurst exponents published recently.","Swissquote Bank, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland",,"Zumbach, G (通讯作者)，Swissquote Bank, Chemin Cretaux 33, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.",gilles.zumbach@swissquote.ch,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

First we prove that if the sum has the same distribution as the corresponding comonotonic sum, then the underlying random variables must be comonotonic as long as each of them is integrable. In the literature, this result is only known to be true if either each random variable is square integrable or possesses a continuous distribution function. We then study the situation when the distribution of the sum only coincides with the corresponding comonotonic sum in the tail. This leads to the dependence structure known as tail comonotonicity. Finally, by establishing some new results concerning convex order, we show that comonotonicity can also be characterized by expected utility and distortion risk measures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, replacing the (unknown) copula by the comonotonic copula will in most cases not reflect reality well. For instance, in an insurance context we may have partial information about the dependence structure of different risks in the lower tail. In this paper, we extend the aforementioned result, using the concept of upper comonotonicity, to the case where the dependence structure of a random vector in the lower tail is already known. Since upper comonotonic random vectors have comonotonic behavior in the upper tail, we are able to extend several well-known results of comonotonicity to upper comonotonicity. As an application, we construct different increasing convex upper bounds for sums of random variables and compare these bounds in terms of increasing convex order. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the evaluation of the expected present value of dividends, the interest rates are assumed to follow a Markov chain with finite state space. A system of difference equations with certain boundary conditions for the expected present value of total dividend payments prior to ruin is derived and solved.

Search outcomes convey valuable information, and learning from search generates endogenous heterogeneity in workers' beliefs about their job-finding probability. We characterize this process and analyze its interactions with job creation and wage determination. Our theory sheds new light on how unemployment can affect workers' labor market outcomes and wage determination, providing a rational explanation for discouragement as the consequence of negative search outcomes. In particular, longer unemployment durations are likely to be followed by lower reemployment wages because a worker's beliefs about his job-finding process deteriorate with unemployment duration.

Trading signals are generated in two ways: using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or regressing stock returns on sector Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). In both cases, the idiosyncratic returns are modelled as mean-reverting processes, which leads naturally to 'contrarian' strategies. We construct, back-test and compare market-neutral PCA- and ETF-based strategies applied to the broad universe of US equities. After accounting for transaction costs, PCA-based strategies have an average annual Sharpe ratio of 1.44 over the period 1997 to 2007, with stronger performances prior to 2003. During 2003-2007, the average Sharpe ratio of PCA-based strategies was only 0.9. ETF-based strategies had a Sharpe ratio of 1.1 from 1997 to 2007, experiencing a similar degradation since 2002. We also propose signals that account for trading volume, observing significant improvement in performance in the case of ETF-based signals. ETF-strategies with volume information achieved a Sharpe ratio of 1.51 from 2003 to 2007. The paper also relates the performance of mean-reversion statistical arbitrage strategies with the stock market cycle.

A Comparison of Two Discrete-Choice Experiments,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MOHS MICROGRAPHIC SURGERY; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; HEALTH-CARE; SENSITIVITY; EXCISION; QUALITY,"Background: Nowadays, an increasing number of discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) incorporate cost as an attribute. However, the inclusion of a cost attribute, particularly within collectively funded healthcare systems, can be challenging because health services or goods are generally not traded in a market situation and individuals are not used to paying for a service or a good at the point of consumption. Objective: To examine whether the inclusion of a cost attribute in a DCE results in different preferences regarding a surgical treatment for primary basal cell carcinoma (BCC) compared with a DCE without a cost attribute. Methods: A randomized study was performed in which the impact of a cost attribute on the general public's preferences for a surgical treatment (Mohs micrographic surgery [M MS] or standard excision [SE]) to remove BCC was examined. This was done by comparing the outcomes of two DCEs, one with a cost attribute (DCE_cost) and one without (DCE_nocost). Six attributes (recurrence, re-excision, travel time, surgical time, waiting time for surgical results, costs) and their levels were selected, based on results of a clinical trial, a cost-effectiveness study, a review and a focus group of patients who had recently received treatment for BCC. Outcomes of both DCEs were compared in terms of theoretical validity, relative importance of the attributes and the rank order of preferences. Results: A total of 615 respondents (n = 303 for DCE_nocost; n = 312 for DCE_cost) were interviewed by telephone. This gave an overall response rate of 38%. Respondents in DCE_nocost preferred a surgical treatment with a lower probability of recurrence, lower surgery time, lower waiting time and no risk for a re-excision. Respondents in DCE_cost showed the same preferences, but also preferred a treatment with less travel time and lower costs. Overall, respondents in both DCEs showed the same preference for a surgical treatment: MMS was preferred over SE. Conclusion: Results suggest that, in this population, the inclusion of a cost attribute in a DCE leads to the same preference regarding a surgical treatment to remove BCC as a DCE without a cost attribute. However, further research in different settings is needed to confirm these findings.","[Essers, Brigitte A.

Although there are some qualitative researches in this field, quantitative bundling is still a problem. This paper designs post-bidding bundle strategy (PBBS) for e-RA to focus on this issue. Based on mathematical model and the bidding data from suppliers, this strategy uses 'item similarity' and 'market competitiveness' to measure the possibility of two items in the same bundle.

Growing healthcare expenditure and shifts in the types of medical resources used have created a greater need for accurate information on the costs of treatment. The objectives of this review were to compare published estimates of direct medical costs for treating HIV and to determine the impact of disease stage on such costs, based on CD4 cell count and plasma viral load. A literature review was conducted to identify studies meeting prespecified criteria for information content, including an original estimate of the direct medical costs of treating an HIV-infected individual, stratified based on markers of disease progression. Three unpublished cost-of-care studies were also included, which were applied in the economic analyses published in this supplement. A two-step procedure was used to convert costs into a common price year (2004) using country-specific health expenditure inflators and, to account for differences in currency, using health-specific purchasing power parities to express all cost estimates in US dollars. In all nine studies meeting the eligibility criteria, infected individuals were followed longitudinally and a 'bottom-up' approach was used to estimate costs. The same patterns were observed in all studies: the lowest CD4 categories had the highest cost; there was a sharp decrease ill costs as CD4 cell counts rose towards 100 cells/mm(3); and there was a more gradual decline in costs as CD4 cell counts rose above 100 cells/mm(3). In the single study reporting cost according to viral load, it was shown that higher plasma viral load level (>100 000 HIV-RNA copies/mL) was associated with higher costs of care. The results demonstrate that the cost of treating HIV disease increases with disease progression, particularly at CD4 cell counts below 100 cells/mm(3). The suggestion that costs increase as the plasma viral load rises needs independent verification. This review of the literature further suggests that publicly available information on the cost of HAART by disease stage is inadequate. To address the information gap, multiple stakeholders (governments, pharmaceutical industry, private insurers and non-governmental organizations) have begun to establish and support an independent, high quality and standardized multicountry data collection for evaluating the cost of HIV management. An accurate, representative and relevant cost-estimate data resource would provide a valuable asset to healthcare planners that may lead to improved policy and decision-making in managing the HIV epidemic.","[Levy, Adrian] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Halifax, NS B3H 1V7, Canada; [Johnston, Karissa] Oxford Outcomes, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Brussels, Fac Med & Pharm, Brussels, Belgium; [Tramarin, Andrea] Osped Civile, Vicenza, Italy; [Montaner, Julio] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Montaner, Julio] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Excellence HIV AIDS, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada",Dalhousie University; Ghent University; University of British Columbia; St. Paul's Hospital; B.C.

Economic analyses of different types that have been performed for several countries to investigate the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid for treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLHIV) based on the clinical data gathered in the POWER and TITAN trials are reviewed for consistency and their value to different decision-makers is assessed. Cost-utility analyses for the USA and several European countries indicate that DRV/r-based HAART is cost effective compared with other standard of care protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in PLHIV with evidence of PI resistance. For all of these countries, the estimated cost-utility ratio is well below typical benchmark values and these ratios are robust, as demonstrated by one-way sensitivity and variability analyses and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Studies using other metrics including the average 1-year drug cost per patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the incremental drug cost per additional patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the total (antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral) costs during the first year of treatment, and the total healthcare budget impact during the first 5 years of treatment provided further evidence of the positive economic outcomes with the use of DRV/r in treatment-experienced PLHIV. Different measures of economic outcomes are useful for different types of decision-makers and different types of decisions. In general, the results of these different types of analyses will be consistent with each other. For darunavir, the economic analyses reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced adults who have failed at least one of the other currently available PIs is cost effective and may be cost saving.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Hill, Andrew M.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Hill, Andrew M.] Tibotec Pharmaceut BVBA, Mechelen, Belgium; [Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Mechelen, Belgium",Research Triangle Institute; Ghent University; University of Liverpool; Johnson & Johnson,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk,3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,,"Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Janssen Cilag; Johnson Johnson,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Janssen Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA),"The authors wish to thank Tony Vangeneugden, Ben Van Baelen, Els De Paepe, Alain Smits, Eric Lefebvre, Sabrina Spinosa-Guzman, Frank Tomaka, Frederic Godderis, Piet De Doncker, Martine De Pauw and the rest of the darunavir study team at Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, Mechelen, Belgium, for their contributions in analyzing and generating the clinical trial data that supported the above-mentioned economic analyses.

We analyse current knowledge of the impact of direct price-cap regulation of generic drugs and the implementation of systems regulating the reimbursement rate, particularly through reference pricing and similar tools, on dynamic price competition between generic competitors in Europe. A literature search was carried out in the EconLit and PubMed databases, and on Google Scholar. The search included papers published in English or Spanish between January 2000 and July 2009. Inclusion criteria included that studies had to present empirical results of a quantitative nature for EU countries of the impact of price capping and/or regulation of the reimbursement rate (reference pricing or similar systems) on price dynamics, corresponding to pharmacy sales, in the generic drug market. The available evidence indicates that price-cap regulation leads to a levelling off of generic prices at a higher level than would occur in the absence of this regulation. Reference pricing systems cause an obvious and almost compulsory reduction in the consumer price of all pharmaceuticals subject to this system, to a varying degree in different countries and periods, the reduction being greater for originator-branded drugs than for generics. In several countries with a reference pricing system, it was observed that generics with a consume:: price lower than the reference price do not undergo price reductions until the reference price is reduced, even when there are other lower-priced generics on the market (absence of price competition below the reference price). Beyond the price reduction forced by the price-cap and/or reference pricing regulation itself, the entry of new generic competitors is useful for lowering the real transaction price of purchases made by pharmacies (dynamic price competition at ex-factory level), although this effect is weaker or non-significant for official ex-factory prices and consumer prices in some countries. When maximum reimbursement systems such as reference pricing or similar types are applied, pharmacies are seen to receive large discounts on the price they pay for the pharmaceuticals, although these discounts are not transferred to the consumer price. The percentage discount offered to pharmacies in a country that uses a price-cap system combined with reference pricing is positively and significantly related to the number of generic competitors in :he market for the pharmaceutical (dynamic price competition at ex-factory level).","Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Res Ctr Econ & Hlth CRES, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Puig-Junoy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Res Ctr Econ & Hlth CRES, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27 34, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",jaume.puig@upf.edu,"Puig-Junoy, Jaume/D-7047-2013",,"Catalan Competition Authority (ACCO); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [SEJ2007-66133]; Merck Company Foundation; philanthropic arm of Merck & Co.

Due to its significance in behavior efficiency, cognitive complexity theory has become a hot spot in the area of external cognition research. Theory suggests that leaders who possess higher cognitive complexity are likely to exhibit a higher level of leadership effectiveness. This paper studies the influence of cognitive complexity on leadership effectiveness, and explores the moderating effects of environmental complexity. While the research results show that the cognitive complexity has a significant positive correlation with leadership effectiveness, organizational performance, and organizational commitment, the relationship between cognitive complexity and employee satisfaction is not significant. In addition, environmental complexity moderates the relationship between cognitive complexity and leadership effectiveness.","[Yao Yan-hong; Zhang Jing] Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,,,,,,,,,27,6,7,1,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1792,1797,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100240,0

This quality-adjusted time without symptoms of progression or toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis provides a combined measure of both the overall survival interval and the quality of survival for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) receiving temsirolimus, interferon (IFN)-alpha or the combination of these agents, using data from a phase III clinical trial. Methods: Overall survival was partitioned into three distinct health states: time with serious toxicity (TOX), time after progression (REL) and time without symptoms of progression or toxicity (TWIST). Health states were quality weighted by patient-reported EQ-5D measures collected while receiving treatment. Results: All 626 patients from the trial were included in computation of health-state durations. EQ-5D questionnaires were obtained from 260 patients upon progression and from 230 after a grade 3 or 4 adverse event, and from 278 patients in the TWiST state. Patients receiving temsirolimus had 38% longer TWiST than those receiving IFN alpha (6.5 vs 4.7 months, respectively; p = 0.0005). Patients receiving temsirolimus had 25% longer quality-adjusted survival in terms of Q-TWiST than those receiving IFN alpha (7.0 vs 5.6 months, respectively; p = 0.0015). Differences between the combination (temsirolimus + IFN alpha) and IFN alpha groups were not statistically significant. Threshold utility analysis indicated that temsirolimus was the preferred alternative for all possible utility weights for REL and TOX health states. Conclusion: Temsirolimus resulted in significantly longer Q-TWiST (quality-adjusted survival) in patients with advanced RCC than IFN alpha therapy.","[Strahs, Andrew; Berkenblit, Anna] Wyeth Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Zbrozek, Arthur S.; Levy, Donna; DeMarinis, Robert; Parasuraman, Shreekant] Wyeth Res, Collegeville, PA USA; [Hudes, Gary] Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA",Pfizer; Pfizer; Fox Chase Cancer Center,"Strahs, A (通讯作者)，Pfizer Inc, 35 Cambridge Pk Dr, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA.",andrew.strahs@pfizer.com,,,Wyeth Research; Pfizer; Novartis; Genentech,Wyeth Research(Wyeth); Pfizer(Pfizer); Novartis(Novartis); Genentech(Roche HoldingGenentech),"This study was sponsored by Wyeth Research, which was acquired by Pfizer Inc in October 2009.

Risk vulnerability and the tempering effect of background risk. Econometrica 64, 1109-1124]. While risk vulnerability captures the idea that the presence of an unfair financial background risk should make risk-averse individuals behave in a more risk-averse way with respect to an independent financial risk, cross-risk vulnerability extends this idea to the impact of a non-financial background risk on the financial risk. It provides an answer to the question of the impact of a background risk on the optimal coinsurance rate and on the optimal deductible level. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a bivariate utility function to exhibit cross-risk vulnerability both toward an actuarially neutral background risk and toward an unfair background risk. We also analyze the question of the sub-additivity of risk premia and show to what extent cross-risk vulnerability provides an answer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas in diffusion models with continuous trading, this strategy has no downside risk, in real markets this risk is nonnegligible and grows with the multiplier value. We study the behavior of CPPI strategies in models where the price of the underlying portfolio may experience downward jumps. Our framework leads to analytically tractable expressions for the probability of hitting the floor, the expected loss, and the distribution of losses. This allows to measure the gap risk but also leads to a criterion for adjusting the multiplier based on the investor's risk aversion. Finally, we study the problem of hedging the downside risk of a CPPI strategy using options.

An investor taking decisions continuously in time selects a consumption-investment policy to maximize his expected total discounted utility of consumption. The market coefficients and the investor's utility of consumption are dependent on the regime of the financial market, which is modeled by an observable finite-state continuous-time Markov chain. We obtain explicit optimal consumption and investment policies for specific HARA utility functions. We show that the optimal policy depends on the regime. We also make an economic analysis of the solutions, and show that for every investor the optimal proportion to allocate in the risky asset is greater in a bull market than in a bear market. This behavior is not affected by the investor's risk preferences. On the other hand, the optimal consumption to wealth ratio depends not only on the regime, but also on the investor's risk tolerance: high risk-averse investors will consume relatively more in a bull market than in a bear market, and the opposite is true for low risk-averse investors.","[Cadenillas, Abel] Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Cadenillas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada.",acadenil@math.ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [194137],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"The work of L.

A recolored version of our bootstrap is also proposed which can further improve upon the finite sample size properties of the procedure when the shocks are serially correlated, in particular ameliorating the significant under-size seen in the M tests against processes with autoregressive or moving average roots close to -1. The wild bootstrap is used because it has the desirable property of preserving in the resampled data the pattern of heteroskedasticity present in the original shocks, thereby allowing for cases where the series under test is driven by martingale difference innovations.","[Taylor, A.

Under such a setting, they argue that arbitrage does not exist in the fractional market. To unravel this discrepancy, we examine the definition of self-financing strategies used by these authors. By refining their definitions, a new notion of continuously rebalanced self-financing strategies, which is compatible with simple buy and hold strategies, is given. Under this definition, arbitrage opportunities do exist in fractional markets.","[Chan, Ngai Hang; Ng, Chi Tim] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Chan, NH (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nhchan@sta.cuhk.edu.hk,"Ng, Chi/AAU-3495-2020","Chan, Ngai Hang/0000-0002-4755-5180","HKSAR-RGC Earmarked Grants [400305, 400306]; HKSAR-RGC General Research Fund [400408]",HKSAR-RGC Earmarked Grants; HKSAR-RGC General Research Fund,"We are indebted to the Editor and three referees for constructive comments that led to an improved version of the paper.

It is common to Find in clinical studies that only an HR-QOL profile measure such as the SF-36 is included, but not the summary HR-QOL index. Therefore, the economist's usual practice is to reprocess the profile data into a single index format. Several 'after-market' tools are available to convert the SF-36 or SF-12 into a single form with or without utility-weighting metric property. However, there has been no consensus with regard to a regression method that should be recommended for such a mapping task. Objective: To report on the performance of different regression methods that have previously been applied to the conversion of SF-12 data in the analysis of a single common dataset. The mapping between the SF-12 and EQ-5D is the focus. Methods: The data were adopted from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2003 where 19678 adults completed both EQ-5D and SF-12 questionnaires. Four econometric techniques, namely ordinary least squares (OLS), censored least absolute deviation, multinomial logit model and two-part model regressions were investigated together with two main types of model specifications: item-based and summary score-based. The performance of each examined model was judged by various criteria, including its estimated mean, the size of mean absolute error and the number of errors. Results: Among four compared econometric techniques, OLS regression was the most accurate model in estimating the group mean. Models with item-based model specification performed better than those with summary score-based regardless of the chosen econometric technique. Nevertheless, the accuracy of OLS deteriorates in older and less healthy subgroups. The results also suggested that the two-part model, which addresses the heterogeneity issue, performs better in these vulnerable subgroups. Conclusions: None of the mapping methods included in the current study are suitable for estimating at the individual level. The methodology exemplified here has wider applicability and might just as readily be applied to other members of the SF family or indeed to other profile measures of HR-QOL. However, it is recommended that a preference-based, single index measure of HR-QOL should be included in the clinical studies for the purpose of economic evaluation.","[Chuang, Ling-Hsiang; Kind, Paul] Univ York, Outcomes Res Grp, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Chuang, LH (通讯作者)，Univ York, Outcomes Res Grp, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",lc525@york.ac.uk,"Kind, Paul/E-9715-2015","Kind, Paul/0000-0003-2377-1652",,,,,46,33,39,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,6,,,,,491,505,,10.2165/00019053-200927060-00005,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,495GC,19640012.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000269877600005,0

This analysis utilized discrete-event Simulation (DES) to model the potential longer-term clinical and economic implications of this trial. Methods: A DES predicting the course of relapsing MS and incorporating the effect of IFNb1a therapy was developed. The model began by randomly reading in actual patient data from the trial to create 1000 patients. Each Simulated patient was replicated - one was assigned to receive SC IFNb1a three times a week and the other to receive IM IFNb1a once a week. During the simulation, patients may (i) experience relapses, with associated short- and long-term impacts on costs and disability; (ii) develop new T2 lesions detected by a magnetic resonance imaging scan; (iii) discontinue treatment because of adverse events or lack of response; (iv) advance to secondary progressive MS; or (v) die. Model inputs were mainly obtained from the EVIDENCE trial, but were taken from published literature if they could not be obtained from the trial. Direct medical costs ($US, year 2006 values) to the US payers were primarily obtained by updating a published cost analysis. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model results. Results: Based on 100 replications of 1000 patient pairs over 4 years, SC IFNb1a was predicted to enable more patients to avoid relapse (216 vs 147). Total mean costs per patient (discounted) were $US79 890 with SC IFNb1a versus $US74485 with IM administration, a net increase of $US5405 per patient. However, SC IFNb1a was estimated to prevent 0.50 relapses and save 23 relapse-free days per patient, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $US10755 per relapse prevented and $US232 per relapse-free day gained. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the result was most sensitive to the treatment efficacy, model time horizon and cost of IFNb1a treatment. Conclusion: Based on the results observed in the EVIDENCE trial, the model predicted that SC IFNb1a would yield greater health benefits over 4 years than IM IFNb1a, at a cost that would seem to be a reasonable trade-off.","[Guo, Shien; Bozkaya, Duygu; Ward, Alexandra; O'Brien, Judith A.] United BioSource Corp, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Guo, Shien] St Louis Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; [Ishak, Khajak] United BioSource Corp, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bennett, Randy; Al-Sabbagh, Ahmad; Meletiche, Dennis M.] EMD Serono Inc, Rockland, MA USA",United Biosource Corporation; Saint Louis University; United Biosource Corporation; Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.,"Guo, S (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",Shien.Guo@unitedbiosource.com,,,,,,,39,21,25,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,1,,,,,39,53,,10.2165/00019053-200927010-00005,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,420EZ,19178123.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000264273000005,0

It means that the applicability and the ability of interpretation of the B-S option pricing model based on the constant variance assumption have been challenged unprecedented. To this end, this paper built on the basis of transilient variance pricing model seeks to examine the pricing of American options and its applications in the pricing of corporate debt value and in the measure of the probability of corporate debt default. According to the derivation of theoretical model and the results of numerical simulation, we get the following conclusions. Firstly, the constant variance model which neglects the transilient risk of firm will result in the underestimate of the probability of debt default. As the asset value of firm declines, the greater the jump of risk is, the greater the underestimate of the probability of debt default is. Secondly, in the transilient variance model, if the corporate asset value declines along with transilient risk, the probability of corporate debt default will jump greatly. Combined with the financial and market data of relevant agencies, we find that if the variance of asset returns jumps suddenly, the probabilities of debt default will increase greatly. Thirdly, as the rise of risk-free rate of return, the probability of corporate debt default will decline. This result indicates that if the government cut base interest rates, the interests of creditors may be damaged. In the transilient variance model, the rise of risk-free rate of return will reduce the jump of the probability of debt default induced by the rise of risk. The risk-sensitive coefficient of the probability of corporate debt default has a negative relation with the risk-free rate of return.","Nankai Univ, Res Ctr Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,,xiaofei90@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,231,238,,,,,,8,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600038,0

Its prevalence spans the globe, with greater distribution in fair skinned individuals and the immunocompromised. With high prevalence, increasing incidence and the risk of transformation to a cancerous lesion, prevention and timely treatment present opportunities to rein in costs. The purpose of this article is to review published economic studies relating to the treatment of actinic keratosis, to summarize results discussing the cost drivers of current treatment modalities and to identify parameters most likely to influence the cost effectiveness of treatment. We systematically conducted a published literature search for pharmacoeconomic research of actinic keratosis using title, abstract or full-text searches with the following search terms ([actinic OR solar] AND (keratosis OR keratoses]) AND (economic OR cost OR pharmacoeconomics OR decision). We included published articles referencing actinic keratosis in a standalone study or in a broader study referencing non-melanoma skin cancer and articles evaluating cost-of-illness, cost-of-treatment, cost minimization, cost effectiveness, cost utility, cost-benefit analysis and cost consequence. Our review of the literature found nine studies devoted to pharmacoeconomic considerations of actinic keratosis treatments, with one article investigating both cost-of-illness and cost-of-treatment, two measuring cost-of-illness, two evaluating cost-of-treatment, one focusing on cost minimization, and three focusing on cost effectiveness. The literature compared a broad range of actinic keratosis treatments including topical medications, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, excision and a combination of treatment modalities. The direct cost of actinic keratosis management in the US was estimated at $US1.2billion per year, with indirect costs totalling $US295 million (year 2004 values). The primary drivers of cost were physician off-ice visits and associated procedures. Pharmacoeconomic research defining standards, outcomes and areas of efficiencies in the treatment of actinic keratosis is in its infancy. To move towards more comprehensive analysis, research needs to focus on updating epidemiological data, evolving evidence-based standards, delineating cost drivers in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations, and on health outcomes.","[Neidecker, Marjorie V.; Davis-Ajami, Mary Lynn; Balkrishnan, Rajesh] Ohio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Div Pharm Practice & Adm, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Balkrishnan, Rajesh] Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Serv Management & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Ctr Dermatol Res, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ctr Dermatol Res, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Ctr Dermatol Res, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University,"Feldman, SR (通讯作者)，WFU Dermatol, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",sfeldman@wfubmc.edu,"Neidecker, Marjorie Vermeulen/B-7961-2012; Feldman, Steven R./AAH-6971-2021; Balkrishnan, Rajesh/L-4015-2019","Feldman, Steven R./0000-0002-0090-6289; Neidecker, Marjorie/0000-0001-9566-4683; Davis-Ajami, Mary Lynn/0000-0002-4974-1796",Galderma Laboratories,Galderma Laboratories,"We wish to thank Sudeep Karve, PhD, Ohio State University College of Pharmacy, for his assistance with 2005 NAMCS data.

In this way, they, can obtain rising investment income while reducing the investment risk. However, through large amounts of data to understand the huge and complicated information of the operating performance of the listed companies is a very troublesome thing. Principal component analysis, which is a method of multi-attribute decision making and comprehensive evaluation, can solve this problem. It can change huge information into several straightforward indexes to help people make choice rapidly.

In present research, most of scholars paid their attention on the scale, development trends of service outsourcing, and analyzed the reasons of it from the point of view of cost, income and the competitiveness of enterprises. So, this paper analyzed the influencing factors of service outsourcing from the angle of the external environment and internal mechanism. We selected typical contract states- the United States, and the main contractor countries- China as research objects, made empirical research on the outside and internal factors of service outsourcing on the basis of time-series data by the multiple regression analysis which are econometric approaches and obtained the result of that which influencing factors were significant on the service outsourcing.

It is shown that, under such circumstances, the standard moment conditions used by these estimators are invalid - a result that holds for any lag length of the instruments used. Transforming the data in terms of deviations from time-specific averages helps to reduce the asymptotic bias of the estimators, unless the factor loadings have mean zero. The finite sample behaviour of IV and GMM estimators is investigated by means of Monte Carlo experiments. The results suggest that the bias of these estimators can be severe to the extent that the standard fixed effects estimator is not generally inferior anymore in terms of root median square error. Time-specific demeaning alleviates the problem, although the effectiveness of this transformation decreases when the variance of the factor loadings is large.","[Sarafidis, Vasilis] Univ Sydney, Discipline Econometr & Business Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Robertson, Donald] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ & Polit, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England",University of Sydney; University of Cambridge,"Sarafidis, V (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Discipline Econometr & Business Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",v.sarafidis@econ.usyd.edu.au; donald.robertson@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,ESRC [PTA-030-2002-00328],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper has benefited substantially from the comments and suggestions of two anonymous referees and a Co-Editor, Frank Windmeijer.

One main reason which causes the issues above is that there is no effective risk management mechanism for civil engineering projects. As there are so many stakeholders and so complex principal-agent relationships, it is not enough to rely on project management by project manager.

Resource constraints are even more noticeable in Asia than in other regions, with a comparatively greater speed of population aging and the development of health security systems. The healthcare industry and policy makers in Asia generally understand that rationing in healthcare delivery is inevitable and have come to accept health technology assessment (HTA) as a policy option. The HTA policy framework is slowly penetrating Asia; South Korea was the first country to regulate the use of pharmacoeconomic evidence in drug reimbursement decision making. The South Korean HTA policy was initially a Surprise in Asia in that the policy was suddenly introduced with a short period of preparation, but industry, researchers and policy makers both in-and outside Of South Korea have come to accept it as necessary and logical. Thailand and Taiwan have also taken steps towards using pharmacoeconomic evidence in HTA, while other Asian Countries are planning to implement Such policies. However, it could be some time before a legitimate pharmacoeconomic-based HTA policy is actually implemented in each Country, and the Course of action will vary depending on the policy Culture, healthcare system and public trust in bureaucracy of each country.","Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul 110799, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Yang, BM (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 28 Yungun Dong, Seoul 110799, South Korea.",bmyang@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,28,33,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,11,,,,,891,901,,10.2165/11310280-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,539QM,19888790.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273272300002,0

Being proactive while faced up with risks and uncertainties, the entrepreneurs accept the calculated risks rather than passively take the sufferings of the risks. Thus, proactive risk handling is more pertinent than risk taking for being a dimension of entrepreneurial orientation. In this paper, we briefly explain the definition and constructs of proactive risk handling, and its operationalization. Besides, by taking case study as the research method, we present the empirical findings on the behaviour of proactive risk handling compared between the enterprises in Hebei, China and Flanders, Belgium.

The criterion is that of maximizing exponential utility. Solving the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation yields that the optimal retention level keeps a constant amount of claims regardless of time and the company's wealth level. A special feature of our construction is to allow for dependencies of the risk reserves in different business lines. Dependence is modeled via an Archimedean Levy copula. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition for an Archimedean Levy generator to create a multidimensional positive Levy copula in arbitrary dimension. Based on these results we identify structure conditions for the generator and the Levy measure of an Archimedean Levy copula under which an insurance company reinsures a larger fraction of claims from one business line than from another.

Our results suggest that Medicare is important for understanding retirement behavior, and that uncertainty and saving are both important for understanding the labor supply responses to Medicare. Half the value placed by a typical worker on his employer-provided health insurance is the value of reduced medical expense risk. Raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 leads individuals to work an additional 0.074 years over ages 60-69.

Evidence From a Tax Audit Experiment in Denmark,ECONOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tax evasion; field experiment; tax enforcement,EVASION,"This paper analyzes a tax enforcement field experiment in Denmark. In the base year, a stratified and representative sample of over 40,000 individual income tax filers was selected for the experiment. Half of the tax filers were randomly selected to be thoroughly audited, while the rest were deliberately not audited. The following year, threat-of-audit letters were randomly assigned and sent to tax filers in both groups. We present three main empirical findings. First, using baseline audit data, we find that the tax evasion rate is close to zero for income subject to third-party reporting, but substantial for self-reported income. Since most income is subject to third-party reporting, the overall evasion rate is modest. Second, using quasi-experimental variation created by large kinks in the income tax schedule, we find that marginal tax rates have a positive impact on tax evasion for self-reported income, but that this effect is small in comparison to legal avoidance and behavioral responses. Third, using the randomization of enforcement, we find that prior audits and threat-of-audit letters have significant effects on self-reported income, but no effect on third-party reported income. All these empirical results can be explained by extending the standard model of (rational) tax evasion to allow for the key distinction between self-reported and third-party reported income.","[Kleven, Henrik Jacobsen] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ & STICERD, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Knudsen, Martin B.; Pedersen, Soren] Danish Inland Revenue, DK-1402 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Kreiner, Claus Thustrup] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Econ, DK-1455 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Copenhagen; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Kleven, HJ (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ & STICERD, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",H.J.kleven@lse.ac.uk; martin.knudsen@skat.dk; claus.thustrup.kreiner@econ.ku.dk; Soren.Pedersen@skat.dk; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Kreiner, Claus Thustrup/0000-0001-6421-492X",ESRC [RES-000-22-3241]; NSF [SES-0850631]; Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G027072/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G027072/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank a co-editor, Alan Auerbach, Oriana Bandiera, Richard Blundell, Raj Chetty, John Friedman, William Gentry, Kare P.

Equilibrium distribution can be symmetrized under milder conditions than in the case of additive games.

With this aim in mind, this paper presents a method (MSL-MC) to price exotic options using multi-dimensional SDEs (e. g. stochastic volatility models). Usually, it is the weak convergence property of numerical discretizations that is most important, because, in financial applications, one is mostly concerned with the accurate estimation of expected payoffs. However, in the recently developed Multilevel Monte Carlo path simulation method (ML-MC), the strong convergence property plays a crucial role. We present a modification to the ML-MC algorithm that can be used to achieve better savings. To illustrate these, various examples of exotic options are given using a wide variety of payoffs, stochastic volatility models and the new Multischeme Multilevel Monte Carlo method (MSL-MC). For standard payoffs, both European and Digital options are presented. Examples are also given for complex payoffs, such as combinations of European options (Butterfly Spread, Strip and Strap options). Finally, for path-dependent payoffs, both Asian and Variance Swap options are demonstrated. This research shows how the use of stochastic volatility models and the theta scheme can improve the convergence of the MSL-MC so that the computational cost to achieve an accuracy of O(epsilon) is reduced from O(epsilon(-3)) to O(epsilon(-2)) for a payoff under global and non-global Lipschitz conditions.","Univ Oxford, Inst Math, Oxford OX1 3LB, England",University of Oxford,"Abe, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Inst Math, 24-29 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LB, England.",klaus.schmitz@gmail.com,,"Schmitz-Abe, Klaus E./0000-0002-7242-8861",,,,,13,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Typically, the evidence submitted by the manufacturer comes from one short-term randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating improvement in overall survival and/or in delay of disease progression, and these are the pre-eminent drivers of cost effectiveness. We draw attention to key issues encountered in assessing the quality and rigour of the manufacturers' modelling of overall survival and disase progression. Our examples are two recent STAs: sorafenib (Nexavar) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and azacitidine (Vidaza) for higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The choice of parametric model had a large effect on the predicted treatment-dependent survival gain. Logarithmic models (log-Normal and log-logistic) delivered double the survival advantage that was derived from Weibull models. Both submissions selected the logarithmic fits for their base-case economic analyses and justified selection solely on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores. AIC scores in the azacitidine submission failed to match the choice of the log-logistic over lAieibull or exponential models, and the modelled survival in the intervention arm lacked face validity. AIC scores for sorafenib models favoured log-Normal fits; however, since there is no statistical method for comparing AIC scores, and differences may be trivial, it is generally advised that the plausibility of competing models should be tested against external data and explored in diagnostic plots. Function fitting to observed data should not be a mechanical process validated by a single crude indicator (AIC). Projective models should show clear plausibility for the patients concerned and should be consistent with other published information. Multiple rather than single parametric functions should be explored and tested with diagnostic plots.

We searched PubMed, EconLit and Web of Knowledge for articles on RP. We reviewed studies that met the inclusion criteria established in the search strategy. From a total of 468 references, we selected the 35 that met all of the inclusion criteria. Some common themes emerged in the literature. The first was that RP was generally associated with a decrease in the prices of the drugs subject to the policy. In particular, price drops seem to have been experienced in virtually every country that implemented a generic RP (GRP) policy. A GRP policy applies only to products with expired patents and generic competition, and clusters drugs according to chemical equivalence (same form and active compound). More significant price decreases were observed in the sub-markets in which drugs were already facing generic competition prior to RP. Price drops varied widely according to the amount of generic competition and industrial strategies: brand-named drugs originally priced above RP values decreased their prices to a greater extent. A second common theme was that both therapeutic RP (TRP) and GRP have been associated with significant and consistent savings in the first years of application. A third general result is that generic market shares significantly increased whenever the firms producing brand-named drugs did not adopt one of the following strategies: lowering prices to RP values; launching new dosages and/or formulations; or marketing substitute drugs still under patent protection. Finally, concerning TRP, although more evidence is needed, studies based on a large number of patient-level observations showed no association between the RP policy and health outcomes.","[Galizzi, Matteo Maria] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ, I-25122 Brescia, Italy; [Ghislandi, Simone] Bocconi Univ, Dept Inst Anal, ECONPUBBLICA, Milan, Italy; [Miraldo, Marisa] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, Healthcare Management Grp, London, England",University of Brescia; Bocconi University; Imperial College London,"Galizzi, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ, Via San Faustino 74B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",galizzi@eco.unibs.it,"Miraldo, Marisa/ABF-2584-2020","Miraldo, Marisa/0000-0002-5772-7740",,,,,44,57,60,0,31,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,1,,,,,17,33,,10.2165/11537860-000000000-00000,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,708FN,21142276.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286347800002,0

To achieve this, health-state descriptions can be combined with a value set that reflects the valuations of the target population. In the decision-utility approach, such a value set is at least partly based on wants and expectations regarding given health states. This may reflect aspects different from the health state experienced and valued by a respondent. Objectives: To derive a value set that is completely based on experienced health states, emphasising the patient's perspective, and test its predictive performance in comparison with established approaches. Methods: Problem descriptions and rating scale valuations of the EQ-5D were drawn from two representative German population surveys in 2006 and 2007. Two models based on given health states but differing in valuation method (la, b) were analysed, along with three models based on experienced health states: (2) ordinary least squares regression; (3) scale-transformed regression; and (4) a generalized linear model with binomial error distribution and constraint parameter estimation. The models were compared with respect to issues in specification, and accuracy in predicting the actual valuations of experienced health states in a new data set, using correlation, mean error and ranking measures for the latter. In addition, the impact of standardizing experience-based index models for age and sex of the subjects was investigated. Results: Models I (a, b), 2 and 3 partly led to plausible and comparable parameter estimates, but also led to problems of insignificance and inconsistencies in some of the estimates. Model 4 achieved consistency and featured partly equivalent and partly better predictive accuracy. Using this model, mean valuations of health states were much better predicted by the experience-based approach than by the decision-utility approach, especially for health states that frequently (>10) occurred in the population sample. Standardizing the experience-based index models for age and sex further improved predictive accuracy and strengthened the position of model 4. Conclusions: A value set for the EQ-5D can be plausibly estimated from experience-based valuations. The approach offers an alternative to decision makers who prefer experience-based valuation over decision utilities in the measurement of health outcome. Although usefulness in population samples was shown, use in a clinical context will first require indication-specific tests. Current limitations include use in a general population only, and a restricted range of health states covered.","[Leidl, Reiner; Reitmeir, Peter] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany; [Leidl, Reiner] Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Munich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich,"Leidl, R (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Postfach 1129, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany.",Leidl@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Leidl, Reiner/GQY-7389-2022; Leidl, Reiner M/B-7209-2009","Leidl, Reiner M/0000-0002-7115-7510",,,,,32,56,61,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,6,,,,,521,534,,10.2165/11538380-000000000-00000,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,776BI,21247225.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291509100006,0

We consider a specific type of equity-linked insurance product with guaranteed minimum maturity benefits (GMMBs), and assume that the underlying equity follows the stochastic volatility model which allows the return's latent volatility component to be short- or long-memory. The explicit form of the quantile reserve or the Value at Risk and its confidence intervals are derived for both the long-memory and short-memory stochastic volatility models. To illustrate the effect of long-memory volatility, we use the S&P 500 index as an example of linked equity. Simulation studies are performed to examine the accuracy of the quantile reserve and to demonstrate the consequence of low coverage probability if model misspecification takes place. The empirical results show that the confidence interval of quantile reserve could be severely underestimated if the long-memory effect in equity volatility is ignored.","[Ho, Hwai-Chung] Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Ho, Hwai-Chung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Yang, Sharon S.] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Finance, Tao Yuan 320, Taiwan; [Liu, Fang-I] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 106, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; National Central University; National Taiwan University,"Ho, HC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Stat Sci, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",hcho@stat.sinica.edu.tw; syang@ncu.edu.tw; d93723006@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,58,2,2,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,669,698,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061133,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700011,0

For each of these three asymptotically normal estimators, an estimator of their asymptotic (co)variance is stated in three different situations, namely the bivariate one-parameter case, the multivariate one-parameter case and the multivariate multiparameter case. An extensive Monte Carlo study is carried out to compare the finite-sample performance of the three estimators under consideration in these three situations. In the one-parameter case, it involves up to six bivariate and four-variate copula families, and up to five levels of dependence. In the multiparameter case, attention is restricted to trivariate and four-variate normal and t copulas. The maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator appears as the best choice in terms of mean square error in all situations except for small and weakly dependent samples. It is followed by the method-of-moment estimator based on Kendall's tau, which overall appears to be significantly better than its analogue based on Spearman's rho. The simulation results are complemented by asymptotic relative efficiency calculations. The numerical computation of Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau and their derivatives in the case of copula families for which explicit expressions are not available is also investigated.

Although some of these predictions have been met with reasonable success in the field, experimental data have generally not provided results close to the theoretical predictions. In a striking study, Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2008) presented evidence that potentially resolves this puzzle: both amateur and professional soccer players play nearly exact minimax strategies in laboratory experiments. In this paper, we establish important bounds on these results by examining the behavior of four distinct subject pools: college students, bridge professionals, world-class poker players, who have vast experience with high-stakes randomization in card games, and American professional soccer players. In contrast to Palacios-Huerta and Volij's results, we find little evidence that real-world experience transfers to the lab in these games-indeed, similar to previous experimental results, all four subject pools provide choices that are generally not close to minimax predictions. We use two additional pieces of evidence to explore why professionals do not perform well in the lab: (i) complementary experimental treatments that pit professionals against preprogrammed computers and (ii) post-experiment questionnaires. The most likely explanation is that these professionals are unable to transfer their skills at randomization from the familiar context of the field to the unfamiliar context of the lab.","[Levitt, Steven D.; List, John A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Reiley, David H.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Chicago; University of Arizona,"Levitt, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",slevitt@uchicago.edu; jlist@uchicago.edu; reily@eller.arizona.edu,,"List, John/0000-0002-1740-3848",,,,,31,42,46,0,42,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JUL,2010,78.0,4,,,,,1413,1434,,10.3982/ECTA7405,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,640OX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281062000007,0

Under the E-CEV model, we study the optimal investment strategy before and after retirement in a defined contribution pension plan where benefits are paid by annuity. By applying the Legendre transform, dual theory and an asymptotic expansion approach, we respectively derive two asymptotic strategies for a CRRA and CARA utility functions in two different periods. Furthermore, we find that each asymptotic strategy can be decomposed into an optimal zero-order strategy and a perturbation strategy. The optimal zero-order strategy denotes an investment strategy where the current volatility is just equal to the mean level of the volatility, whereas the perturbation strategy provides an approximation solution to hedge the slow varying nature of the current volatility deviating from mean level. Finally, we find that the optimal zero-order strategy under given conditions will reduce to the results of Devolder et al. (2003), Xiao et al. (2007) and Gao (2009), respectively.

It is subjectively rational to choose f rather than g if and only if the minimal expected utility of f (with respect to all priors in the set) is at least as high as that of g.

We first present an empirical analysis that motivates the theoretical analysis which follows. The theoretical analysis considers a simple two-state, first-order Markov chain model without covariates in which both transition probabilities are heterogeneous. Using such a model we are able to derive exact small sample results for bias and mean squared error (MSE). We discuss the maximum likelihood approach and derive two novel estimators. The first is a bias corrected version of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) although the second, which we term MIMSE, minimizes the integrated mean square error. The MIMSE estimator is always well defined, has a closed-form expression and inherits the desirable large sample properties of the MLE. Our main finding is that in almost all short panel contexts the MIMSE significantly outperforms the other two estimators in terms of MSE. A final section extends the MIMSE estimator to allow for exogenous covariates.","[Browning, Martin] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Carro, Jesus M.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain",University of Oxford; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Browning, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",Martin.Browning@economics.ox.ac.uk; jcarro@eco.uc3m.es,"Carro, Jesus M./D-3363-2009; Browning, Martin J/G-2824-2014","Carro, Jesus M./0000-0003-2952-7319;",EU [HPRN-CT-2002-00235]; Danish National Research Foundation,EU(European Union (EU)); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"The authors thank two referees, the editor, Manuel Arellano, Bo Honore, Thierry Magnac, Enrique Sentana and participants in the CAM workshop on 'Limited dependent variable models' in July 2004, the 12th Conference on Panel Data in Copenhagen, a CEMFI seminar, and a seminar at Universidad de Alicante for helpful comments and discussion.

However, the pricing procedure is more sophisticated when the model includes such specifications. The purpose of our study is to deal with the complicated pricing procedure by utilizing the concept of the moment-generating function and then to derive the closed-form solution of a defaultable bond. Furthermore, we provide an example to illustrate the application of our model and conduct sensitivity analyses of the bond value for changes in the parameters of our model.

Alternating decision tree (ADT), which is implemented with Logitboost, was chosen as the underlying algorithm. One of the strengths of our approach is that the algorithm is able to select the best combination of rules derived from well-known technical analysis indicators and is also able to select the best parameters of the technical indicators. Additionally, the online learning layer combines the output of several ADTs and suggests a short or long position. Finally, the risk management layer can validate the trading signal when it exceeds a specified non-zero threshold and limit the application of our trading strategy when it is not profitable. We test the expert weighting algorithm with data of 100 randomly selected companies of the SP 500 index during the period 2003-2005. We find that this algorithm generates abnormal returns during the test period. Our experiments show that the boosting approach is able to improve the predictive capacity when indicators are combined and aggregated as a single predictor. Even more, the combination of indicators of different stocks demonstrated to be adequate in order to reduce the use of computational resources, and still maintain an adequate predictive capacity.","[Creamer, German] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica, Lima, Peru; [Freund, Yoav] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Creamer, G (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica, Lima, Peru.",gcreamer@pucp.edu.pe; yfreud@cs.ucsd.edu,"Creamer, Germán G/B-8794-2012","freund, yoav/0000-0002-3850-6184",,,,,68,34,39,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In particular, it is almost certainly the case that the demand for real-world evidence will drive increased demand for CER analyses of observational data Although a great deal of progress has been made in the development and application of statistical methods for the analysis of observational data, the ordinary least squares multiple regression model remains, by far, the most widely applied multivariate analysis tool. This article begins with a brief review of the interpretation of treatment effects captured through the use of dummy variables in multiple regression models. This review makes clear just how limited this typical estimator of treatment effect is. Structural equation and decomposition methods for CER analyses of observational data are then reviewed Although these methods have not been commonly used for outcomes research, they offer the opportunity to extract significantly more information regarding treatment effects than the standard dummy variable approach. I have attempted to make the point that traditional dummy variable methods in regression models provide an extremely limited estimate of treatment effects. Structural equation models and decomposition methods provide considerably more information about treatment effects in particular, the ability to identify how outcomes may vary differentially with respect to patient characteristics and other factors for alternative treatment cohorts. Such an understanding is fundamental to deciphering the heterogeneity of treatment response among patient subpopulations. Structural equation and decomposition methods may be further enhanced by incorporating propensity score matching prior to the analysis On the other hand, researchers should be wary of the potential pitfalls associated with parametric sample selection bias models. Although tests for selection bias and other forms of endogeneity are an excellent research practice, it is entirely possible that attempts to correct for endogeneity may introduce more bias than they remove. Nonparametric methods, such as differences in differences, while making strong assumptions of their own, avoid the need to identify instrumental variables that are correlated with treatment selection but uncorrelated with residuals in the outcome equation.","[Crown, William H.] i3 Innovus, Waltham, MA USA; [Crown, William H.] Ctr Comparat Effectiveness Res, LewinGrp, Falls Church, VA USA",i3 Innovus; Optum; Lewin Group,"Crown, WH (通讯作者)，i3 Innovus, Waltham, MA USA.",bill.crown@i3innovus.com,,,,,,,42,7,10,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,10,,,SI,,947,955,,10.2165/11537750-000000000-00000,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,660UX,20831303.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000282673000018,0

A new algorithm is designed to dynamically select the proper time window to handle concept drift, and then a dynamic classifier selection method is used to build a combined model. With totally 642 samples from Chinese listed companies, which include ST companies from 2001 to 2008 and their paired non-ST companies, the empirical study is carried out by simulating the process of time passage. The results indicate that slip time window and multiple SVMs method can effectively adapt the financial distress concept drift. This combined model is significantly better than the single model build on the adaptive time window, and they are both better than static models.","[Han Jian-guang; Hui Xiao-feng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Sun Jie] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Business, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Zhejiang Normal University,"Han, JG (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,"Hui, XIAO/GZH-2322-2022; Sun, Jie/AAE-8538-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [(70773028), (70801054)]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (70773028) (70801054),,25,3,3,2,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,148,155,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100020,0

This review summarizes the cost effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis regimens for THR and TKR. We searched MEDLINE (January 1997 to October 2009), EMBASE (January 1997 to June 2009) and the UK NHS Economic Evaluation Database (1997 to October 2009). We analysed recent cost-effectiveness studies examining five categories of comparisons: (i) anticoagulants (warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux) versus acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin); (ii) LMWH versus warfarin; (iii) fondaparinux versus LMWH; (iv) comparisons with new oral anticoagulants; and (v) extended-duration (>= 3 weeks) versus short-duration (<3 weeks) prophylaxis. We abstracted information on cost and effectiveness for each prophylaxis regimen in order to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Because of variations in effectiveness units reported and horizon length analysed, we calculated two cost-effectiveness ratios, one for the number of symptomatic VTE events avoided at 90 days and the other for QALYs at the 1-year mark or beyond. Our search identified 33 studies with 67 comparisons. After standardization, comparisons between LMWH and warfarin were inconclusive, whereas fondaparinux dominated LMWH in nearly every comparison. The latter results were derived from radiographic VTE rates. Extended-duration prophylaxis after THR was generally cost effective. Small numbers prohibit conclusions about aspirin, new oral anticoagulants or extended-duration prophylaxis after TKR. Fondaparinux after both THR and TKR and extended-duration LMWH after THR appear to be cost-effective prophylaxis regimens. Small numbers for other comparisons and absence of trials reporting symptomatic endpoints prohibit comprehensive conclusions.","[Kapoor, Alok; Radhakrishnan, Nila] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Hosp Med Unit, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Chuang, Warren] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Hospitalist Med Grp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Smith, Kenneth J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Sect Decis Sci & Clin Syst Modelling, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Berlowitz, Dan] Edith Nourse Rogers Mem Vet Adm Hosp, Ctr Hlth Qual Outcomes & Econ Res, Bedford, MA 01730 USA; [Berlowitz, Dan] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Segal, Jodi B.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.; Losina, Elena] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Orthopaed & Arthrit Ctr Outcomes Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Losina, Elena] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Boston University; Johns Hopkins University; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Boston University,"Kapoor, A (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Med, Hosp Med Unit, Boston, MA 02118 USA.",alok.kapoor@bmc.org,,"Losina, ELENA/0000-0002-3424-0892; Kapoor, Alok/0000-0003-1300-7124; Berlowitz, Dan/0000-0002-8783-5611; Smith, Kenneth J/0000-0001-8088-566X","NIAMS NIH HHS [P60 AR047782, K24 AR057827-03, K24 AR002123, K24 AR002123-10, P60 AR047782-10, K24 AR057827] Funding Source: Medline",NIAMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)),,,73,27,28,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2010,28.0,7,,,,,521,538,,10.2165/11535210-000000000-00000,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,626SL,20550220.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000279987100001,0

A high rebalancing frequency reduces the portfolio performance in the presence of transaction costs, whereas a low rebalancing frequency entails a static investment strategy that hardly reacts to changing market conditions. This article studies a family of portfolio problems in a Black-Scholes type economy which depend parametrically on the rebalancing frequency. As an objective criterion we use log-utility, which has strong theoretical appeal and represents a natural choice if the primary goal is long-term performance. We argue that continuous rebalancing only slightly outperforms discrete rebalancing if there are no transaction costs and if the rebalancing intervals are shorter than about one year. Our analysis also reveals that diversification has a dual effect on the mean and variance of the portfolio growth rate as well as on their sensitivities with respect to the rebalancing frequency.","[Kuhn, Daniel] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Luenberger, David G.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Imperial College London; Stanford University,"Kuhn, D (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England.",dkuhn@doc.ic.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,20,25,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Furthermore, in the phase III TITAN trial (TMC114-C214), DRV/r 600/100 mg bid-based HAART generated a superior 48-week virological response rate compared with standard-of-care lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r; 400/100 mg bid)-based therapy in treatment-experienced, lopinavir-naive patients, and in particular those with one or more International AIDS Society - USA (IAS-USA) primary PI resistance-associated mutations at baseline. These patients had a broader degree of previous PI use/failure (0->= 2) than the POWER patients. Objectives: To determine whether DRV/r 600/100 mg bid-based HAART is cost effective compared with LPV/r-based therapy, from the perspective of Belgian, Italian, Swedish and UK reimbursement authorities, when used in treatment-experienced patients similar to TITAN patients with one or more IAS-USA primary PI mutations at baseline. Methods: An existing Markov model containing health states defined by CD4 cell count ranges (>500, 351-500, 201-350, 101-200, 51-100 and 0-50 cells/mm(3)) and an absorbing state of death was adapted for use in the above-mentioned healthcare settings. Baseline demographics, CD4 cell count distribution, antiretroviral drug usage, virological/immunological response rates and matching transition probabilities were based on data collected during the first 48 weeks of therapy in the modelled subgroup of TITAN patients and the published literature. After treatment failure, patients were assumed to switch to a follow-on combination regimen. For each health state, utility values and mortality rates were obtained from the published literature. Data from local observational studies (Belgium. Sweden and Italy) or the published literature (UK) were used to determine resource-use patterns and costs associated with each CD4 cell count range. Unit costs were derived from official local sources; a lifetime horizon was taken and discount rates were chosen based on local guidelines. Results: The base-case analysis predicted quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains of 0.785 in Belgium, 0.608 in Italy, 0.584 in Sweden and 0.550 in the UK when DRV/r-based therapy was used instead of LPV/r-based treatment. The estimated base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were (sic)6964/QALY gained in Belgium, (sic)9277/QALY gained in Italy, (sic)6868 (SEK69 687)/QALY gained in Sweden and (sic)14 778 (12 pound 612)/QALY gained in the UK. Assuming a threshold of (sic)30 000/QALY mined, DRV/r-based therapy remained cost effective over most parameter ranges tested in extensive one-way sensitivity analyses. The variation of immunological response rates and the time horizon were identified as important drivers of cost effectiveness. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a greater than 70% probability of achieving an ICER below this threshold in all four healthcare settings. Conclusion: From the perspective of Belgian, Italian, Swedish and UK payers, DRV/r 600/100 mg bid-based HAART is predicted to be cost effective compared with LPV/r 400/100 mg bid-based therapy, when used to manage treatment experienced, lopinavir-naive, PI-resistant, HIV-infected adults with a broad range of previous PI use/failure.","[Moeremans, Karen] IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ Outcomes Res, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Hemmett, Lindsay] Tibotec, Buckingham, England; [Hjelmgren, Jonas] Janssen Cilag AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Allegri, Gabriele] Janssen Cilag SpA, Cologno Monzese, Italy; [Smets, Erik] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Serv LLC, Mechelen, Belgium",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson,"Moeremans, K (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ Outcomes Res, Crayerstr 6, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",KMoeremans@be.imshealth.com,,,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Johnson Johnson,Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Services; Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA),"The authors wish to thank Tony Vangeneugden, Ben Van Baelen, Els De Paepe, Main Smits, Eric Lefebvre, Sabrina Spinosa-Guzman, Frank Tomaka, Piet De Doncker and the rest of the darunavir study team (Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, Mechelen, Belgium) for their contributions in generating and analyzing the TITAN-specific efficacy data included in this analysis.

We start with analysis of the expected execution times for the EUR/USD orders submitted at varying market depth. Then we introduce a loss function that accounts for the market volatility risk and the order's P/L in respect to the market best price. This loss function can be optimized for given risk aversion.

We then analyse the case where the firms have stochastic default intensities driven by a common factor, which can be viewed as another extreme from the independent case. This involves the numerical solution of a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs.

In this model, the risk-free asset market plays a central role by allowing non-stockholders (with low EIS) to smooth the fluctuations in their labor income. This process concentrates non-stockholders' labor income risk among a small group of stockholders, who then demand a high premium for bearing the aggregate equity risk. Furthermore, this mechanism is consistent with the very small share of aggregate wealth held by non-stockholders in the U.S. data, which has proved problematic for previous models with limited participation. I show that this large wealth inequality is also important for the model's ability to generate a countercyclical equity premium. When it comes to business cycle performance, the model's progress has been more limited: consumption is still too volatile compared to the data, whereas investment is still too smooth. These are important areas for potential improvement in this framework.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, S Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Guvenen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-101 Hanson Hall,1925 4th St, S Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",guvenen@umn.edu,"Guvenen, Fatih/GSN-2353-2022",,National Science Foundation [SES-0351001],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"For helpful conversations and comments, I thank Daron Acemoglu, John Campbell, V.

At a QRE, all joint moves have non-zero probability. However in mixed scenarios, where some players use quantal response and some use best response, equilibrium strategy profiles can have joint moves with zero probability. This raises the question of applying the trembling hand refinement to such mixed scenarios. To address this I first show how to reformulate the QRE as a best response equilibrium where expected utilities are replaced by more general objective functions. I then show that under this reformulation the two popular types of trembling hand perfection can differ when some players use quantal response and some use best response. I end by showing that one of those types of trembling hand perfection cannot be used to remove certain troubling kinds of equilibrium in such mixed scenarios, while the other type can. The conclusion is that only the one type of trembling hand perfection should be applied when we allow some players to be quantal response and some to be best response.","NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center,"Wolpert, DH (通讯作者)，NASA, Ames Res Ctr, MS 269-1, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",david.h.wolpert@nasa.gov,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

(i) uncertainty as to whether or not a linear deterministic trend is present in the data and (ii) uncertainty its to whether the initial condition of the process is (asymptotically) negligible or not. In each case simple testing procedures are proposed with the aim of maintaining good power properties across Such uncertainties. For the first issue, if the initial condition is negligible, quasi-differenced (QD) detrended (demeaned) Dickey-Fuller-type unit root tests are near asymptotically efficient when a deterministic trend is (is not) present in the data generating process. Consequently. we compare a variety of strategies thin aim to select the detrended variant when a trend is present, and the demeaned variant otherwise. Based on asymptotic and finite-sample evidence, we recommend a simple union of rejections-based decision rule whereby the unit root null hypothesis is rejected whenever either of the detrended or demeaned unit root tests yields a rejection. Our results show that this approach generally outperforms more sophisticated strategies based on auxiliary methods of trend detection. For the second issue, we again recommend a union of rejections decision rule, rejecting the unit root null if either of the QD or ordinary least squares (OLS) detrended/demeaned Dickey-Fuller-type tests rejects. This procedure is also shown to perforin well in practice, simultaneously exploiting the superior power of the QD (OLS) detrended/demeaned test for small (large) initial conditions.","[Taylor, A. M.

Many papers assume that the stock price minus the present value of future dividends or the stock price plus the forward value of future dividends follows a lognormal diffusion process; however, these assumptions might produce unreasonable prices for some exotic options and American options. It is more realistic to assume that the stock price decreases by the amount of the dividend payout at the ex-dividend date and follows a lognormal diffusion process between adjacent ex-dividend dates, but analytical pricing formulas and efficient numerical methods are hard to develop. This paper introduces a new tree, the stair tree, that faithfully implements the aforementioned dividend model without approximations. The stair tree uses extra nodes only when it needs to simulate the price jumps due to dividend payouts and return to a more economical, simple structure at all other times. Thus it is simple to construct, easy to understand, and efficient. Numerous numerical calculations confirm the stair tree's superior performance to existing methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and/or generality. Besides, the stair tree can be extended to more general cases when future dividends are completely determined by past stock prices and dividends, making the stair tree able to model sophisticated dividend processes.","[Dai, Tian-Shyr] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat & Finance Management, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; [Dai, Tian-Shyr] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Finance, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Dai, TS (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat & Finance Management, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",d88006@csie.ntu.edu.tw,,,NSC [NSC 94-2213-E-033-024],"NSC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author was supported in part by NSC Grant NSC 94-2213-E-033-024.,,30,18,18,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Recently, this motivated intensive research on non-separable structures. For instance, in Hoderlein and Mammen (2007) a non-separable model in the single equation case was considered, and it was established that in the absence of the frequently employed monotonicity assumption local average structural derivatives (LASD) are still identified. In this paper, we introduce an estimator for the LASD. The estimator we propose is based on local polynomial fitting of conditional quantiles. We derive its large sample distribution through a Bahadur representation, and give some related results, e.g. about the asymptotic behaviour of the quantile process. Moreover, we generalize the concept of LASD to include endogeneity of regressors and discuss the case of a multivariate dependent variable. We also consider identification of structured non-separable models, including single index and additive models. We discuss specification testing, as well as testing for endogeneity and for the impact of unobserved heterogeneity. We also show that fixed censoring can easily be addressed in this framework. Finally, we apply some of the concepts to demand analysis using British Consumer Data.","[Hoderlein, Stefan] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Mammen, Enno] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Brown University; University of Mannheim,"Hoderlein, S (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Robinson Hall 302C, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",stefan_hoderlein@yahoo.com; emammen@rumms.uni-mannheim.de,"Mammen, Enno/A-1552-2014","Mammen, Enno/0000-0001-7348-5588",Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg 'Eliteforderungsprogramm,Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg 'Eliteforderungsprogramm,"The authors are indebted to Andrew Chesher, Joel Horowitz, Oliver Linton, Rosa Matzkin, Whitney Newey, Jim Powell and seminar participants at the ESWC, EMS Oslo, Bergen, Berlin, Gottingen, Frankfurt, Madrid, Mannheim, Northwestern, Strasbourg, Tubingen, and UCL/IFS for helpful comments.

Objective: To assess the cost effectiveness of four alternative treatment strategies in patients with hypertension and three or more cardiovascular risk factors in the UK (from the UK NHS perspective) or Sweden (from the societal perspective): amlodipine-based plus atorvastatin, atenolol-based plus atorvastatin, amlodipine-based alone and atenolol-based alone. Methods: Based on the trial data, a Markov model was constructed where the risk of myocardial infarction, revascularization procedures and stroke and the long-term costs, quality of life and mortality associated with these events were estimated. Transition probabilities and costs (E, year 2007 values) were based on the patient-level trial data. Outcomes were reported as life-years gained and QALYs. In the latter case, utility reduction from events was based on a substudy in ASCOT patients. Treatment was applied for the duration of the lipid-lowering arm of the trial (3 years) and patients were then followed to the end of their life. Results: Amlodipine-based therapy plus atorvastatin was the most expensive but also most effective treatment. Compared with amlodipine-based therapy alone, the cost to gain one QALY was (sic)11965 in the UK and (sic)8591 in Sweden. The incremental cost effectiveness of amlodipine-based therapy compared with atenolol-based therapy was (sic)9548 and (sic)3965 per QALY gained in the UK and Sweden, respectively. Atenolol-based therapy plus atorvastatin was eliminated through extended dominance. Conclusion: Applying the threshold values used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, a combination of amlodipine-based therapy and atorvastatin appears to be cost effective in patients with hypertension and three or more additional risk factors.","[Lindgren, Peter] I3 Innovus, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindgren, Peter] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, S-10401 Stockholm, Sweden; [Buxton, Martin] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Kahan, Thomas] Danderyd Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Poulter, Neil R.; Sever, Peter S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Dahlof, Bjorn] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Wedel, Hans] Nord Sch Publ Hlth, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Jonsson, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",i3 Innovus; Karolinska Institutet; Brunel University; Karolinska Institutet; Danderyds Hospital; Imperial College London; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; Stockholm School of Economics,"Lindgren, P (通讯作者)，I3 Innovus, Klarabergsviadukten 90 D6, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.lindgren@i3innovus.com,"Kahan, Thomas/CAE-8515-2022; Lindgren, Peter/AID-5379-2022","Lindgren, Peter/0000-0002-8238-8189; Kahan, Thomas/0000-0001-9909-4956","Pfizer Inc., New York, USA","Pfizer Inc., New York, USA(Pfizer)","The study was supported by Pfizer Inc., New York, USA.

The MATRIX study was a large, prospective, community-based, observational US study aimed at evaluating the impact of oxybutynin transdermal system (OXY-TDS). In this paper, we report on productivity findings among working adults in MATRIX. Methods: This study enrolled 2878 adults (aged >= 18 years) with symptoms of OAB from 327 practice sites throughout the US. All subjects received OXY-TDS (3.9 mg/day up to 6 months). Baseline versus end-of-study productivity was measured using the Work Productivity Questionnaire (WPQ). The WPQ includes a subset of questions from the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and consists of four scales: (i) physical; (ii) time management; (iii) mental; and (iv) output demands. Overall productivity was measured by the work productivity index score (WPQ Index; a summary score based oil scales) and work productivity loss score (WPLS; a measure of reduced output compared with healthy workers). Psychometric performance of the WPQ instrument is also reported, since this study represents the first use of the tool. Results: Of the participants, 52% were of working age (18-65 years) and 38.6% were employed. A total of 1112 working adults participated ill MATRIX and were included in this analysis. They had a mean age of 52.4 years-, 92.2% were female and 80.9% were Caucasian. Subjects who reported that they were most affected by OAB were also most impaired at work. After OXY-TDS treatment, participants experienced significant improvements in mean scores for all four WPQ scales (p <= 0.0002) and the mean WPQ Index decreased from 8.2 to 5.5 (p < 0.0001). In addition, the WPLS decreased from 7.7% to 5.2% (p < 0.0001), indicating improvement in work function with OXY-TDS treatment. Conclusion: OAB contributes to decreased work productivity due to job interruptions as well as fatigue. OXY-TDS may result in productivity improvement when patients receive 3.9 mg/day via twice weekly patch application for tip to 6 months.","[Pizzi, Laura T.; Bunz, Thomas J.] Jefferson Sch Populat Hlth, Doris N Grandon Ctr Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Gemmen, Eric] Quintiles, Falls Church, VA USA; [Dahl, Naomi V.] Watson Labs Inc, Morristown, NJ USA; [Sand, Peter K.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Evanston Continence Ctr, Evanston, IL USA",IQVIA; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Pizzi, LT (通讯作者)，Jefferson Sch Populat Hlth, Doris N Grandon Ctr Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 1015 Walnut St,Suite 115, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",laura.pizzi@jefferson.edu,,"Dahl, Naomi/0000-0003-2904-3664",,,,,33,18,19,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,4,,,,,329,339,,10.2165/00019053-200927040-00005,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,482DM,19485428.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000268864300005,0

Alternative equity positions are typically considered separately from efficiency. One proposal seeks to integrate these two sets of societal concerns by attaching equity weights to QALYs. To date, research in pursuit of this goal has focussed on candidate equity criteria and methods for estimating such weights. It has implicitly been assumed that should legitimate, valid and reliable equity weights become available, it would be a straightforward task to incorporate them as a separate simple calculation after estimating cost per un-weighted QALY. This article suggests that, in many situations, these simple approaches to incorporating equity weights will not appropriately reflect the preferences on which the weights are based and that the appropriate incorporation of equity weights in cost-effectiveness analyses will be technically challenging. In addition to the technical challenges, there are a number of issues that arise in the movement from implicit to explicit consideration of equity. Whilst equity weights can, conceptually, be incorporated in economic evaluation, there are a number of challenges to be addressed before the results of such analyses can be considered robust and a fit basis for resource allocation decisions.","[Wailoo, Allan; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Leeds,"Wailoo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",a.j.wailoo@sheffield.ac.uk,"Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617",,,,,15,42,42,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 1311, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,12,,,,,983,989,,10.2165/11314100-000000000-00000,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,539QN,19908923.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000273272400002,0

We show that the nonstandard fixed-rho limit distributions of the t-statistic provide more accurate approximations to the finite sample distributions than the conventional large-rho limit distribution. We prove that the second-order corrected critical value based on an asymptotic expansion of the nonstandard limit distribution is also second-order correct under the large-rho asymptotics. As a further contribution, we propose a new practical procedure for selecting the test-optimal power parameter that addresses the central concern of hypothesis testing: The selected power parameter is test-optimal in the sense that it minimizes the type II error while controlling for the type I error. A plug-in procedure for implementing the test-optimal power parameter is suggested. Simulations indicate that the new test is as accurate in size as the nonstandard test of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002a, 2002b), and yet it does not incur the power loss that often hurts the performance of the latter test. The results complement recent work by Sun, Phillips, and Jin (2008) on conventional and bT HAC testing.","[Sun, Yixiao] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Phillips, Peter C.

We propose the VaR Black-Litterman model which accounts for the VaR and trading (diversification, buy-in threshold, liquidity, currency) requirements. The model takes the form of a probabilistic integer, non-convex optimization problem. We first derive a deterministic reformulation of the probabilistic problem, which, depending on the information on the probability distribution of the FoF return, is the equivalent, or a close approximation, of the original problem. We then show that the continuous relaxation of the reformulated problem is a second-order cone optimization problem for a wide range of probability distributions. Finally, we use a specialized nonlinear branch-and-bound algorithm which implements the portfolio risk branching rule to construct the optimal FoF. The practical relevance of the model and solution method is shown by their use by a financial institution for the construction of several FoFs that are now traded worldwide. The computational study attests that the proposed algorithmic technique is very efficient, outperforming, in terms of both speed and robustness, three state-of-the-art alternative solution methods and solvers.","George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Lejeune, MA (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mlejeune@gwu.edu,,"Lejeune, Miguel/0000-0001-6952-7212",,,,,43,16,19,2,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Existing importance sampling methods are based on a parametric choice of the proposal. This article proposes an algorithm that estimates the optimal proposal non-parametrically using a multivariate frequency polygon estimator. In contrast to parametric methods, non-parametric estimation allows for close approximation of the optimal proposal. Standard non-parametric importance sampling is inefficient for high-dimensional problems. We solve this issue by applying the procedure to a low-dimensional subspace, which is identified through principal component analysis and the concept of the effective dimension. The mean square error properties of the algorithm are investigated and its asymptotic optimality is shown. Quasi-Monte Carlo is used for further improvement of the method. It is easy to implement, particularly it does not require any analytical computation, and it is computationally very efficient. We demonstrate through path-dependent and multi-asset option pricing problems that the algorithm leads to significant efficiency gains compared with other algorithms in the literature.","Heidelberg Univ, Inst Appl Math, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Neddermeyer, JC (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Appl Math, Neuenheimer Feld 294, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",jc@neddermeyer.net,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DA 187/15-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I would like to thank R.

Stock returns are modelled by a stochastic differential equation with non-constant coefficients. If the drift of the stock returns depends on some process independent of the driving Brownian motion, it may not be adapted to the filtration generated by the stock prices. In such a model with partial information, due to the non-constant drift, the position in the stocks varies between extreme long and short positions making these strategies very risky when trading on a daily basis. To reduce the corresponding shortfall risk, motivated by Cuoco, He and Issaenko [Operations Research, 2008, 56, pp. 358-368.] we impose a class of risk constraints on the strategy, computed on a short horizon, and then find the optimal policy in this class. This leads to much more stable strategies that can be computed for both classical drift models, a mean reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and a continuous-time Markov chain with finitely many states. The risk constraints also reduce the influence of certain parameters that may be difficult to estimate. We provide a sensitivity analysis for the trading strategy with respect to the model parameters in the constrained and unconstrained case. The results are applied to historical stock prices.","[Sass, Joern] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Math, D-67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Putschoegl, Wolfgang] UniCredit Bank Austria AG, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Kaiserslautern; UniCredit Group,"Sass, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Math, POB 3049, D-67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",sass@mathematik.uni-kl.de,,,Austrian Science Fund FWF [P17947-N12]; German Research Foundation DFG; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P17947] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); German Research Foundation DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The authors thank the Austrian Science Fund FWF, Project P17947-N12, the German Research Foundation DFG, Heisenberg Programme, for financial support, and two anonymous referees for their stimulating comments and suggestions.

Our results suggest that the fair premiums range from 0.2041% to 0.2436% under the 1999-2002 scheme and from 0.1388% to 0.1521% under the 2003-2009 scheme for various possible levels of average unemployment duration in Taiwan, and they are all lower than the current UI premium rate, 1%. This result explains in part why there is a persistent surplus in the UI program. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the fair premium rate decreases with the hazard rate of exiting from unemployment and increases with the probability of entering into unemployment. The effect of the entering probability is found to be larger than that of the exiting probability. We also provide a wide range of systematic risk coefficient (beta) values generated from three alternative methods to measure its impact on fair premium rates and find that the effect of beta on premium rates is stronger under the 1999-2002 scheme than that of the 2003-2009 scheme.","[Yu, Min-Teh] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 10673, Taiwan; [Chuang, Hwei-Lin] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Tsing Hua University,"Yu, MT (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 10673, Taiwan.",hlchuang@inx.nthu.edu.tw; mtyu@ntu.edu.tw,"Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021","Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327",,,,,41,1,1,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,519,545,,10.2143/AST.40.1.2061126,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700004,0

This allows us to propose a test whose null hypothesis is the existence of seasonal cointegration. A Monte Carlo exercise investigates the finite sample properties of this test procedure.

In this paper, we relax this assumption to the knowledge of only the mean, covariance, and support information. No additional restrictions on the type of distribution such as normality is made. The investor's utility is modeled as a piecewise-linear concave function. We derive exact and approximate optimal trading strategies for a robust (maximin) expected utility model, where the investor maximizes his worst-case expected utility over a set of ambiguous distributions. The optimal portfolios are identified using a tractable conic programming approach. Extensions of the model to capture asymmetry using partitioned statistics information and box-type uncertainty in the mean and covariance matrix are provided. Using the optimized certainty equivalent framework, we provide connections of our results with robust or ambiguous convex risk measures, in which the investor minimizes his worst-case risk under distributional ambiguity. New closed-form results for the worst-case optimized certainty equivalent risk measures and optimal portfolios are provided for two- and three-piece utility functions.

The method consists in sorting or monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true quantile curve than the original curve in finite samples, establish a functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone function, provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity restrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural distribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to estimation of structural distribution and quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran status and earnings.","[Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fernandez-Val, Ivan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Galichon, Alfred] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Chernozhukov, V (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; ivanf@bu.edu; alfred.galichon@polytechnique.edu,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016",,"National Science Foundation; Chaire X-Dauphine  Finance et Developpement Durable.; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F015879/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0752266] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0752823] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Chaire X-Dauphine  Finance et Developpement Durable.; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Previous, more extended, versions of this paper (September 2006, April 2007) are available at web.mit.edu/similar to vchern/www/ and www.ArXiv.org.

We define two nested information criteria (supermodular precision and integral precision) by combining this approach with two variability orders (dispersive and convex orders). We relate precision criteria with orderings based on the value of information to a decision maker. We then use precision to study the incentives of an auctioneer to supply private information. Using integral precision, we obtain two results: (i) a more precise signal yields a more efficient allocation; (ii) the auctioneer provides less than the efficient level of information. Supermodular precision allows us to extend the previous analysis to the case in which supplying information is costly and to obtain an additional finding; (iii) there is a complementarity between information and competition, so that both the socially efficient and the auctioneer's optimal choice of precision increase with the number of bidders.","[Ganuza, Juan-Jose] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Penalva, Jose S.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, Madrid, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Ganuza, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain.",juanjo.ganuza@upf.edu; jpenalva@emp.uc3m.es,"Penalva, Jose/K-6105-2012","Penalva, Jose/0000-0002-1793-9642","Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [SEJ2006-09993, SEJ2005-03924]; Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya; European Social Fund",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This paper was previously circulated under the title On Information and Competition in Private Value Auctions.

The testing strategy boils down to gauging the closeness between the joint and the product of the marginal stationary densities. For that purpose, we take advantage of a generalized entropic measure so as to build a whole family of nonparametric tests of independence. We derive asymptotic normality and local power using the functional delta method for kernels. As a corollary, we also develop a class of entropy-based tests for serial independence. The latter are nuisance parameter free, and hence also qualify for dynamic misspecification analyses. We then investigate the finite-sample properties of our serial independence tests through Monte Carlo simulations. They perform quite well, entailing more power against some nonlinear AR alternatives than two popular nonparametric serial-independence tests.","[Fernandes, Marcelo] Univ London, Dept Econ, London E1 4NS, England; [Neri, Breno] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of London; New York University,"Fernandes, M (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Econ, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",m.fernandes@qmul.ac.uk,,"Fernandes, Marcelo/0000-0002-4680-0439",ESRC [RES-062-23-0311],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are indebted to Yacine Ait-Sahalia, Christophe Croux, Renato Flores, Han Hong, Esfandiar Maasoumi (Editor), Marcelo Medeiros, Benedikt Potscher, four anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, the European University Institute, the 4th Spring Meeting of Young Economists ( Amsterdam, 1999), and the Coloquio Brasileiro de Matematica (Rio de Janeiro, 2001) for valuable comments.

As the economic analyses that informed these recommendations have been the subject of debate, we sought to address the potential limitations of existing models and produce estimates of donepezil treatment cost effectiveness in the UK using the most recent available data and simulation techniques. Methods: A discrete-event simulation was developed that predicts progression of Alzheimer's disease through correlated changes in cognition, behavioural disturbance and function. Patient-level data from seven randomized, placebo-controlled donepezil trials and a 7-year follow-up registry provided the basis for modeling longitudinal outcomes. Individuals in the simulation were assigned unique demographic and clinical characteristics and then followed for 10 years, with severity of disease tracked on continuous scales. Patient mix and costs were developed from UK-specific literature. Analyses were run for severity subgroups to evaluate outcomes for sub-populations with disease of mild versus moderate severity from both a healthcare payer and societal perspective. All costs are reported in pound, year 2007 values, and all outcomes are discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: Over 10 years, treatment of all patients with mild to moderate disease reduces overall direct medical costs by an average of over 2300 pound per patient. When unpaid caregiver time is also taken into consideration, savings increase to over 4700 pound per patient. Compared with untreated patients, patients receiving donepezil experience a discounted gain in QALYs averaging 0.11, with their caregivers gaining, on average, 0.01 QALYs. For the subset of patients starting treatment with more severe disease, savings are more modest, averaging about 1600 pound and 3750 pound from healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, donepezil dominated no treatment between 57% and 62% of replications when only medical costs were considered, and between 74% and 79% of replications when indirect costs were included, with results more favourable for treatment initiation in the mild versus moderate severity stages of the disease. Conclusions: Although the simulation results are not definitive, they suggest that donepezil leads to health benefits and cost savings when used to treat mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease in the UK. They also indicate that both benefits and savings may be greatest when treatment is started while patients are still in the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease.","[Getsios, Denis] United BioSource Corp, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Blume, Steve] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA; [Ishak, K.

The relationship between operational costs and passenger satisfaction has not been established neither in the definition of satisfaction based on customer perceptions nor in the studies using the definition based on specifications in operation research (OR) models. We will align the passenger requirements and cognition with the specifications used in OR models by applying the value function of prospect theory. In our paper, the reference point hypothesis of prospect theory is applied to measure the level of satisfaction for the flexible community bus problem, which can overcome the one-sidedness of traditional satisfaction evaluation either defined by specification or by user perceptions. The aim is to insert as many as unexpected passengers as possible within certain satisfaction level. The numerical results proof that the flexible route plan can insert more unexpected passengers with lower cost and higher passenger satisfaction compared with the fixed and timetabled route. It is also revealed the model has strong adaptability and can be applied in various groups by adjusting the specified satisfaction level.","[Hu Xiang-pei; Wu Li-rong; Wang Wen-juan; Liu Lin-lin] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Syst Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,104,109,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100013,0

Using the correlation analysis and mean-variance analysis, this study concludes that: in small, medium, and large-scale manufacturing enterprises, the competitive priorities show certain integrated relations with each other. With the scale becoming larger, the Trade-off relation in the integrated relation becomes subordinate relation while the cumulative relation becomes main relation in the integrated relations.

In doing so, we present a static model and a dynamic model in order to examine trust-related variables change over time as well as the dynamics of trusting belief revision. Based on plenty of extant literatures, we propose that the importance of the same antecedent of trusting belief changes at different stages of pre-purchase, post-purchase and long-term relationship commitment, and that, most important, the structure of trusting beliefs dynamically changes over time.","[Luo Han-yang] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Harbin 518055, Peoples R China; [Lin Xu-dong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Shenzhen University,"Luo, HY (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Harbin 518055, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70601016],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (70601016).,,46,0,0,1,14,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,539,545,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100075,0

These phenomena can be modelled by chaotic dynamical systems and one way to undertake a rigorous analysis is via symbolic dynamics, a mathematical-statistical technique that allows the detection of the underlying topological and metrical structures in the time series. Symbolic dynamics is a powerful tool initially developed for the investigation of discrete dynamical systems. The main idea consists in constructing a partition, that is, a finite collection of disjoint subsets whose union is the state space. By identifying each subset with a distinct symbol, we obtain sequences of symbols that correspond to each trajectory of the original system. One of the major problems in defining a good symbolic description of the corresponding time series is to obtain a generating partition, that is, the assignment of symbolic sequences to trajectories that is unique, up to a set of measure zero. Unfortunately, this is not a trivial task, and, moreover, for observed time series the notion of a generating partition is no longer well defined in the presence of noise. In this paper we apply symbolic shadowing, a deterministic algorithm using tessellations, in order to estimate a generating partition for a financial time series (PSI20) and consequently to compute its entropy. This algorithm allows producing partitions such that the symbolic sequences uniquely encode all periodic points up to some order. We compare these results with those obtained by considering the Pesin's identity, that is, the metric entropy is equal to the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents. To obtain the Lyapunov exponents, we reconstruct the state space of the PSI20 data by applying an embedding process and estimate them by using the Wolf et al. algorithm.","[Mendes, Diana A.; Ferreira, Nuno; Menezes, Rui] ISCTE IUL, Dept Quantitat Methods, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendes, Diana A.; Ferreira, Nuno; Menezes, Rui] ISCTE IUL, UNIDE, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendes, Vivaldo M.] ISCTE IUL, Dept Econom, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendes, Vivaldo M.] ISCTE IUL, UNIDE, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Mendes, DA (通讯作者)，ISCTE IUL, Dept Quantitat Methods, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",diana.mendes@iscte.pt; vivaldo.mendes@iscte.pt; nuno.ferreira@iscte.pt; rui.menezes@iscte.pt,"Aldea Mendes, Diana/A-6376-2014","Aldea Mendes, Diana/0000-0002-8391-9113; Menezes, Rui/0000-0002-7641-7019","Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia, Lisbon [PTDC/GES/73418/2006, PTDC/GES/70529/2006]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/GES/73418/2006, PTDC/GES/70529/2006] Funding Source: FCT","Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia, Lisbon; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","Financial support from the Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia, Lisbon, is grateful acknowledged by the authors, under the contracts No PTDC/GES/73418/2006 and No PTDC/GES/70529/2006.",,42,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-53852-3,,,,2010,,,,,,,227,+,,10.1007/978-4-431-53853-0_12,0.0,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Physics,BTS33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000287957900012,0

Explanatory phase III RCTs are fit for purpose; researchers make use of guidance documents produced by the US FDA to inform the design of these clinical trials Historically, without explicit FDA guidance, broad patient populations, including women and minorities, often were not considered in trial design In addition, attempts to minimize cost and maximize efficiency have led to smaller sample sizes, as is clear from the increase in 'creeping phase II-ism' To demonstrate effectiveness, RCTs must be reflective of how an intervention will be used in the healthcare market The concept of pragmatic clinical trials has emerged to describe those trials that arc designed explicitly with this need in mind Use of pragmatic trials will be most impactful if post-regulatory decision makers are engaged in the development of recommendations for trial design features, such as indicating outcomes measures and articulating patient populations of interest, which clearly express their evidence needs","[Mullins, C.

By examining 54 Chinese High-Tech industrial parks in the period of 2002-2008 and using hierarchical linear model as our analysis method, our results suggest that government incentive policy affects firms' innovation performance in a U-shaped way. Although government incentive policy has a direct impact on firms' innovation performance, firms have certain level of flexibility to adapt to the policy which leads to a U-shaped growth trend of innovation performance. Moreover, the strength of government incentive policy has a long-term effects on innovation performance in different regions.

This paper studies companies which are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange and have issued their earnings forecast during 2004-2006. The result shows that, what is taken in consideration when the manager decides to disclose information is how the stock market responds to the former information. If the management found the market has overreacted to its good news, the inclination for further release should be decreased, similarly if the market has under reacted to its bad news.

The present study considers an insurance portfolio consisting of several lines of risk which are linked by a copula and aims to evaluate not only the capital allocation for the overall portfolio but also the contribution of each risk over their aggregation. We use the tail value at risk (TVaR) as risk measure. The handy form of the FGM copula permits an exact expression for the TVaR of the sum of the risks and for the TVaR-based allocations when claim amounts are exponentially distributed and distributed as a mixture of exponentials. We first examine the bivariate model and then the multivariate case. We also show how to approximate the TVaR of the aggregate risk and the contribution of each risk when using any copula.

This work presents an application of the copula-GARCH model in the estimation of a portfolio's VaR, composed of NASDAQ and TAIEX. The empirical results show that, compared with traditional methods, the copula model captures the VaR more successfully.

In particular, they allow a break under both the null and alternative hypotheses and are invariant to the magnitude of the shift in level and/or slope. The Subsequent literature devised procedures valid in the case of an unknown break date. However, in doing so most research, in particular the commonly used test of Zivot and Andrews (1992, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 10, 251-270). assumed that if a break occurs it does so only under the alternative hypothesis of stationarity. This is undesirable for several reasons. Kim and Perron (2009, Journal of Econometrics 148, 1-13) developed a methodology that allows a break at an unknown time under both the null and alternative hypotheses. When a break is present, the limit distribution of the test is the same as in the case of a known break date, allowing, increased power while maintaining the correct size.

In particular, we focus on the valuation of insurance options with long-term equity or foreign exchange exposures. Our modeling framework extends the stochastic volatility model of Schobel and Zhu (1999) by including stochastic interest rates. Moreover, we allow all driving model factors to be instantaneously correlated with each other, i.e. we allow for a general correlation structure between the instantaneous interest rates, the volatilities and the underlying stock returns. As insurance products often incorporate long-term exposures, they are typically more sensitive to changes in the interest rates, volatility and currencies. Therefore, having the flexibility to correlate the underlying asset price with both the stochastic volatility and the stochastic interest rates, yields a realistic model which is of practical importance for the pricing and hedging of such long-term contracts. We show that European options, typically used for the calibration of the model to market prices, and forward starting options can be priced efficiently and in closed-form by means of Fourier inversion techniques. We extensively discuss the numerical implementation of these pricing formulas, allowing for a fast and accurate valuation of European and forward starting options. The model will be especially useful for the pricing and risk management of insurance contracts and other exotic derivatives involving long-term maturities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we extend the model of Naik (1993) to a multi-regime case. We present a trinomial tree method to price options in the extended model. Our results show that the trinomial tree method in this paper is an effective method; it is very fast and easy to implement.

We show that, like the classical IGARCH process, a stationary Solution with infinite variance for the integrated Markov-switching GARCH process may exist. To this purpose, an alternative condition for the existence of a strictly stationary solution of the Markov-switching GARCH process is presented, and some results obtained in Hennion (1997, Annals of Probability 25, 1545-1587) are employed.

However, insurance companies distinguish between claims with or without bodily injuries, or claims with full or partial liability of the insured driver. This paper examines an a priori ratemaking procedure when including two different types of claim. When assuming independence between claim types, the premium can be obtained by summing the premiums for each type of guarantee and is dependent on the rating factors chosen. If the independence assumption is relaxed, then it is unclear as to how the tariff system might be affected. in order to answer this question, bivariate Poisson regression models, suitable for paired count data exhibiting correlation, are introduced. It is shown that the usual independence assumption is unrealistic here. These models are applied to an automobile insurance claims database containing 80,994 contracts belonging to a Spanish insurance company.

The turbo-charged lean combustion natural gas single-fuel engines require high-energy ignition system because of its own characteristics. The high-energy ignition control circuit and the ignition trigger circuit were designed, which satisfied the high-energy ignition needs of the spark plugs. Ignition knock sensor signal conditioning circuit was used to automatically check and adjust the engine knock function in order to control the engine knock and the risk of losing fire of the engines. C language was adopted to write the procedure on the computer which was subdivided specifically as soon as possible. It was regarded as a unit to program for the function which was easy to connect the inter-face of the hardware. Through the correct selection of spark plugs and the reasonable matching, which satisfied the needs of bearing high temperature, high voltages, repeated power and high corrosion of the spark plugs?

Empirical estimation of the Mixture ACD model shows that the limitations of the standard base model and its inadequacy of modelling the behavior in the tail of the distribution are suitably solved by our model. When the weights are made dependent on some market activity data, the model lends itself to some structural interpretation related to price formation and information diffusion in the market.","[De Luca, Giovanni] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Ric Econ, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Gallo, Giampiero M.] Univ Florence, Dept Stat G Parenti, Florence, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of Florence,"De Luca, G (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dipartimento Stat & Matemat Ric Econ, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Naples, Italy.",giovanni.deluca@uniparthenope.it,"Gallo, Giampiero/X-6025-2019; Gallo, Giampiero/AAV-6118-2021","Gallo, Giampiero/0000-0003-3556-0238; De Luca, Giovanni/0000-0001-9463-006X",Italian MIUR,"Italian MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Thanks are due to Estela Bee Dagum, Silvano Bordignon, and Tommaso Proietti for their support and encouragement throughout this research project.

One test allows for a trend in the cointegration relations and the other one restricts the trend to being orthogonal to the cointegration relations. The first test is known to have reduced power relative to the second one if there is in fact no trend in the cointegration relations, whereas the second one is based on a misspecified model if the linear trend is not orthogonal to the cointegration relations. Hence, the treatment of the linear trend term is crucial for the outcome of the rank determination procedure. We compare three alternative procedures, which are applicable if there is uncertainty regarding the proper trend specification. In the first one a specific cointegrating rank is rejected if one of the two tests rejects, in the second one the trend term is decided upon by a pretest and in the third procedure only tests which allow for an unrestricted trend term are used. We provide theoretical asymptotic and small sample simulation results, which show that the first strategy is preferable in applied work.","[Demetrescu, Matei] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Luetkepohl, Helmut] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Saikkonen, Pentti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Goethe University Frankfurt; European University Institute; University of Helsinki,"Demetrescu, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Gruneburgpl 1 Postfach RuW 49, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",deme@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; helmut.luetkepohl@eui.eu; pentti.saikkonen@helsinki.fi,"Saikkonen, Pentti/ABD-8240-2020; Demetrescu, Matei/ABD-6488-2021","Demetrescu, Matei/0000-0003-0815-5384",Max Weber Fellow; European University Institute in Florence; Academy of Finland; Okobank Group Research Foundation,Max Weber Fellow; European University Institute in Florence; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Okobank Group Research Foundation,"The research for this paper was carried out while the first author was a Max Weber Fellow and the third author was a Fernand Braudel Fellow at the European University Institute in Florence.

It is shown that spurious instantaneous causality in variance will only appear in degenerated cases, but that spurious Granger causality will be more common. For forecasting volatility, it is generally advisable to aggregate forecasts of the disaggregate series rather than forecasting the aggregated series directly, and unlike for vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) processes, the advantage does not diminish for large forecast horizons. Results are derived for the distribution of multivariate realized volatility if the high-frequency process follows multivariate GARCH.

Many efforts have been done and much success has been achieved in innovation promotion in well positioned urban regions: strong R&D institutions, innovative enterprises of all sizes and innovation supporting infrastructures in public services, technology centres and business development. But this did not prevent rural regions from an ongoing brain-drain within spiral of decline: It seems that the achieved high level of knowledge transfer and competences in highly innovative urban regions does not meet the demand and potentials from rural regions. So a key question is: if triple helix structures exist in rural areas, why shouldn't they become a sparkling source of innovation? Core structures of triple helix were found sporadically - motivated and interested administrations, living communities as interface for information flow, large numbers of SME, enormous potentials of ideas to be developed and sufficient access to R&D institutions. But why are these sources of innovation dry, mostly? Innovation as such is not on the agenda of stakeholders in rural triple helix, the issue is supposed to take place in the next city with its infrastructure.

All costs in this article are expressed in $US, year 2007 values. The costs of hepatitis A outbreaks ranged from $US140000 to $US36 million, and the costs per case in an outbreak situation ranged from $US3824 to $US200 480. These costs were typically found to be substantially higher than estimates from cost-of-illness studies (i.e. costs for sporadic cases) and estimates used in cost-effectiveness analyses, mostly because of costly outbreak-control measures. Post-exposure prophylaxis is a major cost factor, especially for food-borne outbreaks. As a result of the increasing proportion of those susceptible to hepatitis A in low-incidence countries, future outbreaks could, on average, increase in size. The increasing occurrence of hepatitis A cases in outbreak situations and the associated control costs should appropriately be accounted for in economic evaluations of vaccination programmes in low-incidence countries. In order to do this, more studies documenting such outbreak-control strategies in terms of costs and resource use are needed.","[Luyten, Jeroen; Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Beutels, P (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Evaluat Vaccinat, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",Philippe.Beutels@ua.ac.be,"Luyten, Jeroen/V-1124-2019; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Luyten, Jeroen/0000-0003-1770-6352; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Luyten, Jeroen/0000-0001-6398-4025",European Commission [SP22-CT-2004-5020851]; Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (SIMID) [06008 1]; Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (SIMID)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)); Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre,"Financial support for this study was provided by the European Commission (research project POLYMOD [contract number SP22-CT-2004-5020851), the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (SIMID, a strategic basic research project, number 06008 1) and the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre.

A total of 21 studies (but 22 models) were included in the review after being assessed for methodological quality. All of the included studies had used a mathematical model to determine the effectiveness of an HPV vaccine, whilst 13 had also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis. Although the studies used different model structures, baseline parameters and assumptions, all studies showed that vaccination would decrease rates of HPV infection, precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Studies had a consistent message with respect to cost effectiveness: a female-only vaccination programme is cost effective compared with the current cytology-based Pap smear screening programme, while the cost effectiveness of a male and female vaccination programme is generally not cost effective compared with female-only vaccination.","[Marra, Fawziah] Univ British Columbia, BC Ctr Dis Control, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4R4, Canada; [Cloutier, Karine] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Marra, Carlo] Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcomes Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; Laval University,"Marra, F (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, BC Ctr Dis Control, 655 W 12th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4R4, Canada.",fawziah.marra@bccdc.ca,"Marra, Carlo/AAE-4904-2021","Marra, Carlo/0000-0002-2625-2121; Ogilvie, Gina/0000-0001-5783-4493",Merck and Co.,Merck and Co.(Merck & Company),"G.

First, such indices as net income growth rate and return on asset (ROA) which was usually taken as indices illustrating company's financial performance could not represent company's real value. Second, when the company was diversified to a certain degree, the increase of capital investment might not enhance company value. Third, the main factors that affected the firms' financial performance were the ownership internal index, the proportion of state owned shares and debt equity ratio, respectively, and the main factor that affected firms' non-financial performance were diversification index, ownership internal index, proportion of state-owned shares, and debt equity ratio, respectively.

However, obesity prevention, while reducing obesity-related morbidity and mortality, may not result in overall healthcare cost savings because of additional costs in life-years gained. Sector-specific financial consequences of preventing obesity are less well documented, for pharmaceutical spending as well as for other healthcare segments. Objective: To estimate the effect of obesity prevention on annual and lifetime drug spending as well as other sector-specific expenditures, i.e. the hospital segment, long-term care segment and primary healthcare. Methods: The RIVM (Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) Chronic Disease Model and Dutch cost of illness data were used to simulate, using a Markov-type model approach, the lifetime expenditures in the pharmaceutical segment and three other healthcare segments for a hypothetical cohort of obese (body mass index [BMI] >= 30 kg/m(2)), non-smoking people with a starting age of 20 years. In order to assess the sector-specific consequences of obesity prevention, these costs were compared with the costs of two other similar cohorts, i.e. a 'healthy-living' cohort (non-smoking and a BMI >= 18.5 and <25kg/m(2)) and a smoking cohort. To assert whether preventing obesity results in cost savings in any of the segments, net present values were estimated using different discount rates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted across key input values and using a broader definition of healthcare. Results: Lifetime drug expenditures are higher for obese people than for 'healthy-living' people, despite shorter life expectancy for the obese. Obesity prevention results in savings on drugs for obesity-related diseases until the age of 74 years, which outweigh additional drug costs for diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Furthermore, obesity prevention will increase long-term care expenditures substantially, while savings in the other healthcare segments are small or non-existent. Discounting costs more heavily or using lower relative mortality risks for obesity would make obesity prevention a relatively more attractive strategy in terms of healthcare costs, especially for the long-term care segment. Application of a broader definition of healthcare costs has the opposite effect. Conclusions: Obesity prevention will likely result in savings in the pharmaceutical segment, but substantial additional costs for long-term care. These are important considerations for policy makers concerned with the future sustainability of the healthcare system.","[Rappange, David R.] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hoogenveen, Rudolf T.; Van Baal, Pieter H.

The test is based on an empirical likelihood (EL) statistic that measures the goodness of fit between the parametric estimates and the nonparametric kernel estimates of the mean and variance functions. A unique feature of the test is its ability to distribute natural weights automatically between the mean and the variance components of the goodness-of-fit measure. To reduce the dependence of the test on a single pair of smoothing bandwidths, we construct an adaptive test by maximizing a standardized version of the empirical likelihood test statistic over a set of smoothing bandwidths. The test procedure is based on a bootstrap calibration to the distribution of the empirical likelihood test statistic. We demonstrate that the empirical likelihood test is able to distinguish local alternatives that are different from the null hypothesis at an optimal rate.","[Gao, Jiti] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Chen, Song Xi] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Adelaide; Peking University,"Gao, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jiti.gao@adelaide.edu.au,"Chen, Song Xi/AAN-4984-2021; Chen, Song Xi/ABH-2789-2020","Chen, Song Xi/0000-0002-2338-0873; Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021","National Science Foundation [SES-0518904, DMS-0604533]; Australian Research Council [DP0558602, DP0879088]; Australian Research Council [DP0558602, DP0879088] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank Peter C.

Because it is common in many applications, we focus on the case where endogenous regressors and additional instruments are jointly normal, conditional on exogenous regressors. This leads to a severely ill-posed inverse problem. In this setup, we show first how to test for conditional normality. More importantly, we then establish how to exploit this knowledge when constructing an estimator, and we derive the large sample behavior of such an estimator. In addition, in a Monte Carlo experiment we analyze its finite sample behavior. Our application comes from consumer demand. We obtain new and interesting findings that highlight both the advantages and the difficulties of an approach that leads to ill-posed inverse problems. Finally, we discuss the somewhat problematic relationship between endogenous nonparametric regression models and the recently emphasized issue of unobserved heterogeneity in structural models.","[Hoderlein, Stefan] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Holzmann, Hajo] Univ Marburg, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Brown University; Philipps University Marburg,"Hoderlein, S (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",stefan_hoderlein@yahoo.com,,,Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG [HO 3260/3-1]; Claussen-Simon-Stiftung,Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Claussen-Simon-Stiftung,"The authors would like to thank Jean-Pierre Florens, Peter C.

When the additive components and link function are twice differentiable with sufficiently smooth second derivatives, the estimator is asymptotically normally distributed with a rate of convergence in probability of n(-2/5). This is true regardless of the (finite) dimension of the explanatory variable. Thus, the estimator has no curse of dimensionality. Moreover, the asymptotic distribution of the estimator of each additive component is the same as it would be if the link function and the other components were known with certainty.

Insurance companies manage policies by growing, by adding independent risks. Even if adding risks generally ultimately decreases the probability of insolvency, the impact on the insurer's expected utility is less clear. Indeed, it is not true that the risk aversion toward the additional loss generated by a new policy included in an insurance portfolio always decreases with the number of contracts already underwritten. The present paper derives conditions under which zero-utility premium principles are subadditive for independent risks. It is shown that subadditivity is the exception rather than the rule: the zero-utility premium principle generates a superadditive risk premium for most common utility functions. For instance, all completely monotonic utility functions generate superadditive zero-utility premiums. The main message of the present paper is thus that the zero-utility premium for a marginal policy is generally not sufficient to guarantee the formation of insurance portfolios without additional capital.","[Denuit, Michel M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles ISBA, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Eeckhoudt, Louis] LEM, IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France; [Eeckhoudt, Louis] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Menegatti, Mario] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy",Universite Catholique Louvain; IESEG School of Management; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Parma,"Denuit, MM (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles ISBA, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",,"Menegatti, Mario/C-4197-2014","Menegatti, Mario/0000-0002-5893-9753",Onderzoeksfonds K.U.

By considering operators on the space of taxation rules, we also show that progressivity is slightly more robust than merging-proofness.","[Ju, Biung-Ghi] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Moreno-Ternero, Juan D.] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Moreno-Ternero, Juan D.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain; [Moreno-Ternero, Juan D.] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Korea University; Universidad de Malaga; Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Ju, BG (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Anam Dong 5-1, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",bgju@korea.ac.kr; jdmorenot@uma.es,"Moreno-Ternero, Juan D./C-9882-2009","Moreno-Ternero, Juan D./0000-0001-7288-8596","Korea Research Foundation [KRF-2008-332-B00040]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-03883/ECON]; Junta de Andalucia [P06-SEJ-01645, P08-SEJ-04154]; Fundacion Ramon Areces",Korea Research Foundation(National Research Foundation of Korea); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Fundacion Ramon Areces,"We are most grateful to William Thomson for detailed comments and suggestions.

As in several natural phenomena, the predictions of such a model must be compared with the data of a single process realization in our records. In order to give statistical significance to such a comparison, assumptions of stationarity for some quantities extracted from the single historical time series, like the distribution of the returns over a given time interval, cannot be avoided. Such assumptions entail the risk of masking or misrepresenting non-stationarities of the underlying process, and of giving an incorrect account of its correlations. Here we overcome this difficulty by showing that five years of daily Euro/US-Dollar trading records in the about three hours following the New York market opening, provide a rich enough ensemble of histories. The statistics of this ensemble allows to propose and test an adequate model of the stochastic process driving the exchange rate. This turns out to be a non-Markovian, self-similar process with non-stationary returns. The empirical ensemble correlators are in agreement with the predictions of this model, which is constructed on the basis of the time-inhomogeneous, anomalous scaling obeyed by the return distribution.","[Baldovin, Fulvio; Bovina, Dario; Camana, Francesco; Stella, Attilio L.] Univ Padua, INFN & CNISM, Dept Phys, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,,baldovin@pd.infn.it; bovina@pd.infn.it; camana@pd.infn.it; stella@pd.infn.it,,,,,,,20,6,6,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-88-470-1765-8,NEW ECON WINDOWS,,,2011,,,,,,,239,252,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Physics,BVM64,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291893200016,0

By constructing a broad corporate governance index (CGI) for Brazilian public firms, this paper documents that governance does explain average returns on stocks. Most importantly, the governance factor seems to be more powerful than firm size and book-to-market ratio. We also provide evidence that expected stock returns are negatively related to firm-level corporate governance.

Since the name was coined in 1995 by merging the words 'Economics' and 'Physics', this new interdisciplinary field has grown in various directions: theoretical macroeconomics (wealth distribution), microstructure of financial markets (order book modeling), econometrics of financial bubbles and crashes, etc. We discuss the interactions between Physics, Mathematics, Economics and Finance that led to the emergence of Econophysics. We then present empirical studies revealing the statistical properties of financial time series. We begin the presentation with the widely acknowledged 'stylized facts', which describe the returns of financial assets-fat tails, volatility clustering, autocorrelation, etc.-and recall that some of these properties are directly linked to the way 'time' is taken into account. We continue with the statistical properties observed on order books in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this review, (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own high-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the study of correlations of assets such as random matrix theory and graph theory are presented. The companion paper will review models in Econophysics from the point of view of agent-based modeling.","[Chakraborti, Anirban; Toke, Ioane Muni; Abergel, Frederic] Ecole Cent Paris, Lab Math Appl Syst, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Patriarca, Marco] NICPB, EE-15042 Tallinn, Estonia; [Patriarca, Marco] Inst Fis Interdisciplinaire & Sistemas Complejos, E-07122 Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universite Paris Saclay; National Institute of Chemical Physics & Biophysics (NICPB); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat de les Illes Balears; CSIC-UIB - Instituto de Fisica Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos (IFISC),"Chakraborti, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Cent Paris, Lab Math Appl Syst, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France.",anirban.chakraborti@ecp.fr,"Patriarca, Marco/D-8759-2013; Patriarca, Marco/AAK-2034-2020; Chakraborti, Anirban/AAD-2187-2020","Patriarca, Marco/0000-0001-6743-2914; Patriarca, Marco/0000-0001-6743-2914; Chakraborti, Anirban/0000-0002-6235-0204; MUNI TOKE, IOANE/0000-0002-0283-8179",,,,,121,198,203,1,146,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Large sample asymptotic properties are derived under three scenarios concerning the span of data and sampling frequency, each scenario depending on whether span or frequency (or both) tends to infinity. In cases where span tends to infinity the OLS estimators are consistent but their limiting distributions suffer from second-order bias effects arising from serial correlation and endogeneity; the OLS estimators are not even consistent when the span is fixed and sampling frequency increases. In contrast, the FM-OLS estimators are shown to have limiting mixed normal distributions when span tends to infinity and associated Wald statistics have limiting chi-square distributions. The finite sample performance of the estimators and test statistics is explored in a simulation study in which the superiority of the FM-OLS estimator in terms of bias and mean square error is demonstrated and the Wald statistics are found to generally have good size and power properties. Directions in which the model can be extended, and the effects of such extensions, are also discussed.","Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Chambers, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",mchamb@essex.ac.uk,,,ESRC [R000222961]; Leverhulme Trust,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),I am grateful to three anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

The objective of this study was to review studies on unit costs for delivery of adult and paediatric ART per patient-year, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions per mother-infant pair screened or treated, in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review was conducted of English, French and Spanish publications from 2001 to 2009, reporting empirical costing that accounted for at least antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, laboratory testing and personnel. Expenditures were analysed by country-income level and cost component. All costs were standardized to $US, year 2009 values. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. Analyses covered 29 eligible, comprehensive, costing studies. In the base case, in low-income countries (LIC), median ART cost per patient-year was $US792 (mean: 839, range: 682-1089); for lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), the median was $US932 (mean: 1246, range: 156-3904); and, for upper-middle-income countries (UMIC), the median was $US1454 (mean: 2783, range: 1230-5667). ARV drugs were the largest component of overall ART costs in all settings (64%, 50% and 47% in LIC, LMIC and UMIC, respectively). Of 26 ART studies, 14 reported the drug regimes used, and only one study explicitly reported second-line treatment costs. The second cost driver was laboratory cost in LIC and LMIC (14% and 20%), and personnel costs in UMIC (26%). Two ART studies specified the types of laboratory tests costed, and three studies specifically included above facility-level personnel costs. Three studies reported detailed PMTCT costs, and three studies reported on paediatric ART. There is a paucity of data on the full unit costs for delivery of ART and PMTCT, particularly for LIC and middle-income countries. Heterogeneity in activities costed, and insufficient detail regarding components included in the costing, hampers standardization of unit cost measures. Evaluation of programme-level unit costs would benefit from international guidance on standardized costing methods, and expenditure categories and definitions. Future work should help elucidate the sources of the large variations in delivery unit costs across settings with similar income and epidemiological characteristics.","[Galarraga, Omar] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Galarraga, Omar; Santa-Ana-Tellez, Yared] Mexican Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Evaluat Res & Surveys, Div Hlth Econ, Natl Inst Publ Hlth INSP, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Wirtz, Veronika J.; Figueroa-Lara, Alejandro] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Syst Res, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Coulibaly, Ibrahima; Viisainen, Kirsi; Korenromp, Eline L.] Global Fund Fight AIDS TB & Malaria, Geneva, Switzerland; [Medina-Lara, Antonieta] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, Milan, Italy; [Korenromp, Eline L.] Erasmus MC, Dept Publ Hlth, Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Brown University; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica; Bocconi University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Wirtz, VJ (通讯作者)，Av Univ 655, Cuernavaca 62100, Morelos, Mexico.",veronika.wirtz@insp.mx,"Figueroa-Lara, Alejandro/AAH-5978-2021; Wirtz, Veornika/AAG-9712-2019; Galarraga, Omar/N-1622-2019; Medina-Lara, Antonieta/AAP-7634-2021","Galarraga, Omar/0000-0002-9985-9266; Wirtz, Veronika J./0000-0002-0863-8768; Santa-Ana-Tellez, Yared/0000-0003-3086-446X","National Institute of Public Health (INSP)/Consortium for Research on HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (CISIDAT) [2008301]; US National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Fogarty International Center through the Institute of Business and Economic Research (IBER) at the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA [K01-TW008016-02]","National Institute of Public Health (INSP)/Consortium for Research on HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (CISIDAT); US National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Fogarty International Center through the Institute of Business and Economic Research (IBER) at the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC))","The authors thank Daniel Acuna, who conducted the initial bibliographic search, as well as Lazarus Muchabaiwa and Jesse Kigozi for their research assistance.

Ignoring structural breaks in the error variance may be responsible for not rejecting the unit root hypothesis, even if allowance is made in the inferential procedures for breaks in the mean. The article utilizes analytic and Monte Carlo integration techniques for calculating the marginal likelihoods of the models under consideration, in order to compute the posterior model probabilities.

In this setting, quasi closed-form formulae for pricing equity options to a reference firm and for calculating its survival probabilities are derived. Moreover, using three tractable Levy CreditGrades models, we compute implied volatilities on equity options and term structures of credit default swaps (CDSs) and we examine the jump risk effects of the firm's asset value on short term CDS spreads and equity volatility skew. As a result, with this extension, our model is found to have more significant abilities than the original model introduced by Finger et al.

Moment inequality procedures use the implication E[y 0 | x] = x'beta = E[y 1 | x]. As compared to least squares in the classical regression model, estimates obtained using an objective function based on these moment inequalities do not provide a clear approximation to the underlying unobserved conditional mean function. Most importantly, under misspecification, it is not unusual that no parameter beta satisfies the previous inequalities for all values of x, and hence minima of an objective function based on these moment inequalities are typically tight. We construct set estimates for beta in the linear model that have a clear interpretation when the model is misspecified. These sets are based on moment equality models. We illustrate these sets and compare them to estimates obtained using moment inequality-based methods. In addition to the linear model with interval outcomes we also analyse the binary missing data model with a monotone instrument assumption (MIV), we find there that when this assumption is misspecified, bounds can still be non-empty, and can differ from parameters obtained via maximum likelihood. We also examine a bivariate discrete game with multiple equilibria. In sum, misspecification in moment inequality models is of a different flavour than in moment equality models, and so care should be taken with (1) the_interpretation of the estimates and (2) the size of the 'identified set'.","[Ponomareva, Maria] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Tamer, Elie] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Northwestern University,"Ponomareva, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",mponomar@nwo.ca; tamer@northwestern.edu,,,"National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922327] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",We thank the editor and referees for comments that greatly improved the paper.

Results indicate that a mita effect lowers household consumption by around 25% and increases the prevalence of stunted growth in children by around 6 percentage points in subjected districts today. Using data from the Spanish Empire and Peruvian Republic to trace channels of institutional persistence, I show that the mita's influence has persisted through its impacts on land tenure and public goods provision. Mita districts historically had fewer large landowners and lower educational attainment. Today, they are less integrated into road networks and their residents are substantially more likely to be subsistence farmers.","MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Dell, M (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr,E52, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",mdell@mit.edu,,,Oxford University,Oxford University,"I am grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Bob Allen, Josh Angrist, Abhijit Banerjee, John Coatsworth, David Cook, Knick Harley, Austin Huang, Nils Jacobsen, Alan Manning, Ben Olken, James Robinson, Peter Temin, Gary Urton, Heidi Williams, Jeff Williamson, and seminar participants at City University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Stanford Institute of Theoretical Economics, and Warwick for helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper examines how to estimate the autocovariances of a variable separately from its time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. When both cross-sectional and time series sample sizes tend to infinity, we show that the within-group autocovariances are consistent, although they are severely biased when the time series length is short. The biases have the leading term that converges to the long-run variance of the individual dynamics. This paper develops methods to estimate the long-run variance in panel data settings and to alleviate the biases of the within-group autocovariances based on the proposed long-run variance estimators.

Its structure extends the existing multivariate chain ladder models in a natural way, and this extension proves to be advantageous in improving model adequacy and increasing model flexibility. It is general in the sense that it includes various models in the chain ladder framework as special cases. At the heart of this model is the seemingly unrelated regression technique, which is utilized to estimate parameters that reflect contemporaneous correlations. The use of this technique is essential to construct flexible models, and related statistical theories are applied to study properties of existing estimators. A numerical example is utilized to show the advantage of the proposed model in studying multiple triangles that are related both structurally and contemporaneously. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present a generic model for the valuation of life insurance contracts and embedded options. Furthermore, we describe various numerical valuation approaches within our generic setup. We particularly focus on contracts containing early exercise features since these present (numerically) challenging valuation problems. Based on an example of participating life insurance contracts, we illustrate the different approaches and compare their efficiency in a simple and a generalized Black-Scholes setup, respectively. Moreover, we study the impact of the considered early exercise feature on our example contract and analyze the influence of model risk by additionally introducing an exponential Levy model.","[Bauer, Daniel] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Bergmann, Daniela] Univ Ulm, Inst Insurance, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Kiesel, Ruediger] Univ Oslo, Ctr Math Applicat, D-45141 Essen, Germany; [Kiesel, Ruediger] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Energy Trading & Financial Serv, D-45141 Essen, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Ulm University; University of Duisburg Essen,"Bauer, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 35 Broad St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",dbauer@gsu.edu; daniela.bergmann@uni-ulm.de; ruediger.kiesel@uni-due.de,,"Bauer, Daniel/0000-0001-6425-3769",,,,,48,22,24,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2010,40.0,1,,,,,65,95,,10.2143/AST.40.1.2049219,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,609AR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000278627600003,0

Comparisons of the proposed PCA model with the well-known models-the Lee-Carter model, the age-period-cohort model (Renshaw and Haberman, 2006), and the Cairns, Blake, and Dowd model-employ empirical Studies of mortality data from six countries, two each from Asia, Europe, and North America. The mortality data come from the human mortality database and span the period 1970-2005. The proposed PCA model produces smaller prediction errors for almost all illustrated countries in its mean absolute percentage error. To demonstrate longevity risk in annuity pricing, we use the proposed PCA model to project future mortality rates and analyze the underestimated ratio of annuity price for whole life annuity and deferred whole life annuity product respectively. The effect of model risk on annuity pricing is also investigated by comparing the results from the proposed PCA model with those from the LC model. The findings can benefit actuaries in their efforts to deal with longevity risk in pricing and valuation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on pharmaceutical prices, which have high markups over marginal cost due to the monopoly power granted to pharmaceutical companies when drugs are under patent.

Furthermore, no study has quantified the indirect (work-loss) cost burden of epilepsy from an employer perspective in the US. Objective: To assess the annual direct costs for privately insured US patients diagnosed with epilepsy, and indirect costs for a subset of employees from an employer perspective. Methods: A retrospective analysis of a claims database for the privately insured, including employee disability claims from 1999 through 2005 and comprising 17 US companies, was conducted. A total of 4323 patients aged 16-64 years (including 1886 employees) with at least one epilepsy diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 345.x) over the period 1999-2004 were included. The control group was a demographically matched cohort of randomly chosen beneficiaries without an epilepsy diagnosis. All had continuous health coverage during 2004 (baseline) and 2005 (study period). Main outcome measures included annual direct (medical and pharmaceutical) costs and, for employees, indirect (disability and medically related absenteeism) and total costs for the study period. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for univariate comparisons of annual direct costs, indirect costs (costs for the subset of employees with these data), and total (direct and indirect) costs during the study period. Two-part multivariate models that adjusted for patient characteristics were also used to compare costs between the study and control groups. Results: Patients with epilepsy were an average age of 43 years and 57% were female. They had more co-morbidities than controls. On average, direct annual costs were significantly higher per patient with epilepsy than per control ($US10258 vs SUS3862, respectively; p < 0.0001) [year 2005 values], with an annual per-patient difference of $US6396. Epilepsy-related costs ($US2057) accounted for 20% of direct costs for patients with epilepsy. Annual indirect costs were significantly higher for employees with epilepsy than for employed controls ($US3192 vs SUS 1242, respectively; p < 0.0001), with a difference of $US1950. Total direct plus indirect costs for employees with epilepsy were also higher than those for employed controls ($US13595 vs $US5338, respectively; p < 0.0001), with a difference of $US8257. Conclusions: Epilepsy was associated with significant economic burden. The excess direct costs in patients with epilepsy are underestimated when only epilepsy-related costs are considered.","[Ivanova, Jasmina I.] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY 10020 USA; [Birnbaum, Howard G.; Kidolezi, Yohanne; Qiu, Ying] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Mallett, David] Ingenix Employer Solut, Rocky Hill, CT USA; [Caleo, Sue] Janssen Pharmaceut NV, Beerse, Belgium",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Ivanova, JI (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 10 Rockefeller Plaza,15th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA.",,,,"Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., Beerse, Belgium","Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., Beerse, Belgium(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc)","Research funding was provided to Analysis Group, Inc. by Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V., Beerse, Belgium.

The evidence for the heteroskedastic behaviour of the returns and the time-varying relationships among the portfolio components have recently shifted attention to the multivariate GARCH models with time varying correlation. In this work we insert a particular Markov Switching dynamics in some Dynamic Correlation models to consider the abrupt changes in correlations affecting the assets in different ways. This class of models is very general and provides several specifications, constraining some coefficients.

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship among social capital, knowledge acquisition and knowledge exploitation.

One theme of this paper is to study how an investor in a conventional log-Brownian market would invest to optimize expected utility of terminal wealth, when subjected to a bound on his risk, as measured by a coherent law-invariant risk measure. Results of Kusuoka lead to remarkably complete expressions for the solution to this problem. The second theme of the paper is to discuss how one would actually manage (not just measure) risk. We study a principal/agent problem, where the principal is required to satisfy some risk constraint. The principal proposes a compensation package to the agent, who then optimises selfishly ignoring the risk constraint. The principal can pick a compensation package that induces the agent to select the principal's optimal choice.","[Rogers, L. C.

Our main result is that MCS produces testable implications on the (small and large) quantiles of the dependent variable, despite the presence of multiple equilibria. The key features of our approach are that (i) we work with a nonparametric structural model of a continuous dependent variable in which the unobservable is allowed to be correlated with the explanatory variable in a reasonably general way; (ii) we do not require the structural function to be known or estimable; (iii) we remain fairly agnostic on how an equilibrium is selected.

DeJong and Chetan Dave are two outstanding new books that provide an excellent introduction to what is sometimes called the New Macroeconometrics. This area of empirical macroeconomics is centered on the estimation and validation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Canova's and DeJong and Dave's volumes fill a tremendous gap in economists' libraries. Not only does the writing style of both books allow them to be adopted as a reference text for a class, but also the books come filled with applications, exercises, and pointers to computer code that will complement the lectures. Despite sharing the common theme of an introduction to the new macroeconometrics, each book has its own focus. Canova's book aims to survey a long list of techniques relevant to macroeconomists: filters, vector autoregressions (VARs), general method of moments (GMM), simulation methods, dynamic panels, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian econometrics; it also offers two preliminary chapters on probability theory and on DSGE modeling. In contrast, DeJong and Dave have the more modest goal of showing how to compute and estimate DSGE models, which makes it more suitable for a second year graduate class. In exchange, DeJong and Dave often dig a bit deeper into issues of interest to them and build the material at a more leisurely pace.","[Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus] CEPR, London, England",Duke University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Rubio-Ramírez, JF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, 213 Social Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Juan.Rubio-Ramirez@duke.edu,,,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank David DeJong for comments and many conversations on estimation of DSGE models.

Agritourism may have a major impact on rural economy and stimulate the development of rural areas. The results presented herein suggest that this type of tourism business generates additional or even alternative income for farmer families.

The report submitted by SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) to the Congress clearly demonstrates the firm standpoint to continue using fair value. Fair value experiences a path of introduction-avoidance-reintroduction in my country. Under the background of current economic crisis, what kinds of influence will the reintroduction of fair value have on Chinese listed companies' financial status? The answer to such a question has become a public concern and research hotspot. In this paper, we select a sample of 3 12 listed companies of the A-share market from 2006 to 2007 which hold trading financial assets to analyze the effects of the changes in the net profit margin excluding the profits and losses deriving from the changes in fair value (Referred to as the Profits and Losses, the same below) of trading financial assets and that in the ratio of the Prot-its and Losses to net income on rate of return on equity (ROE). The empirical results show: trading financial assets accounts for a small proportion of total assets; the changes in the net profit margin is positively related to those in ROE at 1% significance level; the changes in the ratio of the Profits and Losses to net income have no significant impact on ROE; the Profits and Losses do not become the means in significantly improving and reducing corporate performance, nor exaggerate the market risk; the size of total assets of sample companies is slight]), positively related to ROE at 10% significance level, which means an economy of scale exists; the ratio of liabilities to total assets is negatively related to ROE at 5% significance level.

We develop two methods to estimate the trend function and the coefficient function without taking the first difference to eliminate the fixed effects. The first one eliminates the fixed effects by taking cross-sectional averages, and then uses a non-parametric local linear method to estimate both the trend and coefficient functions. The asymptotic theory for this approach reveals that although the estimates of both the trend function and the coefficient function are consistent, the estimate of the coefficient function has a rate of convergence of (Th)-1/2, which is slower than (NTh)-1/2 as the rate of convergence for the estimate of the trend function. To estimate the coefficient function more efficiently, we propose a pooled local linear dummy variable approach. This is motivated by a least squares dummy variable method proposed in parametric panel data analysis. This method removes the fixed effects by deducting a smoothed version of cross-time average from each individual. It estimates both the trend and coefficient functions with a rate of convergence of (NTh)-1/2. The asymptotic distributions of both of the estimates are established when T tends to infinity and N is fixed or both T and N tend to infinity. Both the simulation results and real data analysis are provided to illustrate the finite sample behaviour of the proposed estimation methods.","[Li, Degui; Chen, Jia; Gao, Jiti] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Li, Degui; Chen, Jia; Gao, Jiti] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3145, Australia; [Chen, Jia] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Adelaide; Monash University; University of Queensland,"Li, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",degui.li08@gmail.com; jiachen1981@gmail.com; jiti.gao@monash.edu,"Chen, Jia/D-8855-2013","Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021; Li, Degui/0000-0001-6802-308X",Australian Research Council [DP0879088]; Australian Research Council [DP0879088] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors would like to thank the Co-Editor Professor Jianqing Fan and two referees for their valuable comments, which substantially improved an earlier version of this paper.

The new copula originates from extracting the dependence function of the multivariate GB2 distribution (MGB2) whose marginals follow the univariate generalized beta distribution of the second kind (GB2). The MGB2 copula can capture non-elliptical and asymmetric dependencies among marginal coordinates and provides a simple formulation for multi-dimensional applications. This new class features positive tail dependence in the upper tail and tail independence in the lower tail. Furthermore, it includes some well-known copula classes, such as the Gaussian copula, as special or limiting cases. To illustrate the usefulness of the MGB2 copula, we build a trivariate MGB2 copula model of bodily injury liability closed claims. Extended GB2 distributions are chosen to accommodate the right-skewness and the long-tailedness of the outcome variables. For the regression component, location parameters with continuous predictors are introduced using a nonlinear additive function. For comparison purposes, we also consider the Gumbel and t copulas, alternatives that capture the upper tail dependence. The paper introduces a conditional plot graphical tool for assessing the validation of the MGB2 copula. Quantitative and graphical assessment of the goodness of fit demonstrate the advantages of the MGB2 copula over the other copulas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model is based on more realistic balance-sheet models recognizing the fact that asset and liabilities are both risky and have to be treated differently taking into account bid and ask prices in a prudent fashion. The underlying theory makes use of conic finance which is based on the concept of acceptability and distorted expectations. We recall the theory and give a brief overview of the related literature. Next, we discuss and propose some potential funded and unfunded contingent capital notes. Traditionally, the conversion trigger of contingent capital notes is in terms of the Core-Tier 1 ratio. We argue that this ratio is maybe not optimal, certainly when taking into account the presence of risky liabilities. As an alternative we introduce triggers based on capital shortfall. The pricing of seven variations of funded as well as unfunded notes is overviewed. We further investigate the effect of the dilution factor and the grace factor. In an appendix we show conic balance sheets including contingent capital instruments.","[Madan, Dilip B.] Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Schoutens, Wim] Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200 B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",,"Schoutens, W (通讯作者)，Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200 B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu; wim@schoutens.be,,,,,,,21,26,30,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

They are easily interpretable but have limitations when used as approximations to general dependence structures. To improve the approximation property of the BF copulas and keep the advantage of easy interpretation, we develop a new copula approximation scheme by using BF copulas locally and patching the local pieces together. Error bounds and a probabilistic interpretation of this approximation scheme are developed. The new approximation scheme is compared with several existing copula approximations, including shuffle of min, checkmin, checkerboard and Bernstein approximations and exhibits better performance, especially in characterizing the local dependence. The utility of the new approximation scheme in insurance and finance is illustrated in the computation of the rainbow option prices and stop-loss premiums. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

At each stage workers sequentially decide which offer to accept (if any). A firm whose offer has been declined may make an offer to another worker in the next stage. The game stops when all firms either have been matched to a worker or have already made unsuccessful offers to any worker remaining in the market. We show that there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium outcome, the worker-optimal matching. Firms in this game have a weakly dominant strategy, which consists of making offers in the same order as given by their preferences. When workers play simultaneously any stable matching can be obtained as an equilibrium outcome, but an unstable matching can obtain in equilibrium.","[Haeringer, Guillaume] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Wooders, Myrna] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Vanderbilt University,"Haeringer, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",Guillaume.Haeringer@uab.es; myrna.wooders@vanderbilt.edu,,"Haeringer, Guillaume/0000-0003-3699-0491","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-04756]; Generalitat de Catalunya, Departament d'Universitats, Recerca i Societat de la Informacio [SGR2009-0419]; Barcelona Graduate School of Economics","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya, Departament d'Universitats, Recerca i Societat de la Informacio(Generalitat de Catalunya); Barcelona Graduate School of Economics","We thank Francis Bloch, Jordi Masso, Alejandro Neme, Joana Pais, Pablo Revilla and Flip Klijn.

However, much less is known about how this relationship is influenced by the success, or otherwise, of depression management strategies, and the economic impact over the longer term. Objective: To investigate the economic impact of non-remission on health service use and costs over 12 months from the index episode in patients with depression. Methods: A naturalistic, longitudinal study was carried out using data from a large primary care UK general practice research database between 2001 and 2006. The records of 88 935 patients aged >= 18 years, diagnosed with depression and in receipt of at least two antidepressant prescriptions (for amitriptyline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline or venlafaxine) in the first 3 months after the index prescription were included. The main outcome measures were health service use and cost over the 12-month study period, by remission status, where remission is defined as patients not using antidepressants for at least 6 months after antidepressant treatment has ended. Results: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were similar for participants classified as in remission and those not in remission. Over 12 months from the index prescription, patients classified as non-remitters spent longer, on average, than patients classified as remitters on concomitant psychotropic medication (204 days vs 93 days, respectively), and had more contact with primary care services (17 vs 13 GP visits), secondary care psychiatrists and other specialists (47% vs 40%). Days in hospital, accident and emergency attendances and psychological therapy contacts did not differ between the groups. Total 12-month costs per participant were significantly lower for remitters (mean 656 vs 937; pound mean difference 317; pound p < 0.0001). Total costs fell over time for both groups, but at a faster rate for those in remission, and for those who remitted earlier after the index prescription than for those who remitted later. Conclusions: Successful cessation of antidepressant medication treatment in adults with depression can result in significant cost savings to the health service.","[Byford, Sarah] Kings Coll London, Ctr Econ Mental Hlth, Inst Psychiat, London SE5 8AF, England; [Despiegel, Nicolas] Lundbeck SAS, Paris, France; [Wade, Alan] CPS Clin Res Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of London; King's College London; Lundbeck Corporation; Lundbeck Corporation - France,"Byford, S (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Ctr Econ Mental Hlth, Inst Psychiat, P024,De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.",s.byford@iop.kcl.ac.uk,"Byford, Sarah/D-1699-2010; Barrett, Barbara/F-7606-2010","Byford, Sarah/0000-0001-7084-1495; Barrett, Barbara/0000-0002-0270-6256",H.

When this condition holds the risk-neutral densities are said to be increasing in the convex order. For Levy processes, such prices decrease with maturity. A time series analysis of squared log returns on the S&P 500 index also reveals such a decrease. If options are priced to a slightly increasing level of acceptability, then the resulting risk-neutral densities can be increasing in the convex order. Calibrated stochastic volatility models yield possibilities in both directions. Finally, we consider modeling strategies guaranteeing an increase in convex order for the normalized quadratic variation. These strategies model instantaneous variance as a normalized exponential of a Levy process.

This yields a leading-order expansion for the implied volatility at large strikes: sigma(BS)(k, T)T-2 similar to Psi(s(+) - 1) x k (Roger Lee's moment formula). Motivated by recent 'tail-wing' refinements of this moment formula, we first derive a novel tail expansion for the Heston density, sharpening previous work of Dragulescu and Yakovenko [Quant. Finance, 2002, 2(6), 443-453], and then show the validity of a refined expansion of the type sigma(BS)(k, T)T-2 (beta(1)k(1/2) + beta(2)+ ...)(2), where all constants are explicitly known as functions of s(+), the Heston model parameters, the spot vol and maturity T. In the case of the 'zero-correlation' Heston model, such an expansion was derived by Gulisashvili and Stein [Appl. Math. Optim., 2010, 61(3), 287-315]. Our methods and results may prove useful beyond the Heston model: the entire quantitative analysis is based on affine principles and at no point do we need knowledge of the (explicit, but cumbersome) closed-form expression of the Fourier transform of log ST (equivalently the Mellin transform of S-T). What matters is that these transforms satisfy ordinary differential equations of the Riccati type. Secondly, our analysis reveals a new parameter (the 'critical slope'), defined in a model-free manner, which drives the second-and higher-order terms in tail and implied volatility expansions.","[Friz, Peter] TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Friz, Peter] WIAS Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gerhold, Stefan] TU Wien, Vienna, Austria; [Gulisashvili, Archil] Ohio Univ, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Sturm, Stephan] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Technical University of Berlin; Technische Universitat Wien; University System of Ohio; Ohio University; Princeton University,"Friz, P (通讯作者)，TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",friz@math.tu-berlin.de,"Sturm, Stephan/E-5836-2013","Sturm, Stephan/0000-0002-7214-8843",MATHEON; Austrian Federal Financing Agency; Christian-Doppler-Gesellschaft; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [0739195] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,MATHEON; Austrian Federal Financing Agency; Christian-Doppler-Gesellschaft; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),P.F. and S.S.

This index, the computation of which is based on the p-variations of the considered asset or rate at different time scales, can be interpreted in terms of Besov smoothness spaces. We study the behavior of our new index using empirical data. It gives rise to phenomena that a classical signature plot is unable to detect. In particular, with our data set, it enables us to separate the sampling frequencies into three zones: no microstructure noise for low frequencies, increasing microstructure noise from low to high frequencies, and some kind of additional regularity on the finest scales. We then investigate the index from a theoretical point of view, under various contexts of microstructure noise, trying to reproduce the facts observed on the data. We show that this can be partially done using models involving additive correlated errors or rounding error. Accurate reproduction seems to require either both kinds of error together or some unusual form of rounding error.","[Rosenbaum, Mathieu] CREST, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Rosenbaum, Mathieu] CMAP Ecole Polytech Paris, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",,"Rosenbaum, M (通讯作者)，CREST, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",mathieu.rosenbaum@polytechnique.edu,,,"BNP-Paribas, FIRST-ETG (Fixed Income Research Strategic Team-Electronic Trading Group)","BNP-Paribas, FIRST-ETG (Fixed Income Research Strategic Team-Electronic Trading Group)","I am grateful to Nour Meddahi and Marc Hoffmann for helpful discussions and comments.

The method is applicable not only to the case of single equilibrium but also the multiple equilibria case without the need to specify an (arbitrary) equilibrium selection mechanism. The article provides a Monte Carlo study on the finite sample performance of such estimators.","[Shang, Qingyan] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Lee, Lung-fei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Shang, QY (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",qshang2@buffalo.edu,,,NSF [SES-0519204],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful for discussion with Bruce A.

Global identification results are known for some specific models, e.g., in some standard auction models. We use functional formulations to obtain general criteria for local identification. These criteria can be applied to both parametric and nonparametric models, and also to models with asymmetry among players and affiliated private information. A benchmark model is developed where the structural parameters of interest are the distribution of private information and an additional dissociated parameter, such as a parameter of risk aversion. Criteria are derived for some standard auction models, games with exogenous variables, games with randomized strategies, such as mixed strategies, and games with strategic functions that cannot be derived analytically.","[Sbai, Erwann] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Florens, Jean-Pierre] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",University of Auckland; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Sbaï, E (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",e.sbai@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,26,9,9,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

An exposure measure, equal to the total payroll of observed workers in each three-way classification, is also included in the dataset. Data are analysed across ten different states, 24 different occupation classes and seven separate observation years. A multiple linear regression model, with only predictors for main effects, could be estimated in 2(23+ 9 + 1 + 1) = 2(34) ways, theoretically more than 17 billion different possible models! In addition, one might expect that the number of claims recorded in each year in the same state and relating to the same occupation class, are positively correlated. Different modelling assumptions as to the nature of this correlation should also be considered. On the other hand it may reasonably be assumed that the number of losses reported from different states and from different occupation classes are independent. Our data can therefore be modelled using the statistical techniques applicable to panel data and we work with generalised estimating equations (GEE) in the paper. For model selection, Pan (2001) suggested the use of an alternative to the AIC, namely the quasi-likelihood under independence model criterion (QIC), for model comparison. This paper develops and applies a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficiently locating, out of the more than 17 billion possible models that could be considered for the analysis, that model with the optimal (least) QIC value. The technique is illustrated using both a simulation study and using workers' compensation insurance claim data.","[Pitt, David] Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Pitt, D (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",david.pitt@mq.edu.au,"Qian, Guoqi/AAB-3953-2022","Qian, Guoqi/0000-0003-3818-0564; Pitt, David/0000-0002-6976-7168",,,,,20,1,1,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,779,796,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061136,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700014,0

Recent developments in the area of derivatives pricing have seen the application of adjoint methods to the calculation of option price sensitivities including the well-known 'Greeks' or partial derivatives of option prices with respect to model parameters. These methods have been the foundation for efficient and simple calculations of a vast number of sensitivities to model parameters in financial mathematics. This methodology has yet to be applied to actuarial problems in insurance or in pensions. In this paper we consider a model for a defined benefit pension scheme and use adjoint methods to illustrate the sensitivity of fund valuation results to key inputs such as mortality rates, interest rates and levels of salary rate inflation. The method of adjoints is illustrated in the paper and numerical results are presented. Efficient calculation of the sensitivity of key valuation results to model inputs is useful information for practising actuaries as it provides guidance as to the relative ultimate importance of various judgments made in the formation of a liability valuation basis.","[Joshi, Mark] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Pitt, David] Macquarie Univ, Dept Actuarial Studies, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Melbourne; Macquarie University,"Joshi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",mark@markjoshi.com; david.pitt@mq.edu.au,"Joshi, Mark/B-3253-2010","Joshi, Mark/0000-0002-8456-3438; Pitt, David/0000-0002-6976-7168",,,,,9,1,1,0,11,PEETERS,LEUVEN,"BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM",0515-0361,,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,NOV,2010,40.0,2,,,,,655,667,,10.2143/AST.40.2.2061132,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,710SK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000286533700010,0

In this paper we consider the case when the coefficients in this relationship are random and distributed independently from the regressors. Our aim is to identify and estimate the distribution of the coefficients nonparametrically. We propose a kernel-based estimator for the joint probability density of the coefficients. Although this estimator shares certain features with standard nonparametric kernel density estimators, it also differs in some important characteristics that are due to the very different setup we are considering. Most importantly, the kernel is nonstandard and derives from the theory of Radon transforms. Consequently, we call our estimator the Radon transform estimator (RTE). We establish the large sample behavior of this estimator-in particular, rate optimality and asymptotic distribution. In addition, we extend the basic model to cover extensions, including endogenous regressors and additional controls.

While different methods of how to price Such securities have been proposed in recent literature, no consensus has been reached.

Under a setting where relatively high rates of convergence can be attained, the minimum distance estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The constrained estimates can be efficient relative to the unconstrained ones. The minimized distance function is shown to be asymptotically chi(2)-distributed, and can be used as a goodness-of-fit test for the constraints. As the extension is motivated by some social interactions models, which are of interest in their own right, we discuss this approach for the estimation and testing of a social interactions model.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lee, LF (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 410 Arps Hall,1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lflee@econ.ohio-state.edu,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The mean function of each expert is an affine function of covariates that may include lags of the dependent variable and/or lags of external predictors. The mixing of the experts is determined by a latent variable, the distribution of which depends on the same covariates used in the regressions. The expert error terms are assumed to follow the generalized t distribution, a rather flexible parametric form encompassing the standard t and normal distributions as special cases and allowing separate modeling of scale and kurtosis. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, for correctly specified and for misspecified models, and provide Monte Carlo evidence on the performance of standard model selection criteria in selecting the number of experts. We further employ the model to obtain density forecasts for daily stock returns and find evidence to support the model.","[Carvalho, Alexandre X.] Inst Appl Econ Res, BR-70076900 Brasilia, OF, Brazil; [Skoulakis, Georgios] Univ Maryland, Dept Finance, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Carvalho, AX (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res, SBS Quadral Bloco J,Ed BNDES Sala 717, BR-70076900 Brasilia, OF, Brazil.",alexandre.ywata@ipea.gov.br,,"Skoulakis, Georgios/0000-0002-5156-1890",,,,,68,1,1,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Analysis is based on a dynamic structural model that addresses the interplay between health, institutional constraints and economic incentives of men and women in the later part of their working lives. Unlike most previous research, which has typically used self-reported and indirect measures of disability conditions, in this paper health is modelled as a direct latent indicator of the eligibility to retire through the disability system. The model specifically accounts for the fact that employment may coincide with bad health when employees do not opt for disability in favour of more desirable retirement opportunities in the future. Norwegian register data are used for estimation. The substitution between disability and early retirement exits is investigated by simulating a complete elimination of the latter. The simulation suggests a moderate inflow of the displaced early pensioners into disability combined with partial employment and negligible inflow into the full-time disability.","Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Iskhakov, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, PO 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",f.v.iskhakov@frisch.uio.no,"Iskhakov, Fedor/ABC-7929-2021","Iskhakov, Fedor/0000-0002-9312-5122",,,,,46,5,6,1,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1368-4221,,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Objective: To determine the cost effectiveness of maintenance treatment with quetiapine fumarate extended-release (XR) tablets in combination with mood stabilizers (lithium or divalproex) in comparison with the following treatments: placebo in combination with lithium or divalproex; no maintenance treatment; lithium monotherapy; lamotrigine monotherapy; olanzapine monotherapy; and aripiprazole monotherapy. Methods: The analysis was conducted from the societal and payer perspectives in the US, using a Markov model. The model simulated a cohort of 1000 stabilized BPD I patients and estimated the quarterly risk in three health states: euthymia, mania and depression. Efficacy data were derived from two randomized, double-blind trials comparing quetiapine + lithium/divalproex with placebo + lithium/divalproex for up to 2 years, as well as other published literature. Resource data were extracted from published literature. Drug costs, hospitalizations and physician visits were among the direct costs. Indirect costs included absenteeism, and mortality rates included suicide. Benefits and costs were discounted at 3% and the price reference year was 2009. Endpoints included number of acute mood episodes, hospitalizations due to an acute mood event and costs per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the model inputs. Results: Treatment with quetiapine XR + lithium/divalproex was associated with reductions in acute mania (46%), acute depression (41%) and related hospitalizations (44%) compared with placebo + lithium/divalproex, and similar reductions in events were observed relative to lithium monotherapy. In the base-case analysis from the payer perspective, the discounted incremental cost per QALY for quetiapine XR + lithium/divalproex compared with placebo + lithium/divalproex was $US22 959, and compared with lithium monotherapy was $US100 235, while all other comparators were dominated. PSA showed these results to be robust to select assumptions. Conclusions: Quetiapine XR + lithium/divalproex may be a cost-effective maintenance treatment option for patients with BPD I.","[Tafesse, Eskinder; Lazarus, Arthur] AstraZeneca Pharmaceut LP, Wilmington, DE 19850 USA; [Woodward, Tatia Chay; Quon, Peter] United Biosource Corp, Bethesda, MD USA",AstraZeneca; United Biosource Corporation,"Tafesse, E (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca Pharmaceut LP, 1800 Concord Pike, Wilmington, DE 19850 USA.",eskinder.tafesse@astrazeneca.com,,,"AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Delaware, USA; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP","AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Delaware, USA(AstraZeneca); AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP(AstraZeneca)","This study was supported by a research grant from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.

The nonparametric envelopment estimators rely oil the assumption that all the observations fall oil the same side of the frontier. The free disposal hull (FDH) estimator of the attainable set is the smallest free disposal set covering all the observations. By construction, the FDH estimator is an inward-biased estimator of the frontier. The univariate extreme values representation of the FDH allows us to derive a bias-corrected estimator for the frontier. The presentation is based on a probabilistic formulation where the input-output,pairs are realizations of independent random variables drawn from a joint distribution whose support is the production set. The bias-corrected estimator shares the asymptotic properties of the FDH estimator. But in finite samples, Monte Carlo experiments indicate that our bias-corrected estimator reduces significantly not only the bias of the FDH estimator but also its mean squared error, with no computational cost. The method is also illustrated with a real data example. A comparison with the parametric stochastic frontier indicates that the parametric approach can easily fail under wrong specification of the model.","[Simar, Leopold] Univ Catholique Louvain, Inst Stat, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Badin, Luiza] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Badin, Luiza] Acad Romana, Gheorghe Mihoc Caius Iacob Inst Math Stat & Appl, Bucharest, Romania",Universite Catholique Louvain; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mathematical Statistics & Applied Mathematics of Romanian Academy,"Simar, L (通讯作者)，Univ Catholique Louvain, Inst Stat, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",simar@stat.ucl.ac.be,"Badin, Luiza/A-8780-2011",,,,,,16,8,9,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We use the model to understand three empirical patterns of friendship formation: (i) larger groups tend to form more same-type ties and fewer other-type ties than small groups, (ii) larger groups form more ties per capita, and (iii) all groups are biased towards same-type relative to demographics, with the most extreme bias coming from middle-sized groups. We show how these empirical observations can be generated by biases in preferences and biases in meetings.

Adopting the argument that large insurance losses may be a 'globalizing factor' for the industry, we study the dependence of geographically distant insurance markets via equity returns. In particular, we employ conditional copula theory to model the bivariate dependence of the insurance industry. In contrast to earlier literature on this subject, we disentangle the causes of dependence stemming from the asset side from those from the liability side by conditioning on general market conditions. We find that for both Europe-America and Europe-Asia the dependence is significant. Moreover, we find asymmetric effects: the international dependence is particularly high for losses, even after conditioning for the asset side dependence. Finally, we investigate the time variation in copula parameters and find evidence that dependence in the insurance sector has increased over time, thus reducing the scope for international diversification of large losses in this sector.

It is consistent under the usual asymptotics and, under many weak moment asymptotics, is larger than usual and is consistent. We also show that the Kleibergen (2005) Lagrange multiplier and conditional likelihood ratio statistics are valid under many weak moments. In addition, we introduce a jackknife GMM estimator, but find that GEL is asymptotically more efficient under many weak moments.

We consider both the model selection problem and the model averaging solutions for the predicted reserves. As a part of this process we also consider the sub problem of variable selection to obtain a parsimonious representation of the model being fitted.,"[Peters, Gareth W.; Shevchenko, Pavel V.] CSIRO Math & Informat Sci, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia; [Peters, Gareth W.] Univ New S Wales, Dept Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wuethrich, Mario V.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of New South Wales Sydney; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Shevchenko, PV (通讯作者)，CSIRO Math & Informat Sci, Locked Bag 17, N Ryde, NSW 1670, Australia.",peterga@maths.unsw.edu.au; Pavel.Shevchenko@csiro.au; wueth@math.ethz.ch,"Shevchenko, Pavel/C-1718-2009","Shevchenko, Pavel/0000-0001-8104-8716; Peters, Gareth/0000-0003-2768-8979",Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of NSW; CSIRO,Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of NSW; CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),The first author is thankful to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of NSW for support through an Australian Postgraduate Award and to CSIRO for support through a postgraduate research top up scholarship.

Almost all procedures presently available in the literature are Simultaneously sensitive to all three types of alternatives. The test statistics under investigation are based on functionals of the partial sums of observations. These Cumulative sum-type (CUSUM-type) statistics have limit distributions if the mean remains constant and the errors satisfy the central limit theorem but tend to infinity in the case when any of the alternatives (1), (2), or (3) holds. On removing the effect of the shifting mean, however, divergence of the test statistics will only occur under the random walk behavior, which in turn enables statisticians not only to detect structural breaks but also to specify their causes.

The test provides a useful alternative to regression-based tests when conditioning variables have roots close or equal to unity. In this case standard predictive regression tests can suffer from well-documented size distortion. Moreover, tinder the alternative hypothesis, they force the dependent variable to share the same order of integration as the predictor, whereas in practice the dependent variable often appears stationary and the predictor may be near-nonstationary. By contrast, the new test does not enforce the same orders of integration and is therefore capable of detecting a rich set of alternatives to orthogonality that are excluded by the standard predictive regression model. Moreover, the test statistic has a standard normal limit distribution for both unit root and local-to-unity conditioning variables, without prior knowledge of the local-to-unity parameter. If the conditioning variable is stationary, the test remains conservative and consistent. Simulations suggest good small-sample performance. As an empirical application, we test for the predictability of stock returns using two persistent predictors, the dividend-price ratio and short-term interest rate.","[Maynard, Alex] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Shimotsu, Katsumi] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Guelph; Queens University - Canada,"Maynard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, McKinnan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",maynarda@uoguelph.ca; shimotsu@econ.queensu.ca,"Maynard, Alex/T-8253-2019; Shimotsu, Katsumi/K-5352-2012","Maynard, Alex/0000-0002-0596-527X; Shimotsu, Katsumi/0000-0002-4566-3137",,,,,44,13,13,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Two methods for estimating the transition intensities are given: the EM algorithm and an MCMC approach. The estimated transition intensities can be used to estimate the matrix of probabilities of transitions between all credit ratings, including default probabilities, over any time horizon. Thus the advantages of a continuous-time model can be obtained without continuous-time data. Estimates of the variance of estimators as well as confidence and credibility intervals are presented, and a test for equality of two intensity matrices is proposed. The methods are demonstrated by analysis of a large data set drawn from Moody's Corporate Bond Default Database, where reasonable estimates are obtained from annual observations.","[Sorensen, Michael] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Bladty, Mogens] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, IIMAS, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Copenhagen; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Sorensen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Univ Parken 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",michael@math.ku.dk,"Bladt, Mogens/AAT-6682-2021; Sorensen, Michael/M-5251-2014","Sorensen, Michael/0000-0001-7233-5377; Bladt, Mogens/0000-0003-4795-2773",,,,,17,28,33,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In particular, prices, interest rates, the commodity value of nominal savings (including money), and utility levels become determinate. Any indeterminacy of equilibrium consumption in the perturbed economy is thus insignificant to consumers, and some forecasting and comparative-statics policy exercises become possible.","Pepperdine Univ, Business Adm Div, Malibu, CA 90263 USA",Pepperdine University,"Burke, JL (通讯作者)，Pepperdine Univ, Business Adm Div, 24255 Pacific Coast Hwy, Malibu, CA 90263 USA.",Jon.Burke@Pepperdine.edu,,,,,,,5,2,2,0,9,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0012-9682,,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2009,77.0,1,,,,,235,247,,10.3982/ECTA5675,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,383ZG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000261712400008,0

ICA is a novel statistical signal processing technique that was originally proposed to find the latent source signals from observed mixture signal without knowing any prior knowledge of the mixing mechanism. SVR is an artificial intelligence forecasting technique and has been widely applied in time series prediction problems. The proposed approach first uses ICA to the forecasting variables for generating the independent components (ICs). After identifying and removing the ICs containing the noise, the rest of the ICs are then used to reconstruct the forecasting variables which contain less noise. The SVR then uses the denoised forecasting variables to build the forecasting model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) closing cash index is used as the illustrative example. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the SVR model with non-filtered forecasting variables and random walk model.","[Dai, Wenshen] Renmin Univ China, Financial Sch, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,,daiws@ruc.edu.cn; jywu@mail.lhu.edu.tw; jerrylu@cyu.edu.tw,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,1128,1132,,,,,,5,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600192,0

These features, motivating the use of GARCH models, make it difficult to predict times and sizes of losses that might occur. Estimation of losses, like the Value-at-Risk, often assume that returns, normalized by the level of volatility, are Gaussian. Often under ARMA-GARCH modeling, such scaled returns are heavy tailed and show extremal dependence, whose strength reduces when increasing extreme levels. We model heavy tails of scaled returns with generalized Pareto distributions, while extremal dependence can be reduced by declustering data.","[Laurini, Fabrizio] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Tawn, Jonathan A.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster, England",University of Parma; Lancaster University,"Laurini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, Via JF Kennedy 6, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",fabrizio.laurini@unipr.it,,,MIUR-COFIN 2004,"MIUR-COFIN 2004(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))",We thank two anonymous referees for valuable suggestions which improved the article.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is applied and compared with alternative techniques for estimating a Conditional Heteroskedastic AutoRegressive Nonlinear (CHARN) model. A multiscale decomposition analysis decomposes a time series into several scales, and then several separated SVRs, equal to the number of scales, are fed for running the CHARN model by scaled decomposed series. A multiscale CHARN model, which is an incorporation of wavelet decomposition analysis with a CHARN model estimated by SVR, is proposed and investigated using real-world data sets. To exploit the locality advantage of wavelets, we use wavelet analysis and combine it with SVR. Wavelets are able to economically describe phenomena that are heterogeneous. Recent studies on heterogeneous agents in financial markets theoretically support advocated scale-based analysis of markets, and, of course, the multiscale CHARN model proposition, since it is believed that each scale corresponds to each heterogeneous agent who acts differently in the market. Our objective is to improve the accuracy of estimation by applying multiscale decomposition. The results of applying SVR to estimate the CHARN model in a single resolution on real-world time series indicate that it outperforms the technical benchmarks. Also, the multiscale CHARN model estimated by SVR is more accurate than a single scale model.","[Safari, Amir; Seese, Detlef] Univ Karlsruhe TH, Inst Appl Informat & Formal Descript Method, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Safari, Amir] Ilan Univ, Ilam, Iran",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Safari, A (通讯作者)，Univ Karlsruhe TH, Inst Appl Informat & Formal Descript Method, Karlsruhe, Germany.",safari@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de,"Safari, Amir/AAI-8890-2020",,,,,,82,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

A model's predictions of key outcomes, such as screening effectiveness, depend on the values of unobservable natural history parameters. Calibration is the process of determining the values of unobservable parameters by constraining model output to replicate observed data. Because there are many approaches for model calibration and little consensus on best practices, we surveyed the literature to catalogue the use and reporting of these methods in cancer simulation models. We conducted a MEDLINE search (1980 through 2006) for articles on cancer-screening models and supplemented search results with articles from our personal reference databases. For each article, two authors independently abstracted pre-determined items using a standard form. Data items included cancer site, model type, methods used for determination of unobservable parameter values and description of any calibration protocol. All authors reached consensus on items of disagreement. Reviews and non-cancer models were excluded. Articles describing analytical models, which estimate parameters with statistical approaches (e.g. maximum likelihood) were catalogued separately. Models that included unobservable parameters were analysed and classified by whether calibration methods were reported and if so, the methods used. The review process yielded 154 articles that met our inclusion criteria and, of these, we concluded that 131 may have used calibration methods to determine model parameters. Although the term 'calibration' was not always used, descriptions of calibration or 'model fitting' were found in 50% (n = 66) of the articles, with an additional 16% (n = 21) providing a reference to methods. Calibration target data were identified in nearly all of these articles. Other methodological details, such as the goodness-of-fit metric, were discussed in 54% (n = 47 of 87) of the articles reporting calibration methods, while few details were provided on the algorithms used to search the parameter space. Our review shows that the use of cancer simulation modelling is increasing, although thorough descriptions of calibration procedures are rare in the published literature for these models. Calibration is a key component of model development and is central to the validity and credibility of subsequent analyses and inferences drawn from model predictions. To aid peer-review and facilitate discussion of modelling methods, we propose a standardized Calibration Reporting Checklist for model documentation.","[Stout, Natasha K.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ambulatory Care & Prevent, Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stout, Natasha K.; Gazelle, G.

It is very important to investigate the relationship between FDI and China's international trade structure. Using data from 1986 to 2005, this paper creates an index of TSA to measure the trade structure advantage and then analyses the effect of FDI on China's trade structure by the means of empirical study. The result shows that because of FDI's spill-over effect on technology, innovation and management, FDI has active impact on optimization of China's international trade structure in long term. At the meantime, there is high risk that FDI plays an opposite role in short term because of time lag from investment to income and the situation of high import low export in processing trade. Finally relevant suggestions are put forward to make good use of spill-over effect and manage the risk.","[Xiao Wen; Hou Tian] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,,ruby.zju@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,7,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,200,205,,,,,,6,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600032,0

Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of closed-form formulae for the valuation of mortality-linked liabilities and assets, and the consequent requirement for simulations within simulations. We propose the use of the probit function along with a Taylor expansion to approximate longevity-contingent values. This makes it possible to develop and implement computationally efficient, discrete-time delta hedging strategies using q-forwards as hedging instruments. The methods are tested using the model proposed by Cairns et al. (2006a) (CBD). We find that the probit approximations are generally very accurate, and that the discrete-time hedging strategy is very effective at reducing risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We directly model the small, moderate and large losses with the Pareto Positive Stable (PPS) distribution and thus it is not necessary to fix a threshold for the tail behaviour. Estimation with the method of moments is straightforward. Properties, graphical tests and expressions for value-at risk and tail value-at-risk are presented. Furthermore, we show that the PPS distribution can be used to construct a statistical test for the Pareto distribution and to determine the threshold for the Pareto shape if required. An application to loss data is presented. We conclude that the PPS distribution can perform better than commonly used distributions when modelling a single loss distribution for moderate and large losses. This approach avoids the pitfalls of cut-off selection and it is very simple to implement for quantitative risk analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It departs from the classical model by assuming that arbitrary quantities of each house may be available to the market. Justified envy considerations arise when two agents have the same initial endowment, or when an agent is in some sense disproportionately rewarded in comparison to her peers. For this general model, an algorithm is designed to find a fractional allocation of houses to agents that satisfies ordinal efficiency, individual rationality, and no justified envy. The analysis extends to the full preference domain. Individual rationality, ordinal efficiency, and no justified envy conflict with weak strategyproofness. Moreover, individual rationality, ordinal efficiency and strategyproofness are shown to be incompatible. Finally, two reasonable notions of envy-freeness, no justified envy and equal-endowment no envy, conflict in the presence of ordinal efficiency and individual rationality. All of the impossibility results hold in the strict preference domain.","[Sethuraman, Jay] Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Athanassoglou, Stergios] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Sethuraman, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, IEOR Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sa2164@columbia.edu; jay@ieor.columbia.edu,,"ATHANASOGLOU, Stergios/0000-0003-2321-5234",National Science Foundation [CMMI-0916453],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to Yeon-Koo Che, Herve Moulin, and to two anonymous referees for detailed comments on earlier versions of this paper.

A pointwise interval reflects uncertainty in a variable at a single time point, but it does not account for any dynamic property of the time-series. As a result, in situations when the path or trajectory of future mortality rates is important, a band of pointwise intervals might lead to an invalid inference. To improve the communication of uncertainty, a simultaneous prediction band can be used. The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate how simultaneous prediction bands can be created for prevalent stochastic models, including the Cairns-Blake-Dowd and Lee-Carter models.

The error distributions considered are drawn from the exponential dispersion family. Each of these models is examined with respect to sufficient statistics and completeness (Section 5), minimum variance estimators (Section 6) and maximum likelihood (Section 7). The chain ladder is found to provide maximum likelihood and minimum variance unbiased estimates of loss reserves under a wide range of recursive models.

A special case is the stationary fractional cointegration model, which has found important applications recently, especially in financial economics. Previous research on this model has considered a semi-parametric narrow-band least squares (NBLS) estimator in the frequency domain, but in the stationary case its asymptotic distribution has been derived only under a condition of non-coherence between regressors and errors at the zero frequency. We show that in the absence of this condition, the NBLS estimator is asymptotically biased, and also that the bias can be consistently estimated. Consequently, we introduce a fully modified NBLS estimator which eliminates the bias, and indeed enjoys a faster rate of convergence than NBLS in general. We also show that local Whittle estimation of the integration order of the errors can be conducted consistently based on NBLS residuals, but the estimator has the same asymptotic distribution as if the errors were observed only under the condition of non-coherence. Furthermore, compared to much previous research, the development of the asymptotic distribution theory is based on a different spectral density representation, which is relevant for multivariate fractionally integrated processes, and the use of this representation is shown to result in lower asymptotic bias and variance of the narrow-band estimators. We present simulation evidence and a series of empirical illustrations to demonstrate the feasibility and empirical relevance of our methodology.","[Nielsen, Morten Orregaard] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Frederiksen, Per] Nordea Markets, DK-0900 Copenhagen C, Denmark",Queens University - Canada,"Nielsen, MO (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Dunning Hall, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",mon@econ.queensu.ca; per.frederiksen@nordea.com,,"Nielsen, Morten Orregaard/0000-0002-1337-9844",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [410-2009-0183]; Danish Social Sciences Research Council (FSE) [275-05-0220]; Danish National Research Foundation,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Danish Social Sciences Research Council (FSE)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We are grateful to the editor Pierre Perron, two anonymous referees, Javier Hualde, Lealand Morin, Benoit Perron, Katsumi Shimotsu and participants at the 2006 Summer Econometrics Workshop in Aarhus and the 2006 European Meeting of the Econometric Society in Vienna for useful and constructive comments, and to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC grant no. 410-2009-0183), the Danish Social Sciences Research Council (FSE grant no. 275-05-0220) and the Centre for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES, funded by the Danish National Research Foundation) for financial support.

One of the major risk groups for IFIs are patients with haematological malignancies treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These IFIs are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Consequently, as the diagnosis of IFIs is difficult, antifungal prophylaxis is desirable in high-risk patients. Furthermore, as the economic impact of IFIs is also significant, it is important to assess the cost benefit and cost effectiveness of each prophylactic agent in order to aid decisions concerning which prophylactic agent provides the best value for limited healthcare resources. This article systematically reviews the available pharmacoeconomic evidence regarding antifungal prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients treated for haematological malignancies. Furthermore, specific points of interest concerning economic analyses of antifungal prophylaxis are briefly discussed. Considering the available evidence, antifungal prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients treated for haematological malignancies seems to be an intervention with favourable cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost-saving potential. Furthermore, recently introduced antifungal agents seem to be attractive alternatives to fluconazole from a pharmacoeconomic point of view. However, due to wide heterogeneity in patient characteristics, underlying diseases, hospital settings and study methods in the included economic studies, as well as the lack of 'head-to-head' trials, it is difficult to find clear evidence of the economic advantages of a single prophylactic agent. Furthermore, we show that the results of cost-effectiveness analyses are highly dependent on several crucial factors that influence the baseline IFI incidence rates and, therefore, differ per patient population or region.","[Pechlivanoglou, Petros; De Vries, Robin; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon PE2, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Daenen, Simon M.

Examples include convex combination, convolution, and the worst-case operator. Here we study the risk measure that is constructed from a family of given risk measures by the best-case operator; that is, the newly constructed risk measure is defined as the one that is as restrictive as possible under the condition that it accepts all positions that are accepted under any of the risk measures from the family. In fact we define this operation for conditional risk measures, to allow a multiperiod setting. We show that the well-known VaR risk measure can be constructed from a family of conditional expectations by a combination that involves both worst-case and best-case operations.

In the first of two articles that provide updated reviews and analyses of the economic burden of RCC, we conducted an updated literature review of RCC-related economic studies. We performed a literature search of PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for English-language studies published from 1 January 2000 to 15 June 2010. We also performed a separate search for related studies in the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports published by the National Institute for Health Research HTA Programme in the UK. Identified articles were classified into three categories: cost studies, cost-effectiveness/cost-utility studies and cost-of-illness studies. All cost estimates were normalized to $US, year 2009 values. We identified 20 articles, including six cost, six cost-utility and eight cost-of-illness studies. In general, the studies found new surgical techniques, such as laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, to be potentially cost saving (in the range of $US181-5842). Targeted agents, such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib and temsirolimus, were associated with higher lifetime costs ($US8537-72 254) and were not always considered to be cost effective by authors of the cost-effectiveness studies included in this review (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: $US49 959-272 418 per QALY). The literature reported annual estimates of the US economic burden of RCC between $US0.60 billion and $US5.19 billion, with per-patient costs of $US16 488-43 805. RCC is associated with substantial economic burden, although the estimates are wide ranging. Comparisons of the estimates across studies were hindered by variations in study methodology, choice of database and the associated timeframe, and limitations inherent to each database. More research is needed to assess the quality of the economic studies of RCC and to understand why the estimated costs differ across studies.","[Shih, Ya-Chen T.; Xu, Ying; Pan, I-Wen] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Quantitat Sci, Dept Biostat, Sect Hlth Serv Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chien, Chun-Ru] China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Smith, Grace L.; Buchholz, Thomas A.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Shih, YCT (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sect Hosp Med, 5841 S Maryland,MC 2007, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tshih@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,"Pan, Iwen/M-2335-2016","Pan, Iwen/0000-0002-2781-2629; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864; Smith, Grace/0000-0002-3171-2911","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [R01 HS018535]; China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan [DMR-98-132]; Department of Health, Taiwan [DOH99-TD-C-111005]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan; Department of Health, Taiwan","This research was partially funded by a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, R01 HS018535) to Ya-Chen Tina Shih, and a grant from the China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan (DMR-98-132) and a grant from the Department of Health, Taiwan (DOH99-TD-C-111005) to Chun-Ru Chien.

Weakly dependent sequences are characterized by absolutely summable impulse response coefficients of their Wold representation. The weights b(n) decay at the rate n(d-1) and are not absolutely summable for long memory models (d > 0). It has been believed that this rate is inherited by the impulse responses of any long memory fractionally integrated model.

It is well known that for the perfect hedging the writer of the option must trade continuously in time, which is impossible in practice. In reality, the writer hedges only at some discrete time instants. The perfect hedging requires the knowledge of the partial derivative of the value function of the American option in the underlying asset, the explicit form of which is unknown in most cases of practical importance. Several approximation methods have been developed for the calculation of the value function of the American option. We claim in this paper that having at hand any uniform approximation of the American option value function at equidistant discrete rebalancing times it is possible to construct a discrete time hedging portfolio, the value process of which uniformly approximates the value process of the continuous time perfect delta-hedging portfolio. We are able to estimate the corresponding discrete time hedging error that leads to a complete justification of our hedging method for nonincreasing convex payoff functions including the important case of the American put. This method is essentially based on a new type square integral estimate for the derivative of an arbitrary convex function recently found by Shashiashvili.","[Shashiashvili, M.] Govt Coll Univ, Abdus Salam Sch Math Sci, Lahore 54600, Pakistan",Government College University Lahore,"Shashiashvili, M (通讯作者)，Govt Coll Univ, Abdus Salam Sch Math Sci, 68-B New Muslim Town, Lahore 54600, Pakistan.",mshashiashvili@yahoo.com,"Shashiashvili, Malkhaz/AAG-2869-2020",,Higher Education Commission of Islamabad,Higher Education Commission of Islamabad,The support of Higher Education Commission of Islamabad is gratefully acknowledged.,,10,11,11,2,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0960-1627,,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We note that earlier HECM models use static mortality tables, neglecting the dynamics of mortality rates and extreme mortality jumps. The earlier models also assume housing prices follow a geometric Brownian motion, which contradicts the fact that housing prices exhibit strong autocorrelation and varying volatility over time. To solve these problems, we propose a generalized Lee-Carter model with asymmetric jump effects to fit the mortality data, and model the house price index via an ARIMA-GARCH process. We then employ the conditional Esscher transform to price the non-recourse provision of reverse mortgages and compare it with the calculated mortgage insurance premiums.

Various longevity derivatives have been proposed, and the capital market has experienced one unsuccessful attempt by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 2004. After carefully analyzing the pros and cons of previous securitizations, we present our proposed longevity bonds, whose payoffs are structured as a series Of Put option spreads. We utilize a random walk model with drift to fit small variations of mortality improvements and employ extreme value theory to model rare longevity events. Our method is a new approach in longevity risk securitization, which has the advantage of both capturing mortality improvements within sample and extrapolating rare, out-of-sample longevity events. We demonstrate that the risk cubic model developed for pricing catastrophe bonds can be applied to mortality and longevity bond pricing and use the model to calculate risk premiums for longevity bonds.

This approach yields a simulated head-to-head trial and can address many of the differences among source trials It provides inputs for economic models and can inform decision makers until actual trial data are available A simulation is constructed to replicate an index trial, including enrolment, randomization and follow-up of patients The simulation is driven by predictive equations derived from the index trial Separate data for the comparators are used to calibrate the index equations to reflect the alternative interventions. The simulation is used to add the missing arms to the index trial and estimate the results that would have been obtained in a head-to-head trial. The STC can also be used to estimate results in various settings and populations and to explore variations in the trial design An STC offers a way to derive comparative effectiveness in the absence of direct trial evidence and a platform to test design features that may help in planning future head-to-head studies","[Caro, J.

The former shortcoming, which is due to the diffusive behaviour assumed for asset values, can be circumvented by considering discontinuous asset prices. In this paper the authors resort to a pure jump process of the Variance-Gamma type. First the authors calibrate the corresponding Merton type structural model to single-name data for the DJ CDX.NA.IG and CDX.NA.HY components. By so doing, they show that it also circumvents the diffusive structural models difficulties over longer horizons. Particularly, it corrects for the underprediction of low-risk spreads and the overprediction of high-risk ones. Then the authors extend the model to joint default, resorting to a recent formulation of the VG multivariate model and without superimposing a copula choice. They fit default correlation for a sample of CDX.NA names, using equity correlation. The main advantage of our joint model, with respect to the existing non-diffusive ones, is that it allows full calibration without the equicorrelation assumption, but still in a parsimonious way. As an example of the default assessments which the calibrated model can provide, the authors price an FtD swap.","[Luciano, Elisa] Univ Turin, ICER, Turin, Italy; [Fiorani, Filippo] Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, Turin, Italy; [Luciano, Elisa] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Bank of America Corporation; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Luciano, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, ICER, Turin, Italy.",luciano@econ.unito.it,"luciano, elisa/HTT-2306-2023","luciano, elisa/0000-0003-2992-3952; SEMERARO, Patrizia/0000-0003-2075-8196",Torino Finanza and its associates,Torino Finanza and its associates,"Patrizia Semeraro gratefully acknowledges financial support from Torino Finanza and its associates, in particular Unicredit and Toro Assicurazioni.

The research frontier in choice modelling is moving rapidly, with a number of issues being explored across several disciplines. These issues include the estimation of discount factors, proper modelling of the variance scale factor and the estimation of individual-level utility functions. Some of these issues are particularly acute when discrete choice tasks are used to facilitate extra-welfarist analyses that rely on population-based values. There are also potential problems in implementing such tasks that have received little interest in the non-health discrete choice literature because they are specific to the QALY framework.

The results suggest that the accruals management is not general for targets, which is associated with incentives of controlling shareholders related to the accruals. We investigate the shareholder wealth effects of equity transactions and their association with abnormal accruals and find the evidence that the outside investors cannot detect controlling shareholders' propping, but can at least partially see through the tunneling of controlling shareholders. Our results also indicate that the markets are hardly to fully recognize the difference of earnings management between controlling shareholders' propping and tunneling and outside investors cannot effectively predict and penalize the expropriation of minority shareholders only when the expropriation does occur.","[Li Shan-min; Mao Ya-juan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1164,1178,,,,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100163,0

Entrepreneurship is a set of special entrepreneur skills (including spirits and skills), especially the abilities of innovating, taking business risks, undertaking pressures, and etc. Because of the complexity, the innovativeness, and the impossibility of direct acquisition of entrepreneurship, professional investors should give a higher compensation to executives with this spirit. Being the most important professional investors in China's security markets, securities investment funds have large market scales and are in a fiercely competitive environment. Thus to listed firms, funds have the strongest monitoring motivation and relative strong monitoring capacity. They are also the strong backing to carry forward entrepreneurship. This paper aims to study the relationship between the pay level of executives in China's listed firms and fund investors' supporting level to entrepreneurship. The study finds: compared to executives in firms without shares owned by funds, executives in firms with shares owned by funds receive higher compensation; the higher proportion of fund ownership, the higher the pay level of the executives is. However, there is not a significant positive correlation between the pay levels of executives with the concentration of fund ownership.","[Li, Zhong-hai; Zhang, Di-xin; Wu, Xu-yue; Ma, Long-fei] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1118,1123,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100156,0

Therefore, the higher cost makes it impossible to compete with the traditional energy and the pricing strategy becomes the bottleneck. Based on the marginal opportunity cost theory of sustainable developing natural sources, this paper concentrates on the value composition of the renewable energy and demonstrates them by the way of the dynamic model, which reflects the relations among all the energies.

This article presents an extended application of the Partially Linear Additive Model (PLAM) to the analysis of gasoline demand using a panel of U. S. households, focusing mainly on the estimation of the price elasticity. Unlike previous semiparametric studies that use household-level data, we work with vehicle-level data within households that can potentially add richer details to the price variable. Both households and vehicles data are obtained from the Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS) of 1991 and 1994, conducted by the U. S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). As expected, the derived vehicle-based gasoline price has significant dispersion across the country and across grades of gasoline. By using a PLAM specification for gasoline demand, we obtain a measure of gasoline price elasticity that circumvents the implausible price effects reported in earlier studies. In particular, our results show the price elasticity ranges between -0.2, at low prices, and -0.5, at high prices, suggesting that households might respond differently to price changes depending on the level of price. In addition, we estimate separately the model to households that buy only regular gasoline and those that buy also midgrade/premium gasoline. The results show that the price elasticities for these groups are increasing in price and that regular households are more price sensitive compared to nonregular.","[Manzan, Sebastiano] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Zerom, Dawit] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Manzan, S (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, 1 Bernard Baruch Way, New York, NY 10010 USA.",sebastiano.manzan@baruch.cuny.edu,"Manzan, Sebastiano/C-4150-2014","Manzan, Sebastiano/0000-0002-0931-9769",,,,,29,13,13,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Objective: To evaluate a new method for assessing the potential cost savings of COPD controller medications based on the incidence of exacerbations and their related resource utilization in the general population. Methods: Patients with COPD (n = 1074) enrolled in a regional managed care system in the US were identified using administrative data and divided by their medication use into three groups (salbutamol, ipratropium and salmeterol). Exacerbations were captured using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) and current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, then logistic regression models were created that described the risk of exacerbations for each comparator group and exacerbation type over a 6-month period. A Monte Carlo simulation was then applied 1000 times to provide the range of potential exacerbation reductions and cost consequences in response to a range of hypothetical examples of COPD controller medications. Results: Exacerbation events for each group could be modelled such that the events predicted by the Monte Carlo estimates were very close to the actual prevalences. The estimated cost per exacerbation avoided depended on the incidence of exacerbation in the various subpopulations, the assumed relative risk reduction, the projected daily cost for new therapy, and the costs of exacerbation treatment. Conclusions: COPD exacerbation events can be accurately modelled from the healthcare utilization data of a defined cohort with sufficient accuracy for cost-effectiveness analysis. Treatments that reduce the risk or severity of exacerbations are likely to be cost effective among those patients who have frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations.","[Mapel, Douglas W.; Schum, Michael; Lydick, Eva] Lovelace Clin Fdn, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [Marton, Jeno P.] Pfizer US Outcomes Res Grp, New York, NY USA",Pfizer,"Mapel, DW (通讯作者)，Lovelace Clin Fdn, 2309 Renard Pl SE,Suite 103, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA.",Doug.Mapel@LCFresearch.org,,,"Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was funded by a grant from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Dr Marton is an employee of, and owns common stocks in, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and participated in the design, data interpretation and manuscript development.

We find striking scale-free behavior of the volatility after each switching occurs. We interpret our findings as being consistent with time-dependent collective behavior of financial market participants. We test the possible universality of our result by performing a parallel analysis of fluctuations in transaction volume and time intervals between trades.

Besides that, the regression result of the model demonstrates that economic growth of Jilin mainly depends on physical capital input; contribution rate of human capital input of Jilin is smaller than that of in economically developed region. Granger causality test results demonstrates that higher education should be developed to promote primary industry; economic growth of secondary industry and human capital of secondary and higher education have reciprocal causation relationship; education at each level depends on the development of tertiary industry in Jilin Province.","[Wang Wen-jing; Zhang Li] Northeast Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Lv Kang-yin] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Business, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China,,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,982,988,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100138,0

Rapid methods for the detection of HEVs in food packing process are important to the food industry and for public health. The LAMP assay of HEVs reported in this study was highly specific, sensitive, and easily diagnostic. A set of four primers was specially designed to strictly detect HEVs preferably HEV-A and HEV-B. The amplification was carried out under isothermal conditions at 61 degrees C, and the result could be obtained in less than 90 min and be monitored by naked-eye visualization. We observed specifically only for HEVs that HEV-A and HEV-B like and not for other viruses. The sensitivity of the assay was 10(1) copies/mu l of a cloned enterovirus 71 fragment, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of the PCR. We tested the LAMP assay in different samples including packaging film samples using for ready-to-eat food, source water and stool specimens by using this LAMP system. A negative result showed in packaging film while positive reaction could be observed in environmental samples and clinical specimens. These results indicate that the developed LAMP assay here has the potential to become a practical method for the rapid diagnosing HEVs preferably HEV-A and HEV-B in various samples.","[Yin, Guang-ya; Zhao, Guo-ping; Gao, Hong-sheng; Wang, Yi-zheng; Meng, Bin; Zhao, Hua-bing] Med Coll Chinese Peoples Armed Police Forces, Tianjin Key Lab Biomarkers Occupat & Environm Haz, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wei] China Packaging Res & Test Ctr, Tianjin 300457, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hong] Tianjin Entry Exit Inspect & Quarantine Bur, Tianjin 300042, Peoples R China; [Yin, Guang-ya; Gao, Hong-sheng; Cai, Bao-li] Hebei Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shijiazhuang 050017, Peoples R China; Nankai Univ, Dept Microbiol, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Hebei Medical University; Nankai University,"Zhao, HB (通讯作者)，Med Coll Chinese Peoples Armed Police Forces, Tianjin Key Lab Biomarkers Occupat & Environm Haz, Tianjin 300162, Peoples R China.",huabingzhao@yahoo.com.cn,"Gao, Hongsheng/G-2460-2010",,Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin [09JCYBJC08400],Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin),The work is supported by Grant 09JCYBJC08400 from the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin,,21,1,1,0,0,"SCI RES PUBL, INC-SRP",IRVIN,"5005 PASEO SEGOVIA, IRVIN, CA 92603-3334 USA",,,978-1-935068-46-4,,,,2010,,,,,,,115,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BUK40,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289654100026,0

We assume that the two independent claim counting processes are, respectively, the Poisson and the generalized Erlang(2) process. We prove that the Gerber-Shiu function satisfies some defective renewal equations. Exact representations for the solutions of these equations are derived through an associated compound geometric distribution and an analytic expression for this quantity is given when the claim severities have rationally distributed Laplace transforms. Further, the same risk model is considered in the presence of a constant dividend barrier. A system of integro-differential equations with certain boundary conditions for the Gerber-Shiu function is derived and solved. Using systems of integro-differential equations for the moment-generating function as well as for the arbitrary moments of the discounted sum of the dividend payments until ruin, a matrix version of the dividends-penalty is derived.

To examine this question, we suppose that players choose whether to take the initiative in each period. The player who tries to take the initiative is able to make an offer only when the other player does not. The probability that a player tries to take the initiative is referred to as the frequency of initiative taking. We assume that this is conditioned on mutually observable states and is, once chosen, unchangeable. When players make their frequency of initiative taking dependent on the identity of the latest proposer, the players alternate their offers (possibly with some stochastic delay). In contrast, when players always use the same frequency of initiative taking, or when players only distinguish odd-numbered from even-numbered periods for the frequency of initiative taking, both players constantly try to take the initiative.

In each step of the auction, to which set of sellers should those transfers be made is the key issue in the description of the algorithm. We assume additively separable utilities and introduce a novel distinction by considering multiple sellers owing multiple identical objects and multiple buyers with an exogenously defined quota, consuming more than one object but at most one unit of a seller's good and having multi-dimensional payoffs. This distinction induces a necessarily more complicated construction of the over-demanded sets than the constructions of these sets for the other assignment games. For this approach, our mechanism yields the buyer-optimal competitive equilibrium payoff, which equals the buyer-optimal stable payoff. The symmetry of the model allows to getting the seller-optimal stable payoff and the seller-optimal competitive equilibrium payoff can then be also derived.","[Sotomayor, Marilda] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-5508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sotomayor, Marilda] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Brown University,"Sotomayor, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908,Cidade Univ, BR-5508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",marildas@usp.br,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The motivation is to seek the most general possible framework for econometrics, NP estimation with no a priori assumptions on the functional relations nor on the observed data. In seeking the boundaries of the possible, however, we run against a sharp dividing line, which defines a necessary. and sufficient condition for NP estimation. We identify this condition somewhat surprisingly with a classic statistical assumption on the relative likelihood of bounded and unbounded events (DeGroot, 2004). Other equivalent conditions are found in other fields: decision theory and choice under uncertainty (monotone continuity axiom (Arrow, 1970), insensitivity to rare events (Chichilnisky, 2000), and dynamic growth models (dictatorship of the present; Chichilnisky, 1996). When the crucial condition works, NP estimation can be extended to the sample space R+. Otherwise the estimators, which are based on Fourier coefficients, do not converge: the underlying distributions are shown to have heavy tails and to contain purely finitely additive measures. Purely finitely additive measures are not constructible, and their existence has been shown to be equivalent to the axiom of choice in mathematics. Statistics and econometrics involving purely finitely additive measures are still open issues, which suggests the current limits of econometrics.","[Chichilnisky, Graciela] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Chichilnisky, G (通讯作者)，335 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10025 USA.",chichilnisky1@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

This probability measure is unique and optimal in the sense of minimizing the relative entropy with respect to the actuarial probability measure P, which is a common approach in the case of incomplete markets. After expounding the key elements of this theory, an application to a set of industrial property risks is developed, assuming that the severity of losses can be modeled by Swiss Re Exposure Curves, as discussed by Bernegger (1997). These curves belong to a parametric family of distribution functions commonly used by pricing actuaries. The quasi risk-neutral pricing approach not only yields risk exposure specific premiums but also Risk Adjusted Capital (RAC) values on the very same level of granularity By way of contrast, the conventional determination of RAC is typically considered on a portfolio level only.","[Niederau, Harry] Dr Niederau Consulting & Res, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Socioecon Inst, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Niederau, H (通讯作者)，Dr Niederau Consulting & Res, Hochstr 26, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland.",info@niederau-research.com; pzweifel@soi.uzh.ch,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2009,39.0,1,,,,,317,337,,10.2143/AST.39.1.2038067,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,464HJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000267495700014,0

They describe and interpret the results of a large Monte Carlo experiment designed to assess the effect of the sample size and the strength of dependence on the level and power of the blanket tests for various combinations of copula models under the null hypothesis and the alternative. To circumvent problems in the determination of the limiting distribution of the test statistics under composite null hypotheses, they recommend the use of a double parametric bootstrap procedure, whose implementation is detailed.

First, a characterization theorem of the subhypotheses comprising the seasonal unit root hypothesis is presented that provides a precise formulation of the alternative hypotheses associated with regression-based seasonal unit root tests. Second, it proposes regression-based tests for the seasonal unit root hypothesis that allow a general seasonal aspect for the data and are similar both exactly and asymptotically with respect to initial values and seasonal drift parameters. Third, limiting distribution theory is given for these statistics where, in contrast to previous papers in the literature, in doing so it is not assumed that unit roots hold at all of the zero and seasonal frequencies. This is shown to alter the large-sample null distribution theory for regression t-statistics for unit roots at the complex frequencies, but interestingly to not affect the limiting null distributions of the regression t-statistics for unit roots at the zero and Nyquist frequencies and regression F-statistics for unit roots at the complex frequencies. Our results therefore have important implications for how tests of the seasonal unit root hypothesis should be conducted in practice. Associated simulation evidence on the size and power properties of the statistics presented in this paper is given that is consonant with the predictions from the large-sample theory.","[Taylor, A.

Considering the strong reliance of knowledge transfer on the environment, while taking the restraining level of benefit decline after technology M&A as a short-term evaluation standard for ownership structure choice, this paper researches the critical role of ownership structures in curbing the decrease of benefits after technology M&A. And the empirical data of listed companies indicates that in listed companies with high owner, hip concentration, the supporting effect of majority shareholders' behavior can exert more influence to curb the benefit decline after technology M&A than the tunneling effect. Moreover, the ownership balance in large degree will confine the majority stockholders' will and behavior, which therefore can weaken their support effect and aggravate the benefit decline after technology M&A.","[Chen Haisheng; Zhou Wei; Liang Mingxia; Lan Hailin] S China Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,,haishengchen@163.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,598,604,,,,,,7,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600104,0

As cost-effectiveness analyses are used to inform national policy decisions and to determine the value of implemented chronic disease control programmes, it is imperative that complete and valid determination of healthcare utilization and costs can be obtained from existing state and federal databases. Differences and inconsistencies between the Medicaid and Medicare databases have presented significant challenges when extracting accurate data for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Objectives: To describe the challenges inherent in merging Medicaid and Medicare claims databases and to present a protocol that would allow successful linkage between these two disparate databases. Methods: Healthcare claims and costs were extracted from both Medicaid and Medicare databases for King County, Seattle, WA, USA. Three Medicaid files were linked to eight Medicare files for unique dual-eligible beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: Although major differences were identified in how variables and claims were defined in each database, our method enabled us to link these two different databases to compile a complete and accurate assessment of healthcare use and costs for dual-eligible beneficiaries with a costly chronic condition. For example, of the 1759 dual-eligible beneficiaries with diabetes, the average cost of healthcare was $US15 981 per capita, with an average of 76 claims per person per year. Conclusion: The resulting merged database provides a virtually complete documentation of both utilization and costs of medical care for a population who receives coverage from two different programmes. By identifying differences and implementing our linkage protocol, the merged database serves as a foundation for a broad array of analyses on healthcare use and costs for effectiveness research.","[Reiber, Gayle E.; McFarland, Lynne V.; Maynard, Charles] VA Puget Sound Healthcare Syst, Hlth Serv Res & Dev, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Prela, Cecilia M.] Ctr Medicare & Medicaid Serv, Medicare Plan Payment Grp, Div Risk Adjustment, Baltimore, MD USA; [Baumgardner, Greg A.] Qualis Hlth, Data Anal Team, Seattle, WA USA; [Anderson, Nancy] Med Assistance Adm, Olympia, WA USA; [Maciejewski, Matthew] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Vet Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System; CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"McFarland, LV (通讯作者)，VA Puget Sound Healthcare Syst, Hlth Serv Res & Dev, 1100 Olive Way 1400, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",lynne.mcfarland@va.gov,"Maynard, Charles/N-3906-2015","Maynard, Charles/0000-0002-1644-7814","Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [500-99-WA02]; US Department of Health and Human Services; Sandy MacColl Foundation, Seattle, Washington; The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Princeton, New York; Adventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Washington State Department of Health","Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; US Department of Health and Human Services; Sandy MacColl Foundation, Seattle, Washington; The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Princeton, New York(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Adventis Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Washington State Department of Health","The analyses upon which this publication is based were performed under contract number 500-99-WA02, funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

But Lithuanian rural tourism lacks variety of services and service quality. Studies of research done in Lithuania show that usually all rural tourism service providers offer the same services: meals, accommodation, boating, bicycle rent, or fishing. Consumers lack services such as organized trips, farm works, dance nights. Research also confirmed that consumers are not satisfied with the service quality. One of the key conditions for the development of rural tourism is to meet consumers' needs and expectations while improving quality of service. Quality of service promotes consumers' loyalty, attracts potential consumers, makes employees satisfied, and forms a proper image in the market. Those are the motivating factors for rural tourism establishments to seek high service quality and to continually improve it. The recommendation is to develop an evaluative service quality system and to apply the principles of total quality management in rural tourism business, ensuring that service meets the set standards. To stand out among competitors, rural tourism service providers have to concentrate their efforts on the development and management of people's intellect.","[Ramanauskiene, Jadvyga; Narkus, Mantas] Lithuanian Univ Agr, Dept Business Management, Fac Econ & Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,Jadvyga.Ramanauskiene@lzuu.lt; vadyba@lzuu.lt,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,5,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,121,126,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200020,0

Most implied barriers are typically larger than the book value of corporate liabilities. We show theoretically and empirically that this result is biased due to the approximation of the market value of corporate assets by the sum of the market value of equity and the book value of liabilities. This approximation leads to a significant overestimation of the default barrier. To eliminate this bias, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation approach to estimate the asset values, asset volatilities, and default barriers. The proposed framework is applied to empirically examine the default barriers of a large sample of industrial firms. This paper documents that default barriers are positive, but not very significant. In our sample, most of the estimated barriers are lower than the book values of corporate liabilities. In addition to the problem with the default barriers, we find significant biases on the estimation of the asset value and the asset volatility of Brockman and Turtle.","[Wong, Hoi Ying] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Choi, Tsz Wang] DBS Hong Kong, Dept Market Risk, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Wong, HY (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hywong@cuhk.edu.hk,"Wong, Hoi Ying/Q-9219-2019","Wong, Hoi Ying/0000-0001-9743-1832",HKSAR-RGC [402603],HKSAR-RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This paper was previously entitled The impact of default barrier on the market value of firm's assets''.

We focus on model risk arising from different specifications for the mortality intensity. To do so we assume that the mortality intensity is almost surely bounded under the statistical measure. Further, we restrict the equivalent martingale measures and apply the same bounds to the mortality intensity under these measures. For this setting we derive upper and lower price bounds for unit-linked life insurance contracts using stochastic control techniques. We also show that the induced hedging strategies indeed produce a dynamic superhedge and subhedge under the statistical measure in the limit when the number of contracts increases. This justifies the bounds for the mortality intensity under the pricing measures. We provide numerical examples investigating fixed-term, endowment insurance contracts and their combinations including various guarantee features. The pricing partial differential equation for the upper and lower price bounds is solved by finite difference methods. For our contracts and choice of parameters the pricing and hedging is fairly robust with respect to misspecification of the mortality intensity. The model risk resulting from the uncertain mortality intensity is of minor importance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although it is common to see variable annuity guarantees written on multiple funds, existing pricing methods are, by and large, based on stochastic processes for one single asset only. In this article, we fill this gap by developing a multivariate valuation framework. First, we consider a multivariate regime-switching model for modeling returns on various assets at the same time. We then identify a risk-neutral probability measure for use with the model under consideration. This is accomplished by a multivariate extension of the regime-switching conditional Esscher transform. We further extend our results to the situation when the guarantee being valued is linked to equity indexes measured in foreign currencies. In particular, we derive a probability measure that is risk-neutral from the perspective of domestic investors. Finally, we illustrate our results with a hypothetical variable annuity guarantee.

We use the Frank copula to jointly model the type of coverage and the number of accidents, with the dependence parameter providing for evidence of the relationship between the choice of coverage and the frequency of accidents. This dependence therefore provides an indication of the presence (or absence) of asymmetric information. The type of coverage is in some sense ordered so that coverage with higher ordinals indicate the most comprehensive coverage. Henceforth, a positive relationship would indicate that more coverage is chosen by high risk policyholders, and vice versa. This presence of asymmetric information could be due to either adverse selection or moral hazard, a distinction often made in the economics or insurance literature, or both. We calibrated our copula model using a one-year cross-sectional observation of claims arising from a major automobile insurer in Singapore. Our estimation results indicate a significant positive coverage-risk relationship. However, when we correct for the bias resulting from possible underreporting of accidents, we find that the positive association vanishes. We further used our estimated model for other possible actuarial applications. In particular, we are able to demonstrate the effect of coverage choice on the incidence of accidents, and based on which, the pure premium is derived. In general, a positive margin is observed when compared with the gross premium available in our empirical database. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Participating life insurance (PLI) contracts have been the focus especially. These policies are typically characterized by a term life insurance, a minimum interest rate guarantee, and bonus participation rules with regard to the insurer's asset returns or reserve situation. Researchers replicate these bonus policies quite differently. We categorize and formally present the most common PLI bonus distribution mechanisms. These bonus models closely mirror the Danish, German, British, and Italian regulatory framework. Subsequently, we perform a comparative analysis of the different bonus models with regard to risk valuation. We calibrate contract parameters so that the compared contracts have a net present value of zero and the same safety level as the initial position, using risk-neutral valuation. Subsequently, we analyze the effect of changes in the asset volatility and in the initial reserve amount (per contract) on the value of the default put option (DPO), while keeping all other parameters constant. Our results show that DPO values obtained with the PLI bonus distribution model of Bacinello (2001), which replicates the Italian regulatory framework, are most sensitive to changes in volatility and initial reserves.

We view term assurance contracts as a swap in which policyholders exchange cash flows (premiums vs. benefits) with an insurer analogous to a generic interest rate swap or credit default swap. Using a simple bootstrapping procedure, we derive the term structure of mortality rates from a stream of contract quotes with different maturities. This term structure is used to calibrate the parameters of affine stochastic mortality models where the survival probability is expressed in closed form. The Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and jump-extended Vasicek models are considered for fitting the survival probabilities term structure.

This estimator is based on the spectral decomposition of the convolution operator, which is compact for an appropriate choice of reference spaces. The density is approximated by a sequence of orthonormal eigenfunctions of the convolution operator. The resulting estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. While most estimation methods assume that the characteristic function (CF) of the error does not vanish, we relax this assumption and allow for isolated zeros. For instance, the CF of the uniform and symmetrically truncated normal distributions have isolated zeros. We show that, in the presence of zeros, the density is identified even though the convolution operator is not one-to-one. We propose two consistent estimators of the density. We apply our method to the estimation of the measurement error density of hourly income collected from survey data.","[Carrasco, Marine] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Florens, Jean-Pierre] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Carrasco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",marine.carrasco@umontreal.ca,"Carrasco, Marine/ACU-3814-2022",,National Science Foundation; SSHRC,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors thank James Stock for suggesting this line of research to them.

Trastuzumab was established as a cost-effective adjuvant treatment in 2006. We present an updated cost-effectiveness analysis from the UK perspective, which explores assumptions about the duration of benefit from treatment, pattern of metastatic recurrence and long-term cardiac toxicity. Objective: The objective of this study was to calculate, from the UK NHS perspective, expected costs (year 2008 values) and benefits over the lifetime of an average cohort of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with or without 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab sequentially after chemotherapy. Methods: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a discrete-state time-dependent semi-Markov model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to characterize uncertainty around expected outcomes. Value-of-information (VOI) analysis was used to identify areas of priority for further research. Results: The cost-effectiveness estimates were highly sensitive to the estimated duration of treatment benefit. Trastuzumab remained a cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30 pound 000 per QALY provided the duration of benefit was more than 3.6 years from treatment initiation, assuming the hazard ratio for disease-free survival was 0.63. An increasing proportion of brain metastases with trastuzumab produced a small change towards worse cost effectiveness. Long-term cardiac toxicity needed to rise to high levels to affect overall life expectancy and cost effectiveness. VOI analysis placed highest value on research into the duration of treatment benefit. The relationships between progression-free survival and overall survival and the costs of cancer recurrence were also important. Conclusion: The cost effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab remains uncertain and dependent on assumptions regarding its clinical effect. Uncertainty around cost effectiveness could be reduced by further research into the duration of treatment effect, particularly in subgroups where this may be shorter. Longterm follow-up is warranted and methods to accurately measure duration of treatment effect and late toxicities should be developed for future adjuvant drug studies.","[Hall, Peter S.; Hulme, Claire; McCabe, Christopher; Oluboyede, Yemi; Round, Jeff] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Hall, Peter S.; Cameron, David A.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Mol Med, Sect Oncol & Clin Res, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Cameron, David A.] Western Gen Hosp, Edinburgh Canc Res Ctr, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Edinburgh,"Hall, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Charles Thackrah Bldg,101 Clarendon Rd, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England.",p.s.hall@leeds.ac.uk,"Hall, Peter S/O-3131-2019; McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016; Cameron, David A/C-7781-2013; Hulme, Charles/B-4115-2013","Hall, Peter S/0000-0001-6015-7841; Cameron, David A/0000-0002-2717-7979; Hulme, Claire/0000-0003-2077-0419; Round, Jeff/0000-0002-3103-6984",UK National Institute for Health Research; UK NHS; Roche Ltd.,UK National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); UK NHS; Roche Ltd.,"The authors thank Christopher Plummer, Sandy Tubeuf, Roberta Longo and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Due to the advantages in terms of the data, many studies investigate US data. However, with the increased flows of capital into emerging markets, studying the behavior of international mutual funds in emerging markets has become more and more important. Nevertheless, studies involving emerging markets are relatively rare. This study examines whether the positive feedback effect and herding behavior exist in Asian markets based on mutual fund data covering the period from 1996 to 2004. The long period enables us to test the sensitivities under the following four conditions, namely the capital volatility (volatile vs. stable), the degree of suffering during the Asian crisis (more suffering vs. less suffering), and the timing of the Asian crisis (pre-, during, and post-crisis), using the exchange rate regime. It was found in this study that mutual fund inflows into the Asian market were attracted by positive stock returns and currency appreciation. Furthermore, it was found that the positive feedback effect and herding behavior did exist in the Asian markets. However, the extent of the above behavior is not the same under different conditions.","[Yang, Tzu-Yi] Hwa Hsia Inst Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Meng-Fen] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Yang, Yu-Tai] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Tao Yuan, Taiwan; [Lee, Jen-Sin] I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; I Shou University,"Yang, TY (通讯作者)，Hwa Hsia Inst Technol, Dept Assets & Property Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",lori405@gmail.com,"Lee, Jen-Sin/AAL-3411-2020",,,,,,36,31,31,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Wet AMD in particular has a major impact on patient quality of life and imposes substantial burdens on healthcare systems. This systematic review examined the cost-effectiveness data for current therapeutic options for wet AMD. PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for all articles reporting original cost-effectiveness analyses of wet AMD treatments. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all wet AMD health technology assessments (HTAs). Overall, 44 publications were evaluated in full and included in this review. A broad range of cost-effectiveness analyses were identified for the most commonly used therapies for wet AMD (pegaptanib, ranibizumab and photodynamic therapy [PDT] with verteporfin). Three studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab in wet AMD. A small number of analyses of other treatments, such as laser photocoagulation and antioxidant vitamins, were also found. Ranibizumab was consistently shown to be cost effective for wet AMD in comparison with all the approved wet AMD therapies (four of the five studies identified showed ranibizumab was cost effective vs usual care, PDT or pegaptanib); however, there was considerable variation in the methodology for cost-effectiveness modelling between studies. Findings from the HTAs supported those from the PubMed and EM BASE searches; of the seven HTAs that included ranibizumab, six (including HTAs for Australia, Canada and the UK) concluded that ranibizumab was cost effective for the treatment of wet AMD; most compared ranibizumab with PDT and/or pegaptanib. By contrast, HTAs at best generally recommended pegaptanib or PDT for restricted use in subsets of patients with wet AMD. In the literature analyses, pegaptanib was found to be cost effective versus usual/best supportive care (including PDT) or no treatment in one of five studies; the other four studies found pegaptanib was of borderline cost effectiveness depending on the stage of disease and time horizon. PDT was shown to be cost effective versus usual/best supportive care or no treatment in five of nine studies; two studies showed that PDT was of borderline cost effectiveness depending on baseline visual acuity, and two showed that PDT was not cost effective. We identified no robust studies that properly evaluated the cost effectiveness of bevacizumab in wet AMD.","[Mitchell, Paul] Univ Sydney, Westmead Hosp, Eye Clin B4A, Discipline Ophthalmol, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [White, Richard] Oxford PharmaGenesis Ltd, Res Evaluat Unit, Oxford, England; [Gallagher, Meghan] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Thomas, Simu] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",NSW Health; Westmead Hospital; University of Sydney; Ghent University; Novartis; Novartis,"Mitchell, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Westmead Hosp, Eye Clin B4A, Discipline Ophthalmol, Hawkesbury Rd, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.",paul.mitchell@sydney.edu.au,"Mitchell, Paul/P-1498-2014; White, Richard/D-5407-2009","White, Richard/0000-0003-4410-6635; White, Richard/0000-0002-6494-8162","Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; Novartis Pharma AG; Pfizer; Allergan; Solvay; Novartis","Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; Novartis Pharma AG; Pfizer(Pfizer); Allergan(AbbVieAllergan); Solvay(Solvay SA); Novartis(Novartis)","All authors participated in the development and writing of the manuscript, and approved the final article for publication.

By applying Taylor's theorem, dynamic hedging portfolios are constructed under different market assumptions, such as the existence of power jump assets or moment swaps. In the case of European options or baskets of European options, static hedging is implemented. It is shown that perfect hedging can be achieved. Delta and gamma hedging strategies are extended to higher moment hedging by investing in other traded derivatives depending on the same underlying asset. This development is of practical importance as such other derivatives might be readily available. Moment swaps or power jump assets are not typically liquidly traded. It is shown how minimal variance portfolios can be used to hedge the higher order terms in a Taylor expansion of the pricing function, investing only in a risk-free bank account, the underlying asset, and potentially variance swaps. The numerical algorithms and performance of the hedging strategies are presented, showing the practical utility of the derived results.","[Yip, Wing Yan] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Stephens, David] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Olhede, Sofia] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",Imperial College London; McGill University; University of London; University College London,"Yip, WY (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England.",wing.yip01@ic.ac.uk,"Olhede, Sofia Charlotta/C-2140-2008","Stephens, David/0000-0001-9811-7140; Olhede, Sofia/0000-0003-0061-227X",,,,,24,3,3,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0960-1627,,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Arias & Haara (1984) suggested marked point processes (MPPs) as useful models for life history data with complex covariates. Age-at-onset distributions (or equivalently, hazard rates) in respect of inherited disorders are often estimated from pedigrees, which are life histories with unusually complex covariates, as well as strong dependencies induced by shared genes. Since Elston (1973) parametric models have often been used, conditioning the likelihood on known genotypes. However, a genotype identified by a presymptomatic genetic test is a form of internal covariate (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002). We propose a very general MPP model of a pedigree, including presymptomatic genetic testing, ('the full model') and show under what circumstances the partial model leading to Elston's likelihood is valid. In practice, pedigrees are often ascertained retrospectively. Many such events can be modelled by augmenting the natural filtration of the MPR We show that, except in simple special cases, the partial model is no longer valid, and the resulting likelihoods appear to be intractable. In particular, ascertainment interacts even with independent censoring so that likelihoods no longer factorize. For one simple special case - studies of sibships - we generalise a classical result to age-at-onset data. We conclude that the study of genetic conditions with variable age at onset gains insights from the underlying principles of survival analysis in their modern form, but that great care is needed in translating epidemiological studies into actuarial models.","[Macdonald, Angus S.] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Macdonald, Angus S.] Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University; Heriot Watt University; University of Edinburgh,"Macdonald, AS (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",A.S.Macdonald@ma.hw.ac.uk,,,Genetics and Insurance Research Centre at Heriot-Watt University,Genetics and Insurance Research Centre at Heriot-Watt University,"This work was carried out at the Genetics and Insurance Research Centre at Heriot-Watt University.

The model selection test is applicable to dynamic models with very general selection criteria and estimation methods. Since our test statistic does not assume the exact form of a true model, the test is essentially non-parametric once competing models are estimated. For the unknown serial correlation in data, we use a Heteroscedasticity/Autocorrelation-Consistent (HAC) variance estimator, and the sampling distribution of the test statistic is approximated by the fixed-b asymptotic approximation. The asymptotic approximation depends on kernel functions and bandwidth parameters used in HAC estimators. We compare the finite sample performance of the new test with the bootstrap methods as well as with the standard normal approximations, and show that the fixed-b asymptotics and the bootstrap methods are markedly superior to the standard normal approximation for a moderate sample size for time series data. An empirical application for foreign exchange rate forecasting models is presented, and the result shows the normal approximation to the distribution of the test statistic considered appears to overstate the data's ability to distinguish between two competing models.","[Choi, Hwan-Sik] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kiefer, Nicholas M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Kiefer, Nicholas M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Kiefer, Nicholas M.] Univ Aarhus, CREATES, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Cornell University; Cornell University; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Choi, HS (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 3035 Allen,4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",hwansik.choi@tamu.edu; nmk1@cornell.edu,,,,,,,35,8,9,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

We fit this model to data from the TASS database over the period 2000 to 2005. We let {An} and {Bn} be independent sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables, allowing general distributions, with An and Bn independent of Xn-1, where E[Bn] = 0. This model is appealing because it can involve relatively few parameters, can be analysed, and can be fitted to the limited and somewhat unreliable data reasonably well. The key model parameters are the year-to-year persistence factor E[An] and the noise variance [image omitted]. The model was chosen primarily to capture the observed persistence, which ranges from 0.11 to 0.49 across eleven different hedge-fund strategies, according to regression analysis. The constant-persistence normal-noise special case with An = and Bn (and thus Xn) normal provides a good fit for some strategies, but not for others, largely because in those other cases the observed relative-return distribution has a heavy tail. We show that the heavy-tail case can also be successfully modelled within the same general framework. The model is evaluated by comparing model predictions with observed values of (i) the relative-return distribution, (ii) the lag-1 auto-correlation and (iii) the hitting probabilities of high and low thresholds within the five-year period.","[Derman, Emanuel; Park, Kun Soo; Whitt, Ward] Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Whitt, W (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ww2040@columbia.edu,"Whitt, Ward/D-5337-2013; Park, Kun Soo/C-1819-2011",,"NSF [DMI-0457095]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [0948190] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",Ward Whitt was partially supported by NSF grant DMI-0457095.,,44,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We show that these models have limiting stationary distributions and characterize these limits. We show that the tails of both the transient and stationary distributions of these models are necessarily exponential or Gaussian; in the non-Gaussian case, we characterize the tail decay rate for any linear combination of factors. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear combination of factors to be Gaussian.

The debilitating symptoms during an acute episode require intensive treatment, frequently leading to inpatient psychiatric care, which places significant demands on health and social care systems and incurs substantial costs. However, no study to date has estimated the economic impact of relapse. Objectives: To estimate the direct costs associated with relapse in the treatment of BD following an acute manic or mixed episode over a 21-month follow-up period in routine clinical practice in Europe, using data from a large, prospective, observational study. Methods: EMBLEM was a prospective, observational study on the outcomes of patients with a manic/mixed episode of BD conducted in 14 European countries. Patients eligible for analysis were those enrolled in the 21-month maintenance phase of the study, following the 3-month acute phase. Relapse was defined as achieving any one of the following criteria: (i) at least a one-point increase in Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) overall score from the previous visit, with a final rating of >= 4; (ii) inpatient admission for an acute episode of BD; or (iii) psychiatrists' confirmation of relapse. Data on healthcare resource use were recorded retrospectively for the four respective periods (3-6, 6-12, 12-18 and 18-24 month visits). Multivariate analyses were performed to compare the cost of resource use (inpatient stay, day care, psychiatrist visits and medication) for those who relapsed during the 21-month maintenance phase and those who never relapsed. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the 6-month costs during relapse. The analyses were adjusted for patient characteristics and took account of non-Normality of the cost data by using a log link function. UK unit costs were applied to resource use. The analysis was repeated after multiple imputation for missing data. All costs were presented as year 2007/08 values. Results: A total of 1379 patients completed all visits during the maintenance phase and were eligible for inclusion in the present analysis. Of these, over half (54.3%) experienced relapse during this period. A total of 792 patients without any missing data were eventually included in the final cost model. Costs incurred by patients who relapsed during the 21-month maintenance phase were approximately double those incurred by patients who never relapsed (9140 pound vs 4457; pound p < 0.05). Of the cost difference, 80.3% was accounted for by inpatient stay. Estimates on the economic impact were higher (11 pound 781 vs 4789; pound p < 0.05) in the additional analysis with imputed missing data. The impact of relapse was even greater in the 6-month cost comparison. The average 6-month costs for patients who relapsed were found to be about three times higher than for those who did not relapse (4083 pound vs 1298; pound p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings confirm the significant economic impact of relapse in BD patients after an acute manic or mixed episode, even when considering direct costs only. Such costs were dominated by inpatient stay. Nevertheless, the use of UK unit costs requires caution when interpreting this costing in the context of a specific country, as resource use and the associated costs will differ by country.","[Hong, Jihyung; Knapp, Martin] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Personal Social Serv Res Unit, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hong, Jihyung; Reed, Catherine; Novick, Diego] Eli Lilly & Co, European Hlth Outcomes Res, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [Maria Haro, Josep] St Joan de Deu SSM, Barcelona, Spain; [Windmeijer, Frank] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England; [Knapp, Martin] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Ctr Econ Mental Hlth, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Eli Lilly; University of Bristol; University of London; King's College London,"Hong, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, LSE Hlth, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.hong@lse.ac.uk,"Windmeijer, Frank/AAL-5695-2020; Haro, Josep Maria/D-1423-2011; Knapp, Martin RJ/G-3011-2011","Knapp, Martin/0000-0003-1427-0215; Windmeijer, Frank/0000-0002-4232-2783",Eli Lilly and Company; ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The EMBLEM study was supported by Eli Lilly and Company.

And then, conjoint analysis will be applied to test utility preference of knowledge flow, in order to deepen researches of knowledge flow. The conclusion finds that it needs to select right conditions in the process of knowledge flow, and different chains have different requirements. The two supply chains both consider inter-firm cooperation to be effective variables. However, the manufacturing supply chain proposed higher requirements on the technology in the knowledge embedded, while the IT-business supply chain emphasizes on staff's knowledge.","[Hua Lian-lian; Zhang Wu-yi] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China",Kunming University of Science & Technology,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,397,402,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100056,0

Parameter estimation indicates that China's money supply mechanism does not target oil price shock, but makes a significant pro-cyclical response to output and a counter-cyclical reaction to inflation. It also shows that the persistence and volatility of oil price shocks are much stronger than that of other exogenous shocks. Impulse analysis exhibits that oil price shocks exert a lasting contraction effect on output and consumption, and meanwhile push inflation up. Furthermore, forecast error variance decomposition and historical decomposition reveal that the impact of oil price shock is stronger than other five shocks, and it is one of the main sources of China's economic fluctuation.","[Jian Zhi-hong; Li Shuang; Zheng Jun-yao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1503,1512,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100204,0

This new approach is based on wavelet analysis, which decomposes a given time series on a scale-by-scale basis. Empirical results indicate that, as the investment horizon lengthens, a greater weighting should be allocated to stocks. An explanation for this result is that the mean-reverting property of stock returns causes investors to perceive that stocks are less risky than bonds and T-bills at longer time scales compared with shorter time scales. When we include the effect of risk aversion, it is found that the higher the risk aversion, the less the Sharpe ratio, indicating that a more conservative investor prefers a smoother consumption stream.","[In, Francis] Monash Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Kim, Sangbae] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taegu 702701, South Korea",Monash University; Kyungpook National University,"In, F (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",francis.in@buseco.monash.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP098678],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors thank two anonymous referees for their helpful and constructive comments and suggestions and are pleased to acknowledge the support of the Australian Research Council (grant number DP098678).,,34,22,23,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, we focus on the collective and Bayes net premiums for the aggregate amount of claims under a compound model assuming some degree of dependence between the random variables Theta(1), and Theta(2). The degree of dependence is modelled using the Sarmanov-Lee family of distributions [Sarmanov, O.V., 1966. Generalized normal correlation and two-dimensional Frechet classes.

Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection with regime switching: A continuous-time model, SIAM J. Control Optim. 42 (4), 1466-1482]. We assume that the risky stock's price is governed by a Markovian regime-switching geometric Brownian motion, and the liability follows a Markovian regime-switching Brownian motion with drift, respectively. The evolution of appreciation rates, volatility rates and the interest rates are modulated by the Markov chain, and the Markov switching diffusion is assumed to be independent of the underlying Brownian motion. The correlation between the risky asset and the liability is considered. The objective is to minimize the risk (measured by variance) of the terminal wealth subject to a given expected terminal wealth level. Using the Lagrange multiplier technique and the linear-quadratic control technique, we get the expressions of the optimal portfolio and the mean-variance efficient frontier in closed forms. Further, the results of our special case without liability is consistent with those results of Zhou and Yin [Zhou, X.Y., Yin, G., 2003.

Fixed effects, random effects, and Bayesian approaches all fall into this category. We provide a characterization of the class of weights (or priors) that produce estimators that are first-order unbiased. We show that such bias-reducing weights will depend on the data in general unless an orthogonal reparameterization or an essentially equivalent condition is available. Two intuitively appealing weighting schemes are discussed. We argue that asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be read from the posterior distribution of the common parameters when N and T grow at the same rate. Next, we show that random effects estimators are not bias reducing in general and we discuss important exceptions. Moreover, the bias depends on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the population distribution of the effects and its best approximation in the random effects family. Finally, we show that, in general, standard random effects estimation of marginal effects is inconsistent for large T, whereas the posterior mean of the marginal effect is large-T consistent, and we provide conditions for bias reduction. Some examples and Monte Carlo experiments illustrate the results.","[Arellano, Manuel; Bonhomme, Stephane] CEMFI, Madrid 28014, Spain",,"Arellano, M (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain.",arellano@cemfi.es; bonhomme@cemfi.es,"Arellano, Manuel/AAD-8080-2021",,Spanish MEC [SEJ2005-08880],Spanish MEC(Spanish Government),"We thank Victor Aguirregabiria, Josh Angrist, Gary Chamberlain, Gabriele Fiorentini, JeanPierre Florens, Jinyong Hahn, Laura Hospido, Guido Imbens, Thierry Magnac, Jean- Marc Robin, Enrique Sentana, and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

Hence, standard models ignore the reinvestment risk present in practice when considering contacts with longer time to maturity than the longest bond traded in the market. In this paper we propose a model including this reinvestment risk. We place a restriction on the bonds traded in the market by limiting the time to maturity of traded bonds. At fixed times, new bonds are issued in the market, thus extending the time of maturity of traded bonds. The initial prices of the new bonds issued in the market depend on the information generated by the market and a stochastic variable independent thereof describing the reinvestment risk. In order to quantify and control the reinvestment risk we apply the criterion of risk-minimization.","Nordea Markets, DK-0900 Copenhagen C, Denmark",,"Dahl, M (通讯作者)，Nordea Markets, Strandgade 3, DK-0900 Copenhagen C, Denmark.",mikkel.dahl@nordea.com,,,Danica Pension; Nordea Pension; Pen-Sam; PFA Pension; PKA; SEB Pension,Danica Pension; Nordea Pension; Pen-Sam; PFA Pension; PKA; SEB Pension,"This work was carried out while the author was a Ph.

Differences in opinions on the desirability of preventive treatment initiation may hamper the process and outcome of shared decision making between physician and patient. Objective: To evaluate and compare preferences of GPs and patients for preventive osteoporosis drug treatment. Methods: Discrete-choice experiment (DCE) involving 34 general practices in the area of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants included 40 GPs and 120 women aged 60 years who participated in a study on osteoporosis case finding. We included any woman aged >60 years, with an over-representation of women with a high fracture risk (n = 60). Outcomes: (i) The relative weights that GPs and patients place on five treatment attributes of preventive osteoporosis drug treatment: effectiveness, nausea as an adverse effect, total treatment duration, route of drug administration and out-of-pocket costs; and (ii) the determinants of any differences in preferences between GPs and patients. Results: The response rate was 40/59 (68%) for GPs and 120/181 (66%) for patients. All treatment attributes proved to be important for preferences of GPs and patients. GPs had a significantly less favourable attitude towards preventive osteoporosis drug treatment than patients; they placed significantly higher values on effectiveness of preventive drug treatment and short total preventive treatment duration than patients. Conclusions: GPs and patients showed different preferences towards preventive osteoporosis drug treatment. Addressing each of these differences may have a positive effect on the process and outcomes of shared decision making regarding preventive treatment initiation.","[de Bekker-Grob, Esther W.; Essink-Bot, Marie-Louise; Meerding, Willem Jan; Steyerberg, Ewout W.] Erasmus MC Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Publ Hlth, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Essink-Bot, Marie-Louise] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Social Med, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koes, Bart W.] Erasmus MC Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Gen Practice, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; University of Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"de Bekker-Grob, EW (通讯作者)，Erasmus MC Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Publ Hlth, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",e.debekker@erasmusmc.nl,"Steyerberg, Ewout W/C-1509-2018; Koes, Bart/K-4614-2016","Steyerberg, Ewout W/0000-0002-7787-0122; Essink-Bot, Marie-Louise/0000-0002-4650-5886; Koes, Bart/0000-0002-0450-9969",Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) [945-14-010 HTA],Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw)(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development),"The authors thank Huibert A.P.

In this article, we conduct a variety of unit root tests on all possible N(N+1)/2 real rates between pairs of the N+1 countries and estimate the proportion of the pairs that are stationary. This proportion can be consistently estimated even in the presence of cross-section dependence. We estimate this proportion using quarterly data on the real exchange rate for 50 countries over the period 1957-2001. The main substantive conclusion is that to reject the null of no adjustment to PPP requires sufficiently large disequilibria to move the real rate out of the band of inaction set by trade costs. In such cases, one can reject the null of no adjustment to PPP up to 90% of the time as compared to around 40% in the whole sample using a linear alternative and almost 60% using a nonlinear alternative.","[Yamagata, Takashi] Univ York, Dept Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Pesaran, M.

Today, India contributes 10% and 14% of the total World's fruits and vegetables production, respectively. Similarly, our country has considerable share in almost all-horticultural produce the world over. The study was conducted in Haryana state. Out of 19 districts of the state four districts namely Sonipat, Faridabad, Jhjjar, and Gourgaon were selected purposively. The study was conducted in 16 villages. From each village 15 respondents were selected randomly and hence, a total numbers of 240 farmers were interviewed for the study. It was pleasing that majority (82.08%) of the respondents had favorable attitude towards horticultural crops as a diversification in Haryana 10% respondents was having negative attitude. The attitude statement analysis indicated that statement generally fruit and vegetable cultivation as a diversification is meant for the farmers who residing near the city was most important and got first rank followed by fruit and vegetable cultivation as a diversification is right way to increase your income having second rank and the third rank was obtained by judicious mixing of enterprises brought stability in your income. The statement adoption of fruit and vegetable cultivation as a diversification is an indicator of progressiveness of farmers and fruit and vegetable cultivation as a diversification is necessary for your satisfaction got ranking forth and fifth. The overall status of the respondents had medium level (51.25%) of diversification towards horticultural crops farming. The constraints related to inputs were considered to be most serious with average mean score of 11.38 followed by constraints related to marketing with mean score 10.84, constraints related to technical guidance was the third most serious with mean score 10.72, constraints related to production found to be at fourth place with mean score of 9.15 and constraints related to psychological found the fifth and last place with average mean score 9.07. Non availability of quality seeds, high price of insecticide, pesticide and fungicides, absence of agro processing units, exploitation by middle man, fluctuation in price at the time of peak season, plant-protection problem and lack of guidance of seeds treatment and post harvest technology etc. were the main constraints faced by the respondents to adopt the horticultural crops farming as a diversification.","[Shehrawat, P.

Regardless of the chosen measure in evaluating the globalization within the financial sector, evidence seem to show that capital markets were more open in 1914 than in any other subsequent moment in time up to the 70s of last century. Data published within a study of the World Federation of Exchanges show a new historic record of 11.6 billion derivative contracts being transacted in 2006 on exchanges worldwide, with 5.0 billion futures and 6.6 billion options traded, this increase in derivatives markets activity confirming their continuing growth over recent years. Considering the period between 2002 and 2006, the average annual growth rate of the number of traded contracts reached 14 % for options and 22 % for futures. Paper performs an analysis of the Czech derivative market through a deductive approach starting from the macroeconomic picture of emerging capital markets of Central and Eastern Europe and than moving to the specific case of the Derivatives Exchanges in the Czech Republic. After a review of accounting reforms in Czech Republic, an empirical study is done on data from annual reports of 51 companies listed on Prague Exchange by focusing on the comparison of reporting for financial (FOREX, commodity and interest rate) derivatives by using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in comparison with the Czech Accounting Standards (Czech GAAP). Findings reveal potential sources of information asymmetry which might put the information advantage in the hands of some parties involved in derivatives trading. The very low level of information reported on derivatives operations might be the signal of an alarming situation concerning the characteristics of accounting information.","[Strouhal, Jiri] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Financial Accounting & Auditing, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,strouhal@vse.cz,"Strouhal, Jiri/H-6426-2012","Strouhal, Jiri/0000-0001-9109-7087",,,,,13,2,2,0,2,LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE,KAUNO RAJ,"STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2009,,,,,,,276,279,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BNL14,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000274845200047,0

The two control practice affect organizational capability through the mediating role of organizational performance management context and social relation context. Specifically, the trust context mediates the relationship between strategic control practice and adaptation capability, the support context does not take mediating role between them.

The objectives of this review were to summarize the available temporary health-state valuation methods, identify advantages and disadvantages of each, and identify areas for future research. We describe the key aspects of each method and summarize advantages and disadvantages of each method in terms of consistency with QALY theory, relevance to temporary health-state-specific domains, ease of use, time preference, and performance in validation studies. Two broad categories of methods were identified: traditional and adapted. Traditional methods were health status instruments, time trade-off (TTO), and the standard gamble (SG). Methods adapted specifically for temporary health-state valuation were TTO with specified duration of the health state, TTO with a lifespan modification, waiting trade-off, chained approaches for TTO and SG, and sleep trade-off. Advantages and disadvantages vary by method and no 'gold standard' method emerged. Selection of a method to value temporary health states will depend on the relative importance of the following considerations: ability to accurately capture the unique characteristics of the temporary health state, level of respondent burden and cognition, theoretical consistency of elicited preference values with the overall purpose of the study, and resources available for study development and data collection. Further research should focus on evaluating validity, reliability and feasibility of temporary health-state valuation methods.","[Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, Div Gen Pediat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wright, Davene R.; Wittenberg, Eve; Swan, J.

All those lead to serious commercial bribes and high drugs price which the people cannot afford. China has constantly explored the Public Bidding of drug procurement since 2001. The third-party bidding agency integrated the computer science with Chinese-specialized drug bidding and then developed into an Electronic Bidding System. Unfortunately, the system seems to be unavailable to cut the drug price down. There still existed serious commercial bribes during the purchasing. Bidding evaluation is the core step in E-Bidding System, which has a direct impact on the bidding result. This article makes a concrete analysis of the Bidding Evaluation System and points out the main problems. So the author will give us some feasible suggestions to improve the E-Bidding System, such as expanding the expert database; improving the searching method; selecting the experts randomly and automatically; notifying the experts by technological means instead of manual work and establishing blacklist for the experts.

There are many attempts to deal with the first, using various log-Levy models for the asset; some of these are successful in fitting the unconditional distribution of log returns, but cannot of course reproduce the second stylized fact. We propose to model the returns with a hidden two-state Markovian regime (as in J Appl Econ 13:217-244, 1998), conditional on the value of which the returns have different distributions. A key observation is that if the means of the returns in the different regimes are the same, then the log returns are automatically uncorrelated, so we fit to index data under this restriction. By choosing symmetric hyperbolic distributions for the conditional returns, we are able to fit well the unconditional distributions, the autocovariances of absolute returns and the Taylor effect. Moreover, we find that a common regime model explains simultaneously these statistics for the S&P500, FTSE, DAX, Nikkei and CAC40. Implications for investment and option pricing are discussed.","[Rogers, L. C.

Reference points adjust each period according to some exogenously specified law of motion. When reference points do not adjust following disagreement, we show that disagreement does not arise in equilibrium, but they do influence the division of the pie. In contrast, when reference points adjust downwards following disagreement, disagreements arise and players may try to manipulate the reference point of their opponent. When reference points adjust downwards following a rejection, for a particular Markov equilibrium, we show that the set of feasible allocations can be divided into agreement and disagreement regions. In particular, there are thresholds such that if one (or more) player's reference point is above the threshold, disagreement necessarily arises.","So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Hyndman, K (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, 3300 Dyer St,Suite 301R, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",hyndman@smu.edu,,"Hyndman, Kyle/0000-0003-3666-8734",,,,,11,11,13,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The players alternately choose these locations (possibly in batches of more than one in each round) in order to secure the area closer to their locations than that of their rival's. The player with the highest secured area wins the game and otherwise the game ends in a tie. Earlier research has shown that, if an analogous game is played on disjoint circles, the second mover advantage is in place only if K = 1, while for K > 1 both players have a tying strategy. It was also shown that these results hold for line segments of identical length when rules of the game additionally require players to take exactly one location in the first round. In this paper we show that the second mover advantage is still in place for K a parts per thousand yen 1 and 2K - 1 a parts per thousand currency sign N, even if the additional restriction is dropped, while K a parts per thousand currency sign N < 2K - 1 results in the first mover advantage. Our results allow us to draw conclusions about a natural variant of the game, where the resource mobility constraint is more stringent so that in each round each player chooses a single location and we show that the second mover advantage re-appears for K a parts per thousand currency sign N < 2K - 1 if K is an even number.

When calculating e.g. next years premium, it is vital to correctly model these factors and to estimate the unknown parameters. A standard way is to separately estimate in the claimsize and the claim frequency models. Often there is a deductible with each single claim, and this deductible can be quite large, particularly in inhomogeneous cases such as industrial fire insurance or marine insurance. Not taking the deductibles into account can lead to serious bias in the estimates and consequent implications when applying the model. When the deductibles are nonidentical, in a full maximum likelihood estimation all unknown parameters have to be estimated simultaneously. An alternative is to use pseudo-maximum likelihood, i.e. first estimate the claimsize model, taking the deductibles into account, and then use the estimated probability that a claim exceeds the deductible as an offset in the claim frequency estimation. This latter method is less efficient, but due to complexity or time considerations, it may be the preferred option. In this paper we will provide rather general formulas for the relative efficiency of the pseudo maximum likelihood estimators in the i.i.d. case. Two special cases will be studied in detail, and we conclude the paper by comparing the methods on some marine insurance data.","[Paulsen, Jostein] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Paulsen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Univ Pk 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",,"Paulsen, Jostein/N-5921-2014",,,,,,13,0,0,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2011,41.0,1,,,,,1,28,,10.2143/AST.41.1.2084384,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,770WU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291120000001,0

A semiparametric model based on Coxian distributions is proposed for the approximation of both the interarrival time between claims and the claim size distributions. A Bayesian density estimation approach for the Coxian distribution is implemented using reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The family of Coxian distributions is a very flexible mixture model that can capture the special features frequently observed in insurance claims. Furthermore, given the proposed Coxian approximation, it is possible to obtain closed expressions of the Laplace transforms of the total claim count and the total claim amount random variables. These properties allow us to obtain Bayesian estimations of the distributions of the number of claims and the total claim amount in a future time period, their main characteristics and credible intervals. The possibility of applying deductibles and maximum limits is also analyzed.

While the existing convolution algorithms compute the density of the underlying state variable by moving forward on a suitably defined state space grid, our new algorithm uses backward price convolution, which resembles classical lattice pricing algorithms. For the first time in the literature we provide an analytical upper bound for the pricing error caused by the truncation of the state space grid and by the curtailment of the integration range. We highlight the benefits of the new scheme and benchmark its performance against existing finite difference, Monte Carlo, and forward density convolution algorithms.","[Cerny, Ales; Kyriakou, Ioannis] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Cerny, A (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",cerny@martingales.info,"Černý, Aleš/GQA-9269-2022; Kyriakou, Ioannis/J-6079-2019","Černý, Aleš/0000-0001-5583-6516; Kyriakou, Ioannis/0000-0001-9592-596X",Cass Business School; EPSRC,Cass Business School; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),We would like to thank Gianluca Fusai and Jan Vecer for helpful discussions.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of affine term structure models, called Bilinear Term Structure Model (BTSM).

This paper estimates the benefits of such a strategy to Wal-Mart, focusing on the savings in distribution costs afforded by a dense network of stores. The paper takes a revealed preference approach, inferring the magnitude of density economies from how much sales cannibalization of closely packed stores Wal-Mart is willing to suffer to achieve density economies. The model is dynamic with rich geographic detail on the locations of stores and distribution centers. Given the enormous number of possible combinations of store-opening sequences, it is difficult to directly solve Wal-Mart's problem, making conventional approaches infeasible. The moment inequality approach is used instead and works well. The estimates show the benefits to Wal-Mart of high store density are substantial and likely extend significantly beyond savings in trucking costs.","[Holmes, Thomas J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Holmes, Thomas J.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Holmes, Thomas J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Federal Reserve System - USA; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Holmes, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-101 Hansen Hall,1925 4th St S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",holmes@umn.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [0551062]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0551062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I have benefited from the comments of many seminar participants.

The efficacy of bivalirudin in the management of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) planned for invasive interventions has been shown in large, pivotal, open-label trials. Bivalirudin provided similar ischaemic protection to heparin plus a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor, but with a significant reduction in bleeding events, in patients with NSTE-ACS planned for urgent or early intervention and those with STEMI planned for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Mortality rates were also significantly lower in patients with STEMI receiving bivalirudin than in those receiving heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in the key trial of patients with STEMI. Based on this clinical data, modelled cost-utility analyses from the perspective of various UK NHS providers have predicted that bivalirudin would be highly likely to be cost effective with regard to the cost per QALY gained relative to a heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor-based strategy over a lifetime horizon in these patient populations. In patients with NSTE-ACS planned for urgent or early invasive intervention, a bivalirudin-based strategy was considered to be cost effective in the UK, Scotland and Wales. In patients with STEMI planned for primary PCI, a bivalirudin-based strategy was dominant in the UK and Scotland. Parallel and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that base-case conclusions were robust over a range of plausible changes in parameter estimates and assumptions, including changes made to more closely reflect current local clinical practice. In addition, budgetary impact analyses in several countries suggested that the implementation of a bivalirudin-based strategy, instead of a heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor-based strategy, would be cost saving from a hospital perspective in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing urgent or early PCI, as well as in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Likewise, prospective and retrospective treatment cost studies in the US indicated that treatment with bivalirudin was less costly than treatment with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in these indications. In conclusion, available pharmacoeconomic data from several countries, despite some inherent limitations, support the use of strategies based on bivalirudin over those based on heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in patients with NSTE-ACS planned for urgent or early invasive intervention or STEMI planned for primary PCI. These pharmacoeconomic advantages primarily reflect that, relative to heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, bivalirudin is associated with lower rates of bleeding over the short term, and is associated with lower rates of early mortality that are subsequently maintained over the longer term in patients with STEMI.","Adis, Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland 0754, New Zealand",Adis International,"Lyseng-Williamson, KA (通讯作者)，Adis, Wolters Kluwer Business, 41 Centorian Dr,Private Bag 65901, Auckland 0754, New Zealand.",demail@adis.co.nz,"White, Howard D/A-7034-2009","Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine/0000-0002-5104-1158",,,,,42,3,4,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,4,,,,,343,359,,,,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,746TV,21395353.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000289271500006,0

For this review, the English-language literature was searched for studies of interventions in CKD reporting an original incremental cost-utility (cost per QALY) or cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year) ratio. Published cost studies that did not report cost-effectiveness or cost-utility ratios were also reviewed. League tables were then created for both cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios to assess interventions in patients with stage 1-4 CKD, waitlist and transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, the percentage of cost-saving or dominant interventions (those that save money and improve health) was compared across these three disease categories. A total of 84 studies were included, contributing 72 cost-utility ratios, 20 cost-effectiveness ratios and 42 other cost measures. Many of the interventions were dominant over the comparator, indicating better health outcomes and lower costs. For the three disease categories, the greatest number of dominant or cost-saving interventions was reported for stage 1-4 CKD patients, followed by waitlist and transplant recipients and those with ESRD (91%, 87% and 55% of studies reporting a dominant or cost-saving intervention, respectively). There is evidence of opportunities to lower costs in the treatment of patients with CKD, while either improving or maintaining the quality of care. In order to realize these cost savings, efforts will be required to promote and effectively implement changes in treatment practices.","[Menzin, Joseph; Lines, Lisa M.; Nichols, Christine; Rodriguez, Lauren] Boston Hlth Econ Inc, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Weiner, Daniel E.; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Agodoa, Irene; Mayne, Tracy] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA USA; [Mayne, Tracy] Davita Clin Res, El Segundo, CA USA","Boston Health Economics, Inc.; Tufts Medical Center; Amgen; DaVita","Menzin, J (通讯作者)，Boston Hlth Econ Inc, 20 Fox Rd, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",jmenzin@bhei.com,"Lines, Lisa/AAK-7940-2020; Lines, Lisa/R-4983-2016","Lines, Lisa/0000-0002-9202-3466; Lines, Lisa/0000-0002-9202-3466; Weiner, Daniel/0000-0002-8775-394X","Amgen; American Society of Nephrology, Dialysis Clinic, Inc.; Covidien; Genzyme","Amgen(Amgen); American Society of Nephrology, Dialysis Clinic, Inc.; Covidien; Genzyme(Sanofi-AventisGenzyme Corporation)","Funding for this study was provided by Amgen.

To reduce the excess iron and its deleterious effects, available iron chelation therapy (ICT) in the US includes oral deferasirox or infusional deferoxamine (DFO). The aim of this study was to review and synthesize the available pharmacoeconomic evidence on ICT in patients with beta-thalassaemia, SCD and MDS in the US. We systematically identified and reviewed pharmacoeconomic studies of ICT in patients with beta-thalassaemia, SCD and MDS that either were published in MEDLINE-indexed, English-language journals from 1999 to 2009, or appeared in medical society websites and scientific meeting abstracts. We assessed available cost-of-illness, cost-of-treatment, cost-consequence, cost-effectiveness, utility and patient-satisfaction studies. The majority of the 20 identified studies assessed cost of treatment, mainly focusing on acquisition and administration costs of ICTs. Gaps in the published literature include current data on direct medical costs for patients with MDS, direct medical costs associated with complications of iron overload, direct non-medical costs, indirect costs and patient utilities. Different underlying model assumptions, methodologies and comparators were found in the cost-effectiveness studies, which yielded a broad range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for different ICTs. Comprehensive cost-of-illness studies are needed to address data gaps in the published literature regarding the economic burden of iron overload. Comparative-effectiveness studies that evaluate clinical, economic and patient-reported outcomes would help the medical community to better understand the value of different ICTs.","[Zhang, Bin; Donga, Prina Z.; Miller, Jeffrey D.; Pashos, Chris L.] Abt Biopharma Solut Inc, Lexington, MA USA; [Corral, Mitra; Sasane, Medha] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",Novartis,"Pashos, CL (通讯作者)，United BioSourc Corp, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",chris.pashos@unitedbiosource.com,,,,,,,40,2,5,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2011,29.0,6,,,,,461,474,,10.2165/11589250-000000000-00000,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,776BI,21452907.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000291509100002,0

In this paper, we generalize this result by distinguishing equivalence classes of balanced games that share the same core structure. We then associate a system of linear inequalities with each equivalence class, and we show that the system defines the class. Application of this general theorem to the class of convex games yields an alternative proof of the Shapley-Ichiishi result. Other applications range from computation of stable sets in non-cooperative game theory to determination of classes of TU games on which the core correspondence is additive (even linear). For the case of convex games we prove that the theorem provides the minimal defining system of linear inequalities. An example shows that this is not necessarily true for other equivalence classes of balanced games.","[Kuipers, Jeroen] Maastricht Univ, Dept Knowledge Engn, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Dries] Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Voorneveld, Mark] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Kuipers, J (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Knowledge Engn, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",kuipers@maastrichtuniversity.nl; d.vermeulen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; Mark.Voorneveld@hhs.se,,"Vermeulen, Dries/0000-0003-1514-7518",Wallander/Hedelius Foundation,Wallander/Hedelius Foundation,"Financial support from the Wallander/Hedelius Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

Measurement metrics for each of the two items were devised to estimate their effect on offshoring effectiveness. We spoke to some of the top 10 IT vendors in India, collected offshoring data from both clients and vendors, and used the data to validate our decision framework. The framework helped us to investigate current industry practices in IT outsourcing, identify issues and problems beyond the obvious advantages of outsourcing, and propose measures to assess offshoring effectiveness. The investigation gave us an insight on how industry practices differ, and an opportunity to record the best practices and suggest possible improvements in the service or product delivery cycle to enhance customer experience.","[Biswas, Dip] San Jose State Univ, Dept Engn, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University,,dip_b@yahoo.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,709,718,,10.1109/ICMSE.2010.5719879,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100099,0

An Analysis Based on Forecasting US Employment Growth,ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bagging; Combination forecasts; Employment; Forecast encompassing; Principal components,COMBINATION; OUTPUT,"Forecasting a macroeconomic variable is challenging in an environment with many potential predictors whose predictive ability can vary over time. We compare two approaches to forecasting U.S. employment growth in this type of environment. The first approach applies bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to a general-to-specific procedure based on a general dynamic linear regression model with 30 potential predictors. The second approach considers several methods for combining forecasts from 30 individual autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models, where each individual ARDL model contains a potential predictor. We analyze bagging and combination forecasts at multiple horizons over four different out-of-sample periods using a mean square forecast error (MSFE) criterion and forecast encompassing tests. We find that bagging forecasts often deliver the lowest MSFE. Interestingly, we also find that incorporating information from both bagging and combination forecasts based on principal components often leads to further gains in forecast accuracy.","[Rapach, David E.; Strauss, Jack K.] St Louis Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63108 USA",Saint Louis University,"Rapach, DE (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, Dept Econ, 3674 Lindell Blvd, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",rapachde@slu.edu,,,Simon Center for Regional Forecasting at Saint Louis University,Simon Center for Regional Forecasting at Saint Louis University,The authors thank two anonymous referees for very helpful comments.

However SMEs mainly do not export regularly and they often export less than once a year. In addition there is a low adoption of export with less than 5% of all SMEs involved in Australia. By understanding those involved in export initiation and using innovation theories there may be other ways that exporting can be made to be more sustainable for SME internationalisation. This study reviewed internationalisation theory in relation to export initiation. Specifically it looked at internationalisation approaches such as: stages, learning, born-global, network, and contingency and compared innovation theory to these approaches to demonstrate that all export initiation is innovative not just the stages approach. From here common innovation roles (champions, boundary spanners and intrapreneurs) were reviewed to see how they fit with all approaches in internationalisation. Each innovation role was reviewed and some evidence of their activities in SME internationalisation was found. It was demonstrated that all export initiation is innovative and not necessarily just the stages approach. In SME internationalisation innovation roles appear to exist. Finally a conceptual model and propositions were arrived at. Propositions were that each innovation role had a part to play in an innovation such as export initiation. This paper provides an understanding of innovation and how it relates to export initiation. A better understanding of innovation roles and how they relate to export initiation is provided. Further research is required to field test the propositions. Also research is required to see if the innovation roles are independent, interdependent or have significant overlaps? Another possible area of research could look at the existence of other roles in innovation or synthesised roles. Finally, measure the concept that all internationalisation is an innovation and not only the territory of the stages approach.","[Rees, Murray] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Edwards, Ron] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Business & Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; Monash University,"Rees, M (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Enterprise, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",,"Edwards, Ron/J-2669-2014",,,,,,92,0,0,2,20,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4244-8119-4; 978-1-4244-8117-0,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2010,,,,,,,1389,1397,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BXV73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000297300100190,0

The combination of both binary and weighted approaches delivers more precise and thorough insights into the topological structure and properties of international trade and financial networks (ITN and IFN). It is found that the ITN is more densely connected than the IFN, while both types of network display a core-periphery structure. This hierarchical organization is more pronounced in financial markets, suggesting that the bulk of trade in financial assets occurs through a handful of countries acting as hubs. High-income countries are better linked and form groups of tightly interconnected nodes.

In this paper, 3 latent variables and 21 observed variables are conducted in structural equation model(SEM). We identify that ten observed variables is determinant in job satisfaction of firm networks, six observed variables in organizational commitment of firm networks, and five observed variables in efficiency of firm networks. Furthermore, it finds that job satisfaction of firm networks significantly contributes to organizational commitment and efficiency of firm networks. While, organizational commitment of firm networks plays partial intermediary role in the relationship between job satisfaction and efficiency of firm networks.

As resource Sharing is a highly socialized activity, it is affected by many kinds of factors. Analysis on the influencing factors will help related departments find an effective way to construct resource system. According to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), This paper classifies all the factors into three major types. They are sharing attitude, subjective norm of sharing and perceived behavioral control ability. The first part of this paper introduces the exogenous variables of all the three kinds of factors. Then, on the basis of structural equation model (SEM), this paper gives a theoretical model and does an empirical study. The result shows that sharing attitude is the most important factor; Perceived behavioral control ability comes secondly; Subjective norm of sharing is the last but not the least important factor. It is just to say compared with the other two factors, related departments can consider this factor later. In the last part, this paper comes to the conclusion that:(1) It is necessary to raise sharing benefits and decrease sharing cost in order to arouse enthusiasm of sharing subjects.(2) Sharing mechanism is also an important factor that needs attention;(3) Benefit compensation have an effective impact on sharing than any other policy measure.

The required default probabilities are computed by inverting the Laplace transform of first-passage probabilities. Four Laplace-inversion algorithms are examined for the given problem with respect to precision and run-time; these are based on different theoretical inversion formulas. Then it is demonstrated that the model explains CDS spreads of various firms with high precision. The calibration algorithm is further refined to a robust routine that penalizes deviations from a given prior, which is inspired by the relative entropy of two probability measures. It is shown that, if the model is calibrated at consecutive days, stable model parameters can be obtained with pricing errors below bid-ask spreads.","[Biere, Andre; Scherer, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, HVB Inst Math Finance, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich,,scherer@tum.de,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,UNIVERSE ACADEMIC PRESS TORONTO,TORONTO,"1 SPADINA CRESCENT, ROOM 205, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3G3, CANADA",,,978-1-926642-01-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,945,954,,,,,,10,"Business; Economics; Management; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BLY20,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000271409600163,0

The limit distribution of the AIC criterion, which is inconsistent, is also obtained. The analysis provides a general limit theory for semiparametric reduced rank regression under weakly dependent errors. The method does not require the specification of a full model, is convenient for practical implementation in empirical work, and is sympathetic with semiparametric estimation approaches to co-integration analysis.

Recently, a number of papers have appeared where the authors have utilized a mortgage rate implied by the current yield curve (the so-called endogenous mortgage rate). However, the existing computational algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality and, consequently, are problematic to use for full-scale problems. A computational algorithm, proposed in this paper, is tractable in the sense that its complexity is equivalent to the problem of mortgage valuation. Moreover, the algorithm does not require iterations. The numerical example is based on a PDE computation.

The project uses the common village houses to demonstrate the activity path to improvements and to ignite action in the residents through the joint volunteering and project implementation. The village houses in Finland have cultural and historic value and the hub of many village activities. At the same time, this approach guarantees the project results remain in the village among the residents. In addition, the project develops a guideline and a DVD material on the project implementation. The development project is a great example of the role of university of applied science in the regional development with multidisciplinary approach and practical implementation of the scientific research.

The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of AC versus TC, from a Chinese healthcare provider perspective, based on a clinical trial. Methods: A lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model. Events rates and utilities in the Markov model were derived from published papers. Data on cost of breast cancer care were obtained from the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, PR China. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were undertaken. Cost estimates were valued in Chinese yuan (Y), year 2008 values. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Results: Patients receiving TC gained 14.45 QALYs, 0.41 QALYs more than patients receiving AC. The lifetime costs of patients receiving TC were Y93 511, Y10 116 more than that of AC patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were Y26 742 per life-year gained (2719.8 pound per year) and Y24 305 per QALY gained (2471.9 pound per QALY). The most sensitive parameter in the model was the cost of primary cancer treatments in the TC arm. At a threshold willingness to pay of Y86 514 per QALY, the probability of TC being cost effective was 90%. Conclusions: Our model suggests that TC may be considered cost effective from a Chinese healthcare provider perspective, according to the threshold defined by the WHO.","[Peng Liubao; Wan Xiaomin; Tan Chongqing; Li Jianhe; Cui Wei; Luo Xia; Cao Junhua] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Pharm, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Karnon, Jon] Univ Adelaide, Dept Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Chen Gannong] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Mammary Gland & Thyroid Gland Gen Surg, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; University of Adelaide; Central South University,"Peng, LB (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Dept Pharm, 139 Ren Min Zhong Rd, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China.",pengliubao@126.com,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023; Wan, Xiaomin/GPX-4388-2022","Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [06JJ4128],Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province),"Peng Liubao, Wan Xiaomin, Tan Chongqing, Jon Karnon, Chen Gannong and Li Jianhe contributed equally to this work.; This project was supported by Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 06JJ4128).

Therapy choice depends on many factors, including cost. Previous estimates of ESA cost differences have been derived from claims data. These data lack clinical variables, such as baseline haemoglobin (Hb) level, which are likely to influence choice of ESA, dosing and costs. We estimated cost differences between DA and EA in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, using a propensity-score matched analysis of baseline patient characteristics with and without Hb values to assess the effect of this clinical variable on ESA cost estimates. Methods: Data were extracted from electronic medical records in two US databases between January 2004 and December 2006. The study sample included 6743 patients receiving chemotherapy, with one or more visits during the study period, who received an ESA during a chemotherapy episode. Episodes of chemotherapy care were constructed using a 90-day gap in administration to identify the start and end. Patients receiving both DA and EA during their initial chemotherapy episode or with missing data were excluded, representing 42% of patients with CIA receiving an ESA. Drug costs were calculated from the cumulative dose multiplied by 106% of the average sales price (ASP) for DA or EA. Two propensity-score matches were conducted: first using variables available in administrative billing claims systems, then adding the baseline Hb test result. Regression-adjusted cost differences were estimated with and without baseline Hb, using generalized linear models. Results: Using baseline Hb levels resulted in a better match of the baseline characteristics for the EA and DA treatment groups than the original sample or the matched sample without Hb variables. Mean ESA costs (year 2007 values) for the original sample were $US4171 for EA and $US3811 for DA (mean difference $US360; p<0.001, standard error [SE] $US99). With propensity-score matching without Hb variables, mean estimated costs were $US3836 for EA and $US3599 for DA (mean difference $US237; p = 0.053, SE $US123). With propensity-score match including Hb variables, mean costs were $US3965 for EA and $US3536 for DA (mean difference $US429; p=0.001, SE $US125). Cost differences in sensitivity analyses ranged between $US102 (p = 0.201) and $US261 (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Addition of baseline Hb level as a variable in propensity score and ESA cost models affects ESA treatment cost estimates in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Cost comparisons based on observational data should use analytical methods that account for differences in clinical variables between treatment groups.","[Eremina, Daria; Hess, Gregory; Hill, Jerrold; Hulnick, Scott; Roumm, Adam] SDI, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462 USA; [Polsky, Daniel; Hess, Gregory] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Whyte, Joanna L.; Kallich, Joel] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Amgen,"Hill, J (通讯作者)，SDI, 220 W Germantown Pike,Suite 140, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462 USA.",jhill@sdihealth.com,,"Kallich, Joel/0000-0002-5016-4703; Hess, Gregory/0000-0001-8942-6865",,,,,21,9,12,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,,2009,27.0,9,,,,,755,765,,10.2165/11313860-000000000-00000,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,507JE,19757869.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000270848500006,0

Students are critical about the reform because it creates serious financial obstacles to study for school leavers with insufficient evaluations in the school leaving certificate. It became evident that the majority of students would be unable to study following the order established by the reform. The outcomes of science and studies reform could be negative for countryside.

This paper presents the Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP), an extension of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a broader and more comprehensive objective function that accounts not just for the travel distance, but also for the amount of greenhouse emissions, fuel, travel times and their costs. Mathematical models are described for the PRP with or without time windows and computational experiments are performed on realistic instances. The paper sheds light on the tradeoffs between various parameters such as vehicle load, speed and total cost, and offers insight on economies of 'environmental-friendly' vehicle routing. The results suggest that, contrary to the VRP, the PRP is significantly more difficult to solve to optimality but has the potential of yielding savings in total cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this distribution may be unavailable (inaccurate) in reality as we may have no (insufficient) data to calibrate the distribution. In this paper we relax this assumption and present a new method to assess travel time reliability that is distribution-free in the sense that the methodology only requires that the first N moments (where N is a user-specified positive integer) of the travel time to be known and that the travel times reside in a set of bounded and known intervals. Because of our modeling approach, all sources of uncertainty are automatically accounted for, as long as they are statistically independent. Instead of deriving exact probabilities on travel times exceeding certain thresholds via computationally intensive methods, we develop semi-analytical probability inequalities to quickly (i.e. within a fraction of a second) obtain upper bounds on the desired probability. Numerical experiments suggest that the inclusion of higher order moments can potentially significantly improve the bounds. The case study also demonstrates that the derived bounds are nontrivial for a large range of travel time values. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As we would expect, if the on-ramp demand is space-independent then this distribution tends toward uniformity in space if the freeway is either: (i) uncongested; or (ii) congested with queues on its on-ramps and enough inflow to cause the average freeway density to increase with time. In all other cases, however, including any recovery phase of a rush hour where the freeway's average density declines, the distribution of flow and density quickly becomes uneven. This happens even under conditions of perfect symmetry, where the percentage of vehicles exiting at every off ramp is the same. The flow-density deviations from the average are shown to grow exponentially in time and propagate backwards in space with a fixed wave speed. A consequence of this type of instability is that, during recovery, gaps of uncongested traffic will quickly appear in the unevenly congested stream, reducing average flow. This extends the duration of recovery and invariably creates clockwise hysteresis loops on scatter-plots of average system flow vs. density during any rush hour that oversaturates the freeway. All these effects are quantified with formulas and verified with simulations. Some have been observed in real networks. In a more practical vein, it is also shown that the negative effects of instability diminish (i.e., freeway flows increase) if (a) some drivers choose to exit the freeway prematurely when it is too congested and/or (b) freeway access is regulated in a certain traffic-esponsive way. These two findings could be used to improve the algorithms behind VMS displays for driver guidance (finding a), and on-ramp metering rates (finding b). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This wastes capacity on the approach because some of its lanes cannot discharge during its green phases. The paper shows that the problem can be eliminated by reorganizing traffic on all the lanes upstream of an intersection using a mid-block pre-signal. If drivers behave deterministically, the capacity that can be achieved is the same as if there were no left turns. However, if the reorganization is too drastic, it may be counterintuitive to drivers. This can be remedied by reorganizing traffic on just some of the available lanes. It is shown that such partial reorganization still increases capacity significantly, even if drivers behave randomly and only one lane is reorganized. The paper shows how to optimize the design of a pre-signal system for a generic intersection. It also identifies both, the potential benefits of the proposed system for a broad class of intersections, and the domain of application where the benefits are most significant.

It is shown below that, even in a perfectly symmetric network with uniform demand, clockwise loops are to be expected when there are disturbances, especially if the disturbances cause a significant fraction of the drivers to not change routes adaptively. It is also shown that when drivers are not adaptive networks are inherently more unstable as they recover from congestion than as they are loaded. In other words, during recovery congestion tends more strongly toward unevenness because very congested areas clear more slowly than less congested areas. Since it is known that uneven congestion distributions reduce network flows, it follows that lower network flows should arise during recovery, resulting in clockwise loops. Fortunately, the presence of a sufficient number of drivers that choose routes adaptively to avoid congested areas helps to even out congestion during recovery, increasing flow. Thus, clockwise loops are less likely to occur when driver adaptivity is high. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For networks consisting of a single route this MFD can be predicted analytically: but when the networks consist of multiple overlapping routes experience shows that the flows observed in congestion for a given density are less than those one would predict if the routes were homogeneously congested and did not overlap. These types of networks also tend to jam at densities that are only a fraction of their routes' average jam density. This paper provides an explanation for these phenomena. It shows that, even for perfectly homogeneous networks with spatially uniform travel patterns, symmetric equilibrium patterns with equal flows and densities across all links are unstable if the average network density is sufficiently high. Instead, the stable equilibrium patterns are asymmetric. For this reason the networks jam at lower densities and exhibit lower flows than one would predict if traffic was evenly distributed. Analysis of small idealized networks that can be treated as simple dynamical systems shows that these networks undergo a bifurcation at a network-specific critical density such that for lower densities the MFDs have predictably high flows and are univalued, and for higher densities the order breaks down. Microsimulations show that this bifurcation also manifests itself in large symmetric networks. In this case though, the bifurcation is more pernicious: once the network density exceeds the critical value, the stable state is one of complete gridlock with zero flow. It is therefore important to ensure in real-world applications that a network's density never be allowed to approach this critical value. Fortunately, analysis shows that the bifurcation's critical density increases considerably if some of the drivers choose their routes adaptively in response to traffic conditions. So far, for networks with adaptive drivers, bifurcations have only been observed in simulations, but not (yet) in real life. This could be because real drivers are more adaptive than simulated drivers and/or because the observed real networks were not sufficiently congested. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This makes it possible to distinguish taxes on inputs in the production of car trips and taxes on transport as an activity. Moreover, the model allows us to consider the implications of treating transport as a demand, derived from other activities. We extend several well known tax rules from the public finance literature and carefully interpret the implications for the optimal tax treatment of passenger transport services. The main findings of the paper are the following. First, if governments are limited to taxing market inputs into transport trip production, the time-allocation framework: (i) provides an argument for taxing congestion below marginal external cost, (ii) implies a favourable tax treatment for time-saving devices such as GPS, and (iii) provides a previously unnoticed argument for public transport subsidies. Second, if the government has access to perfect road pricing that directly taxes transport as an activity, all previous results disappear.

This paper proposes a reliable facility location model to optimize traffic surveillance benefit from synthesized sensor pairs (e.g., for travel time estimation) in addition to individual sensor flow coverage (e.g., for traffic volume statistics), while considering probabilistic sensor failures. Customized greedy and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are proposed to solve this problem, and their performance is discussed. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms solve the problem efficiently. We also discuss managerial insights on how optimal sensor deployment and surveillance benefits vary with surveillance objective and system parameters (such as sensor failure probabilities).

Non-experiment external validity tests involving observation of choice activity in a natural environment, where the individuals do not know they are in an experiment, are rare. In contrast the majority of tests are a test of external validity between hypothetical and actual experiments. Deviation from real market evidence is referred to in the literature broadly as hypothetical bias. The challenge is to identify such bias, and to the extent to which it exists, establishing possible ways to minimise it. This paper reviews the efforts to date to identify and 'calibrate' WTP derived from one or more methods that involve assessment of hypothetical settings, be they (i) contingent valuation methods, (ii) choice experiments involving trading attributes between multiple alternatives, with or without referencing, or (iii) methods involving salient or non-salient incentives linked to actual behaviour. Despite progress in identifying possible contributions to differences in marginal WTP, there is no solid evidence, although plenty of speculation, to explain the differences between all manner of hypothetical experiments and non-experimental evidence. The absence of non-experimental evidence from natural field experiments remains a major barrier to confirmation of under or overestimation. We find, however, that the role of referencing of an experiment relative to a real experience (including evidence from revealed preference (RP) studies), in the design of choice experiments, appears to offer promise in the derivation of estimates of WTP that have a meaningful link to real market activity, closing the gap between RP and SC WTP outputs.

Mixed pdf's contain components with the usual continuous density function specifications that underlie common choice models (e.g. MNL GEV, MNP), but also contain one or more discrete probability mass points. These mixed pdf's result in models that can be interpreted to reflect different regimes of decision-making. Two exemplars developed in this paper, the 2- and 3-Mix models, are the result of a mixed pdf that combines a continuous pdf plus one or two mass points, respectively. The 2-Mix permits a specific alternative to be in the Tradeoff Condition (the usual situation for alternatives in extant choice models, and the only regime in which compensatory utility is defined and compared) or in the Rejection Condition (in which an alternative has extreme disutility). The 3-Mix model adds the Dominance Condition (in which an alternative has an extremely attractive utility) - interestingly, the inclusion of this condition makes the model capable of simulating a particular form of satisficing decision making. These models are derived, discussed and compared relative to several extant choice models, then applied empirically on both a RP data set (work trip mode choice) and a SP data set (recreation campsite selection).

The attractiveness of a given route involves evaluation of both the possible travel time outcomes, and their perceived probability of occurring. We consider a modelling framework where the perceived value and perceived probabilities of travel time outcomes are obtained via nonlinear transformations of the actual travel times and their probabilities. In this context, we present the analysis required to formulate an equilibrium condition analogous to that of User Equilibrium, wherein travellers choose the routes that maximises their perceived value in the face of uncertain travel times. Existence and uniqueness conditions for this equilibrium are established. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) provides a well supported paradigm for choices made under uncertainty, where each choice alternative presents a discrete probability distribution of a finite number of possible outcomes. Our analysis admits the particular transformations associated with CPT as a special case, and holds for a more general class of transformations and for the case of a continuous distribution of outcomes.

A rule that is attracting attention in stated choice studies is the extent to which respondents attend to or ignore one or more attributes in processing the information on offer. A model specification method is implemented in the context of a stated choice data set where car drivers choose between tolled and non-tolled routes. The evidence into a willingness to pay (WTP) for travel time savings is obtained, and contrasted with the results from the traditional full preservation model. The evidence suggests that the WTP is sufficiently different and higher, on average. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time there has been growing interest in the representation of unexplained heterogeneity in choice data, using random coefficients models such as Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL). The presence of multiple observations for each respondent can indeed be a great asset in the identification of such variations in tastes. However, in this paper, we question the validity of the common assumption that tastes vary across respondents but stay constant across repeated choices for the same respondent. We extend the existing framework for the MMNL analysis of panel data by allowing for intra-respondent heterogeneity on top of inter-respondent heterogeneity. An empirical analysis making use of a SC dataset for route choice confirms our hypotheses and shows that superior performance is obtained by our more general model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Because construction projects are highly fragmented with many participants involved at different construction stages, coordination is more complicated. However, coordination is usually not well planned and executed to manage the interfaces so the project performance is not as expected. This paper establishes the coordination systems for construction projects by simulating circulatory system because the physiological function of the human body is natural and effective. Three mechanisms of the circulatory system were drawn and applied on project coordination. (1) Normal operation. Blood is pumped by the heart, transported to all body organs through arteries, and then returns to the heart through veins. In the construction, the contractor (heart) supplies information (nutrients) to project parties (organs) by coordination (blood flow) methods (arteries and veins). Coordination needs is derived from project uncertainty and equivocality (U&E), and supply is offered by different methods engineers use to coordinate. Supply matching needs results in better project performance. (2) Monitoring system. Sensory receptors are the key to meet the needs for human body. Baroreceptors and Chemoreceptors can sense blood pressure, blood O-2, CO2 and pH, and then transmit stimulus to the central nervous system. A monitoring system in the contractor is needed in which a few managers or engineers are assigned as receptors to measure the appropriateness of coordination with the owner, subcontractors and internal members. (3) Regulation mechanism. For unexpected change, blood flow is mainly regulated by nervous and hormonal system after the change is sensed. When the construction project has a change or accident, coordination needs change as well. To meet coordination needs, supply should be adjusted such as more meetings and informal discussion. The three mechanisms can be transferred into practical operation procedures which are implemented at planning and execution stages to help contractors coordinate effectively.","[Shen Fangying; Chang Andrew, S.] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,,sfangying@yahoo.com.tw; anschang@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1758,1765,,,,,,8,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901045,0

Several factors, including population growth, personal income, transportation costs and agricultural land value, are assumed to explain most of urban growth over time and urban size variations across cities. This paper focuses empirically on the variations of urban sizes among Chinese cities by employing the classic mono-centric model in urban economics. The econometric results suggest that fundamental economics factors, identified by the mono-centric theory, are of primary importance explaining the variation of urban spatial sizes. The empirical study contains data of more than 200 major cities in China and over 10 years. In cross-sectional analysis, population, transportation costs, personal income and agricultural land price determine nearly 90% of variations. In panel data analysis, population growth is the most influential factor.","[Xu, F.

In China, quality management and cost management must comply with the various codes and standards, for example Unified standard for constructional quality acceptance of building engineering and Code of valuation with bill quantity of construction works, which are promulgated by Ministry of Construction (MOC) and General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), and there is a sophisticated set of practices in the field of schedule management. There is a set of the sorting and coding system each other in these codes, standards and practices, and there is not consistent between them. Therefore, understanding the differences, which exist in the different sorting and coding system, is crucial for building the integrated sorting and coding system of construction project. This study analyzes the differences and finds the internal accord in the different sorting system by comparison method. Based on these analysis, some principle of establishing the integrate sorting and coding system of construction project and the implementation model are bring out.

Despite this potential, the up-take rate of sustainable housing in new build and through home renovation is not as high as expected within the housing industry. This is in contrast to the influx of emerging building technologies, new materials and innovative designs seen in exemplar homes built worldwide. How we should use the increasing awareness of SH and emerging technologies as an impetus to change the un-sustainable designs and practices of the building industry is high on the agenda of the government and majority of the stakeholders involved. This warrants the study of multifaceted strategies that meet the needs of multiple stakeholders and integrated seamlessly into housing development processes. Specifically, the different perceptions, roles and incentives of stakeholders, who inevitably need to ensure their benefits and commercial returns, should be highlighted and acted upon. This paper discusses the preliminary findings of a research project that aims to promote SH implementation by identifying and materializing the mutual benefits among key stakeholders. The aim is to be achieved through questionnaire surveys, structural equation modelling, interviews and case studies with seven major stakeholders within the Australian housing industry. This research identifies the influence and relationship of relevant factors, investigates preferences, similarities and differences between stakeholders on perceived benefits and in turn explores the mutual-benefit strategy package that facilitates decision making towards sustainable housing development.","[Zheng, Y.

With rare exception, however, a non-linear treatment of the parameter set to allow for behavioural reality, such as embedded risk attitude and perceptual conditioning of occurrence probabilities attached to specific attributes, is absent. This is especially relevant to the recent focus in travel behaviour research on identifying the willingness to pay for reduced travel time variability, which is the source of estimates of the value of trip reliability that has been shown to take on an increasingly important role in project appraisal. This paper incorporates, in a generalised non-linear (in parameters) logit model, alternative functional forms for perceptual conditioning (known as probability weighting) and risk attitude in the utility function to account for travel time variability, and then derives an empirical estimate of the willingness to pay for trip time variability-embedded travel time savings as an alternative to separate estimates of time savings and trip time reliability. We illustrate the richness of the approach using a stated choice data set for commuter choice between unlabelled attribute packages. Statistically significant risk attitude parameters and parameters underlying decision weights are estimated for multinomial logit and mixed multinomial logit models, along with values of expected travel time savings.

However, this assumption may not be realistic as a transportation network is exposed to various uncertainties. This paper investigates MCP in a traffic network under stochastic travel demand. Cases of both fixed and elastic demand are considered. In the fixed demand case, travel demand is represented as a random variable, whereas in the elastic demand case, a pre-specified random variable is introduced into the demand function. The paper also considers a set of assumptions of traveler behavior. In the first case, it is assumed that the traveler considers only the mean travel time in the route choice decision (risk-neutral behavior), and in the second, both the mean and the variance of travel time are introduced into the route choice model (risk-averse behavior). A closed-form formulation of the true marginal cost toll for the stochastic network (SN-MCP) is derived from the variational inequality conditions of the system optimum and user equilibrium assignments. The key finding is that the calculation of the SN-MCP model cannot be made by simply substituting related terms in the original MCP model by their expected values. The paper provides a general function of SN-MCP and derives the closed-form SN-MCP formulation for specific cases with lognormal and normal stochastic travel demand. Four numerical examples are explored to compare network performance under the SN-MCP and other toll regimes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of carrier choice models developed in this paper suggest that 3PLs are more biased against intermodal shipping than other end-shippers. The principal conclusions are as follows: mode and carrier choice modeling needs to take into consideration differences between 3PLs and other end-shippers; and with the increasing role of 3PLs in choosing carriers, their stronger bias against intermodal shipping will present further challenges to increasing freight rail mode share.

The product distribution from plants to customers and the material supply from suppliers to plants are considered together. We merge a distribution trip and a supply trip into one triangular trip for saving allocation cost. Vehicles from plants visit a customer and a supplier for each trip. We provide a heuristic solution procedure based on Lagrangian relaxation. Computational results indicate that the proposed heuristic solution procedure is shown to be efficient yielding optimal or near-optimal solutions for randomly generated instances.

In brief we may call it the value of headway in analogy with the value of travel time and the value of reliability. Users have waiting time costs as well as schedule delay costs measured relative to their desired time of arrival at the destination. They may either arrive at the station to choose just the next departure or they may plan for a specific departure in which case they incur also a planning cost. Then planning for a specific departure is costly but becomes more attractive at longer headways. Simple expressions for the user cost result. In particular, the marginal cost of headway is large at short headways and smaller at long headways. The difference in marginal costs is the value of time multiplied by half the headway.

In the literature, most studies to develop such strategies typically assume the availability of measured link traffic information on all network links, either through manual survey or advanced traffic sensor technologies. In practical applications, the assumption of installed sensors on all links is generally unrealistic due to budgetary constraints. It motivates the need to estimate flows on all links of a traffic network based on the measurement of link flows on a subset of links with suitably equipped sensors. This study, addressed from a budgetary planning perspective, seeks to identify the smallest subset of links in a network on which to locate sensors that enables the accurate estimation of traffic flows on all links of the network under steady-state conditions. Here, steady-state implies that the path flows are static. A basis link method is proposed to determine the locations of vehicle sensors, by using the link-path incidence matrix to express the network structure and then identifying its basis in a matrix algebra context. The theoretical background and mathematical properties of the proposed method are elaborated. The approach is useful for deploying long-term planning and link-based applications in traffic networks.

Instead of sharing household responsibilities, households may hire domestic helpers for household maintenance. Alternatively, they may get helps from members of the extended family such as parents of household heads. This paper develops a model to analyze households' trade-offs between hiring domestic helpers for household maintenance and taking these responsibilities by household members. We will apply household economic theories to develop a time allocation model incorporating interactions among household members. We assume that households trade off the money they are willing to spend for hiring helpers with the time they may need to spend for household maintenance activities to maximize utilities, subject to time constraints. The model may be used to analyze the impacts of domestic helpers on household members' time allocation to subsistence, maintenance and recreation activities. It may also be applied to analyze the impacts of government policies regarding the minimum salary of domestic helpers and the change of household members' wage rates on households' decision to hire helpers. The paper extends the current literature on intra-household activity-travel interactions by considering external helps from domestic helpers, which may contribute to the understanding of activity-travel patterns of household members.

According to the implementation contents of green construction, comprehensive evaluation index system of green construction is established in this paper. Because DEA method has any advantages in a multi-input multi-output model, the comprehensive evaluation model of green construction based on DEA cross-evaluation is structured.

Achieving end-user satisfaction and optimizing the total value of an intelligent system design is a major goal of building owners and developers. A multitude of products/options with varying costs can be used to create alternatives that meet the design objectives. Owners have to carefully select the most optimum design alternative that combines the most valuable options and realize the design objectives within the project budget. This paper presents a method to help buildings' owners and developers identify the most valuable intelligent system design alternative. The proposed approach uses Value Engineering (VE) methodology to calculate value parameter for each alternative. Firstly, by pinpointing the relevance and suitability of the existing standards of intelligent system functions and specifications used in residential communities in China, three levels of system functions are identified. By using the simple arithmetic measure, Function parameter of each alternative is calculated. Considering all significant costs over the economic life of each alternative added compared to the conventional counterparts, Cost parameter of each alternative is derived. Thereafter, the derived function and cost parameters are combined to measure how well a particular alternative achieves the requirements taking into account its overall cost. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed approach helps owners and developers identify the final value of intelligent residential communities so as to optimize decision and support evaluation.","[Huang Zhiye] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,,hzye110@yahoo.com.cn; Dengxp2002@sina.com,"DENG, Xiaopeng/AGE-5078-2022","DENG, Xiaopeng/0000-0002-2987-505X",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1240,1246,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900194,0

In the field of residential construction, as a typical model of sustainable housing in China, green housing or green ecological residence (the definition is not unanimous) has taken a first step moving toward reality though there are many obstacles on the road. In order to speed up the tempo of sustainable housing in China, proposals and measures should be advanced to deal with restrictions to decrease energy consumption and reduce environmental damage. This paper studies on the mechanism of internal motivation and external impetus from view of economics to solve restrictive factors of sustainable housing in China from three aspects: developers' lacking of motivation, consumers' insufficient understanding on green house and the indetermination of government function. It is widely believed that sustainable building is more expensive than standard building practice, which leads to shortage of motivation on green housing development The paper disproves this assumption and demonstrates that sustainable building could be financially profitable, and more countermeasures are advocated to use this positive financial aspect Moreover, as a part of the inner motive, life cycle cost analysis method is introduced to help consumers changing their views of selecting and utilizing house as well as changing their lifestyle. To resolve externality problems, government should take on responsibilities and bear some of the cost to offer basic conditions for market working.

These risks mainly involve incorrect decision risks, contracting and performance risks, liability risks etc. Currently many Chinese construction enterprises lack experience in management of international project undertaking, and quite a number of enterprises are blind to potential risks of projects. To respond to international market competition, the enterprises have to analyze and study the class and value of the risks inherent in international projects carefully, establish relevant specific countermeasures pertinently, and take scientific management measures in an attempt to reduce, or transfer and spread risks, and thus occupy a favorable position in the international competition. To manage risks, firstly should identify risks, and study the probability and pattern of occurrence of risk events. Risk identification is a complicated and delicate job, so it's very important to follow specific procedures and steps, and use advanced methods to analyze each event by stages and layers, and conduct assessment practically and realistically. Secondly, it should discern and repeatedly compare each factor possibly leading to risks; make presumptions and judgment on each tendency or trend; and evaluate each internal or external factor and variable of a specific enterprise or project. In the whole process of a project's life cycle, there may appear all sorts of uncertainties, and these uncertainties will have positive or negative effects on the realization of the project's objectives. An analysis of project risks is to analyze and assess each kind of uncertainties to be arisen and their effects probably caused, and the extent of the effects appropriately. Through disclosing the effects of risks, the enterprises can analyze their potential risks and assess capabilities, and take relevant countermeasures, and thus attain the purpose of reducing the adverse effects of risks, or cutting down the probability of occurrence of risks. A project risk indicator is an important content to reflect the risk profile of a construction project and conduct risk analyses. It can select project risk indicators according to different dimensions of research, and for an international project, the risk indicator system mainly comprises the cost risk indicator, the construction period risk indicator and the financial risk indicator. This article will build a project risk evaluation indicator system by combined use of the expert survey method and the Monte Carlo simulation method. Since project completion risks may be transferred to subcontractors through contracts for project undertaking such as by the form of fixed-price turn-key contract, it is vital to evaluate the credit, experience, technology, and management of subcontractors etc. However, only emphasizing the transfer of completion risks from one party to another cannot solve the problem fundamentally, and the real dissolution of risks lies in the correct selection of subcontractors. This article will build a subcontractor multi-objective selection decision model targeting at professional contractor selection risks in international project undertaking, and make an in-depth study of risk management in international project undertaking.","[Li Bo] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100040, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,libo@ztjs.cn,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,19,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,1271,1279,,,,,,9,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900199,0

Selecting an appropriate project delivery method is one of the key factors determining the success of a project and a critical task,which determines the project schedule, quality and investment objectives. To increase the chances of project success, owners must choose appropriate project delivery system to meet their needs. This study proposed a decision-making model for the selection of project delivery system which is based on information entropy and unascertained measure model. In order to overcome the subjective evaluations from the experts, the theory of 'entropy weight' is applied to modify the experts' subjective weight. The multi-attribute unascertained measure decision- making is fitted to deal with the uncertainty information for selection of project delivery system. The application of the model in a real-world practice was provided. The methodology proposed a effective way for the owners to select a appropriate delivery system for their project in the uncertainty condition.","[Wu, X.

The result is seriously affected by interference information in Classical Factor Analysis. To deal with this problem, a Fuzzy Factor Analysis Model (FFAM) is proposed in this research. By using the FFAM, effects of interference information can be greatly reduced, and the result will be more accurate by iterative computation in FFAM. In this paper, 8 common factors, among the 26 factors affecting the safety cost of construction enterprises, are obtained by using the FFAM developed.

As a result, such models are usually estimated using maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) techniques. Unfortunately, for many practical situations, the computational cost to ensure good asymptotic MSL estimator properties can be prohibitive and practically infeasible as the number of dimensions of integration rises. In this paper, we introduce a maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) estimation approach for MNP models that can be applied using simple optimization software for likelihood estimation. It also represents a conceptually and pedagogically simpler procedure relative to simulation techniques, and has the advantage of substantial computational time efficiency relative to the MSL approach.

The model incorporates a parametric variational inequality (VI) that formulates the user equilibrium (UE) behavior of intermodal operators in route choice for any given network design decision of the network planner. The model also uses a cost function that is capable of reflecting the transition from scale economies to scale diseconomies in distinct flow regimes for carriers or hub operators, and a disutility function integrating actual transportation charges and congestion impacts for intermodal operators. To solve the MPEC model, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) embedded with a diagonalization method for solving the parametric VI is proposed. Finally, the comparative analysis of the HGA and an exhaustive enumeration algorithm indicates a good performance of the HGA in terms of computational time and solution quality. The HGA is also applied to solve a large-scale problem to show the applicability of the proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The need is further highlighted by the challenges arising from the capacity needs of rapid urbanization and the need to renew aging infrastructure. This paper proposes a generalized modeling framework that combines a multilayer network concept with a market-based economic approach to capture the interdependencies among various infrastructure systems with disparate physical and operational characteristics. Thereby, the various infrastructure systems are modeled as individual networks connected through links representing market interactions. The market interactions capture the various types of interdependencies through supply-demand mechanisms. The modeling framework uses a multilayer infrastructure network (MIN) concept, the computable general equilibrium (CGE) theory, and its spatial extension (SCGE), to formulate an equilibrium problem. The mapping between the modeling framework and the real-world context is discussed, followed by a description of the various model components.

Our formulation belongs to the problem class that Pang and Stewart (2008) refer to as differential variational inequalities. It combines the within-day time scale for which route and departure time choices fluctuate in continuous time with the day-to-day time scale for which demand evolves in discrete time steps. Our formulation is consistent with the often told story that drivers adjust their travel demands at the end of every day based on their congestion experience during one or more previous days. We show that analysis of the within-day assignment model is tremendously simplified by expressing dynamic user equilibrium as a differential variational inequality. We also show there is a class of day-to-day demand growth models that allow the dual-time-scale formulation to be decomposed by time-stepping to yield a sequence of continuous time, single-day, dynamic user equilibrium problems. To solve the single-day DUE problems arising during time-stepping, it is necessary to repeatedly solve a dynamic network loading problem. We observe that the network loading phase of DUE computation generally constitutes a differential algebraic equation (DAE) system, and we show that the DAE system for network loading based on the link delay model (LDM) of Friesz et al. (1993) may be approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). That system of ODEs, as we demonstrate, may be efficiently solved using traditional numerical methods for such problems. To compute an actual dynamic user equilibrium, we introduce a continuous time fixed-point algorithm and prove its convergence for effective path delay operators that allow a limited type of nonmonotone path delay. We show that our DUE algorithm is compatible with network loading based on the LDM and the cell transmission model (CTM) due to Daganzo (1995). We provide a numerical example based on the much studied Sioux Falls network. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The traffic performance model describes how traffic propagates (over time) along routes connecting origin-destination (OD) pairs, examples being the cell transmission model, the vertical queueing model and the travel time model. This is implemented in a dynamic network loading (DNL) algorithm, which uses the given route inflows to compute the link inflows (and hence link costs), which are then used to compute the route travel times (and hence route costs). A route swap process specifies the route inflows for tomorrow (at the next iteration) based on the route inflows today (at the current iteration). A dynamic user equilibrium (DUE), where each traveller on the network cannot reduce his or her cost of travel by switching to another route, can be sought by iterating between the DNL algorithm and the route swap process. The route swap process itself takes up very little computational time (although route set generation can be very computationally intensive for large networks). However, the choice of route swap process dramatically affects convergence and the speed of convergence. The paper details several route swap processes and considers whether they lead to a convergent system, assuming that the route cost vector is a monotone function of the route inflow vector.

Specifically, it has been argued that some respondents may simplify the choice tasks by consistently ignoring one or more of the attributes describing the alternatives, and direct questions put to respondents after the completion of SC surveys support this hypothesis. However, in the general context of issues with response quality in SC data, there are certainly grounds for questioning the reliability of stated attribute processing strategies. In this paper, we take a different approach by attempting to infer attribute processing strategies through the analysis of respondent-specific coefficient distributions obtained through conditioning on observed choices. Our results suggest that a share of respondents do indeed ignore a subset of explanatory variables. However, there is also some evidence that the inferred attribute processing strategies are not necessarily consistent with the stated attribute processing strategies. Additionally, there is some evidence that respondents who claim to have ignored a certain attribute may simply have assigned it lesser importance. The results produced by the inferring approach not only lead to slightly better fit but also more consistent results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model system takes the form of a joint mixed Multinomial Logit-Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MNL-MDCEV) structure that (a) accommodates differential sensitivity to the ATE attributes due to both observed and unobserved individual-related attributes, and (b) controls for the self-selection of individuals into neighborhoods due to both observed and unobserved individual-related factors. The joint model system is estimated on a sample of 2793 households and individuals residing in Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area. The model results indicate the significant presence of residential self-selection effects due to both observed and unobserved individual-related factors. For instance, individuals from households with more bicycles are associated with a higher preference for out-of-home physically active pure recreational travel pursuits (such as bicycling around in the neighborhood). These same individuals locate into neighborhoods with good bicycling facilities. This leads to a non-causal association between individuals' time investment in out-of-home physically active pure recreational travel and bicycling facilities in their residential neighborhoods. Thus, ignoring the effect of bicycle ownership in the time-use model, would lead to an inflated estimate of the effect of bicycling facility density on the time invested in physically active pure recreational travel. Similarly, there are significant unobserved individual factors that lead to a high preference for physically active recreational activities and also make individuals locate in areas with good bicycling facilities. When such unobserved factors were controlled by the proposed joint residential location and time-Use model, the impact of bicycling facility density on out-of-home physically active recreational activities ceased to be statistically significant (from being statistically significant in the independent time-use model). These results highlight the need to control for residential self-selection effects when estimating the effects of the activity-travel environment on activity time-use choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, a small but growing stream of research has looked at using what have become known as efficient SC experimental designs to allocate the attribute levels to choice situations in a manner designed to produce better model outcomes. This research stream has shown that the use of efficient SC designs can lead to improvements in the reliability of parameter estimates derived from discrete choice models estimated on SC data for a given sample size. Unlike orthogonal designs, however, efficient SC experiments are generated in such a manner that their efficiency is related to the econometric model that is most likely to be estimated once the choice data is collected. To date, most of the research on efficient SC designs has assumed an MNL model format. In this paper, we generate efficient SC experiments for Nested logit models and compare and contrast these with designs specifically generated assuming an MNL model form. We find that the overall efficiency of the design is maximized only when the model assumed in generating the design is the model that is fitted during estimation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid increases of housing price are one aspect of the bubble, but the mere fact of rapid price growth itself is not the conclusive evidence of a bubble. The inspection of the bubble in housing market must be based on the correct analysis of public expectations. In this paper, the forming of housing market expectations and influences on price are examined on the basis of the investigation of agents in housing market. The results indicate that people's expectations can partly explain the trend of housing price in Tianjin in recent years and the public expectations can be easily influenced by informal information, which causes the herd behavioral.

Secondly, the real estate enterprises were over-optimistic about the market. Finally, non-rational consumption of housing buyers, over-lending of banks and the real estate speculation had increased the volatility of the real estate market.

This paper introduces the principles and technology support of nD modeling, analyzes the challenges that traditional construction design and construction management facing, proposes an nD enabled collaborative environment, and explains how the construction design and management collaboration can be achieved though the nD modeling.","[Yang, J.] Southeast Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,,yj8133@163.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,5,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2274,2280,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901129,0

Furthermore, the urban metropolis is now widely recognized to be an environment which is especially vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and for which integrated supply chain decisions can produce very substantial net benefits. Accordingly, this paper presents a dynamic supply chain network model formulated as a differential variational inequality; the model is fashioned to allow consideration of supply chain disruption threats to producers, freight carriers, and retail enterprises.

Due to the current hub-and-spoke operation of the airline industry, the focus of RM research has shifted from the traditional single-leg problem to the network-type problem. The mainstream approaches, bid price and virtual nesting, are faced with some limitations such as inaccuracy due to their suboptimal nature and operation interruption caused by the required updates. This study developed an algorithm to generate a seat control policy by approximating the expected revenue function in a dynamic programming (DP) model. In order to deal with the issue of dimensionality for the DP model in a network context, this study used a suitable parameterized function and a sampling concept to achieve the approximation. In the numerical experiment, the objective function value of the developed algorithm was very close to the one achieved by the optimal control. We believe that this approach can serve as an alternative to the current mainstream approaches for the network RM problem for airlines and will provide an inspiring concept for other types of multi-resource RM problems.

The proposed model considers simultaneous route and departure time choices of heterogenous users who are distinguished by their valuation of travel time and punctual arrival. Moreover, two dynamic system optima are considered: one minimizes system cost in the unit of monetary value (i.e., the conventional system optimum, or SO) and the other minimizes system cost in the unit of travel time (i.e., the time-based SO, or TSO). Analytical solutions of no-toll equilibrium, SO and ISO are provided and the welfare effects of the corresponding dynamic congestion pricing options are examined, with and without route choice. The analyses suggest that TSO provides a Pareto-improving solution to the social inequity issue associated with SO. Although a TSO toll is generally discriminatory, anonymous TSO tolls do exist under certain circumstances. Unlike in the case with homogenous users, an SO toll generally alters users' route choices by tolling the poorer users off the more desirable road, which worsens social inequity. Numerical examples are presented to verify analytical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The contribution of this paper is to develop a dynamic model of rail demand at the market-level, yielding short and long-run elasticities with respect to lateness. Whereas individual-level models have suggested a high valuation of lateness and reliability, our market-level models indicate a relatively mooted demand response. Reconciling these findings, we reason that., whilst rail travellers show considerable disdain for experiences of lateness, such experiences will not necessarily dissuade them from travelling by train.

Government interventions are needed to solve these problems, yet few quantitative models are available to guide the design of related public policies. This paper proposes a new model for optimizing the allocation of additional routes in a liberalizing airline market, in which airport capacity constraints are explicitly considered. The proposed model captures the interactions among three types of agents: (1) a regulator who aims to maximize social welfare by optimizing the allocation of additional routes to competing carriers; (2) airlines competing with flight frequency and airfare; and (3) passengers who minimize their own travel disutility (or equivalently maximize utility) given airlines' services and prices. In the proposed model, the passenger demand elasticity is also explicitly considered. The route allocation model is formulated as a 0-1 integer programming problem, and is solved by a heuristic implicit enumeration approach. The Korean - mainland China - Hong Kong airline market serves as model illustration. The effects of airport slot constraints are examined, and the revealed value (marginal welfare gain) of airport capacity expansion is also calculated, which can potentially serve as a benchmark indicator for the planning of airport investments.

A Bayesian nonparametric estimation procedure is employed for the model's link function, substantially reducing the risk of a mis-specified model. It is shown via simulation that little is lost in terms of estimation quality if the nonparametric estimation procedure is used when standard parametric assumptions (e.g., linear functional forms) are satisfied, but there is significant gain if the parametric assumptions are violated. It is also shown that imposing appropriate monotonicity constraints on the relationships provides better function estimates. Results suggest that key factors for explaining crash rate variability across roadways are the amount and density of traffic, presence and degree of a horizontal curve, and road classification. Issues related to count forecasting on individual roadway segments and out-of-sample validation measures also are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this approach, consumers optimize their combined residence and transport options represented as paths in an extended network built by connecting the transport sub-network to a fictitious sub-network that represents land-use and transport demand options. We model a static land-use and transport equilibrium by considering road congestion and location externalities. The latter include trip destination choices based on land-use attractions, as well as endogenous neighborhood characteristics that determine residential choices and segregation phenomena. The model can deal with heterogeneous populations and locations as well as multiple trip purposes, though it assumes only private transport modes. In a previous paper we studied the case with road congestion externalities only, characterizing equilibria by a strictly convex and coercive unconstrained minimization problem. This characterization fails for more general externalities, so we restate the model as a fixed-point problem, establishing the existence of equilibria, providing sufficient conditions for its uniqueness and for the convergence of a fixed-point iteration. A small numerical example is used to illustrate the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We then compare transport systems that have, for a given capacity, the same total infrastructure cost but vary in the proportion of fixed costs and variable capacity costs. We show that, compared to a benchmark infrastructure which has zero fixed costs, an infrastructure which has (ceteris paribus) a higher share of fixed costs leads to higher welfare for the regional government building it. Moreover, we find that, even for capacity characterized by very high shares of fixed costs, financing of infrastructure is generally not an important issue as long as regions are allowed to toll through traffic. Finally, we show that, compared to the benchmark technology without fixed costs, regions are more likely to make a particular transport investment if they can chose a technology with higher fixed costs. As a corollary. projects with a higher share of fixed costs do not necessarily require higher federal subsidies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Several authors have criticized this approach because it fails to recognize attribute thresholds in consumer behavior, or a more generic domain where such a compensatory strategy is contained, In this paper, a mixed strategy is proposed, which combines the compensatory strategy valid in the interior of the choice domain with cutoff factors that restrain choices to the domain edge. The proposed model combines the multinomial logit model with a binomial logit factor that represents soft cutoffs. This approach extends previous contributions in several ways and allows multiple dimensions for cutoff factors. In addition to considering individual behavior, it introduces system constraints Such as capacity and inter-agent interactions (choice externalities). This extension yields a non-linear problem, which is solved by analyzing the fixed point problem. Additionally, a set of evaluation tools, a social utility of the constrained problem, and a measure of the shadow price of each constraint, are proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In a closed housing market, the housing price is mainly determined by the quantity of housing supply, the inhabitants' income and the commercial banks' credit support to housing consumption. In an open housing market, the housing price is mainly determined by the quantity of housing supply, the inhabitants' income, the housing-buyers' wealth outside the district and the commercial banks' credit support to housing consumption. The quantity of housing supply is mainly determined by the amount of land provided by local government in the long run, and is mainly determined by the real estate developers' behavior of housing supply in the short run.

This requires the participation of various government departments and stakeholder groups along with scientists and experts from different scientific disciplines. Conflict, arising from the diversity of perspectives, beliefs and benefits among those interest groups is a common characteristic of integrated water management. In order to benefit from stakeholder participations in supporting and accepting any results obtained in stakeholder meetings etc, the conflict of interests must be addressed. Examining the essence of the conflict, the Integrated Sustainability Assessment (ISA) is a form of knowledge co-production aiming at gathering and synthesizing diverse perceptions of persisting problems. ISA is a cyclical process of scoping, envisioning, experimenting and learning to provide the stakeholder with a deeper understanding of causalities behind the water issues. Following the visionary process of ISA, we particularly focus on agent based modeling as an essential method to understand and visualize the complexity of water resource management. Agent Based Models (ABM.) complements traditional analytic methods and is a useful approach to depict not only the roots of conflict, but also potential resolutions based on stakeholders viewpoints. Nevertheless, ABM and designing and implementing the computer applications, which are supposed to reflect the ideas shaped during the ISA process, is very challenging. There are few examples of computer models, if any, embedding multiple disciplines to capture the interactions among stakeholders related to water issues. As a result of these challenges, many developed models detach from the initial goals and cannot be used effectively to address the problem. We strive to address some of these challenges by recognizing the need for an analytical (conceptual) framework along with empirical evidence from case studies as well as utilizing appropriate methodologies and tools for the implementation phase. Respectively, first, we explore the role of the Agent Modeling Language (AML) to develop the conceptual model upon which the computer models should be built up. AML provides a rich set of modeling constructs for modeling applications that substantiates and/or shows characteristics of multi-agent systems such as a river basin with all its stakeholders. Second, we propose to apply eXtreme Programming (XP) methodology to implement agent-based models. XP is based on short-time software delivery providing the developers with the opportunity of fixing the applications' errors, and changing the direction of development in the early stages. We use an example to illustrate the process of developing an agent-based model and how to deal with the complications of converging different perspectives in the model.","[Nastar, Maryam; Wallman, Patrik] LUCSUS, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",,,maryam.nastar@lucsus.lu.se; patrik.wallman@lucsus.lu.se,"Nastar, Maryam/GYU-1214-2022","Nastar, Maryam/0000-0001-8918-9601",,,,,23,2,2,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1863-5520,,978-3-540-88350-0,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

Therefore, this study suggested Project Consulting Management as a new method of PM model for owner-in house to maximize an owner's impact. The model focuses on consulting management of priority elements at each stage, and it was applied to an actual project: Star City. The owner's powerful involvement ensured that the project was secure, and also advanced the new project.

Second, the technical efficiency of China real estate industry is influenced by GDP, population, square and the number of corporate of real estate industry. This means that the differences of technical efficiency are owned to the environment variables under the same conditions. Finally, real estate industry in China is in the state of increasing return to scale, but the scale efficiency is low.

To cope with the dependency of node-link adjacency matrix on new links, travel time function is appropriately modified. The nonlinearity of the travel time function is also removed by means of a convex-combination based linear approximation which takes advantage of a unimodular structure. Two valid inequalities is developed which shorten computation time significantly. The validity of the proposed formulation is examined by two test problems.

A fast lane reserves a more than proportional share of capacity to a designated group of travelers. Travelers are otherwise identical and other travelers can use the reserved capacity when it would otherwise be idle. The paper shows that such a fast lane is always Pareto improving under Nash equilibrium in arrival times at the bottleneck and inelastic demand. It can replicate the arrival schedule and queueing outcomes of a toll that optimally charges a constant toll during part of the demand peak. Within some bounds, the fast lane scheme is still welfare improving when demand is elastic. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We reviewed cost-effectiveness estimates for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS published from 2002--2007 and catalogued in the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry. We constructed efficiency frontier (EF) curves by plotting QALYs against costs, using methods used by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) in Germany. We stratified the QALY-cost ratios by prevention stage, country of study, and payer perspective, and estimated EF equations using log and square-root models. A total of 53 QALY-cost ratios were identified for HIV/AIDS in the Tufts CEA Registry. Plotted ratios stratified by prevention stage were visually grouped into a cluster consisting of primary/secondary prevention measures and a cluster consisting of tertiary measures. Correlation coefficients for each cluster were statistically significant. For each cluster, we derived two EF equations -- one based on the log model, and one based on the square-root model. Our findings indicate that stratification of HIV/AIDS interventions by prevention stage can yield distinct EFs, and that the correlation and regression analyses are useful for parametrically characterizing EF equations. Our study has certain limitations, such as the small number of included articles and the potential for study populations to be non-representative of countries of interest. Nonetheless, our approach could help develop a deeper appreciation of cost effectiveness beyond the deterministic approach developed by IQWiG.",,,"Kamae, MS (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",mkamae@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,"Cohen, Joshua/0000-0003-1737-0991",,,,,0,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this contribution, we compare Kerner's three-phase traffic theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental diagram. We discuss the inconsistent use of the term traffic phase and show that patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with simple two-phase models, if the model parameters are suitably specified and factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered, such as effects of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design (e g combinations of off- and on-ramps) Conversely. we demonstrate that models created to reproduce three-phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and associated phase diagrams, no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental diagram in equilibrium or non-unique flow-density relationships In conclusion, there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized facts of spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution, and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and data, considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of detail in the traffic model used.

This paper investigates the properties of Pareto-efficient BOT contracts using a bi-objective programming approach under perfect information. Under certain conventional assumptions, we find that for any Pareto-efficient BOT contract: (1) the concession period should be set to be the whole road life: (2) the volume-capacity ratio (or the road service quality) and the average social cost per trip are constantly equal to those at the social optimum whenever there are constant returns to scale in road construction. Extensions are made to the cases with increasing (decreasing) returns to scale in road construction. A variety of regulatory regimes are investigated to analyze the behavior of the profit-maximizing private firm, and efficient regulations, including demand and markup charge regulations, are elucidated for both the public and private sectors to achieve a predetermined Pareto-optimal outcome.

The problem consists of identifying the minimum cost routes required to service (e.g., pickup or deliver) demand located along the edges of a network. Unfortunately, the problem belongs to the set of NP-Hard problems: consequently. numerous heuristic and metaheuristic solution approaches have been developed to solve it. In this article. an ant colony optimization based metaheuristic is presented. Modifications are introduced for various components of the ant colony metaheuristics: specifically for those associated with the initial population, the ant decision rule and the local search procedure. The new metaheuristic was tested on seven standard test networks for the capacitated arc routing problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs extremely well vis-A-vis the state-of-the-art metaheuristics for the problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All exogenous factors are considered to be constant over time and user equilibrium is being pursued through a day-to-day adjustment process. The traffic dynamics is represented by a recurrence function, which governs the system evolution over time. Equilibrium stability and attraction domain are then analyzed by studying the topological properties of the system evolution. Stability is important because unstable equilibrium is transient. Even for stable equilibrium, only points within its attraction domain are attracted to the equilibrium. We show that the attraction domain of a stable equilibrium is always open. Furthermore. its boundary is formed by trajectories towards unstable equilibria. Through an understanding of these properties, computation schemes can be devised to determine the ranges of the attraction domains, as demonstrated in this study. Once this is accomplished. a partition chart can be drawn on the state space where each part represents the attraction domain of an equilibrium point. We trust that charting the attraction domains of user equilibria, as presented in this paper, will open up innovative ways for transportation network management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The literature illustrates the large efforts in trying to move forward from this simplistic approach, the limited attempts in modeling route choice behavior from revealed preference data, and the nonexistent endeavor in investigating the transferability of more realistic path generation techniques and route choice models. This paper introduces a test to analyze the transferability of path generation techniques that is based on a newly defined efficiency index for the evaluation of their cost-effectiveness. Then, equality of model estimates is tested to examine the transferability of route choice models, based on a methodology normally used in the estimation of models with mixed data (typically revealed and stated preference data) and on an existing transferability test statistic commonly used in mode choice modeling. Lastly, an experiment is presented to illustrate the implementation of the transferability tests, based on revealed preference data from two different case studies. Experiment results show that path generation techniques are totally transferable at the model specification level and partially transferable at the model parameter level, and that transferability is generally verified when parameters optimized for a larger network are successfully applied to a smaller network. Experiment results also show that not all route choice models are transferable at the model specification level, and none are transferable at the model parameter level. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The scale of public facilities and road area are larger than those in ordinary residential quarters. So water consumption for greening, roads, waterscape and other facilities is enormous, which causes much burden to residents and real estate companies. Tap water is commonly the sole water resource for these usages. However, the growing price of tap water overloads this burden. New water resources must be found. Rainwater and domestic sewage may be two alternatives. They are compared in aspects of technology complexity, investment, operation cost and reliability. Rainwater can be easily treated. Unit operation cost for rainwater treatment is about 1/4 of tap water. But initial investment on rainwater collection system and reservoir is large because the scale of rainwater reuse is decided by unpotable water demand on the most unfavorable condition. The treatment facilities for domestic sewage reclamation are more complicated, but sewage capacity and quality is relatively more stable. Sewage reuse can save 1/2 of daily costs compared with tap water usage. Therefore in periods with plenty of rainfall, rainwater is the first substitute for tap water in ecological residential quarters. Rainwater collection system and reservior should be designed and installed appropriately. Sewage is a reliable water resource except tap water in periods with insufficient rainfall. But it should be treated thoroughly. When the reclaimed water is used as waterscape supplement, the sewage needs deep treatment to remove nitrogen and phosphorus effectively in case of algae propagation. Comprehensive utilization of rainwater and sewage is suggested. It can not only save investment and costs, but also enhance water supply reliability and residential environment level. The implementation of this integrated water reuse needs the support of policies and strategies.","[Jing, Z. Q.; Ge, J.; Xue, H.

The model could propose an interval for possible negotiation between the host government and the private investor. Nevertheless, a major limitation in applying this model is identified in this paper. In a BOT project, the net asset value of the facility at its transfer time is significantly greater than zero. However, this net asset value was not considered in the analysis of the model. This study extends the BOTCcM to an alternative BOT concession period negotiation interval model by incorporating the net asset value of the facility at its transfer time. The span of the concession period interval proposed by the new model for negotiation between the host government and the private investor should be significantly shorter than that proposed by the BOTCcM.","[Wu Min] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,,minwu@hku.hk; lhli@hku.hk,"Wu, Min/AAB-2446-2022","Wu, Min/0000-0003-0977-3600",,,,,6,0,0,0,2,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2606,2611,,,,,,6,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901183,0

It is necessary for the urban residents, property-management staff and concerned experts to consider from a strategic perspective how to establish a scientific and feasible evaluation index system for property management service. According to the theory of Analytical Hierarchy Process, this paper established an evaluation index system for property management service. By applying Analytical Hierarchy Process, this paper sets up an objective evaluation index system to make the qualitative problems quantified. This index system not only provides a scetific evaluation and management for property management, but also performs a good function in directing the property management. The index system can provide theoretical reference for the further improvement of the quality of property management service.","[Wu Yunqing] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tiangong University,,wyqmaster@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,2084,2090,,,,,,7,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119901096,0

Whereas traditionally the objectives of housing affordability and housing sustainability were considered in isolation, policy responses are increasingly recognising the importance of both. However, any policy attempting to foster best practise in terms of affordability and sustainable housing must be able to link housing outcomes with the broader community; that is, affordable and sustainable housing must be socially sustainable. This paper considers social sustainability in terms of social acceptability, the minimisation of social exclusion and the fostering of social capital. Affordability is also analysed at a conceptual level before the concluding discussion attempts to overlay the two concepts in suggesting how social sustainability may be fostered in affordable and sustainable housing.","[Zillante, George; Arman, Michael; Davidson, Kathryn; Wilson, Lou; Pullen, Stephen; Zuo, Jian] Univ S Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",University of South Australia,,george.zillante@unisa.edu.au; michael.arman@unisa.edu.au; kathryn.davidson@unisa.edu.au; lou.wilson@unisa.edu.au; stephen.pullen@unisa.edu.au; jian.zuo@unisa.edu.au,"Zuo, Jian/D-4055-2009; Zuo, Jian/HPD-5969-2023; Wilson, Lou/E-2456-2011; Zuo, Jian/M-3223-2016; Davidson, Kathryn/F-3769-2013","Davidson, Kathryn/0000-0003-3521-3535",,,,,33,0,0,0,5,HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV,KOWLOON,"INST TEXTILES & CLOTHING, YUK CHOI RD, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-962-367-675-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,456,463,,,,,,8,"Construction & Building Technology; Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil; Management; Urban Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Business & Economics; Engineering; Urban Studies,BQI61,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000281119900070,0

In this paper, we consider a model in which wages and the decision whether or not to provide a company car are the result of direct negotiation between employer and employee. Using this framework, we theoretically and numerically study first- and second-best optimal tax policies on labour and transport markets, focusing on the role of the tax treatment of company cars. We obtain the following results. First, higher labour taxes and a more favourable tax treatment of company cars raise the fraction employees that receives a company car; congestion and congestion tolls reduce it. Second, in countries that provide large implicit subsidies to company cars, eliminating the preferential tax treatment of company cars may be an imperfect but quite effective substitute for currently unavailable congestion tolls. The numerical illustration, calibrated using Belgian data, suggests that it yields about half the welfare gain attainable through optimal congestion taxes. Third, the favourable tax treatment of company cars justifies large public transport subsidies; the numerical results are consistent with zero public transport fares. Finally, we find that earlier models that ignored the preferential tax treatment of company cars may have substantially underestimated optimal congestion tolls in Europe. The numerical illustration suggests that about one third of the optimal congestion toll we obtain can be attributed to the current tax treatment of company cars. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Conceptually, the global sub-optimality or infeasibility of the decentralized system is resolved by a network controller who coordinates the dispatchers and train operators at the lower layers on a real-time basis. However, such notion of a multi-layer system cannot be effectual unless the top layer is able to provide a global solution soon enough for the dynamic lower layers to adapt in a seamless manner. Unfortunately, a train-conflict resolution problem is NP-hard as formally established in this paper and an effective solution method traded off between computation time and solution quality has been lacking in literature. Thus, we propose a column-generation-based algorithm that exploits the separability of the problem. A key ingredient of the algorithm is an efficient heuristic for the pricing subproblem for column generation. Tested on the real data from the Seoul metropolitan railway network, the algorithm provides near-optimal conflict-free timetables in a few seconds for most cases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the ones of the previous MIP-based heuristic by Tornquist and Persson (2007) and the priority-based heuristic by Sahin (1999).

By allowing multiple vehicles to service the same customer (i.e., splitting deliveries), substantial savings in travel costs are possible. However, split deliveries are often an inconvenience to the customer who would prefer to have demand serviced in a single visit. We consider the vehicle routing problem in which split deliveries are allowed only if a minimum fraction of a customer's demand is serviced by a vehicle.

We derive analytical results both for general cost and demand functions and for specific functional forms, namely Bureau of Public Roads cost functions and constant-elasticity demand functions. The latter are also used in a numerical simulation model. We consider second-best cases where only a sub-set of links in a network is subject to tolling and/or capacity choice, and cases with and without a self-financing constraint imposed. We will demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, second-best long-run cost (or actually: generalized price) functions can be derived for most of the cases of interest, which can be used in an applied network model as a substitute for the conventional short-run user cost functions. Doing so reduces the dimensionality of the problem and should therefore be helpful in speeding up procedures for finding second-best optima. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
