The article also presents the methodological framework applied in defining goals in a society as well as the role and the interdependence of social indicators and performance indicators for specific units/programs in public administration. On this basis, we developed a theoretical concept of connections between different levels of long-term goals, implementational goals as well as efficiency and effectiveness indicators at the level of sub-programs of selected budget users. A theoretical and methodological framework constructed in this way will hopefully serve as the basis for realizing the concept of Slovenian direct performance budgeting in the near future.","[Aristovnik, Aleksander; Seljak, Janko] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Aristovnik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Gosarjeva 5, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si; janko.seljak@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649",,,,,42,7,7,0,13,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Applying Granger and Huang's (1997) methodology we find evidence that size of government Granger causes corruption in both samples. Since a larger government involvement in private markets today will be followed in future by a higher level of corruption a policy advice would be to enhance governance.

Micro level studies suggest managerial skills play a key role in the adoption of modern technologies. In this paper we model the interactive process between on-the-job managerial skill acquisition and the adoption of modern technology. We use the model to illustrate why some countries develop managerial skills quickly and adopt best practice technologies, while others stay backwards. The model also explains why managers will not migrate from rich countries to poor countries, as would be needed to generate convergence. Finally we show why standard growth accounting exercises will incorrectly attribute a large proportion of managerial skills' contribution to total factor productivity and we quantify the importance of this bias.","[Beaudry, Paul; Francois, Patrick] Univ British Columbia, CIFAR & CEPR, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of British Columbia; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Beaudry, P (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, CIFAR & CEPR, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,,,,,,,33,18,19,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Postponing retirement may increase time devoted to grandchild care transfers, which allows the young to work more on the labor market. We then study the conditions under which this positive family externality holds.

Does the incidence of a currency crisis increase the subsequent demand for reserves? Do countries make choices between different combinations of exchange rate regime and reserve holding? Does an arrangement with the IMF encourage countries subsequently to build up reserves more than they otherwise would have done? Do different patterns emerge depending upon the measure of reserves used? In addressing the above questions, we find significant support for the 'Mrs. Machlup's Wardrobe Theory' of international reserves, which purports that irrespective of the amount of reserves countries have accumulated, they continue to add to their stock.","[Bird, Graham; Mandilaras, Alex] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Mandilaras, A (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",amandilaras@surrey.ac.uk,,"Mandilaras, Alex/0000-0001-5833-4458",,,,,10,8,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In particular, it analyses the circumstances in which a government of a single country, considered to be a small economy, has incentives (or not), to synchronise the domestic election dates with the election dates (not necessarily determined in an endogenous way) of a country performing the role of an 'anchor', considered to be a large economy. To achieve this purpose, the paper uses, as an illustration, an asymmetric version of the model in Miller and Salmon (1990) in order to derive the optimal domestic electoral period length, which, in this sense, can be considered to be endogenously determined. The paper then shows how elections should occur in the small economy in order to benefit from the performance of the large economy. As a particularly relevant result it is shown that the incentive to synchronise the election dates depends upon the inflation history of the economies.","Univ Evora, Evora, Portugal",University of Evora,"Caleiro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Evora, Portugal.",caleiro@uevora.pt,"Caleiro, António Bento/B-2815-2008","Caleiro, António Bento/0000-0003-1205-4404",,,,,27,0,0,0,6,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

To account for seasonal effects we additionally use a Difference-In-Differences (DID) strategy. Descriptives show that there is a post-reform increase in the number of mini-jobs. However, we show that this increase cannot be causally related to the reform, since the short-run effects are very limited.

Institutional distance between a pair of countries appears then as a fundamental variable to be considered in explaining international trade flows. This paper implements a gravity model to analyze bilateral trade patterns empirically in relation with the institutional aspects. It allows us specifically to investigate the influence of institutions on the commercial patterns for 51 from 1996 to 2004. We use indicators on political stability, regulatory quality, and other proxies that reflect de quality of governance for both partners as well as their institutional distance. Those indicators are successively incorporated in the gravity equations. The paper ought to test that institutions and good governance matter for international trade.

Thanks to the signaling opportunity that arises when notification is voluntary, voluntary notification leads to lower enforcement costs for the regulator and lower notification costs for the merging parties. Some of the theoretical predictions are supported by exploratory empirical tests using merger data from Australia.

While the factoring company has enough information about its clients (credit report based on financial and non-financial data), about customers there are only few characteristics. But the risk of non-payment lies on the customers. Thereby, it is important to find some common similarities among the customers. This is done here by clustering with Bregman divergence. In the second section we describe shortly the principle of factoring business and in Section 4 possible customers' characteristics (turnover through factoring, pay morale, yield, per cent of offsets, etc.) The third section introduces Bregman divergence (definition and basic properties). Then we describe the procedure for clustering and apply it to the data about customers. The procedure was written in VBA MS Excel.

We discuss this issue in the context of an example involving a pair of new Keynesian DSGE models in which the central bank's policy model includes a misspecified Phillips curve.

This study investigates the validity of these accusations by following the TA100 Index and four designed portfolios during the period 2006 to 2008. The designed portfolios were constructed in accordance with the weekly report on short selling activity issued by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The results show that short sellers did not succeed in outperforming the market during that 3-year period. Moreover, the portfolios that did not include the stocks picked by the short sellers performed more poorly (they should have been sold short) than the portfolios that included stocks chosen by the short sellers.

Yet, this economic variable is a common thread running through recent concerns about obesity and the Food Stamp (FS) program. This article provides initial estimates of the time cost in food preparation at home for the United States. Two standard methods of estimation are implemented and three demographic profiles are considered: (i) the general population, (ii) the typical FS participant and (iii) the typical FS participant following the United States Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food Plan. For the general population and averaging across methods, the time cost share of total food cost is about 30% if the individual works in the market and at home, but it is about 49% if the individual does not work in the market. For the typical FS participant, especially one following the Thrifty Food plan, the time cost share of total food cost can be as much as 26% higher than the general population. These substantial percentages provide strong incentives to purchase food away from home and help undermine overall diet quality and the efficacy of the FS program, which ignores the time cost in food at home production.","[Davis, George C.; You, Wen] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Davis, GC (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, 214 Hutcheson Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",georgedavis@vt.edu,,,,,,,40,23,31,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We estimate the average difference between a foreign-owned and a domestically owned firm's debt ratio, treating the mode of ownership as endogenous. Using data from 32,067 European firms, we find that foreign-owned firms on average exhibit a significantly higher debt ratio than their domestically owned counterparts in the host country.

At a lower GDP growth of 1.22% a year, gasoline consumption would be reduced and domestic ethanol consumption in Brazil would be no higher than 18.32 billion liters. Contrary to the current situation, forecasts indicated that hydrated ethanol consumption could become much higher than anhydrous consumption in Brazil. The former is being consumed in cars moved exclusively by ethanol and flex-fuel cars, successfully introduced in the country at 2003. Flex cars allow Brazilian consumers to choose between gasoline and hydrated ethanol and immediately switch to whichever fuel presents the most favourable relative price.","[Figueira, Sergio Rangel; Burnquist, Heloisa Lee; Piedade Bacchi, Mirian Rumenos] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agri Luiz de Queiroz, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Burnquist, HL (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agri Luiz de Queiroz, Ave Padua Dias 11,POB 9, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",hlburnqu@esalq.usp.br,"Bacchi, Mirian/C-3657-2015",,,,,,24,12,12,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this period maternity leave benefits became less generous, and childcare was privatized and became increasingly scarce. Using nationally representative household survey data it is shown that in 1992, there was essentially no association between the probability of a woman being a labour force participant and her having a child under age 3. However, by 2004, having children under age 3 had become associated with significantly reduced participation and employment probabilities, conditional on other observable characteristics of women and their households, and local factors. Several potential explanations for these findings are discussed.","[Grogan, Louise] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Koka, Katerina] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",University of Guelph; Brock University,"Grogan, L (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, MacKinnon Bldg Rm 743, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",lgrogan@uoguelph.ca; kkoka@brocku.ca,"Koka, Katerina/AAA-9938-2021","Koka, Katerina/0000-0002-8834-7994",,,,,34,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Particular emphasis is given to the question of whether the extent of rent-sharing varies with collective bargaining coverage. In this context, two conflicting hypotheses are tested. The first one asserts that unions exploit their bargaining power at the firm level and appropriate a larger share of rents than the bargaining parties in uncovered firms. The second one states that unions favour a compressed intra-industry wage structure and suppress the responsiveness of wages to firm-specific profitability conditions. The empirical analysis provides strong support for the second hypothesis. While Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (POLS) estimates yield positive estimates of the rent-sharing coefficient in covered establishments, dynamic panel data estimates accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of rents point to a rent-sharing coefficient of zero.","Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Labour Markets Human Resources & Social Poli, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Guertzgen, N (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Labour Markets Human Resources & Social Poli, Mannheim, Germany.",guertzgen@zen.de,,,,,,,40,12,12,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The co-agglomeration of foreign and domestic enterprises may be a driving force of intra-industrial agglomeration. Theories however provide conflicting predictions on whether foreign and domestic enterprises share similar locations. Based on data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms in 2005 in China, this study finds that foreign enterprises are considerably more agglomerated than domestic enterprises, and there exist significant industrial variations in the intra-industry co-agglomeration of foreign and domestic enterprises. Statistical analysis suggests that foreign-specific agglomeration and dependence on intermediate inputs from primary industries discourage the co-agglomeration of foreign and domestic enterprises. Differences in equipment, technology and labour productivity result in locational patterns of foreign enterprises distinct from those of domestic enterprises. Meanwhile statistical results confirm the positive role of external economies and knowledge spillover effects in driving the co-agglomeration of foreign and domestic enterprises.","[He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junsong] Peking Univ, Lincoln Inst Ctr Urban Dev & Land Policy, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"He, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,50,9,11,5,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,3,,,,,323,343,PII 925485524,10.1080/14631377.2010.498682,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,636WF,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280773700004,0

We employ the stochastic metafrontier approach to estimate the cost efficiency of 24 distribution units during the period 1997-2002. Empirical results find that the average cost efficiency is overestimated using the traditional stochastic frontier model, especially for low density regions. The average cost efficiency of the high density group is significantly higher than that of the low density group as it benefits from network economies. This Study also calculates both short-term and long-term optimal scales of electricity distribution firms, lending policy implications for the deregulation of the electricity distribution industry.

Against this hylomorphic model of creation, I argue that the forms of things arise within fields of force and flows of material. It is by intervening in these force-fields and following the lines of flow that practitioners make things. In this view, making is a practice of weaving, in which practitioners bind their own pathways or lines of becoming into the texture of material flows comprising the lifeworld. Rather than reading creativity 'backwards', from a finished object to an initial intention in the mind of an agent, this entails reading it forwards, in an ongoing generative movement that is at once itinerant, improvisatory and rhythmic. To illustrate what this means in practice, I compare carpentry and drawing. In both cases, making is a matter of finding the grain of the world's becoming and following its course. Historically, it was the turn from drawing lines to pulling them straight, between predetermined points, which marked the transition from the textilic to the architectonic, debasing the former as craft while elevating the latter as technology.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Dept Anthropol, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Ingold, T (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Dept Anthropol, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",tim.ingold@abdn.ac.uk,"Thomas, Nicola/C-6206-2015",,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-051-27-0129] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,318,385,2,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This theorem is derived based on the expected utility of wealth model. However, Cox and Sadiraj [Cox, J.C., Sadiraj, V., 2006. Small- and large-stakes risk aversion: Implications of concavity calibration for decision theory. Games Econ.

Using a triple differences approach, I find that the program has no significant effect on the time use of eligible individuals, except for the sharp decrease in the housework participation of elderly women who live with another potential beneficiary. Individuals 60 to 69 years old change their time use only if they live with a potential beneficiary, but not because they expect to receive the demogrant themselves in a few years. In particular, men in their 60s seem to retire early if they live with someone who qualifies for the transfer. Both men and women 18 to 59 years old increase their labor supply if they live with an eligible man, but decrease it if they live with an eligible woman.

The empirical results from the Displaced Worker Supplement support this model and suggest that when the local unemployment rate is high, less information is transmitted by a layoff concerning worker quality, for the sample of white-collar workers.","Stephen F Austin State Univ, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA",,"Kosovich, SM (通讯作者)，Stephen F Austin State Univ, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA.",kosovichs@sfasu.edu,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The rural non-farm economy is known as one important driver of structural change because it offers alternative employment. However, little is known about the factors that influence farm exit decisions. Based on a recent household survey of Croatian family farms, we analyse individual employment decisions of farm household members by taking a prospective look at developments to come in the medium term. We find that mixed activities and part-time farming will be at the core of expected future developments. A cumulative logit regression model is employed, showing that steps toward individual farm exit are least likely for elderly people and for those in households that are particularly successful in farming. Individual exit is more likely for better-off households. Generally, we find that there is a clear trend toward non-farm employment for individuals, but there are hardly any indications that this leads to final abandonment of the farm.","[Moellers, Judith; Fritzsch, Jana] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Dept External Environm Agr & Policy Anal, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Möllers, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Dept External Environm Agr & Policy Anal, Halle, Saale, Germany.",moellers@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,,,,,11,10,10,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2010,22.0,1,,,,,119,128,PII 919254856,10.1080/14631370903525645,0.0,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,596GX,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000277674300007,0

An increase in lump sum taxes reduces the steady state level of consumption and improves the stock of foreign bonds. Consistent with empirical evidence, durable consumption exhibits initial excess volatility. Though an increase in the tax on durables increases the demand for nondurables and improves the bond holdings in the steady state, an increase in the tax on nondurables has insignificant effects on the stock of foreign bonds and the consumption of durables. Using quarterly data from the UK and estimating generalized impulse response functions we find empirical support.

The max-plus algebra is the algebraic structure in which classical operations - addition and multiplication are replaced by a circle plus b = max{a, b} and a circle times b = a + b, respectively. Each system of linear equation in max-plus algebra we can write in the matrix form A circle times x = b, where A and b are matrix and vector of suitable size. If we replace the matrix elements with matrix interval A = <(A) under bar, (a) over bar Ft > and vector elements by vector interval b = <(b) under bar, (b) over bar >, we get an interval system of linear equations. We can define several types of solvability of interval systems in max-plus algebra. In this paper, we shall deal with one of them, the so called T4 solvability. We give the algorithm which answers the question whether the given interval system is T4 solvable or not.

It is important to take all the motives of the system acquisition into account, and to examine if the chosen method gives a clear answer to the question, whether or not the investment in the given system has been appropriate. In the form of a case study the paper describes an example of a possible approach to the evaluation of an investment in a specific information system aimed at energy savings in a manufacturing-oriented company. First of all, the demand on the input data and the method's suitability in relation to the investment nature was compared when searching for the methods suitable for the investment evaluation. A specific evaluation of the benefit of the system implementation was carried out in two scenarios, using the incremental method by means of constructing a stochastic regression model of energy consumption. A specific case of how an information system is implemented in a company illustrates a possibility of how a quantitative evaluation of such a company investment can be carried out, and at the same time, it also shows that even a relatively high investment of this kind can have quite a short pay-off period.","[Plevny, Miroslav; Lavickova, Petra] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Husova 11, Pilsen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,,plevny@kso.zcu.cz; petra.lavickova@gmail.com,"Plevny, Miroslav/J-9489-2015","Plevny, Miroslav/0000-0003-4774-0877",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,536,541,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900091,0

What is better to maximize? According to Baumol, firms aim to maximize their sales revenue rather than their profit. This idea is known as revenue maximization theory. In the present paper we study a dynamics model of a revenue maximizing firm. The model considers that the firm aims to maximize its revenue within a very long time period hence the infinite time horizon is used. The further assumption of the model is that the firm respects a minimum acceptable rate of return on capital. The model is formulated as an optimal control problem on infinite time horizon. Necessary conditions of maximum principle for optimal solution suggest that the rule for maximization revenue of the firm is the equality of the ratio of marginal substitution of labor over capital and the ratio of the wage rate over the discount rate. If the firm is governed by this hypothetical maximization rule it grows endogenously at the rate directly proportional to the return on capital.","[Prazak, Pavel] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove 50002, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,,pavel.prazak@uhk.cz,"Prazak, Pavel/F-8299-2013","Prazak, Pavel/0000-0001-9160-5758",,,,,10,5,5,0,2,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,542,547,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900092,0

Standard trade openness indicators fall short of portraying the peculiarity of the Asian experience, and of explaining why other emerging markets with similar characteristics have been less successful over the last 25 years. The analysis offers an alternative perspective on the issue regarding international economic integration by taking into account the whole structure of international trade relationships and by determining both the position of countries in the world trade network, and its evolution over time. We find that East Asian countries are more integrated into the world economy, as they have moved from the periphery of the network towards its core. Our results support the idea that the degree of openness matters but it is not enough to characterize economic integration. The number and identity of trade partners, and the specific individual structure of trade for each country, need to be incorporated in order to fully characterize international economic integration. By doing so, it is possible to argue that the integration process of the East Asian countries mirrors their high economic performance, while the lower degree of integration of Latin America can be related to the lack of economic development of the region, even though their degree of openness has increased.","[Reyes, Javier] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy; [Fagiolo, Giorgio] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Trento; University of Trento; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Reyes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Business Bldg,Room 406,1, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",jreyes@walton.uark.edu,"Reyes, Juan/JAN-9859-2023; SCHIAVO, Stefano/B-6147-2012; Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021; Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022; Reyes, José Antonio Reyes/GXZ-6957-2022","SCHIAVO, Stefano/0000-0001-9740-5167; Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352;",,,,,37,23,29,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

A key distinction is whether we restrict to the traditional one-stage mechanisms or allow multistage mechanisms. For one-stage mechanisms, the paper shows that for a large and important subclass of monotonic choice rules-called intersection monotonic-the total message space size needed for one-stage Nash implementation is essentially the same as that needed for verification (with honest agents who are privately informed about their preferences). According to Segal (2007), the latter is the size of the space of minimally informative budget equilibria verifying the choice rule. However, multistage mechanisms allow a drastic reduction in communication complexity. Namely, for an important subclass of intersection-monotonic choice rules (which includes rules based on coalitional blocking such as exact or approximate Pareto efficiency, stability, and envy-free allocations), we propose a two-stageNash implementation mechanism in which at most 5 alternatives plus 4N log(2) N bits are announced in any play. Such two-stage mechanisms bring about an exponential reduction in the communication complexity of Nash implementation for discrete communication measured in bits or a reduction from infinite-to low-dimensional continuous communication.","Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Segal, IR (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ilya.segal@stanford.edu,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,6,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

I address the following questions: When and how can migration to a country substitute for educational subsidies in that country? Who should be admitted when the receiving country cares about the wellbeing of the unskilled workers who stay behind in the sending country? How and why the incentives to form human capital in the sending country will have a paradoxical effect on the migration policy of the receiving country? How and why will the level of a separating tax imposed by the destination country be reduced by the human capital formation calculus in the sending country?

Specifically, two distinct efficient cartel hypotheses claim that inter-firm coordination can increase economic efficiency in industries with a large degree of avoidable fixed costs and/or variable output. This paper performs the first systematic empirical test of these hypotheses via an examination of cartel performance under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, a two-year cartel experiment in the United States. While I find a wide variation in welfare changes during cartelization, there is no compelling evidence that differences in fixed costs are the cause. I do, however, find robust empirical support for the hypothesis that industries with highly variable output experience higher welfare gains (or less negative welfare declines) under collusion.","Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University,"Taylor, JE (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",taylo2je@cmich.edu,,,,,,,36,5,5,1,10,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

While the impact of the provided information on the switching behavior has been investigated in the past, an area of research that is less well understood relates to the effect of the travelers' risk aversion (or risk-seeking) in their travel behavior. The objective of this research is to examine the impact of information acquisition on travelers' switching travel behavior and to identify and quantify the role of attitudes and perceptions on switching behavior. A combined choice and latent variable model has been developed, in which the individual traveler's risk aversion has been modeled as a latent variable. The model has been estimated using data collected through travel diaries in the Puget Sound Region (PSRC) in 2000. As expected, travelers in general tend to maintain their habitual travel pattern. However, specific travel information -such as that regarding an incident or road closure- influences behavioral switches such as departure time change and route change.","[Tsirimpa, Athena; Polydoropoulou, Amalia] Univ Aegean, Dept Shipping Trade & Transport, Korai 2a, Chios 82100, Greece; [Antoniou, Constantinos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Transportat Engn, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Athens 15780, Greece",University of Aegean; National Technical University of Athens,"Tsirimpa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Dept Shipping Trade & Transport, Korai 2a, Chios 82100, Greece.",a.tsirimpa@stt.aegean.gr; polydor@aegean.gr; antoniou@central.ntua.gr,"Antoniou, Constantinos/K-4980-2019","Antoniou, Constantinos/0000-0003-0203-9542",,,,,46,17,19,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

It illustrates the various issues with a wide range of examples and stories from national accounts compilation practice. National accounts statistics are estimates of a universal accounting model (SNA93). The operational versions of the model decide what is actually estimated. They are estimated by expanding and transforming the available data with accounting identities, assumptions, and plausibility checks. The estimates reflect personal knowledge and skills, resources, and policy. For a specific type of use, the universal and operational national accounting concepts are usually not perfect. The quantitative importance of such conceptual measurement errors is often overlooked but can be substantial. For assessing the reliability of national accounts statistics, sampling theory is not very important. The major methods are consistency checks, sensitivity analysis, and analysis using a description of the data sources, operational model, and compilation methods.","CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Bos, F (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",f.bos@cpb.nl,,,,,,,34,1,2,0,2,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The present article briefly analyses the crisis with a particular emphasis on these subjects, with the goal of suggesting some lessons that can be drawn from it for Latin America and the Caribbean. Accordingly, it describes the economic conditions and major changes that occurred in the financial system of the United States during the 1990s and the current decade, identifying the contribution of these factors to the crisis. The initial lessons drawn from this analysis are the need to: (i) consider macroprudential risk in the regulatory framework, (ii) reduce the procyclical bias of the system, (iii) widen the scope of regulation and (iv) deal with the conflicts of interest that prevent prompt and reliable disclosure of the risk taken on by financial institutions.",,,,filipa.correia@cepal.org; felipe.jimenez@cepal.org; sandra.manuelito@cepal.org,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,6,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2009,,99,,,,,7,22,,,,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,580YZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276488300001,0

It is argued that cooperative behaviour is grounded on three kinds of 'common goods', defined as goods that are shared and recognized as beneficial by the workers. These comprise common goals, relational satisfaction, and moral norms and values. The commonly held goods are associated with motives and behavioural rules which constitute both the reasons for cooperating and the means through which the dilemmatic nature of cooperation is overcome. It is further argued that the binding character of these rules is closely linked to humans' ability and opportunity to communicate. Normative guidelines relative to management practices and directions for future research are also derived.","[Lopes, Helena] Res Ctr Socioecon Change, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Helena; Teles, Nuno] Res Ctr Socioecon Change, DINAMIA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Santos, Ana C.] Ctr Social Studies CES, Coimbra, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Universidade de Coimbra,"Lopes, H (通讯作者)，Res Ctr Socioecon Change, ISCTE, Lisbon, Portugal.",Helena.lopes@iscte.pt,"; Teles, Nuno/R-3546-2018","Lopes, Helena Maria Sousa/0000-0003-1710-778X; Santos, Ana Cordeiro/0000-0002-3654-2544; Teles, Nuno/0000-0002-3785-6019",,,,,63,13,14,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In the 2007 season of the show, one of the judges, Simon Cowell, threatened to quit the show if a contestant, Sanjaya Malakar, who was clearly a low-ability contestant, won the competition. He was concerned that the show was becoming a popularity contest instead of a singing contest. Is this a problem? Not necessarily. I show that, under certain conditions, making success in the contest dependent on a contestant's popularity and not solely on her singing ability or performance, could paradoxically increase aggregate singing effort.

In particular, we investigate the relative contributions of earned versus unearned income in enhancing women's autonomy and the role of employment outside of their husband's farm. In a simple theoretical model, it is demonstrated that earned income could be more important than unearned income in empowering women. Using data from rural Bangladesh, empirical estimations confirm this prediction and also reveal the surprising fact that it is not employment per se but employment outside their husbands' farms that contributes to women's autonomy. The data also point to the importance of choosing the correct threat point in theoretical analyses of female autonomy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate the impact of CEOs achieving superstar status on the performance of their firms, using prestigious business awards to measure shocks to CEO status. We find that award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform, both relative to their prior performance and relative to a matched sample of non-winning CEOs. At the same time, they extract more compensation following the awards, both in absolute amounts and relative to other top executives in their firms. They also spend more time on public and private activities outside their companies, such as assuming board seats or writing books. The incidence of earnings management increases after winning awards.

The generator level bidding data show very strong persistence in generators' grouping choices over time. Using dynamic random effect ordered probit model, we find that persistence is characterized by positive state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence is more important than unobserved heterogeneity. The finding of true state dependence Suggests a scope for economic policy intervention. If NYISO can implement an effective policy to switch generators from higher price groups to lower price groups, the effect is likely to be lasting. As a result, the market price can be lowered in the long-run. Generators' offered capacity is estimated by a two-stage sample selection model. The estimated results show that generators in higher-priced groups tend to withhold their capacity strategically to push up market prices. It further confirms the importance of an effective policy to turn generators into lower price groups in order to mitigate unexpected price spikes. The simulated market prices based on Our estimated aggregate supply curve can replicate most volatility of actual DA market prices. Applying our models to different demand assumptions, we find that demand conditions can affect market prices significantly. It validates the importance of introducing demand side management during the restructure of electricity industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The government maximises total surplus but incurs some cost of public funds laLaffont and Tirole (1993). Government outsourcing is proposed as an alternative to regulation in which firms freely enter the market and choose their prices and output levels. However the government can contract ex post with the private firms. This ex post contracting set-up allows more flexibility than regulation where governments commit to both investment and operation cash-flows.

The recent empirical literature which uses Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVAR) with long-run restrictions has argued that technology shocks lead to a persistent and significant decline in employment in most of the G7 countries. We claim that the international transmission of shocks prevents the use of existing SVAR models, but also suggests alternative specifications to properly uncover their effects. We show in a quantitative two-country model that a measure of labor productivity aggregated across countries is more immune to persistent, if not permanent, shocks and allows to accurately identify the responses of the labor input to a technology shock. Using labor productivity at the G7 aggregate level, we find that the response of employment changes critically in most of the major seven developed countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The local elite serves as an intermediary between aid donors and aid recipients through its control of the government and major firms. The likelihood of misusing aid is large if the elite is characterized by extensive economic and political power and little concern for social groups besides itself. To determine which countries have this type of elite we use a historically determined variable: the percentage of European settlers in total population in colonial times. We provide strong empirical evidence that the level of European settlement in colonial times is negatively related to the effectiveness of foreign aid as measured in a growth-regression framework. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a wide set of alternative explanatory factors advanced in the aid effectiveness literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using a comprehensive panel data set of China's state-owned enterprises, we investigate the impacts of privatization on social welfare and firm performance indicators. The privatization of China's state-owned enterprises was found to have little impact on the change of firm employment, but it did lead to increasing sales and hence higher labor productivity. Meanwhile, there was a gain in firm profitability contributed to mostly by the reduction of managerial expenses to sales. The impact of privatization was sustainable in the long run, and was more pronounced when state ownership was reduced to minority position as opposed to majority position.

However, considerable uncertainty still exists as to which factors have been the most important causes of this development. This article uses a measure of income inequality derived from taxation statistics and a recently proposed method for testing long-run Granger non-causality to examine the key determinants of Australia's inequality for the years 1970-2001. In line with popular concern, we find that globalisation and technological progress - defined as the global flow of information - has increased income inequality. In contrast, improved terms of trade have been equity-enhancing. Of the institutional determinants, de-unionisation has had an adverse effect on income inequality, whereas higher minimum wages have reduced it.","[Gaston, Noel] Bond Univ, Globalisat & Dev Ctr, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; Bond Univ, Sch Business, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Bond University; Bond University,"Gaston, N (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Globalisat & Dev Ctr, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",ngaston@bond.edu.au,"Gulasekaran, Rajaguru/AAW-4717-2021","Gulasekaran, Rajaguru/0000-0003-2816-1749",,,,,30,10,10,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

I decompose the increase in claims into three channels: a borrower effect, as a country's EMU membership may leave its borrowers more creditworthy in the eyes of foreign lenders; a  creditor effect, as membership in a monetary union may increase the attractiveness of a nation's commercial banks as intermediaries, perhaps through increased scale economies or through an improved regulatory environment after the advent of monetary union; and a pairwise effect, as joint membership in a monetary union increases the quality of intermediation between borrowers and creditors when both are in the union. Isolating these three channels through a series of difference-in-differences specifications, I find that the pairwise effect is the primary source of increased financial integration.

The new survey contains questions about many policy issues not treated by previous surveys. The questions treat issues such as trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting. Additional questions treat the relationship between economic growth, happiness, and well-being, whether the typical American consumes too much, works too much, saves too little, and live in a house that is too large. The results show disagreement on many issues but evidence of considerable agreement on others, including a consensus that the benefits of Wal-Mart stores typically outweigh their costs, that Americans save too little and that economic growth in developed countries increases well being.

We show that a model of multiple concurrent auctions, in which our opponents are naive or incremental bidders as identified in the lab, explain the results well.

We document that this trust is affected not only by the characteristics of the country being trusted, but also by cultural aspects of the match between trusting country and trusted country, such as their history of conflicts and their religious, genetic, and somatic similarities. We then find that lower bilateral trust leads to less trade between two countries, less portfolio investment, and less direct investment, even after controlling for the characteristics of the two countries. This effect is stronger for goods that are more trust intensive.

This paper analyzes the impact of various socio-demographic characteristics on social capital. Proxy variables for social capital are obtained from a comprehensive principal components analysis exercise using survey data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The BHPS provides information on social and economic change at the individual and household levels in Britain and the UK with an annual survey of ca. 10,000 individuals from ca. 5,000 households. Based on the 13th wave of this database, we investigate the impact of exogenous qualities, individually acquired characteristics, and of the social environment using a spatial auto-regression framework. The results show that the formation of social capital can be modeled to a very high degree of statistical accuracy. The structural effect from the households contributes substantially to the social capital level of each household member. Thus, the social capital formation can be based equally on individual measures (such as education) and social contagion processes.","[Walde, Janette] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Hauser, Christoph; Pfaffermayr, Michael; Tappeiner, Gottfried] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ Theory Econ Policy & Econ Hist, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck; University of Innsbruck,"Walde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",christoph.hauser@uibk.ac.at; michael.pfaffermayr@uibk.ac.at; gottfried.tappeiner@uibk.ac.at; janette.walde@uibk.ac.at,"Walde, Janette/HCH-4003-2022; Tappeiner, Gottfried/D-3470-2016; Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Tappeiner, Gottfried/0000-0002-6749-2834; Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Walde, Janette/0000-0002-1241-5292; Hauser, Christoph/0000-0003-3505-3359",,,,,21,4,4,1,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We employ Markov switching and structural vector autoregressions, together with structural 15 equations, to investigate monetary policy effectiveness during the Japanese disinflation. We find evidence of regime switching in the mid-1990s in a model including the nominal policy interest rate. When monetary policy shocks are identified by using the McCallum rule for monetary base, a monetary expansion is found to have a statistically significant impact on prices. Moreover, a lower real ex ante interest rate can still stimulate the economy despite the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Quarantine measures under incomplete information about infection risk,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Migration; Infectious diseases; Public health; Quarantine,,"This paper explores the implications for public policy of the fact that individuals have incomplete but private information about their exposure to infectious disease when they make migration decisions. In a 2-period model we study conditions under which the presence of quarantine measures may lead to inefficient outcomes by strengthening individuals' interest in migration to escape centres of disease and thereby imposing negative externalities on other uninfected individuals. We show first that when the disease has an epicentre, the marginal migrant imposes a net negative externality. Secondly, quarantine policies may sometimes encourage migration instead of discouraging it. Thirdly, even when they succeed in discouraging migration, quarantine policies may lower social welfare, and even increase overall disease incidence, if they go too far, thereby discouraging those intra-marginal migrants for whom private benefits exceed private costs by more than the negative externality they impose on others.

The results generally suggest that consumers value and are willing to pay about 5.9 percent of the original price for nutritional information on the food product we studied. Individuals who are non-price-sensitive, nutritionally knowledgeable and with longer time horizon are willing to pay more for nutritional information than others. Considering consumers' willingness to pay for nutritional information on food products and an EU impact assessment study, the costs of provision of this information are not prohibitive to firms. We estimate that the least conservative cost of labelling to the firm for a specific food product can be as much as euro29,431, whereas the average economic value of nutrition information is estimated at euro17,064.

There is a distribution of agents indexed by a skill factor that determines one's average productivity at performing research. An entrepreneur starts-up a research venture by borrowing from an investor that funds R&D so as to invent new goods. Skill is private information, creating an adverse selection problem for the investor who designs a truth-telling mechanism. We show that an increase in the mean skill enhances growth as it leads to greater R&D productivity and investment; while an increase in the dispersion of the skill distribution dampens growth as it makes the adverse selection problem between investors and entrepreneurs more severe. The growth rate would double in the absence of adverse selection. The R&D investment of the average size firm must be subsidized threefold for the negative adverse selection effect to be nullified. We provide U.S. industry-level and European sector-level evidence in favor of the positive scale effect and negative adverse selection effect using the firm size distribution (FSD) to proxy for the entrepreneurial skill distribution.

Identification is achieved by transferring the binary information from the source survey to the target survey by means of a logistic regression determining group affiliation in the source survey by use of variables available also in the target survey. In the proposed methodology we improve on common matching procedures by optimizing the cut-value of the probability which assigns group affiliation in the target survey. This contrasts with the commonly used Hosmer-Lemeshov cut-values for binary categorization, which equates between the sensitivity and specificity curves. Instead we improve group identification by minimizing the sum of total errors as a percent of total true outcomes. The Jewish ultra-orthodox population in Israel serves as a case study. This idiosyncratic community, committed to the observance of the Bible is only latently observed in the surveys typically used for poverty calculation. It is explicitly captured in the social survey, which is not suitable for poverty measurement. This procedure is useful for ex-post enhancement of survey data in general.","[Gottlieb, Daniel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Natl Insurance Inst, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Gottlieb, Daniel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University,"Gottlieb, D (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Natl Insurance Inst, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",danielgt@nioi.gov.il,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,4,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 23,2009,3.0,,,,,,,,200930,,,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,V20ML,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000208144000001,0

Second, we find that CLS, a method for estimating the returns to education without control for endogeneity bias, may underestimate the true rates of return for men. In addition, if we do not control for endogeneity bias and the sample selection bias, we may further underestimate the true rates of return for women. Finally, we find that OLS estimates of the returns to education for men are slightly higher than for women.

In particular, we investigate the influence of aging and health shocks on a household's ownership of various assets and on the share of total assets held in each asset class. We find that households decrease their ownership of principal residences, vehicles, financial assets, businesses, and real estate as they age, while increasing the share of assets held in liquid assets and time deposits. We find that widowhood and other health shocks are associated with the same kinds of portfolio changes, and that the effect of shocks strengthens with time since the shock. Finally, we show that the effect of a shock is greatly magnified when households have physical or mental impairments. This suggests that factors other than standard risk and return considerations weigh heavily in many older households' portfolio decisions.","[Coile, Courtney] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Milligan, Kevin] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Wellesley College; University of British Columbia,"Coile, C (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA.",ccoile@wellesley.edu,"Milligan, Kevin/A-1627-2008","Milligan, Kevin/0000-0002-0998-0581",,,,,23,64,73,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Indeed, such rights can be temporarily transferred to a private firm, even if ownership of the assets remains public. Hence, such a separation makes it possible to analyse the large continuum of contracts from full private to full public management.

Current housing market policies in the Netherlands generate substantial welfare losses. The direct and indirect subsidies on housing distort the housing market, house moving behaviour, the labour market and the asset portfolio of households. The welfare loss is estimated at more than 6 billion euro per year. In addition, physical planning restrictions cost at least 3 billion euro per year, a price which is paid for the conservation of open space and nature, especially in the Green Heart of the Randstad. Developments on the housing market over the last fifteen years and the sizeable welfare losses from current policies are sufficient reason to develop an agenda for reform. The Reports suggest several elements for such an agenda, including a gradual reduction of housing subsidies in the owner-occupier sector as well as in the rental sector, an easier land policy to better meet the qualitative housing needs of the population, and an extension of the social tasks for the housing societies.","Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Don, H (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Room H11-09,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",don@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2009,157.0,2,,,,,251,264,,10.1007/s10645-009-9114-9,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,477BN,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000268491900005,0

It selectively touches on inequalities, migration, social policy, and international security. In the course of this exercise, I present two hypotheses: one relating to the formation of the new middle class, and the other relating to the geriatric peace argument. The first hypothesis posits that when the growing inequalities in terms of per capita income aggravate the sense of happiness among the low- and middle-income strata as contrasted to high-income strata, the formation of a new middle class becomes more difficult. The second hypothesis posits that when the aging population carries a large demographic weight, it tends to be transformed into strong political voice, which is, in turn, translated into larger government spending on social policy items often accompanied by a likely decline in the defense expenditure budget. These hypotheses paint a provocative picture of East and South-East Asia in the next four decades, especially in the wake of the deepening economic difficulties prevailing over the entire globe. I present these hypotheses for further conceptual elaboration and empirical analysis.","Univ Niigata Prefecture, Tokyo Satellite Off, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130024, Japan",University Niigata Prefecture,"Inoguchi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Niigata Prefecture, Tokyo Satellite Off, Bunkyo Ku, 1-17-8 Nishikata, Tokyo 1130024, Japan.",inoguchi@unii.ac.jp,,,,,,,36,8,8,1,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1832-8105,,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

We demonstrate, consistent with empirical results, that the wage elasticity of labour demand is increasing as a function of outsourcing. Furthermore, we show that a production mode with more outsourcing reduces the negotiated wage in a high-wage country with labour market imperfections if the relative bargaining power of the labour union is sufficiently high. Under such circumstances outsourcing reduces equilibrium unemployment. Finally, we characterize the optimal production mode showing that stronger labour market imperfections induce a production mode with more outsourcing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Three benchmark interest rate operating procedures are identified, none of which presupposes that the main purpose of the central bank is to engage in inflation targeting. The paper then explores the consequences for macroeconomic performance (specifically, short-run growth and the rate of inflation) of activist fiscal policies designed to raise the short-run growth rate. The results provide insights into fiscal and monetary policy interactions in the sort of macroeconomic environment envisaged by some critics of the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact.

We show that when investors reward better performing funds with higher cash flows, near quarter-ends a mutual fund manager has an incentive to distort new investment toward stocks in which his fund holds a large existing position. The short-term price impact of these trades increase the fund's reported returns. Higher returns are rewarded by greater subsequent fund inflows which, in turn, allow for more investment distortion the next quarter. Because the price impact of trades is short term, each subsequent quarter begins with a larger return deficit. Eventually, the deficit cannot be overcome. Thus, our model leads to the empirically observed short-run persistence and long-run reversal in fund performance. In doing so, our model provides a consistent explanation of many other seemingly contradictory empirical features of mutual fund performance.","[Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Davies, Ryan J.] Babson Coll, Finance Div, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Babson College,"Bernhardt, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",danber@uiuc.edu; rdavies@babson.edu,,"Davies, Ryan/0000-0002-0841-6209",,,,,35,13,13,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

This paper examines the introduction of the demand for status (as a function of wealth) into a model of uninsurable idiosyncratic risk-the spirit of capitalism (soc) assumption. We find that soc preferences lead to less inequality in wealth; placing wealth into the utility function leads to a shrinking wealth distribution. The drop in wealth concentration is smaller if the utility function implies status is a luxury good, but no parametrization leads to higher wealth Gini coefficients than the benchmark case. We then consider the consequences of revenue-neutral tax reforms with and without soc preferences, finding that the), make little difference for this policy experiment.","[Young, Eric R.] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Luo, Yulei] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Virginia; University of Hong Kong,"Young, ER (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",ey2d@virginia.edu,,,,,,,46,15,16,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

A Ramsey type planner chooses tax rates on each good type as well as spending levels on each good type subject to an exogenous total expenditure constraint. It is shown that, like taxes, government spending policy has price effects and that these price effects have significant implications for optimal policy. These price effects imply a U shape to the government's objective function and this U shape results in boundary values for the choice of the spending allocation. In particular, it is shown that the optimal allocation of government spending tends to be concentrated on one good rather than spread among many goods.","[Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Gorostiaga, Arantza] Univ Basque Country, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Kansas State University; University of Basque Country,"Cassou, SP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",scassou@ksu.edu; arantza.gorostiaga@ehu.es,"Gorostiaga, Arantza/Z-5483-2019","Gorostiaga, Arantza/0000-0001-5540-5396",,,,,26,1,2,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We focus on the sensitivity of the estimated effect to (i) the assumptions about the exogeneity of labour market status; and (ii) the time interval between the measurement of fertility and employment status. Using Spanish quarterly data, we estimate a switching probit model that accounts for the joint determination of both variables. In order to obtain a behavioural effect of the former on the latter, we look at the timing of conception instead of the timing of birth, and present alternative sets of estimates depending on the accuracy with which conception is measured (yearly or quarterly). Our results show a positive although non-significant effect of participation and employment on the probability of having the first child, once the sample of women who conceive in the same quarter (or one quarter later) in which labour market status is measured and the endogeneity between both variables is accounted for. We find that annual data tend to over-estimate the negative effect of employment or participation on the probability of having a child, but the main biases appear when looking at the effect of participation.","[Alba, Alfonso; Carrasco, Raquel] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Alvarez, Gema] Univ Vigo, Dept Org Empresas, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidade de Vigo,"Carrasco, R (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",alfonso.alba@uc3m.es; galvarez@uvigo.es; rcarras@eco.uc3m.es,"Carrasco, Raquel/H-5596-2015","Carrasco, Raquel/0000-0003-2550-6350",,,,,21,7,7,1,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-5469,1435-5477,,SPAN ECON REV,Span.

If the inter-risk-free temporal elasticity of substitution exceeds one, an increase in uncertainty lowers the price-dividend ratio for equity, and a rise in the expected growth rate raises this ratio. Calibrations indicate that society would willingly reduce GDP by around 20 percent each year to eliminate rare disasters. The welfare cost from usual economic fluctuations is much smaller, though still important, corresponding to lowering GDP by about 1.5 percent each Year.

This paper examines the role of labor mobility in China's regional economic development in the context of phases of demographic transition and the existence of institutional barriers, Our findings show that the two most important sources of interregional income disparity are per worker capital stock and technology level. The fact that the richest provincial economies are at the later phase of demographic transition provides a major reason for why those economies have accumulated higher per worker capital stock and achieved higher productivity levels. We also discover that regional per capita income levels have not displayed convergence since the mid 1990s. Two observations explain this phenomenon. One observation is that capital and labor movements have played only a limited role in equalizing their marginal returns across regions despite the fact that labor mobility has substantially strengthened this role since 2000. The other observation is that the impact of demographic changes on income growth has been distinctly uneven between the rich and poor regions. This phenomenon can be attributed to some particular features of China's interregional labor migration.","Univ Fraser Valley, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada",University of Fraser Valley,"Ding, L (通讯作者)，Univ Fraser Valley, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada.",ecslud@yahoo.com,,,,,,,28,4,4,3,16,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

In the first model presented, the financial contracts on offer involve pooling equilibrium with no adverse selection. However, in the special case analyzed, where contracts are of mixed form, there may be a separating equilibrium and also equilibrium may not exist. Interesting result is that the separating equilibrium found is not economically efficient since aggregate investments falls short of first-best level. More importantly, capital structure does matter. The relative magnitude of outside equity makes a real difference to the quantity of aggregate investment in equilibrium. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ibrahim, M. V.; Barros, C.

In contrast to previously used estimation methods, observations of regional prices as well as of trade costs are used in a direct estimation of the first order conditions. The proposed method uses bi-level programming techniques to minimize a weighted least squares criterion under the restriction that the estimated parameters satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for an optimal solution of the transport model. A penalty function and a smooth reformulation are used to iteratively approximate the complementary slackness conditions. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to trace out some properties of the estimator and compare it with a traditional calibration method. The analysis shows that the proposed technique estimates prices as well as trade costs more precisely than the traditional calibration method. It is suggested to apply the same method to a range of linear and quadratic models. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

There are two periods, an initial period of regular price sales and a terminal period of last-minute sales at a (possibly) reduced price. The price in a period is constant over time. In the initial period, the organizers of the event advertise the event to potential attendees. If tickets are sold out by the end of the first period, there will be no last-minute sales. We find that advertising should be decreased over time during the first period. There are three different advertising scenarios: it may be optimal not to advertise at all, to advertise at a positive rate until the end of the first period, or to stop advertising at an earlier instant of time. In the last-minute sales, the organizers implement a feedback pricing policy such that the selected price depends on the number of tickets that have been sold in the regular sales period. Finally, we establish optimality conditions for the time instant where to switch to last-minute sales. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To manage this risk, Contracts for Difference (CfDs), i.e., forwards on the spread between a particular area price and the (unconstrained) system price, were introduced at the Scandinavian electricity exchange Nord Pool at the end of 2000. We empirically investigate the pricing of these CfDs over the period 2001 through 2006 and find that CID prices contain significant risk premia. Their sign and magnitude, however, differ substantially between areas and delivery periods, because areas are subject to transmission congestion to a varying extent. While the relation between risk premia and time-to-maturity is not uniform for CfDs, there is a negative relation for implied area and system forwards, which can be explained by the relative hedging demand of market participants. In addition, we find that risk premia of CfDs and implied area forwards vary systematically with the variance and skewness of the underlying spot prices. This confirms both implications of the Bessembinder and Lemmon [Bessembinder, H., Lemmon. M.L, 2002.

However, this paper examines the data for the period 1999-2006 after considerable changes in the Spanish economy. Moreover, it examines migration at the disaggregated level of Spanish provinces rather than regions, the usual unit of measurement. Using a spatial error model as well as a spatial autoregression model it finds the differentials in wages and unemployment between provinces to be significant explanatory variables. House prices are also important in accounting for the dynamics of internal migration.","[Mulhern, Alan; Watson, John G.] Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Mulhern, A (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Sch Econ, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",alan.mulhern@hotmail.com; jgwatson@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,18,19,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

This 'skewing' of quality depends on the characteristics of customer's demand for quality. Customers differ in demand for quality, because they differ in either (i) their preferences and/or (ii) their time cost per unit. The monopolist is constrained to supply the same quality of good to all customers. The price and quality per unit are described under the assumption the monopolist (i) profit maximises; (ii) maximises social welfare subject to a profit constraint. The determinants of the skewing of quantity and quality are found under third-degree price discrimination and uniform pricing.","Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Sibly, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Private Bag 85, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",hugh.sibly@utas.edu.au,"Sibly, Hugh/J-7385-2014","Sibly, Hugh/0000-0003-0271-7710",,,,,11,3,3,0,7,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,ADELAIDE,"UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, ADELAIDE, SA 5001, AUSTRALIA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

As a consequence of the search for cost effectiveness/reduction we observe a convergence in how the care market is organised: all countries are moving towards home care, private provision and cash transfers. The aim of this paper is twofold. It is argued that the way in which elderly care is provided and financed may entail considerable differences in the creation of a formal care market. National employment models in turn shape the features of the care labour market, affecting both the quantity and quality of care labour supply, the extent of the care labour shortage, and the degree of dependence on migrant carers. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various European country models of elderly care to show how these two factors combine to shape the characteristics of elderly care regimes, and their differing capacity to meet increasing demand for care either by using native workers or, alternatively, by turning to immigrant workers in order to cope with labour shortages.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Econ Pubbl, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Simonazzi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Econ Pubbl, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",annamaria.simonazzi@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,32,207,213,2,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

When applied to the floating regime, the model replicates the well-known stylized facts, such as excess volatility, fat tails, volatility clustering, and exchange rate disconnect. Our main result is that when applied to a credible target zone, our model predicts that the exchange rate remains in the center of the band for a considerable period, even though the fundamental exchange rate does not exhibit mean reversion tendencies. This is consistent with the empirical evidence and contrasts with the traditional target zone model based on Krugman [1991. Target zones and exchange rate dynamics. Quarterly Journal of Economics 16, 669-682], which predicts that the exchange rate in a target zone clusters close to the edges of the band. The hump-shaped distribution of the exchange rate obtained ill our model greatly reduces the frequency of central bank intervention. We also conclude that the introduction of a target zone regime significantly reduces exchange rate volatility by decreasing speculative activity in the FX market. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A permanent flow of aid mainly finances consumption rather than investment-consistent with the historical failure of aid inflows to translate into sustained growth. Large aid flows are associated with higher real exchange rates and smaller tradable sectors because aid is a substitute for tradable consumption. Aid volatility results in substantial welfare losses, providing a motivation for recent discussions of aid architecture stressing the need for greater predictability of aid. These results are also consistent with evidence from cross-country regressions of manufactured exports, presented later in the paper. (C) 2008 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Insufficient structural reforms, which have most of the time led to poor financial development and deficient trade openness have been a crucial factor for the deficit in private capital formation.

Sales people turnover is one of the key factors influencing negatively productivity, sales, customer loyalty, and unpredicted expenses. Recent year's survey indicates that almost three quarters of all employees are considering leaving an organization in two years and the majority of these employees are sales people. The opinion prevails that sales people are motivated mainly by financial rewards thus to find other effective motivational factors is crucial as well as link the financial rewards with the results. Survey conducted in 1971 (Jensen, McMullen & Stark 2008) by RIA (Research Institute of America) showed that 24 % of surveyed organizations changed the sales people financial reward system. Repeated survey in 2000 indicated the fact that organizations are still searching for the appropriate sales people financial reward system. Thus, the objective of the paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between sales people motivation dimensions and their relationship with the organization in B2B sector. The study was designed to investigate the nature of salespeople-organization long-term relationship dimensions (commitment to the organization and psychological contract) and motivation dimensions' (personal growth and ability, recognition of effort and results, financial compensation and incentives, leadership support, employee autonomy, and team work) relationship within B2B environment. A survey was conducted involving 105 salespeople working in B2B sector at telecommunication and financial companies. Research findings indicate that salespeople relationship with the organization is determined mainly by two motivation dimensions positive feedback from the immediate supervisor about salespeople behaviour and decision making autonomy. The study extends prior literature highlighting the positive impact of employee autonomy on employees' psychological contract, their satisfaction with personal growth, and their effort and results. Specifically, the employee autonomy dimension decision making autonomy - demonstrated the strongest relationship with psychological contract.","[Buciuniene, Ilona; Skudiene, Vida] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics,"Buciuniene, I (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, Ausros Vartu Str 7A, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ilobuc@ism.lt; vidsku@ism.lt,"Buciuniene, Ilona/L-9140-2014",,,,,,56,6,8,1,27,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

International experiences have shown that it is difficult that the market alone provides incentives to attract enough investment in capacity reserves. We analyze various measures to cope with this problem, including moth-ball reserves, capacity payments, ICAP and call options. We then construct a model to analyze the structure of incentives for the expansion of electricity supply in the spot market, and capacity in the long run electricity reserve market. Through a game-theory model, we analyze price convergence in three markets: the peak spot market, the non-peak spot market, and the long-run capacity reserve market. We finally carry out a simulation for Mexican power generation. The combination of CFE'S virtual market, together with capacity payments, has eventually resulted in capacity generation expansion similar to what would be attained in an open electricity market, such as the one modelled in our study. But this does not necessarily imply that the Mexican electricity industry will not need in the future-if the generation market is fully open to private investment-some of the discussed capacity incentive mechanisms.","[Rosellon, Juan] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,,victor.carreon@cide.edu; juan.rosellon@cide.edu,,"Rosellon, Juan/0000-0003-3811-1278",,,,,35,0,0,0,2,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

This literature has developed formulas for the welfare consequences of various policies that are functions of reduced-form elasticities rather than structural primitives. I present a general framework that shows how many policy questions can be answered by estimating a small set of sufficient statistics using program-evaluation methods. I use this framework to synthesize the modern literature on taxation, social insurance, and behavioral welfare economics.

The cost structure of the railway industry is analysed using a stochastic frontier approach estimated within the framework of a translog cost system. The results confirm that European railways experience significant cost increases due to inefficient behaviour. In contrast to previous studies, however, the estimates indicate a much greater role for allocative rather than technical inefficiency. Overall, inefficiencies can essentially be explained by the supply of excess capacity and by the over-employment of labour inputs.

Ethnic affiliation of consumers has a direct effect on both consumer ethnocentrism and on domestic purchase behavior. However, the findings on the role of identification to the nation and openness to other cultures as antecedents to consumer ethnocentrism and/or to domestic product quality evaluation were not consistent across countries and across studies, indicating a need for further research on the influence of affective processing mechanisms in consumption.

The findings confirm the well-known result that these indexes very closely approximate each other, implying that the mathematically simpler and computationally easier Tornqvist is the more practicable index. Moreover, this article's nominal growth decomposition yields all the results from the more common real growth decomposition and is also more informative for policy purposes. Application to the US agricultural sector during 1948-2001 shows that of the 3.31% average annual growth in revenues, TFP growth contributed 1.90 percentage points (pct. pts.); growth in output prices added 1.43 pct. pts.; while growth in input quantities contributed - 0.02 pct. pts. (i.e. fewer inputs). Therefore, real output growth (or revenue growth less output price growth) was 1.88 pct. pts., revealing that TFP's 1.90 pct. pts. growth contribution was fully responsible for real output growth with fewer inputs. Since revenues measure incomes, these results suggest that policy should focus more on measures to foster TFP growth than on specific price or quantity instruments to enhance income growth.","[Ball, V.

After reviewing an empirical literature going back several decades, we apply a convenient log change decomposition to Current Population Survey data to characterize rising unemployment in each postwar recession.

There are no capitalists in the beginning, but a spectrum of workers who supply various types of labour as well as other services. Some workers may make savings, or have properties which yield incomes other than wages. When prices and wage rates are given, we can determine which types of labour are exploited and which types exploit others.

The prices of e.g., bonds, options, and other assets in AJD models are given by extended pricing transforms that have an exponential-affine form; these transforms have been characterized in great generality by Duffie et al. [2000. Transform analysis and asset pricing for affine jump-diffusions. Econometrica 68, 1343-1376]. Calculating model prices requires inversion of these transforms, and this has limited the application of AJD models to the comparatively small Subclass for which the transforms are available in closed form. This article seeks to widen the scope of AJD models amenable to practical application through approximate transform inversion techniques. More specifically, we develop the use of saddlepoint approximations for AJD models. These approximations facilitate the calculation of prices in AJD models whose transforms are not available explicitly. We derive and test several alternative saddlepoint approximations and find that they produce accurate prices over a wide range of parameters. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of the non-linear model of business fluctuations (Keynes - Samuelson - Gabisch) indicates that the degree of complexity of any economy is subject to changes in relation to the contemplated control parameters.","Uniwersytetu Mikolaja Kopernika Toruniu, Wydzial Nauk Ekonomicznych & Zarzadzania, Katedra Ekon, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Jakimowicz, A (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Mikolaja Kopernika Toruniu, Wydzial Nauk Ekonomicznych & Zarzadzania, Katedra Ekon, Torun, Poland.",jakimow@econ.uni.torun.pl,"Jakimowicz, Aleksander/AAE-7810-2020","Jakimowicz, Aleksander/0000-0003-2522-082X",,,,,75,2,2,0,6,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2009,,1,,,,,15,48,,,,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,422CW,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000264405700002,0

The results indicate that prenatal care demand in South America is significantly affected by a woman's age, previous pregnancy experience, education and marital status. Furthermore, household wealth and the degree of wantedness of the child significantly influence prenatal care demand. Since prenatal care use has been shown to improve infant and maternal health, there may be substantial benefits from economic and public health policies that target these determinants of prenatal care in the countries under study.","Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Denton, TX 75229 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Jewell, RT (通讯作者)，Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Box 311457, Denton, TX 75229 USA.",tjewell@unt.edu,,,,,,,27,5,5,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The financial potential of banks, i.e. the complete financial sources, was around 300 bn kunas at the end of 2006. The most important sector shaping the financial potential of banks is that of the population with a share of about 37.6%; banking institutions. mainly foreign, account for about 2010, the share of companies is about 15.4% while the share of central and local administration is 4.4%. Research results show that in the past thirteen-year-period there has been a positive, linear and very close connection between the financial potential and domestic sources of the banks and the Croatian GDP. Results also show that the changes in the financial potential and domestic sources for the banks react elastically to changes in the GDP. The realized Croatian GDP is actually the main source for the shaping of deposits made by the population and legal persons, as well as for other sources pointing, therefore, to the necessity for the banks to change the past crediting policy. Credits to the population, as the largest share in crediting, should be significantly slowed down, while financial monitoring of current operations and development of economic subjects should be significantly increased. A more intense credit monitoring of the economy would result in a stronger increase of the GDP and the financial potential of banks, while the system of multiplication of credits and deposits would enable banks to strengthen their deposit base and profitability.","Ekon Fak Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Jurman, A (通讯作者)，Ekon Fak Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.",antun.jurman@efri.hr,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,1,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIVERSITY PULA,PULA,"PRERADOVICEVA 1-1, PULA, 52 100, CROATIA",1331-677X,,,EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

For that aim, we construct a small scale empirical model of the Korean economy, simulate the estimated model with a set of alternative monetary policy rules, and compare the stabilization performances of those rules. There turns out to be ample room for further stabilization of inflation and output, if the central bank shifts from the historically conducted monetary policy rule to the optimal rule. The stabilization gains under the optimal rule, however, are not attributable to additional policy indicators (such as housing price inflation) the optimal rule involves. Rather, the optimal rule improves upon the historical one because the former takes a quite different reaction scheme toward the historical policy indicators. Moreover, as long as the Bank of Korea maintains appropriate reactions to the historical policy indicators, housing price inflation does not contain much extra information for further stabilization.","[Kim, Jangryoul; Lim, Gieyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imundong Dongdaemungu, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",kjryoul@hufs.ac.kr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This analysis considers a SPF approach to estimating efficiencies for organizations in the Republic of Ireland that supply GP services outside of normal working hours. These organizations are run out of a number of primary care centres. The daily payroll for the centre is the output in the SPF and the services offered by these centres enter the production function as inputs. It is argued that these services are exogenous variables and are determined by patient characteristics and reported conditions and not the staff within the centre. A characteristic of the data used is a two-tier structure emanating from a centre lying within a co-op. To account for this tier structure the analysis considers a random parameters approach. The analysis also considers proxies for quality of care and casemix and incorporates them into the SPF. The sensitivity of efficiency values to the excluding the random parameters, quality of care and casemix variables is examined by estimating three reduced forms of the model which ignore each of these elements.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Lordan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland.",lordang@tcd.ie,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

With better data and more sophisticated empirical techniques, there is a burgeoning literature that shows that crowd-out exists. The purpose of this paper is to examine the recent literature that studies the issue of crowd-out across a variety of venues to understand better the empirical estimation issues as well as the institutional details that can lead to a better understanding of the effects of government programs on individuals and organizations.","[Payne, A.

Using matching methods to address bias from non-random location, we find deforestation impacts vary greatly due to park lands' characteristics. Avoided deforestation is greater if parks are closer to the capital city, in sites closer to national roads, and on lower slopes. In allocating scarce conservation resources, policy makers may consider many factors such as the ecosystem services provided by a site and the costs of acquiring the site. Pfaff and Sanchez 2004 claim impact can rise with a focus upon threatened land, all else equal. We provide empirical support in the context of Costa Rica's renowned park system.

In this context, a relevant and neglected issue is the assessment of how service quality responded to an increasingly competitive environment. This study utilizes data envelopment analysis to assess the quality efficiency of mobile telephony companies in Brazil during the 2000-2003 period. Window analysis was conducted for the entire period, taking as reference different quality indicators pertaining to different forms of complaints and calls completed and interrupted. The efficiency measurement was made feasible by interpreting the indicators reflecting a positive dimension of quality as outputs and those reflecting negative aspects of quality as inputs. Given potential heterogeneities across firms that relate to the frequency band and to the technology (time division multiple access technology and code division multiple access technology among others), this article considered adjusted efficiency scores. The Tobit model for censored data was estimated to control for the aforementioned aspects. Rescaled residuals from the econometric estimation produced efficiency scores for service quality. The evidence indicated an overall improvement in efficiency over time. Nonparametric tests were consistent with a positive evolution of quality over time even for shorter subperiods.","[Resende, Marcelo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-22290 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Resende, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Av Pasteur 250, BR-22290 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mresende@ie.ufrj.br,"Resende, Marcelo/AAF-6570-2020",,,,,,29,11,13,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While the concept of regional competitiveness is not formed yet at the academic level and the method of competitiveness measurement, which is grounded methodologically and accepted generally, is still missing, the competitiveness of a region can be measured in different ways: analyzing one or several factors of competitiveness, using theoretical models of competitiveness, creating composite indices, etc, Every method has its advantages and disadvantages. Each of them can he useful in the measurement of regional competitiveness, because they emphasize different aspects of the concept of competitiveness. The justification of identification of the factors of competitiveness and the test of results for robustness and sensitivity are requested for the transparency of each method. The summarized scheme of the measurement of regional competitiveness by regional competitiveness index (RCI) is presented in the article. The measurement of regional competitiveness is based on the factors of competitiveness. To identify the factors of competitiveness, the following traditional models of competitiveness can be used as methodological foundations: the National Diamond model, Double Diamond model, Nine factors model, Regional competitiveness hat model, Pyramid model of Regional Competitiveness, Regional competitiveness tree model. Every model distinguishes in different techniques of the selection and grouping the factors of competitiveness into a general system. It is important to find out the factors, which create the complex competitive advantage of the region, but not only positive presuppositions for its achievement. The main factors of regional competitiveness are presented in this article. In order to measure the competitiveness in quantitative dimension, the indicators of factors of regional competitiveness are also presented. The regional competitiveness index can be constructed in various scenarios: by using and combining different techniques of the selection and weighting the factors, methods of data normalization, etc. Every technique has its advantages and disadvantages. Different techniques are possible for calculating the index, if the choice is methodologically based and the results are statistically justified. The stages and the main aspects on a sound methodology of the calculation of RCI are identified in this article. Rapidly developing processes of globalization throw new challenges for the means of economic analysis and strategic planning. Different techniques can be used for analyzing and creating strategies for increasing the competitiveness of the region. Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. In order to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the measurement of competitiveness by RCI, the new created index was empirically tested on the basis of the data of 10 Lithuanian districts during the period of 2001-2007. The results of the measurement and advantages and disadvantages of the use of RCI are presented in the article. The new created RCI, presented in the article, is one of the ambitions for having a convenient tool, which can be used in the economic analysis, strategic planning and justification of solutions for the increase of competitiveness of a region.","[Snieska, Vytautas; Bruneckiene, Jurgita] Kauno Tech Univ, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V (通讯作者)，Kauno Tech Univ, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",,,,,31,79,81,1,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The first part of the results was published by the same authors in this journal in 2009, Vol. 1(61) (Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, Balciunas, 2009). Therefore, aiming at a more comprehensive view of motivation of participation in civil society organisations in the aspect of the expression of collectivistic motives, it is recommended to get acquainted with the first part. Furthermore, in the first publication a brief overview of methodology and Mutual Incentives Theory, which we referred to when collecting the quantitative research data, as well as general characteristic of participants in civil society organisations, which is important when presenting the results of empiric research, is presented; however, seeking not to repeat the published information, the mentioned aspects will not be publicized in this article. The results of a complete research, carried out by one of the authors of the article, Tijunaitiene, including the expression of both collectivistic and individualistic incentives, are presented in the dissertation (Tijunaitiene, 2009). As motivation is the secondary formation to motive, aiming to understand motivation, we have to primarily identify motives, which create the system of inducement of activities. To present this article it is necessary to remind that the fundamental provision of empiric research was that all motives of participation can be relatively divided into two groups: individualistic and collectivistic ones. It has not been published yet how individualistic incentives, measured by Simmons and Birchall's instrument, manifest themselves, but it is to be done in the nearest future. As it has been mentioned, this article deals only with the expression of collectivistic incentives, and it is the second article, i.e. the first part has already been presented. All the results obtained are used to create the models of activation of motivation, which are also to be published in the future, but not in this publication. It should be reminded that the developers of the methodology - Simmons and Birchall - proposed to research collective motives by the scale of 30 collective attitudes, where all the attitudes are grouped by the authors into the groups of common values, feeling of community and common goals. After the Lithuanian experts validation procedure, 25 incentives (attitudes) that remained in the subscale are divided into three subscales, according to which the analysis of survey results in the first part was carried out (see Tijunaitiene, Neverauskas, Balciunas, 2009), but bearing in mind, the different cultural, social and economic settings than those where the instrument was born, it was tried to reject the 3-subscale instrument model of the original developers and extend the analysis of collectivistic incentives on the ground of 5 factors. Rather large sample (N=987) enables to reveal more pure, more adequate factor model. Thus, 5 new factors have been distinguished: identification with the group and its performance results, acting together, competence of organisation activity, dissatisfaction with quality of organisation activity, commitment to civil activity. The results based on the ground of these factors are presented in this article.","[Tijunaitiene, Rigita; Balciunas, Sigitas] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Neverauskas, Bronius] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Siauliai University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Tijunaitiene, R (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu Str 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",rigita@smf.su.lt; bronius.neverauskas@ktu.lt; balciunas@cr.su.lt,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,2,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We compared 2005 against 2004, when we were able to isolate the flat tax impact from other factors. We found that the higher the gross wage is, the higher the flat tax gains are. The inequality indicators we calculated (the Gini index, the relative mean deviation, the coeficient of variation, the standard deviation of logarithms, the Mehran index and the Piesch index) show an increase in inequality determined by the flat tax. The Lorenz curve is illustrative, as only the last quantile of the population (richest 20%) appears as the - clear winner of the flat tax. The results also indicate that the higher the income level, the higher the income elasticity of consumption. We conclude that the flat tax led to increased income inequality and it stimulated households consumption particularly among the wealthiest households.","[Voinea, Liviu] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Voinea, L (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Voinea, Liviu/JDC-7546-2023; Voinea, Liviu/C-4361-2011",,,,,,26,15,16,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

These rankings are often used, formally or informally, to help assess the publication success of individual economists or institutions. Although ranking methods and opinions are legion, scant attention has been paid to the usefulness of any ranking as representative of the many articles published in a journal. First, because the distributions of citations across articles within a journal are seriously skewed, and the skewness differs across journals, the appropriate measure of central tendency is the median rather than the mean. Second, large shares of articles in the highest-ranked journals are cited less frequently than typical articles in much-lower-ranked journals.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Wall, HJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",wall@stls.frb.org,"Wall, Howard/HCG-8393-2022","Wall, Howard/0000-0003-0411-9749",,,,,10,20,21,0,10,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The incentives of the owners are examined with a model of cross-ownership cartels and data from professional sports. Assuming that various professional sport events are substitutes, owners may increase profits by eliminating competition, even if they own the competition. This study shows that the recent National Hockey League (NHL) lockout caused a statistically significant increase in attendance for the National Basketball Association and junior hockey leagues. Given that many NHL owners own teams in these substitutable leagues, this could be construed as anti-competitive behaviour and may have prolonged the NHL lockout and helped NHL owners in collective bargaining. Given the public investment in sports facilities and market power in professional sports, this analysis calls for cross-ownership across professional sports to be questioned.","Univ Michigan, Program Sport Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Winfree, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Program Sport Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jwinfree@umich.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020",,,,,,23,10,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Investing more on the early children education, regular education and health; ensuring more equality on infrastructure and public service; making more equality on market including the labor, finance, land market; all those proposals which has been proved by other countries are effective to keep the attainable development.","[Zhang, Yingqiang; Yuan, Lunqu] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,,Jeff.zyq@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,4,WORLD ACAD UNION-WORLD ACAD PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"113, ACADEMIC HOUSE, MILL LANE, WAVERTREE TECHNOLOGY PARK, LIVERPOOL, L13 4 AH, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84626-071-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,419,422,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQC52,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000280689800093,0

However, in contrast to other advanced economies, Japan experienced an exceptional recessive period in the 1990s and 2000s, with the rate of unemployment rising to a historical maximum of 5.5% in 2002, to persist above 4% in subsequent years. In the present paper, we examine the main causes behind the paths followed by the labour income share and the unemployment rate during the post-1997 crisis period (19972002) and the transition years that followed (20022009). We do so by estimating a multi-equation macro model that allows us to look separately at the various components of this particular labour market: wages, output, and employment. Our main finding is that the fall in the labour share can be attributed to the changes that took place within the labour relations system (the weakening of unions mainly) and that the surge in unemployment can be altogether ascribed to the distorting effects of the sizeable and increasing public debt.","[Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Agnese, Pablo] FH Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Edifici B, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",hector.sala@uab.es,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017; Agnese, Pablo/R-8262-2018","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790; Agnese, Pablo/0000-0002-5959-7265",,,,,33,4,4,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We decompose the well documented decline in white public enrollment following desegregation into migration to suburban districts and increased private school enrollment and find that migration was the more prevalent response. Desegregation caused black public enrollment to increase significantly outside of the South, mostly by slowing decentralization of black households to the suburbs, and large black private school enrollment declines in southern districts. Central district school desegregation generated only a small portion of overall urban population decentralization between 1960 and 1990.","[Baum-Snow, Nathaniel] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Baum-Snow, Nathaniel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lutz, Byron F.] Fed Reserve Board, Div Res, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Baum-Snow, N (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Nathaniel_Baum-Snow@brown.edu; byron.f.lutz@frb.gov,,,NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,41,52,78,0,29,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

If immigrants are relatively good substitutes for native workers, the impact of immigration will be largest immediately upon the immigrants' arrival, and may become smaller as the labor market adjusts to the supply shock. Conversely, if immigrants upon arrival are poor substitutes for natives, the initial effect of immigration is small, and increases over time as immigrants acquire local labor market skills and compete with native workers. We empirically examine these alternative hypotheses using data from Israel between 1989 and 1999. We find that wages of both men and women are negatively correlated with the fraction of immigrants with little local experience in a labor market segment. A 10 percent increase in the share of immigrants lowers natives' wages in the short run by 1-3 percent, but this effect dissolves after 4-7 years. This result is robust to a variety of different segmentations of the labor market, to the inclusion of cohort effects, and to different dynamic structures in the residual term of the wage equation. On the other hand, we do not find any effect of immigration on employment, neither in the short nor in the medium run. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Paserman, M.

This paper explores the hypothesis of social ambivalence (so called as well or approach-avoidance conflict) as a phenomenon influencing attitudes towards the environmental effects of the introduction of GMOs (Genetic Modified Organisms). If social ambivalence exists it would be suggestive of an interplay between rational models or behaviour and normative or moral models of behaviour. This paper provides some quantitative analysis based on a representative sample of the European Union, using unique data from the Eurobarometer 58.0 (2002) examining public perceptions of environmental risks. Our findings suggest that GMOs are perceived as having a non-neutral impact on the environmental and social life and that as hypothesized there is evidence of social ambivalence, which appears to be more significant when environmental effects of GM foods are taken into account. Consistently with the hypothesis of interplay between rational and normative models of behaviour, respondents perceive some risks while benefits are not perceived by the public and moral concerns regarding technologies being developed by international corporations are important. A specific type of social ambivalence is found, namely GMO are not accepted for Europeans but they are in less developed countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Institutional factors such as widespread corruption, inefficient bureaucracy, and high risk of expropriation of private property by government can create uncertainty among producers and discourage them from investing and innovating over the long term. This can limit the ability of producers to improve the quality of their exports in the future. We find some evidence that a better institutional environment (i.e. lower corruption, more efficient bureaucracy and more secure property rights) is associated with better export quality. After accounting for potential endogeneity between institutional and economic variables, we conclude that better institutions lead to improvements in export quality. Among the institutional factors considered in this article, corruption appears to be most robustly associated with export quality. These results have important implications for policymakers.

To estimate the impact of taxes on university enrollment, we estimate a structural microeconometric model, in which a high-school graduate decides to enter university studies if expected lifetime utility from this choice is greater than that anticipated from starting to work right away. We estimate the ex-ante future paths of the expectation and variance of after-tax income for German high-school graduates, accounting for nonrandom selection. The enrollment model takes into account university dropout and unemployment risks. Consistently with expectations, the estimation results indicate that higher expected returns to a tertiary education increase the probability of university enrollment, whereas higher uncertainty among graduates decreases enrollment rates. A simulation based on the estimated model indicates that a revenue-neutral, flat-rate tax reform with an unchanged basic tax allowance would increase enrollment rates for men in Germany.","[Fossen, Frank M.] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Fossen, Frank M.; Glocker, Daniela] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Publ Econ Dept, D-10108 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Fossen, FM (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",frank.fossen@fu-berlin.de; dglocker@diw.de,"Fossen, Frank/S-5861-2019","Fossen, Frank/0000-0002-5908-8049",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,44,7,10,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We use Czech mass privatization as an experiment that allows us to analyze under what conditions a viable stock market arises. On the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE), unlike its counterparts in Poland or Hungary, exceptionally large amounts of shares were delisted e.g. excluded from public trading soon after trading at this market began in 1993. We estimate the determinants of shares delisting analyzing the period 1993-2004. Using firm-level data on listed and delisted companies we show that it was possible to prevent massive delisting if certain pre-privatization and privatization characteristics of the companies had been taken into account when deciding which companies to place on the stock exchange for public trading following the mass privatization. This result has important implications for establishing stock markets in emerging economies.","[Fungacova, Zuzana] Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Hanousek, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague 11121 1, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan] Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hanousek, Jan] CEPR, London, England",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Anglo-American University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Fungácová, Z (通讯作者)，Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, POB 160, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",zuzana.fungacova@bof.fi; jan.hanousek@cerge-ei.cz,"Hanousek, Jan/H-2879-2014; Hanousek, Jan/HOC-4951-2023","Hanousek, Jan/0009-0006-3997-5931",,,,,28,3,3,0,24,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

While elected officials strive for re-election, appointed ones are career-concerned. Provided that the effort exerted to uncover the firm's unknown cost is sufficiently effective in swaying votes, elected officials produce more information than appointed ones do. As a result, when the demand is inelastic, appointment induces wider allocative distortions and higher profits which, in turn, yield stronger incentives to invest. Hence, appointment will prevail on election when investment inducement is sufficiently relevant and shareholders are sufficiently more powerful than consumers. Data on electricity rates and costs, and the methods of selecting regulators and appellate judges for a panel of forty-seven US states confirm these predictions.

Employers promise as much wage-smoothing as they can, consistent with incentive conditions that ensure they will not renege during low-profitability times. Equilibrium is inefficient if these incentive constraints bind, with risky wages for workers and a risk premium that employers must pay. Mandatory firing costs can help, by making it easier for employers to promise credibly not to cut wages in low-profitability periods. We show that firing costs are more likely to be Pareto-improving if they are not severance payments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper confirms that the profits retained as a reserve fund, if combined with unconstrained bureaucratic discretion, can engender inflationary bias. This result is intriguing because the previous literature emphasizes a similar distortion in monetary policy for the opposite case where those profits are turned over to the Treasury. We therefore propose that some external changes in central-banking institutions alone may not warrant their desired 'outcome' without reining in excessive discretion. This proposition can provide a beneficial implication for establishing the meaningful independence of central banks.","[Kim, Iljoong; Kim, Inbae] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Kim, Iljoong] SungKyunKwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Ewha Womans University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, I (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",ijkim@skku.edu; ibkim@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,12,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

First, we examine entry and exit patterns and the role of new and exiting firms versus incumbents in job creation and destruction. We find that while the rate of job creation at new firms is quiet high - at 8% on average - the numbers of jobs added by new firms is small in absolute terms. Next, we examine survival rates and find that the probability of survival increases monotonically with firm size, but that manufacturing and foreign-owned firms face higher likelihoods of exit compared to service oriented and domestically-owned firms. We find that higher GDP growth increases the probability of firm survival, but this is a broad impact with no firm size disproportionately affected. In robustness checks we find that post-1987, size is no longer a significant determinant of firm survival for new entrants, suggesting that the operating environment for firms changed. Finally, we find that trade and fiscal reform episodes raised the probability of firm exit and attenuated the survival disadvantages faced by smaller firms, but exchange rate revaluation and pro-private sector reforms did not significantly lower the likelihood of exit.

Our results support a model in which employers have good information about the quality of HU graduates and pay them according to their ability, but in which the market has relatively little information about COMAS graduates. Hence, high-skill COMAS graduates are initially treated as if they were the average COMAS graduate, who is weaker than a HU graduate, and consequently earn less than HU graduates. However, over time the market differentiates among them so that after several years of experience, COMAS and HU graduates with similar entry scores have similar earnings.

We develop a model in which competing manufacturers must license several patents to produce standard-compliant goods. Separate licensing creates a double-marginalization problem. Moreover manufacturers must sink a fixed cost to enter the product market, and thus face a hold-up problem if licensing takes place after their entry. In this setting, the formation of a pool fails when it takes place after entry. Instead, we show that allowing patent owners to commit ex ante on joining a pool is an effective way to trigger the emergence of a stable pool solving both the double-marginalization and hold-up problems. Therefore, patent owners should be encouraged to coordinate their licensing policies on a voluntary basis at early stages in the standard-setting process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A collusive network is a set of market sharing agreements between firms in oligopolistic markets and auctions. Belleflamme and Bloch (Int Econ Rev 45(2):387-411, 2004) fully characterize the pairwise stable collusive networks in their symmetric model. In contrast, we characterize the collusive networks to which a dynamic network formation process converges with positive probability in the symmetric model. We provide a complete characterization for the case of the process that starts from a network with sufficiently few links. Moreover, we show that the process never cycles but always converges to a stable network. In addition, we discuss an asymmetric model where firms enjoy a home country advantage. We show that the expected number of collusive agreements may be reduced by an increase in the degree of the home country advantage. This implies that policies for discouraging entry may fail, and may lead to a decrease in expected social surplus.","Hannan Univ, Fac Econ, Matsubara, Osaka 5808502, Japan",,"Okumura, Y (通讯作者)，Hannan Univ, Fac Econ, 5-4-33 Amami Higashi, Matsubara, Osaka 5808502, Japan.",okuyasu@gs.econ.keio.ac.jp,"Okumura, Yasunori/J-2542-2016; Okumura, Yasunori/AAO-2073-2021","Okumura, Yasunori/0000-0003-0170-7502;",,,,,16,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

But, as we argue in this paper, schooling generates many experiences and affects many dimensions of skill that, in turn, affect central aspects of individuals' lives. Schooling not only affects income, but also the degree to which one enjoys work, as well as one's likelihood of being unemployed. It leads individuals to make better decisions about health, marriage, and parenting. It also improves patience, making individuals more goal-oriented and less likely to engage in risky behavior. Schooling improves trust and social interaction, and may offer substantial consumption value to some students. We discuss various mechanisms to explain how these relationships may occur independent of wealth effects and present evidence that nonpecuniary returns to schooling are at least as large as pecuniary ones. Ironically, one explanation why some early school leavers miss out on these high returns is that they lack the very same decision-making skills that more schooling would help improve.","[Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Salvanes, Kjell G.] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5035 Bergen, Norway; [Salvanes, Kjell G.] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Educ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Salvanes, Kjell G.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Toronto; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",oreo@economics.utoronto.ca; Kjell.Salvanes@nhh.no,,,,,,,104,428,560,3,92,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Productivity increases in the final output sector have no effect on growth or inequality.

Income inequality and welfare inequality are driven by different factors and are likely to respond in opposite ways to productivity enhancement in the human capital sector.

This paper develops a trade model that can account for why offshoring industries in lcw wage countries such as Mexico experience fluctuations in employment that are twice as large as in high wage countries such as the United States. We argue that a key to explaining this outcome is that the extensive margin of offshoring responds endogenously to shocks in demand and transmits those shocks across borders in an amplified manner. Empirical evidence supports the claim that the extensive margin of offshoring is an active margin of adjustment, and quantitative simulation experiments show that the degree of movement of this margin in the data is sufficient to explain relative employment volatility in Mexico and the U.S. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.","[Bergin, Paul R.; Feenstra, Robert C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bergin, Paul R.; Feenstra, Robert C.; Hanson, Gordon H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hanson, Gordon H.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Bergin, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",prbergin@ucdavis.edu; refeenstra@ucdavis.edu; gohanson@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,25,32,35,3,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1996,,,J INT ECON,J.

It evaluates four model specifications, including the advanced dynamic, autoregressive, dynamic autoregressive probit models as well as the conventional static probit model. The empirical results highlight several significant recession predictors, notably the government bond yield spread, growth rates of the housing starts, the real money supply and the composite index of leading indicators. Both the in-sample and out-of-sample results suggest that the forecasting performance of the four probit models is mixed. The dynamic and dynamic autoregressive probit models are better in predicting the duration of recessions while the static and autoregressive probit models are better in forecasting the peaks of business cycles. Hence, the advanced dynamic models and the conventional static probit model can complement one another to provide more accurate forecasts for the duration and turning points of business cycles.","[Hao, Lili; Ng, Eric C.

J,"Mazumder, S",,,,"Mazumder, Sandeep",,,The empirical validity of the New Keynesian Phillips curve using survey forecasts of inflation,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inflation; Phillips curve; Marginal cost,MARGINAL COST; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR,"This paper investigates the performance of the New Keynesian Phillips curve when survey forecasts of inflation are used to proxy for inflation expectations. Previous authors such as Brissimis and Magginas (2008) have applied survey measures of inflation expectations to the NKPC, and have concluded that these estimates are superior to those estimated using actual data on future inflation. However this approach employs the use of the labor income share as the proxy for real marginal cost, something which is highly problematic once we consider the countercyclicality of this variable. This paper develops and tests a procyclical marginal cost variable alongside various survey measures of inflation forecasts in the NKPC, while recognizing the problem of weak instruments that occurs when estimating the model using conventional GMM.

This discrepancy may be due to several causes. Assuming, however, that a trade model is not misspecified - in the sense that behavior of the economic agents involved in the specific commodity markets has been included in the study and that the relevant policy instruments have been properly taken into account - the cause of discrepancy may be traced either to imprecision of unit transaction costs or to imprecision in the measurement of the demand and supply functions' parameters, or both. Policy assessments based on this type of imprecise models are distorted. This paper presents a methodology for calibrating mathematical programming spatial trade models of increasing complexity, from the one-commodity case to a multi-commodity model with asymmetric slope matrices of demand and supply functions. The proposed calibration procedure identifies corrections of imperfectly measured parameters. The calibrated models generate solutions that exactly reproduce quantities produced and consumed in all countries, as well as trade flows among all pairs of countries, observed in a given base year. Such models may then serve as a springboard for assessing the impact of various policy changes on economic agents in the countries under study. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model allows for the possibilities of spillovers and asymmetries in the variance-covariance structure for real output growth and the change in the real price of oil. Our measure of oil price uncertainty is the conditional variance of the oil price change forecast error. We isolate the effects of volatility in the change in the price of oil and its asymmetry on output growth and employ simulation methods to calculate generalized impulse response functions and volatility impulse response functions to trace the effects of independent shocks on the conditional means and the conditional variances, respectively, of the variables. We find that oil price uncertainty has a negative effect on output, and that shocks to the price of oil and its uncertainty have asymmetric effects on output.","[Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Rahman, Sajjadur] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Saskatchewan,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",serletis@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,33,79,88,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

It shows that when intermediate inputs are not highly differentiated, lowering input tariffs leads to a rise in within-firm productivity and wages, and lowering output tariffs has the opposite effect. When intermediate inputs are highly differentiated, the conclusions reverse. These predictions are supported by the data, given by the industrial survey from INEGI (Mexico's Insitituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografia e Informacion) in the period 1984-90. The paper yields estimates for the elasticity of substitution among intermediate inputs, which are useful in determining the direction of the impact of trade liberalization.

The competitive model is augmented as we provide traders with correct beliefs about their price impacts to define equilibrium with endogenously determined market power and show that such equilibrium exists in economies with smooth utility and cost functions and is generically determinate. Traders' price impacts depend positively on the convexity of preferences or cost functions of the trading partners and are subject to mutual reinforcement. Compared to the competitive model, the volume of trade is reduced, and hence is Pareto inefficient. The price effects of non-competitive trading depend on the convexity of marginal utility or cost function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Fiscal policy can be an effective countercyclical tool if monetary policy accommodates the fiscal expansion, if expectations about future output growth and inflation are constant, and if structural relationships are invariant to the policy change. Recent expansions are unlikely to produce large output multipliers or have important debt or inflation effects.

Results are reported from an experiment using hypothetical choice scenarios. Brief vignettes were used depicting hypothetical couples at the transition to marriage and to parenthood. Each participant (N=400) responded to two brief vignettes depicting one hypothetical couple about to get married and another approaching the birth of a first child. The relative income of the hypothetical partners was varied across vignettes. Respondents selected the form of financial organisation they considered 'best' for each couple from a list of six different money management systems (adapted from Pahl, 1989), provided a reason for their choice and indicated which partner (if either) should have greater access to personal spending money. Whilst the 'joint pool' was most frequently chosen as the best system of financial organisation, a series of correspondence analyses revealed significant associations between the income disparities depicted in the vignettes and the money management systems chosen. Analysis suggested that the normative dimensions underlying these choices related to notions of equality/disparity and (inter)dependence/autonomy. Income disparities were also associated with views on personal spending money in the transition to marriage. The findings and their broader implications are discussed with reference to gender and the potential explanatory role of income disparity in accounting for gender differences in access to household monetary resources.

Rational choice theory predicts that households will find annuities attractive at the onset of retirement because they address the risk of outliving one's income, but in fact, relatively few of those facing retirement choose to annuitize a substantial portion of their wealth. There is now a substantial literature on the behavioral economics of retirement saving, which has stressed that both behavioral and institutional factors play an important role in determining a household's saving accumulations. Self-control problems, inertia, and a lack of financial sophistication inhibit some households from providing an adequate retirement nest egg. However, interventions such as automatic enrollment and automatic escalation of saving over time as wages rise (the save more tomorrow plan) have shown success in overcoming these obstacles. We will show that the same behavioral and institutional factors that help explain savings behavior are also important in understanding 1) how families handle the process of decumulation once retirement commences and 2) why there seems to be so little demand to annuitize wealth at retirement.","[Benartzi, Shlomo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Behav Decis Making Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Previtero, Alessandro] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada; [Thaler, Richard H.] Univ Chicago, Univ Chicago Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Chicago,"Benartzi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Behav Decis Making Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",benartzi@ucla.edu; aprevitero@ivey.uwo.ca; Richard.Thaler@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,50,137,149,0,61,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Estimation of this elasticity is of particular interest not only in its own right but also because of its relevance to the debate about the competitiveness of labour markets. The essence of monopsonistically competitive labour markets is that labour supply to a firm is imperfectly elastic with respect to the wage rate. The intuition is that, where workers have heterogeneous preferences or face mobility costs, firms can offer lower wages without immediately losing their workforce. This is in contrast to the perfectly competitive extreme, in which the elasticity is infinite. Therefore, a simple test of whether labour markets are perfectly or imperfectly competitive involves estimating the elasticity of the labour supply to a firm. We find that the Australian wage elasticity of labour supply to a firm is around 0.71, only slightly smaller than the figure of 0.75 reported by Manning (2003) for the United Kingdom. These estimates are so far from the perfectly competitive assumption of an infinite elasticity that it would be difficult to make a case that labour markets are perfectly competitive.","[Booth, Alison L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Booth, Alison L.] Univ Essex, Wivenhoe Pk, Essex, England",Australian National University; University of Essex,"Booth, AL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,16,13,15,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

We demonstrate that such spending by households is highly sensitive to social spending by other villagers. This suggests that social spending is either positional in nature (i.e., motivated by status concerns) or subject to herding behavior. We also document systematic relations between social spending and changes in higher order terms of the income distribution. We find that the implications of status seeking for spending are not unidimensional-they vary across income groups and expenditure categories. In particular, and consistent with theories of rank-based status seeking, we find that the poor increase spending on funerals and gifts as competition for status intensifies. In addition, poor families of grooms expend more for wedding ceremonies as local income competition increases, while the families of brides do not. The welfare implications of spending in order to keep up with the Joneses are potentially large, particularly for poor households. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

We find that left-wing governments promote regulation in gas and electricity sectors. Also, less politically fragmented institutions contribute to deregulation of gas and electricity industries. Long tenures of incumbent government have limited impact on regulation in electricity sector, while it is associated with an increase in regulation of gas sector. Further, we find that higher political constraints and more globalized countries lead to deregulation in electricity and gas sectors. We discover that economic and social integration are the forces that promote deregulation in the gas industry, whereas political integration advance deregulation in the electricity industry.

We add the threat of an interest rate defence to the global game model of Morris and Shin (American Economic Review 88, 1998). With an endogenous defence, actions of speculators may become strategic substitutes instead of the usual complements. Nevertheless, our generalised model remains tractable and has a unique threshold equilibrium. It provides additional insights. For instance, the threat of an interest rate defence makes speculation riskier and this may be sufficient to keep speculators out when fundamentals are still relatively strong. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For example, monetary incentives from principals may change how tasks are perceived by agents, with negative effects on behavior. In other cases, incentives might have the desired effects in the short term, but they still weaken intrinsic motivations. To put it in concrete terms, an incentive for a child to learn to read might achieve that goal in the short term, but then be counterproductive as an incentive for students to enjoy reading and seek it out over their lifetimes. Next we examine the research literature on three important examples in which monetary incentives have been used in a nonemployment context to foster the desired behavior: education; increasing contributions to public goods; and helping people change their lifestyles, particularly with regard to smoking and exercise. The conclusion sums up some lessons on when extrinsic incentives are more or less likely to alter such behaviors in the desired directions.","[Gneezy, Uri] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Meier, Stephan] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA; [Rey-Biel, Pedro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Columbia University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Gneezy, U (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ugneezy@ucsd.edu; sm3087@columbia.edu; pedro.rey@uab.es,"Rey-Biel, Pedro/H-6213-2015","Rey-Biel, Pedro/0000-0002-1606-2631",,,,,63,862,982,9,327,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Our agents invest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based on three sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii) information from their friendship network and (iii) private information. Our bounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to the current market regime by weighting each of these sources of information in their trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. We find that bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, due to a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into a transient collective herding regime. After this self-amplified exuberance, the price has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash, which brings the price even below its fundamental value. These ingredients provide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financial markets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the current market regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility. A positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms (adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubbles and crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite (herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a single framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the distribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes are qualitatively different from the rest of the price moves.

We build a model of technology diffusion in which follower economies achieve productivity growth by taking advantage of technology spillovers from the world technology frontier. We hypothesize that China's regional productivity growth is a positive function of regional openness and a negative function of the current level of regional productivity. Empirical analysis in this paper focuses on how openness affects productivity growth in the Chinese provinces. We examine two effects of openness on regional productivity growth in China: the direct growth effect and the convergence effect. By using a variety of panel data regression techniques, we show that the direct growth effect of openness is the main effect while the convergence effect is insignificant. The findings of this paper lend strong support to the claim that the opening-up of China promotes the country's economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The index can be used to track shadow economies through time or across sectors and therefore is a useful tool to evaluate the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing the size of shadow economies. Our results suggest that the shadow economy in Latvia in 2010 is considerably larger than in neighbouring Estonia and Lithuania. While the shadow economy as a percentage of GDP in Estonia contracted from 2009 to 2010, it expanded in Latvia and Lithuania. An important driver of shadow activity in the Baltic States is entrepreneurs' dissatisfaction with and distrust in the government and the tax system. We also find that involvement in the shadow economy is more pervasive among younger firms and firms in the construction sector. The findings of this study have a number of policy implications: (i) the relatively large size of shadow economies in the Baltic States and their different expansion/contraction trends cause significant error in official estimates of GDP and its rates of change; (ii) tax compliance can be encouraged by addressing the high level of dissatisfaction with the tax system and with government (e.g., making tax policy more stable and increasing the transparency with which taxes are spent), and (iii) significant scope exists for all three governments to increase their tax revenues by bringing entrepreneurs 'out of the shadows'.",,,,talis.putnins@sseriga.edu; arnis.sauka@sseriga.edu,"Sauka, Arnis/ABF-7869-2021","Putnins, Talis/0000-0001-5731-499X",,,,,12,24,26,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

In this paper we continue to study family of games which generalise Shapley's example by introducing an external parameter and prove that there exists an abundance of periodic and chaotic behaviour with player. dithering between different strategies. The reason for all this, is that there exists a period orbit (consisting of playing mixed strategies) which is of jitter type': such an orbit is neither attracting, repelling or of saddle type as nearby orbits jitter closer and further away from in a manner which is reminiscent of a random walk motion.

Finite models of the form pioneered by Ericson and Pakes (1995) capture the dynamics of a finite number of heterogeneous firms as they compete in an industry, and are typically analyzed using the concept of Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE). Infinite models of the form pioneered by Hopenhayn (1992), on the other hand, consider an infinite number of infinitesimal firms, and are typically analyzed using the concept of stationary equilibrium (SE). A third approach uses oblivious equilibrium (OE), which maintains the simplifying benefits of an infinite model but within the more realistic setting of a finite model. The paper relates these three approaches. The main result of the paper provides conditions under which SE of infinite models approximate MPE of finite models arbitrarily well in asymptotically large markets. Our conditions require that the distribution of firm states in SE obeys a certain light-tail condition. In a second set of results, we show that the set of OE of a finite model approaches the set of SE of the infinite model in large markets under a similar light-tail condition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Zhang, T",,,,"Zhang, Ting",,,International Outsourcing and Unemployment in a Minimum-wage Economy,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PURE THEORY; TRADE,"To explore the impact of international outsourcing on unemployment and social welfare, the conventional trade model is extended by including both economies of scale and a minimum-wage constraint in the unskilled-labor market. In the paper, the scale economies are linked with the production of the most skill-intensive good. It is shown that within such a framework, there is a trade-off between a more socially desirable endowment allocation and a greater level of employment. Therefore, even though outsourcing could raise aggregate employment, this benefit is at the cost of further exacerbating the resource misallocation. In this way, the extensions to the traditional framework explored in the paper generate new insights as to why outsourcing may cause a net welfare loss to the home country.","Dept Justice Canada, Res & Stat Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H8, Canada",,"Zhang, T (通讯作者)，Dept Justice Canada, Res & Stat Div, 284 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H8, Canada.",tzhang3@connect.carleton.ca,"l, j/JVZ-8480-2024; L, J/JEF-9564-2023; Zhang, Tingting/HDN-5850-2022",,,,,,19,7,7,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Evidence from Rural Mozambique,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FARMER FIELD SCHOOLS; PROPENSITY SCORE; INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; HOUSEHOLD INCOME; AFRICA; IMPACT; ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; CAUSAL; OPPORTUNITIES,"Mozambique remains predominantly poor. The official statistics show that poverty incidence barely changed from 54% in 2002-03 to 55% in 2008-09, which stands way above the government's target of 45% by the year 2009. This places the country off-target to cut hunger and poverty by half by 2015, despite an annual economic growth of about 7% in the period 1994-2010. In rural areas, poverty levels have slightly increased, due to the underperformance of the agricultural sector. Extension services can have a significant impact on poverty reduction through stimulating growth in agricultural productivity. Based on a nationally representative household survey from Mozambique, this paper uses three econometric models, namely an OLS regression, the doubly robust estimator and matching and regression to estimate the economic impact of receipt of extension. The results suggest that the receipt of extension increases farm incomes by 12%. However, rather than crafting resource-poor technologies, extension services tend to target wealthier households who are relatively more likely to adopt the existing technologies. This might increase income inequality. The impact of extension, and therefore its contribution to poverty reduction, can be enhanced through several mechanisms (e.g., programme design and the number of staff).","[Cunguara, Benedito] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci Vienna, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Cunguara, Benedito] Ctr Dev Res Wien, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Moder, Karl] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci Vienna, Inst Appl Stat, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Cunguara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci Vienna, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",benedito.cunguara@boku.ac.at,,,,,,,47,32,38,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

In this paper we use an estimation approach that is valid under relatively weak assumptions to measure the impact of State Enterprise Zones (ENTZs), Federal Empowerment Zones (EMPZs), and Federal Enterprise Community (ENTC) programs on local labor markets. We find that all three programs have positive, statistically significant, impacts on local labor markets in terms of the unemployment rate, the poverty rate, the fraction with wage and salary income, and employment. Further, the effects of EMPZ and ENTC designation are considerably larger than the impact of ENTZ designation. We find that our estimates are robust to allowing for a regression to the mean effect. We also find that there are positive, but statistically insignificant, spillover effects to neighboring Census tracts of each of these programs. Thus our positive estimates of these program impacts do not simply represent a transfer from the nearest non-treated Census tract to the treated Census tract. Our results are noteworthy for several reasons. First, our study is the first to jointly look at these three programs, thus allowing policy makers to compare the impacts of these programs. Second, our paper, along with a concurrent study by Neumark and Kolko (2008), is the first to carry out the estimation accounting for overlap between the programs. Third, our estimation strategy is valid under weaker assumptions than those made in many previous studies; we consider three comparison groups and let the data determine the appropriate group. Fourth, in spite of our conservative estimation strategy, by looking at national effects with disaggregated data, we show that ENTZ designation generally has a positive effect on the local labor market, while most previous research on ENTZs, much of which used more geographically aggregated data to look at state-specific effects, did not find any significant impacts. Fifth, we note that there is little or no previous work on ENTCs. Overall, our results strongly support the efficacy of these labor market interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We use individual-level data for 24 countries that participated in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor during 2004, 2005 and 2006 (some 350,000 observations). Our findings indeed show that a recent exit decreases the probability of undertaking no entrepreneurial activity, whereas it substantially increases the probabilities of being involved in all other engagement levels. Investigating the conditions under which an exit increases engagement in entrepreneurial activities, we find that the probability of entrepreneurial engagement after exit is higher for males, for persons who know an entrepreneur and for persons with a low fear of failure. Educational attainment does not seem to be relevant. Moreover, there exists large cross-country variation in the probability of entrepreneurial engagement after exit.","[Hessels, Jolanda; Thurik, Roy] EIM Business & Policy Res, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Hessels, Jolanda; Thurik, Roy; van der Zwan, Peter] Erasmus Univ, Ctr Adv Small Business Econ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Grilo, Isabel] Commiss European Communities, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Grilo, Isabel] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thurik, Roy] GSCM Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Hessels, J (通讯作者)，EIM Business & Policy Res, POB 7001, NL-2701 AA Zoetermeer, Netherlands.",joh@eim.nl,"Thurik, Roy/A-9386-2012","Thurik, Roy/0000-0002-0242-6908; van der Zwan, Peter/0000-0003-2654-4367; Hessels, Jolanda/0000-0002-0865-3386",,,,,77,122,136,4,86,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

I first outline a simple model constructed on the premise that people are motivated by their own payoff and by how their action compares to others in their reference group. I show that conformity in actions may arise from learning about the descriptive norm, or from image-related concerns. In order to empirically disentangle the two, I use the fact that image-related concerns can only be present if actions are publicly observable. The model predictions are then tested in a charitable contribution experiment in which the actions and identities of the subjects are unmasked in a controlled and systematic way. Both learning about the descriptive norm (i.e., what others are doing) and image-related concerns play an important role in the choices of the subjects. Individuals indulge in social comparison and change their contributions in the direction of the social norm even when their identities are hidden. Once identities and contribution distributions of group members are revealed, individuals conform to the choice of other group members. Moreover, I find that social ties (defined as subjects knowing each other from outside the lab) affect the role of social influence: Subjects only respond to the choices of group members they are friends with. In particular, a low contribution norm evolves that causes individuals to contribute less in the presence of friends. This suggests that social comparison and image-related concerns may not always lead to higher contributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These theoretical studies also claim that an efficient denominational mix has the additional benefit of keeping down the production costs incurred by the central bank. This paper challenges this claim and demonstrates that more efficient currency systems can also be more costly. Central banks therefore face an efficiency-cost trade-off and have to weigh the benefits for transactors against those for the central bank itself. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Many researchers criticize such policies, as government expenditure supporting accumulation and growth of the urban sector is thought to be competitive with government financed rural employment creation. However, my assertion is that there is no demand-driven trade-off between these urban and rural employment generations. In fact, I propose a supply-side trade-off. The generic food-supply-constraint creates this rural-urban conflict. To investigate this phenomenon, first a Kaleckian macroeconomic framework is constructed, with which I examine the role of the government and that of the food sector in supporting accumulation in the modern sector and thereby generating urban employment. Subsequently, the issue of rural employment creation with the help of food surplus and through direct government intervention is considered. Finally, we arrive at the issue of the rural-urban conflict: the conflict between the effects of government involvement in accumulation-led urban employment generation and of direct government intervention through development management administrating rural employment. However, I also propose a policy that could minimize such a contradiction.","Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Econ & Polit, Santini Ketan 731235, W Bengal, India",Visva Bharati University,"Chakrabarti, S (通讯作者)，Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Econ & Polit, Santini Ketan 731235, W Bengal, India.",saumyavb72@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

In fact, people still find it worthwhile to invest in a reputation as a trusting person, even though the immediate payoff for trusting is poor.

External knowledge sources affect the innovation decision but not innovation performance, thus pointing to the primacy of internal processes for the crucial task of knowledge exploitation.

Payment for environmental services (PES) is seen as a promising instrument to address the problem, for which one key information is the willingness to pay (WTP) of urban water users for water source pollution control. Using a contingent valuation survey data, we estimate the WTP of Fuzhou City residents for pollution control by the livestock farms located at the upstream Min River. When the protest responses are not distinguished, the mean WTP is estimated at CNY0.21/m(3), or 10% of the current base tariff. When the protestors are distinguished, the estimated mean WTP equals CNY0.51. The total annual WTPs of the two cases are CNY22 million and CNY53 million, respectively, which lead to potentially opposite conclusions about Fuzhou's participation in the provincial PES program, to which Fuzhou contributes CNY30 million. The results highlight the importance of addressing protest responses in contingent valuation as well as in policymaking and implementation. We find that the WTP varies greatly with income, which calls for attention to the affordability and distribution issues of a water tariff reform. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The recent history and situation of Islam in the region are described through the variety of the landscapes of belief detected during interviews and observations in the field. The territorial basis of the rivalries that led to the breakup of CDUMES following liberalization during the 1990s is discussed before switching focus to several towns and villages in the south and west of the region. This approach to Islam via the territory allows for crossing several factors: the stances adopted by local authorities (at the level of the city, district and republic); co-optation and personal initiatives; the flexible relation to the authority of the muhtasib; the preponderance of networks of sociability based on the question of funding. This point of view allows for detecting the different relations to religion in a common territory marked by modes of identity (Ishanism) and fundamentalist tendencies for refusing traditional norms.","Ctr Etud Franco Russe Moscou, Moscow, Russia",,"Le Torrivellec, X (通讯作者)，Ctr Etud Franco Russe Moscou, Moscow, Russia.",xavier@letorrivellec.fr,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,2,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We look at both innovation effort (R&D intensity) and innovation performance measures such as new product sales. We obtain the following main results: (1) the presence of CEO incentive schemes increases both corporate innovation effort and innovation performance; (2) sales-based performance measures in the incentive scheme, as compared with profit-based performance measure, are more conducive to firm innovation; and (3) CEO education level, professional background and political connection are positively associated with firm's innovation efforts. The main results are robust to endogeneity tests with instrumental variables. We also discuss some important policy implications. Journal of Comparative Economics xxx (xx) (2011) xxx-xxx.

It synthesizes the work of Hyman Minsky (1977, 1985), Jan Toporowski (2001), and Dick Bryan and Michael Rafferty (2006). The decade immediately after 1971 is presented as a key period with key events that shaped a Wall Street revolution that now drives world capitalism. Balance sheet computations of expected profitability emerge as the main driver of a contemporary capitalism that is inherently more competitive than before. Debt, credit, and liquidity, therefore, play crucial parts in a world system where banks and corporations have been joined by new rentier institutions in riskier speculative business activities that now characterize the system. The conclusions are largely Keynesian ... when the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.","Univ Witwatersrand, Corp Strategy & Ind Dev Res Programme, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"McKenzie, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Corp Strategy & Ind Dev Res Programme, Johannesburg, South Africa.",rex.mckenzie@wits.ac.za,"McKenzie, Rex/AAX-6247-2021",,,,,,39,10,11,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

(ii) Groups can differ in marginal cost of effort and their membership size. (iii) In each group the members decide how much effort to put without observing the sharing rules of the other groups. It is shown that endogenous determination of group sharing rules completely eliminates the group-size paradox, i.e. a larger group always attains a higher winning probability than a smaller group, unless the prize is purely private. In addition, an interesting pattern of equilibrium group sharing rules is revealed: The group attaining the lower winning probability is the one choosing the rule giving higher incentives to the members.

A strategy is properly rationalizable if it can optimally be chosen under common belief in the events (a) and (b). In this paper we present an algorithm that for every finite game computes the set of all properly rationalizable strategies. The algorithm is based on the new idea of a preference restriction, which is a pair (s(i), A(i)) consisting of a strategy s(i), and a subset of strategies A(i), for player i. The interpretation is that player i prefers some strategy in A(i) to s(i). The algorithm proceeds by successively adding preference restrictions to the game. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We show that different degree of efficiency gain sharply changes the comparisons of optimal subsidy, total outputs and social welfare between mixed and private duopoly. What is more, for an imposition of an optimal subsidy, welfare may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged with privatization, which depends on the level of the cost efficiency gap and the taxation burden. However, it may be possible to raise welfare through privatization as long as the efficiency gain prevails or no excess taxation burden exists.

Over the past two decades, consistent with the adoption of inflation targeting strategies by a growing number of central banks and the development of New Keynesian models for which monetary aggregates are largely irrelevant, money and credit have been progressively neglected in the conduct of monetary policy. A striking exception has been the Eurosystem, which has implemented a strategy known as the two-pillar monetary policy strategy giving a prominent role for money. In this paper, we develop a small optimizing model based on Ireland (2004), estimated on euro area data and featuring this two-pillar strategy. We evaluate an ECB-style cross-checking policy rule in a DSGE model with real balance effects of money. We find some evidence that indeed money plays a non-trivial role in explaining the euro area business cycle. This provides a rationale for the central bank to factor in monetary developments but also raises some issues regarding the reliability of M3 as an appropriate monetary indicator. We find some evidence that the ECB has systematically reacted to a filtered measure of money growth but weak evidence it has reacted more aggressively during excess money growth periods.

However, some issues arise when these data are analyzed or used directly. Even when industrial energy consumption alone is examined, at least three types of issues are encountered: missing data, large amounts of misallocated data in some countries, and numerous unrealistic outliers in the time-series variations. When we deal with only a few regions, we can look at data one by one and modify them. In this case, we are going to overcome these issues with a systematic method because the data covers world including more than a hundred regions. This paper proposes a data reconciliation method to treat these issues, and describes its application to world industrial energy consumption. As a result of its application, we found that the three issues mentioned above seemed to be overcome. The degree of the reconciliation by region showed that OECD countries' degree tends to be smaller than those of non-OECD countries. However, not all of the OECD countries have low values and some countries, such as the United States, have high values. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Users play a game of extractions, where they decide how much resource to draw from each source they are connected to. We show that the network structure matters. The exploitation at each source depends on the centrality of the links connecting the source to the users. The equilibrium is unique and we provide a formula which expresses the quantities at an equilibrium as a function of a network centrality measure. Next we characterize the efficient levels of extractions by users and outflows from sources. We provide a graph decomposition which divides the network into regions according to the availability of sources.

Cross-border ownership on the basis of both financial interests and corporate control leads to horizontal market linkages through which tariffs and production subsidies may harm locally owned firms but benefit the foreign firm.

Regression analyses focusing on the four largest economies in North and South America (the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil) reveal a generally positive relationship between ethics and happiness. In particular, respondents who do not justify unethical actions have higher reported well-being than those who are more accepting of such actions, after controlling for factors identified in the literature as important correlates of happiness and well-being. The effect of ethics on happiness is roughly similar to that of a modest increase in income, being married and attending church, while the effect is smaller than that of having poor health or being dissatisfied with one's personal finances.","Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"James, HS (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 146 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",hjames@missouri.edu,"James, Harvey/V-4021-2019","James, Harvey/0000-0003-0189-271X",,,,,51,33,36,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2011,64.0,2,,,,,193,212,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00502.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,750DO,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289525100003,0

Scale economies are considered finite so that for the individual utility an optimal scale of operations arises. A similar observation yields for scope economies as joint production is not predicted univocally anymore. In the water sector, scale economies and joint production are preferred. Nevertheless, several countries are restructuring the sector in order to improve the scale and scope of operations. This article intends to provide some insights into this matter. We analyze the Portuguese water market structure using non-parametric techniques with data from the year 2005. After surveying the literature on scale and scope economies, we discuss the peculiarities of the Portuguese water sector. The paper confirms the natural monopoly features. Although scope economies are absent, it highlights scale economies. The optimal scale of the utilities is located between 160,000 and 180,000 inhabitants. As such, the Portuguese water sector optimally counts 60 water utilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the short- and long-run interdependence between world oil prices, lira-dollar exchange rate, and individual agricultural commodity prices (wheat, maize, cotton, soybeans, and sunflower) in Turkey. To this end, the Toda-Yamamoto causality approach and generalized impulse-response analysis for identification of the long- and short-run interrelationships are applied to the monthly data spanning from January 1994 to March 2010. The impulse-response analysis suggests the Turkish agricultural prices do not significantly react to oil price and exchange rate shocks in the short-run. The long-run causality analysis reveals that the changes in oil prices and appreciation/depreciation of the Turkish lira are not transmitted to agricultural commodity prices in Turkey. Hence, our results support neutrality of agricultural commodity markets in Turkey to both direct and indirect effects of oil price changes. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, a controversial discussion concerning the monetary integration of CEE countries into the EMU has emerged. Both issues have earned particular academic and political interest because Eastern and Western Europe are at different stages of economic development and volatile international capital flows seem to require either a higher degree of wage or exchange rate flexibility. Based on the Scandinavian model of wage adjustment by Lindbeck (1979), we analyze the role of exchange rates in the wage determination process of the Central and Eastern European countries to identify which exchange rate strategy contributes to faster wage convergence in Europe. Panel estimations suggest that workers in countries with fixed exchange rates are likely to benefit in the long run from higher wage increases. (C) 2011 Society for Policy Modeling.

Previous research has shown in the long-run that inflation tends to appropriately increase the price of gold in the U.S., leading to gold's popularity as an asset in portfolios to reduce the risk against sudden inflation. However, gold is only partially effective in hedging against inflation in Japan. This research found that the rigidity between the price of gold and the consumer price index affects the inflation hedging ability of gold in the long-run. The gold price is characterized by market disequilibrium induced by the price rigidity, causing the price of gold to be unable to response to changes in the CPI. To explore the inflation hedging ability of gold in the short-run, this study further examines the price rigidity in low and high momentum regime. It is found during the low momentum regimes that, gold return is unable to hedge against inflation in either the U.S. or Japan. However, during high momentum regimes, gold return is able to hedge against inflation in the U.S., while the price rigidity in Japan causes the price of gold to not fully hedge against inflation in the short-run.

The estimated model accounts for a substantial fraction of the cyclical variation in output and is consistent with the observed inertia in inflation. This is true even though firms in the model re-optimize prices on average once every 1.8 quarters. The key feature of our model underlying this result is that capital is firm-specific. If we adopt the standard assumption that capital is homogeneous and traded in economy-wide rental markets, we find that firms re-optimize their prices on average once every 9 quarters.

Some public investment can be diverted from its purpose by corrupt individuals. Voters determine the level of public investment subject to an incentive constraint equalizing the returns from productive and corrupt activities. We concentrate on two exogenous institutional parameters: the technology of corruption is the ease with which rent-seekers can capture a proportion of public spending. The concentration of political power is the extent to which rent-seekers have more political influence than other people. One theoretical prediction is that the effects of the two institutional parameters on income growth and equilibrium corruption are different according to the constraints that are binding at equilibrium. In particular, the effect of judicial quality on growth should be stronger when political power is concentrated. We estimate a system of equations where both corruption and income growth are determined simultaneously and show that income growth is more affected by our proxies for legal and political institutions in countries where political rights and judicial institutions, respectively, are limited.","[de la Croix, David] UCLouvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium; [de la Croix, David] UCLouvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Delavallade, Clara] Univ Paris 01, Cape Town, South Africa",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Cape Town,"de la Croix, D (通讯作者)，UCLouvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium.",delacroix@uclouvain.be; Clara.Delavallade@uct.ac.za,"de la Croix, David/E-4677-2013","de la Croix, David/0000-0002-7589-8535",,,,,38,24,26,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Our aim is to highlight the strategic role of appropriation among a smaller group of agents in an intertemporal context. The model yields the conclusion that there exists a unique linear/non-linear Markov perfect equilibrium strategy, even when strategies are defined over the entire state space. We demonstrate that partial cooperation can be seen as a long-run response to conflict. Moreover, a decrease in the effectiveness of appropriation, the depreciation rate of a common-pool stock, the rate of time preferences or an increase in the degree of noise improves the degree of partial cooperation and thus welfare in an anarchic society.

In our setup, PMR modifies the distribution of firm productivities, thereby affecting the equilibrium rate of unemployment. We distinguish between PMR related to entry costs and PMR that generates recurrent fixed costs. We find that: (i) higher entry costs raise the rate of unemployment mainly through our novel selection effect, (ii) higher fixed costs decrease unemployment through the selection effect and increase it through the competition effect analyzed in Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, 879-907).

Then follows a discussion of the basis in the real economy for profit seeking and accumulation of finance capital in the last three decades, viz. the dominance of shareholder value, low wage policy combined with mortgage (re-) financing particularly in the us, the turn to fully funded pensions, and the rising foreign deficits and debt of the us. The paper next discusses new means of financial profit seeking, viz, credit derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds and the increasing use of leverage within the financial sector. In the final section, it is argued that the present crisis is essentially a crisis of overaccumulation of finance capital which has turned into a general economic crisis characterised by increasingly deficient demand.

This paper shows that optimal monetary policy under parameter uncertainty can motivate this pattern. If the central bank is uncertain about the slope of the Phillips curve and follows a min-max strategy to formulate policy, the interest rate reacts more strongly to inflation when inflation is further away from target. The reason is that the worst case the central bank takes into account is endogenous and depends on the inflation rate and the output gap. As inflation increases, the worst-case perception of the Phillips curve slope becomes larger, thus requiring a stronger interest rate adjustment. Empirical evidence supports this form of nonlinearity for post-1982 U.S. data.","Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, Licher Str 62, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",peter.tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,34,20,20,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The dynamics of our model admits a locally attracting stationary state P-1*, which is, in fact, a poverty trap, coexisting with another stationary state P-2* possessing saddle-point stability. Global dynamical analysis shows that, under some conditions on the parameters, if the initial values of the state variables are close enough to the coordinates of P-1*, then there exists a continuum of equilibrium trajectories approaching P-1* and one trajectory approaching P-2*. Therefore, our model exhibits global indeterminacy, since either P-1* or P-2* can be selected according to agent expectations. Moreover, we prove that conditions guaranteeing the attractivity of P-1* also imply the saddle-point stability of P-2*. However, when P-1* is not attractive, numerical simulations show the possible existence of one or two limit cycles: an attractive one surrounding P-1* and one endowed with a two-dimensional stable manifold surrounding P-2*.

This paper uses a large dataset on the population of Norway that allows us to precisely measure birth order effects on IQ. We find a strong and significant effect of birth order on IQ, and our results suggest that earlier born children have higher IQs. Our preferred estimates suggest differences between first-borns and second-borns of about one fifth of a standard deviation or approximately 3 IQ points. Despite these large average effects, birth order only explains about 3% of the within-family variance of IQ. When we control for birth endowments, the estimated birth order effects increase. Thus, our analysis suggests that birth order effects are not biologically determined. Also, there is no evidence that birth order effects occur because later-born children are more affected by family breakdown.

A unique firm-level dataset is constructed by combining two databases: the Annual Industrial Survey and the China GreenWatch Program Rating System. The empirical results obtained from a series of ordered probit models indicate that openness has a positive relation to corporate environmental performance in China. However, the two main market-opening strategies in China, exporting and attracting foreign investment, have different effects on environmental performance. The results reveal that foreign investment plays a substantial and positive role that can support the environmental spillovers in China. However, the effect of exporting is insignificant. The environmental pressure from foreign customers to improve Chinese firms' environmental performance presents a challenge. Our study indicates that China could make environmental quality improvements through increased international openness, as is likely the case for other developing countries.","[Bu, Maoliang; Liu, Zhibiao] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yanyan] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Southeast University - China,"Bu, ML (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",bumaoliang@hotmail.com; zbliu@nju.edu.cn; adamesky@gmail.com,"BU, Maoliang/B-3777-2008","BU, Maoliang/0000-0002-3290-4181; Gao, Yanyan/0000-0003-0326-504X",,,,,37,17,17,7,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2011,19.0,2,,,,,77,92,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2011.01236.x,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,745GS,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000289154500005,0

Debt-financed increases in spending facilitate self-insurance by bond holders and may crowd in private consumption. They also loosen the borrowing constraints faced by firms, thereby raising labour demand and possibly the real wage.

However, it has not been fully uncovered yet in a more systematic and practical manner possibly due to theoretical or methodological reasons. In this study, a structural approach with partial least squares is introduced to incorporate various functional constructs together determining the performance of innovation systems into an integrated path framework based on the extended framework of Romer's idea production function. By constructing a rich province-year panel dataset over the 10th five-year plan period of China, we use the novel analytical framework to detect and untangle the periodically operating state of China's regional innovation systems (RISs) in terms of the effectiveness of functional constructs shaping and influencing the innovation process. The examination results show that China's RISs perform well in terms of the performance of most functional constructs except for innovation linkage as well as innovation sophistication. With respect to the interactive effects between the contextual innovation environment and the innovation process, however, China's RISs perform poorly from the perspective of system thinking.

The findings show that macroeconomic uncertainty significantly influences stock market volatility. Although volatilities in inflation, the gold price and the oil price seem to play a role, it is found that volatility in short-term interest rates and exchange rates are the most important, suggesting that South African domestic financial markets are increasingly becoming interdependent.

Around 2002 the central government implemented another influential reform: the Tax-for-Fee reform. Using a unique two-year panel of village data from rural China covering more villages than the previous literature and spanning over these two reforms, our dual-goal in this paper is, first to evaluate the impact of village election on local governance, and second to examine the potential interplay between the Tax-for-Fee reform and the village election. We show empirically that village elections do bring about positive consequences, including the enhancement of public expenditure and the improvement in efficiency in public administration, through the check and balances provided by the villagers' representatives meetings. However, the improvement in administrative efficiency has been partly unexpectedly attenuated by the Tax-for-Fee reform. We argue that this conflict is possibly due to the Tax-for-Fee reform's tightening up the villages' budget and that with sticky administration costs, the reduction of administrative share in total expenditure has been weakened. Therefore the tax reform undermines the functioning of village democracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The incentive for technology licensing is stronger under decentralized unions. We identify circumstances under which the benefit from licensing creates a stronger incentive for innovation under decentralized unions. If the union's preference for employment is high, the benefit from licensing may create higher incentive for innovation under decentralized unions. However, if the union's preference for wage is high enough, the incentive for innovation is higher under a centralized union irrespective of licensing ex-post innovation. If the centralized union decides whether or not to supply workers to all firms, the possibility of higher innovation under decentralized unions increases. We further show that perfectly substitutable workers can be better off under decentralized unions if the labor productivity depends on the unionization structure, which occurs in our analysis when, e.g., licensing after innovation occurs only under decentralized unions or innovation (with no licensing) occurs only under a centralized union.

The essence of the model is a tension between two bads: that which arises from being relatively deprived at home, and that which arises from engaging in humiliating work away from home. Balancing between these two bads can give rise to an explicit, voluntary choice to engage in humiliating work. The paper identifies conditions under which a migrant will choose to engage in degrading work rather than being forced into it, to work abroad as a prostitute, say, rather than on a farm. The paper delineates the possible equilibria and finds that greater relative deprivation will make it more likely that the equilibrium outcome will be engagement in prostitution. It is shown that under well specified conditions, every individual will work as a prostitute, yet every individual would be better off working on a farm. Put differently, when specific conditions are satisfied, there is a possibility of a coordination failure: if individuals believe that everyone else will choose to be a prostitute, this belief will be self-fulfilling. In this case, all the individuals choose to engage in prostitution, which renders each of them worse off. The paper discusses various policy implications. It is shown that a policy intervention (a crackdown on migrants' engagement in prostitution), if implemented strictly, can increase everyone's welfare, but when the policy is implemented loosely, cracking down on prostitution will only reduce individuals' welfare without reducing their engagement in prostitution.

The paper first shows that Operation Twist and QE2 are similar in magnitude. It then identifies six significant, discrete announcements in the course of Operation Twist that could have had a major effect on financial markets and shows that four did have statistically significant effects. The cumulative effect of these six announcements on longer-term Treasury yields is highly statistically significant but moderate, amounting to about 15 basis points (bp). This estimate is consistent both with time-series analysis undertaken not long after the event and with the lower end of empirical estimates of Treasury supply effects in the literature. The effects of Operation Twist on long-term agency and corporate bond yields are also statistically significant but smaller, about 13 bp for agency securities and 2 to 4 bp for corporates. Thus, the effects of Operation Twist seem to diminish substantially as one moves from Treasury securities toward private sector credit instruments.","Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Swanson, ET (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.",,"Reichlin, Lucrezia/J-9024-2015",,,,,,29,139,160,0,26,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Welfare theories can predict either a positive or a negative impact of income inequality on subjective well-being and empirical research has found evidence of a positive, negative, or non-significant relation. This paper attempts to determine some of the possible causes of such empirical heterogeneity. Using a very large sample of world citizens we test the consistency of the effect of income inequality in predicting life satisfaction. We find that income inequality has a negative and significant effect on life satisfaction. This result is robust to changes of regressors and estimation choices and also persists across different income groups and across different types of countries. However, this relation is easily obscured or reversed by multicollinearity generated by the use of country and year fixed effects. This is particularly true if the number of data points for inequality is small, which is a common feature of cross-country or longitudinal studies.","Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Verme, P (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ S Cognetti de Martiis, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",paolo.verme@unito.it,"verme, paolo/P-5228-2019","verme, paolo/0000-0002-8754-1138",,,,,42,80,87,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In our model, regional governments lack commitment so their policy announcements must be credible, and redistribution between skilled and unskilled workers is bounded by informational constraints. In any given region, the welfare of all workers is increasing in the share of skilled workers, as after-tax incomes increase for both skilled and unskilled workers. When skilled workers are more geographically mobile than unskilled ones, the endogenous response of redistribution policy can induce regional agglomeration of skilled workers. We also find that the equilibrium features symmetry-breaking if migration costs are relatively low; and that worker mobility tends to amplify pre-existing welfare differences in income and welfare across regions.

We employ high-frequency five-minute intraday data on stock market index returns and four classes of EU and US macroeconomic announcements during 2004-07. We account for the difference of each announcement from its market expectation and we jointly model the volatility of the returns accounting for intraday movements and day-of-the-week effects.

We show that strong contemporaneous links across markets are present even after controlling for macroeconomic announcements.

We explore how introducing impure altruism into standard regulatory settings alters regulatory prescriptions. The optimal calibration of both quantitative controls and externality taxes is affected. It also leads to surprising results on the comparative performance of instruments. Under quantity-based regulation, welfare is increasing in the propensity for altruism in the population; under price-based regulation, the relationship is non-monotonic. Price-based regulation is preferred when the population is either predominantly altruistic or predominantly selfish; quantity-based regulation is preferred for cases in between.

First, in the global air transport market, routes between 1000 and 2000 km are identified as the fastest growing segment. Gravity model analysis reveals that there is potentially significant room for further growth from cross-border liberalization. Second, in the impact assessment of market liberalization in Northeast Asia, the effect of tripartite market liberalization of triangular routes that connect major cities in each of the three nations, Japan, South Korea and Mainland China, is analyzed. Simulation using a Cournot model with product differentiation shows that overall welfare gains would be achieved from tripartite liberalization. Air carriers' losses are overridden by an increase in consumer surplus. Such an arrangement by the three nations might eventually lead to an integrated environment in which airlines could evolve into a true multi-hub Northeast Asian air carriers.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Yamaguchi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",yamaguchi@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Applying time-series econometric techniques, we find the existence of long-run equilibrium relationships between IPO activities and selected macroeconomic variables. Stock market performance and volatility are shown to play the most important role in the timing of IPOs. The Fed funds rate and the 10 year US Treasury Bond (TB) yield play a comparable role in determining the amount of proceeds raised in the IPOs. There also exist different short-run dynamic adjustment mechanisms between IPOs and macroeconomic factors towards the long run equilibrium path and they are mostly completed within the period of 6 months to 1 year. The results have some useful implications for forecasting IPO activities.","[Bang Nam Jeon] Drexel Univ, Dept Econ & Int Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Anh L.

We posit a general class of dynamic games in which current policies affect the future distribution of political power, resulting in the following Faustian trade-off: if the current ruler chooses his preferred policy, he then sacrifices future political power; yet if he wants to preserve his future power, he must sacrifice his present policy objectives. The trade-off comes from the fact that the current political ruler/pivotal voter cannot uncouple the direct effect of his policy from its indirect effect on future power. A policy-endogenous (PE) equilibrium describes this endogenous transfer of power and the resulting evolution of policy and political power over time. We show that the Faustian trade-off in a PE equilibrium is decomposed into two basic rationales. The political preservation effect induces more tempered policy choices than if one's policy choice did not affect one's political fortunes. However, the reformation effect induces more aggressive policies in order to exploit the productivity gains from policies chosen by even more aggressive successors. We distinguish between political systems that give rise to monotone Faustian dynamics-political power that progressively evolves towards more fiscally liberal types of leaders-and cyclical Faustian dynamics-political power that oscillates between liberal and conservative types of leaders. In each case, we show that the Faustian trade-off moderates the choices of each type of leader.","[Bai, Jinhui H.; Lagunoff, Roger] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Bai, JH (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,58,27,27,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The asymmetry between consumption and production is emphasised, with production being concentrated and preceding consumption, but consumption being more generalised and causing production. A theory of economic growth through endogenous technological change and increasing trade is presented. Fiscal policies and regulation, with incomes policies, are required to manage the system to achieve full employment, with monetary policies accommodating demand for money.

It defines institutional and active labour market measures (ALMSs) as well as passive (unemployment benefits) labour market policies. Considering the fact that labour market is an open system, its function is influenced by many external and internal factors. Labour market answers the changes of the economic environment, therefore the decrease of general production volume, production exports and investment flows during the economic recession reduce vacancies and increase unemployment. It is claimed that the person, who lost his job, experiences financial shortage as well as faces the social - psychological problems, which often have to deal with the State devoted financial resources. The situation in the labour market is proposed to improve applying some different measures. The experience of some countries shows that there is a variety of labour market regulation and unemployment support measures, but the measures determined the positive effect on labour market in one countries not definitely appear as active in the other group of countries. It is argued that the labour market liberalization can create more opportunities to establish new working places, which would satisfy the needs of people who lost their job, and the changes would be beneficial for both employers and employees. Still, the labour market liberalization in the country is rather controversial. Although a lot of researchers and practitioners deal with the problems of labour market, still there is lack of an analysis on the effects of labour market measures. The paper generalizes the experience of labour market liberalization and the impact of labour market measures on unemployment in the country as well as in other foreign countries.","[Berzinskiene, Daiva; Juozaitiene, Liongina] Siauliai Univ, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Berzinskiene, D (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Architektu St 1, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",daiva.berzinskiene@ktu.lt; prodekanas@smf.su.lt,,,,,,,54,11,11,2,33,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Following the single-equation approach, both religious measures are found to decrease income significantly and income is found to affect religion negatively. However, these cross-effects become insignificant once the equations are estimated simultaneously.

The main implication of the results is that poor macroeconomic performance has detrimental effects to financial development, a variable that is important for affecting, (e.g., economic growth and income inequality). Therefore, low and stable inflation, and all that it encompasses, is a necessary first step to achieve a deeper and more active financial sector with all its attached benefits. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The testing of a wide range of functions is mandatory, in order to choose the ones that offer the possibility of predicting trends more accurately. In the current report, we introduce several functions and compare them on datasets concerning foreign trade of Romania over the 1996 to 2000 period. We conclude that some of the complexities of transitioning from a communist to a capitalist economy, as reflected in the foreign trade, are best captured by complex and logistic functions defined below. Furthermore, we describe a seasonal variation in the volume of trade, which may be characteristic for all transition economies in East-European countries.","[Boboila, Cristian] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Boboila, Cristea] Univ Craiova, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Craiova 200585, Romania",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of Craiova,"Boboila, C (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Karp Bldg,9th Floor,1 Blackfan Circle, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",boboila@fas.harvard.edu; boboila@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Yet the weakness in the labor market and its impact on retirement are often overlooked. If older job seekers have difficulty finding work, they may retire earlier than expected. The net effect of the current economic crisis on retirement is thus far from clear. In this paper, we use 30 years of data from the March Current Population Survey to estimate models relating retirement decisions to fluctuations in equity, housing, and labor markets. We find that workers age 62 to 69 are responsive to the unemployment rate and to long-run fluctuations in stock market returns. Less-educated workers are more sensitive to labor market conditions and more-educated workers are more sensitive to stock market conditions. We find no evidence that workers age 55 to 61 respond to these fluctuations or that workers at any age respond to fluctuating housing markets. On net, we predict that the increase in retirement attributable to the rising unemployment rate will be almost 50 percent larger than the decrease in retirement brought about by the stock market crash.","[Coile, Courtney C.; Levine, Phillip B.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Coile, CC (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",ccoile@wellesley.edu; plevine@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,30,62,71,0,20,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Paradoxically, it is also a little known variable, especially in the long term. Historians have never devoted a synthesis to the subject and, among all the economists who have centred their work on the study of economic growth, Hoffmann (1965) is the only one to have addressed aggregate earnings over a long period. This article follows up his founding work and has two objectives. The first is to measure the movement of wages and wage earners over a long period and use this to make an original estimate of aggregate employment earnings in Germany from 1810 to 1989. Reconstituted sets of statistics are also used to put forward new hypotheses concerning the way is which wages, wage earners and aggregate employment earnings in Germany are linked to the socioeconomic development of the country in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is also sought to detect the temporary and permanent shocks that have affected the German economy since the beginning of the 19th century. Our reflection is in two parts. The first defines the concept of wages, sets out the spatial scope and describes the methodological constraints. The second describes our cliometric results.","[Demeulemeester, Jean-Luc; Diebolt, Claude; Jaoul-Grammare, Magali] Univ Strasbourg, BETA CNRS, Fac Sci Econ & Gest, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Diebolt, C (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA CNRS, Fac Sci Econ & Gest, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",cdiebolt@cournot.u-strasbg.fr,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

SC is defined as an indicator of the similarity between a given sectoral structure and another, which is admitted as a referential. Consequently, the paper is organized as follows. The first chapter is consecrated to computational formulas applicable to the estimation of such a measure. Ten possible algorithms are examined and five are retained as adequate for empirical investigations. The second chapter discusses, by using WB Statistics for the World Economy, two important questions concerning the structural coefficient (SC): Is SC an authentic numeraire? and Can SC be rather considered as an attractor?. The paper inclines towards the second supposition. In the third chapter, on the famous binomial sectoral structure-economic growth, comments based on analytical valences of the structural coefficient (SC) are provided. With this aim, the Toda-Yamamoto version of Granger causality test is applied. Several conclusions and further research lines end the paper.

It allows for one or more sectors to operate more than one technology simultaneously, with the relatively lowest-cost one supplemented by others if it encounters a binding factor constraint. The RCOT model solves for sector outputs, goods prices that are set by the highest-cost technologies in use, and scarcity rents that correspond to binding factor constraints experienced by the lower-cost technologies. The model is motivated by the fact that mineral deposits of different qualities may be exploited simultaneously, as may primary and recycled sources for the same materials or irrigated and rain-fed techniques for producing the same crop. RCOT generalizes Carter's square choice-of-technology model, in particular adding the factor constraints that allow several alternatives to operate simultaneously.

Standard models fail to replicate the behavior of imports and exports, though they can match net exports relatively well. Inspired by the fact that a large fraction of international trade is in durable goods, we propose a two-country two-sector model in which durable goods are traded across countries. Our model can match the business cycle statistics on the volatility and comovement of the imports and exports relatively well. The model is able to match many dimensions of the data, which suggests that trade in durable goods may be an important element in open-economy macro models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We pay attention to the situation of international goods markets' integration and attempt to clarify why the deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are common across countries. To summarize our main results, global price dispersion of the Big Mac did not decrease although per capita income dispersion reduced. On the other hand, price dispersions of the Big Mac decreased within countries where trade ties are strong. These results suggest that Big Mac prices of countries in the world converge to several levels and that existence of trading bloc accounts for deviations from absolute Big Mac parity to some extent.","Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan",,"Fukumoto, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",fukumoto@osaka-ue.ac.jp,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The theory predicts a very strong (explosive) effect of even small toeholds. While asymmetric toeholds do have an effect on bids and revenues in the lab, which gets stronger the larger the asymmetry, it is not nearly as strong as predicted. We explain this by analyzing the flatness of the payoff functions, which leads to large deviations from the equilibrium strategies being relatively costless. This is a general fundamental weakness of this type of explosive equilibria, which makes them fail when human players are involved. Our analysis shows that a levels of reasoning model explains the results better where this equilibrium fails. Moreover, we find that although big toeholds can be effective in a takeover battle, the cost to acquire them might be higher than the strategic benefit they bring.

Through comparison of the responses from the 2004 and 2010 surveys, changes in the business and management of Russian companies are examined. The perceived abilities to perform particular stages of innovation projects have significantly increased and Russian companies successfully use contractors for various types of innovation activity. However, the intensity of innovations remains low and the resources that can be utilised to create innovations at Russian CEOs' disposal remain limited as few actual innovation projects satisfy the criteria imposed by Russian owners to improve the overall profitability of the firm. The owner's criteria for evaluating innovation effectiveness particularly impede radical product innovations and breakthrough innovations in production technologies. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between the perception of innovative capabilities by CEOs and the intensity of innovations proved to be a valuable research construct and this suggests that comparative study of innovation capabilities of firms in emerging and developed economies would be a profitable extension of this research.","Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Gurkov, I (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",gurkov@list.ru,"Gurkov, Igor/H-1501-2015","Gurkov, Igor/0000-0001-8116-0425",,,,,7,11,11,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2011,23.0,4,,,,,507,516,,10.1080/14631377.2011.622572,0.0,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,883HL,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000299624800006,0

We applied new break tests and tested for nonlinearity in the cointegrating relation with post World War II data for 15 countries. Our empirical results support cointegration, after accounting for breaks, and a linear Fisher relation in the long run.

It traces interpretations of European policy-makers about the sources and costs that these two human-induced insecurities incur on Europe's societies and identifies the rationalities underlying the respective perceptions and policy actions. The analysis reveals that there are different logics at work that guide the economics of security: path dependency, reactive logics, emotions, integration dynamics and institutional interests, external pressures and more recently also considerations about the potential effects on the European economy. However, the EU's attempts to model cost scenarios still remain underdeveloped.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Peace Res & Secur Policy, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Heller, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Peace Res & Secur Policy, Beim Schlump 83, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany.",heller@ifsh.de,,,,,,,91,2,2,2,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

We also construct a combined measure of core inflation estimates on the basis of their reliabilities. Empirical evidence shows that the new measures demonstrate marked improvement in their eligibility to serve as core inflation estimators. Furthermore, the combined measure is shown to perform best. It appears that the conventional core measures such as the retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX) and the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation series are not successful in capturing the underlying trend of inflation, casting some doubt on their current use in the making of monetary policy decisions.","[Huh, Hyeon-Seung] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Chunchon, South Korea",Yonsei University; Kangwon National University,"Huh, HS (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 134 Sinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",hshuh@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One of the important key in facility management is the space management.

From the analysis of the facility management definition, space management aspects to be highlight as one of the essential aspects in the facilities management that should be given as a priority. However, awareness among people regarding to vital of space management are less. Waste of space is still applicable in any organization especially in higher education institutions.

Such a finding has important policy implications since it suggests that recessions have both short-term effects (on employment, income) and long-term effects (on productivity).

Quantitative and qualitative researches expanded the cognizance of PR effectiveness evaluation and made it more accurate. Based on the results of the researches, clear and adaptable corpus of evaluation criteria was suggested that ensures the adequacy of projected PR effectiveness evaluation solutions to the situation in question. Through the study of direct experience, the list of criteria for all stages of PR effectiveness evaluation was expanded and an additional stage of interim evaluation was identified. Evaluation criteria were grouped in line with the consistency of PR effectiveness evaluation process, defined by input, implementation, interim evaluation and impact evaluation stages. Results of the researches are presented following the same order of sequence. Criteria for the evaluation of PR objectives are suggested based on hierarchical levels of objectives, while distinguishing between evaluation criteria for tasks, target audiences and action plan. In PR implementation stage, the following criteria are presented: simplicity, informativeness, veracity, ethicality and novelty of communication message, purpose-centrality of information provided, attractiveness of the media and attractiveness of message presentation. When discussing the PR impact, criteria for the evaluation of different PR results - outputs, outtakes and outcomes - are presented.

We generalize the MDH model to accommodate both informed and uninformed trading effects on return volatility. Using a Fourier filtering technique, we uncover the salient long-run dependence of information flow from high-frequency data with a relative short time span. The positive relationship between volatility and volume is primarily driven by the informed component of trading. We find a negative correlation between uninformed volume and volatility. Uninformed trading seems to add depth and liquidity to the market and therefore reduces volatility.","[Li, Jinliang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wu, Chunchi] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Management, Jacobs Management Ctr 335 A, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",Tsinghua University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Li, JL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",lijinliang@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023",,,,,,11,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

As oil industry has a great role in Iran's economy, the interviewers chosen are the managers and key executives of three Iranian oil companies. The results of this study show that by using the training activities and knowledge sharing with the enhancement of leadership development, the organizational effectiveness would enhance. In addition, six training activities are introduced as the most important methods in this study. These activities are Case study, Role play, Action learning, 360 degree feedback, Job rotation, and Job assessment. Highlighting the importance of the issue may encourage the other researchers to work on different aspects of the study.

Service work is also associated with a higher probability of transitioning into bad health and possibly with a lower probability of recovery. These findings suggest that blue-collar and service workers wear out faster with age because they are more likely than their white-collar counterparts to experience negative health shocks.

In this respect, the country has experienced a variant of the transition which occurred in the former Soviet Union where relative female wages fell by more than female participation. We have used the Machado and Mata (2005) analysis of the gender gap distribution. This reveals that the effect of coefficients on observed characteristics in widening the gap was increasing over time, especially in the lower and middle deciles of the wage distribution. At the same time, the effect of the characteristics themselves in reducing the gap was shrinking. The decomposition of changes in the gap over time, based on Juhn et al. (1991), confirms that the contraction of women's relative wages has been caused both by a deterioration in the observed characteristics of female workers and by the associated remuneration. Changes in the residual wage distribution tend to slightly reduce the gap rather than, as is the case elsewhere, to increase it. The analysis carried out in line with Neuman and Oaxaca (2004) suggests that the increased gap was not caused by sample selection. Instead, two observed factors are found to be mainly responsible for the results: hours of work have increased for men more than for women and women have experienced segregation in low-wage industries.","[Pastore, Francesco] Univ Naples 2, Naples, Italy; [Verashchagina, Alina] Sapienza Univ Roma, Rome, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Sapienza University Rome,"Pastore, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Naples, Italy.",fpastore@unina.it; alinaver@gmail.com,"Pastore, Francesco/I-4950-2019; Pastore, Francesco/B-1481-2012","Pastore, Francesco/0000-0002-8156-1453; Pastore, Francesco/0000-0002-8156-1453",,,,,37,25,26,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Knowing how customers perceive their services, what they considered important and what factors guide and influence their behaviour, is crucial for the success of travel agencies. They need to understand the underlying dimensions of customer attitudes and satisfaction and how to improve them. Travel agencies are forced to search for new ways to differentiate themselves and gain a better competitive position in order to improve their service perceptions and customer loyalty. Developing a successful strategy thus requires knowledge of the attributes that consumers use to evaluate services in tourism. Valid and reliable measures of perceived value would allow individual travel agencies the ability to identify the dimensions of perceived value in which they perform well or poor. The paper presents partial findings of the research focused on customer satisfaction in tourism conducted by the Department of Marketing in 2009-2010. It examines the relationship between customers and travel agencies as well as the impact of customers' demographics (age and income in particular) on their perceptions and attitudes towards services offered by travel agencies by applying multi-attribute model that has been used also in brand image studies.","[Simova, Jozefina] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Liberec 46001, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,jozefina.simova@tul.cz,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-755-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,411,418,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BYT98,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000300261200044,0

The focus of this paper concerns the intellectual assumptions on which previous regulatory approaches have largely been built, both in the UK and in a number of other countries. We examine the analysis provided by the UK's Turner Review (2009) which follows the market failure approach to regulation and we contrast this with the alternative state failure approach. Both approaches only offer partial and polarised views into the causes of the crisis. We offer a synthesis and argue that a new conceptual approach to the management of financial markets is required. The essence of this new approach is the recognition that the state and regulation are not external to the market. While this paper largely relates to the UK, it provides potentially important lessons for many other countries.","[Slattery, David; Nellis, Joseph G.] Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Slattery, D (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",david.slattery1@ntlworld.com; j.g.nellis@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,12,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2011,58.0,3,,,,,407,423,,10.2298/PAN1103407S,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,834YP,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-08,WOS:000296000700008,0

A comparison of the results indicates that a positive and significant coefficient estimate of the EU dummy variable is found for both the pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) estimator and the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) estimator. The results, however, diverge once fixed effects are admitted into the model. The least squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator suggests a small positive effect of EU integration on trade. In contrast, the dynamic LSDV estimator indicates that regional integration has a larger beneficial effect on trade.

The main findings of the paper are the bimodality of income density distribution over time and across countries, the lack of convergence at a single point in time and the presence of convergence clubs in the income distribution from 1995 to 2008. They suggest the lack of absolute convergence on long term (1995-2008), and also when looking only from 2003 onwards.

In consequence the emphasis was put on description and comparison between different methods of reliability assessment such as: test-rest, parallel-test, split-half or internal consistency. The author investigated them primarily in context of psychometrics and its general applications in the area of marketing and customers research studies. In the second part of article, a new perspective on the measurement (Item Response Theory - IRT) was discussed. Later on, both concepts of measurement CTM and IRT were compared. Although researchers in the field of psychometrics have paid a considerable attention to measurement theory, in another field (e.g. marketing) these topics somehow have been neglected. And the recent advances in statistical analysis have drawn increasing attention to these nagging problems of measurement. Therefore in the article the author decided to review and stress the great importance of various concepts in reliability measurement. The author hopes that for researchers in the above field who wish to familiarize themselves with current debates over the right choice of an appropriate measurement design and strategies, it will be a good starting point for their own research and reliability estimation, especially when making a decision on how to develop an appropriate scale for measurement and choose for that scale respective estimate reliability. As a result, the description will be useful for managers, marketers, who want to study reliability and problems associated with scales construction to study customers behavior or market trends and those who want to attempt integrate measurement theory into their aggregate models of the business.","Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Mkt Res, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Tarka, P (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Mkt Res, Poznan, Poland.",,,"Tarka, Piotr/0000-0002-3178-7366",,,,,59,0,1,0,9,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Generally, countries with relatively low GDP per capita should catch-up with richer ones and this has become the main objective of post-communist countries at the beginning of the transition process. However, when we look at the regional level and regional GDP per capita data in these countries one can assume that the intensity of real convergence strongly differs among regions and disparities between regions still prevail. The paper attempts to identify factors responsible for persistence of regional disparities in the Visegrad Four countries. In the paper, available Eurostat NUTS 3 statistical data were used for analysis of economic disparities development in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The paper has two main parts. In the first theoretical part approaches to regional disparities and their measurement on the basis of indexes are provided. The second, empirical, part contains description of the main trends in regional development of Visegrad Four countries. This is followed by comparison of these trends in the Visegrad Four regions. Calculations suggested conclusion that the regional disparities between regions are growing.","[Tvrdon, Michal] Silesian Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business Adm, Karvina, Czech Republic; [Skokan, Karel] VSB Tech Univ, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Tvrdon, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business Adm, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina, Czech Republic.",tvrdon@opf.slu.cz; karel.skokan@vsb.cz,"Tvrdon, Michal/J-4806-2012","Tvrdon, Michal/0000-0001-9029-883X",,,,,31,37,37,0,30,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-8619,,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

To address this problem, the present study constructs a phased model of one mother equation, from which a series of equations of financial mathematics are derived as a response to several needs of credit beneficiaries. This solution seeks to strengthen the bank-customer relationship to have the following effects: a greater number of credits granted on behalf of banks, an increase of investments and also an increase in savings, as Keynes points out when asserting that all savings become investments. The proposed model consists of one scenario, based on a mother equation. Scenario corresponds to credits with reduction or increase in payment instalments, postponable payment periods. Of the mother equation, 10 explicative variables are solved for a total of 11 phasing formulas for credits with 3 levels of payment. Finally, a numerical example for illustration is provided.","[Valencia-DeLara, Pilar] Univ Castilla La Mancha Spain, Castile La Mancha, Spain; [Ramirez-Ceballos, Alberto] ID Int Decis Ltd, London, England",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Valencia-DeLara, P (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha Spain, Castile La Mancha, Spain.",,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,2,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

To address this question, we show how alternative specifications of news affect the equilibrium by deriving the mapping between news shocks and the endogenous variables in a simple analytical model. News shocks are shown to add moving average (MA) components to endogenous variables. We then show how the additional MA components affect equilibrium dynamics. We generalize two popular forms of news processes to demonstrate how information flows impact equilibrium dynamics. To compare these news processes, we establish conditions under which the two processes have identical information content. We find that allowing news shocks to be correlated across time generates hump-shaped impulse response functions and helps mitigate the comovement problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We use structural decomposition analysis (SDA) with chained constant price input-output tables and environmental extensions. We construct three sets of constant-price data using a smoothing algorithm to remove random variations from the data, and find that the results of the SDA are relatively robust to these variations. The production of exports was responsible for around 70% of the growth in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2002, household consumption of domestically produced products for about 15%, government 10%, with the remainder due to gross capital formation. The dominance of exports in the emissions growth may make future greenhouse gas mitigation challenging in Norway, particularly considering that the exports are dominated by oil and gas production.","[Peters, Glen P.] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Yamakawa, Asuka] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Peters, GP (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo CICERO, Oslo, Norway.",glen.peters@cicero.uio.no,"Peters, Glen P/B-1012-2008","Peters, Glen P/0000-0001-7889-8568",,,,,29,51,56,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Population ageing will tend to lower both labour-force participation and savings rates, thereby raising concerns about a future slowing of economic growth. Our calculations suggest that OECD countries are likely to see modest-but not catastrophic-declines in the rate of economic growth. However, behavioural responses (including greater female labour-force participation) and policy reforms (including an increase in the legal age of retirement) can mitigate the economic consequences of an older population. In most non-OECD countries, declining fertility rates will cause labour-force-to-population ratios to rise as the shrinking share of young people will more than offset the skewing of adults towards the older ages. These factors suggest that population ageing will not significantly impede the pace of economic growth in developing countries.","[Bloom, David E.; Canning, David; Fink, Guenther] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Consumption is modelled as an activity, combining time and commodities, and embedded in the environment. An economic interpretation for a structural shortage of time in consumption activities is suggested. It is also shown, that the environmental embeddedness of consumption can contribute to restoring more balanced proportions of time and commodities in consumption. In a dynamic setting the paper also discusses the effects of discounting on consumption, the use of time and the environment. It is found that, within a certain range of the rate of discount, a 'discounting trap' may arise, significantly depressing the level of environmental quality in the long-run equilibrium.","Univ Trieste, Dept Econ, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Cogoy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dept Econ, Piazzale Europa 1, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",mario.cogoy@econ.units.it,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We carry out experiments for two-stage games, where R&D investment choices are followed by product market competition. An increase in the number of firms from two to four reduces investments, whereas a switch from Cournot to Bertrand increases investments, even though theory predicts a negative effect in the four-player case. The results arise both in treatments in which both stages are implemented and in treatments in which only one stage is implemented.

Our findings show that households that rent extra land are relatively more productive, but contradict results of earlier studies which found that tenure status of plots affects the level of land investments. We further find that off-farm employment does not significantly affect rice yields. This result contradicts those of earlier studies which found that the negative lost-labor effect of off-farm employment dominates the positive income effect. Another novel finding is that people working locally off-farm tend to switch from green manure planting towards the use of organic manure on their rice plots. We conclude that policies that will further stimulate the development of land rental markets, which is still in its infancy, can contribute significantly to higher rice production in Southeast China.

We introduce a new formal model of social production, called a Group-based Meritocracy Mechanism (GBM), which extends the single-group-level analysis of a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM) to multiple groups. In a GBM individuals are ranked according to their group contributions. Based on this ranking, participants are then partitioned into equal-sized groups. Members of each group share their collective output equally amongst themselves according to a VCM payoff function. The GBM has two pure-strategy Nash equilibria. One is non-contribution by all; this equilibrium thus coincides with the VCM's equilibrium. The second equilibrium is close to Pareto optimal. It is asymmetric and quite complex from the viewpoint of experimental subjects, yet subjects tacitly coordinate this equilibrium reliably and precisely. Extensions of the basic GBM model to incorporate various features of naturally occurring group formation are suggested in the conclusion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The reasons for this are partly due to fundamental problems with the underlying General Equilibrium theory and partly to the unrealistic assumptions on which most financial models are based. What is common to the two is that systematic warnings over more than a century in the case of finance and over 30 years in the case of equilibrium theory have been ignored and we have persisted with models which are both unsound theoretically and incompatible with the data. It is suggested that we drop the unrealistic individual basis for aggregate behaviour and the even more unreasonable assumption that the aggregate behaves like such a 'rational' individual. We should rather analyse the economy as a complex adaptive system, and take the network structure that governs interaction into account. Models that do this, of which two examples are given, unlike standard macroeconomic models, may at least enable us to envisage major 'phase transitions' in the economy even if we are unlikely to be able to forecast the timing of their onset.

Ignoring positive (negative) leisure externalities leads to equilibrium consumption, labor and capital that are too high (low) and leisure that is too low (high). The government should tax (subsidize) labor income according to whether the leisure externality is positive or negative. The level of this tax (subsidy) depends on the elasticity of individual and average leisure and the consumption tax. Equilibrium dynamics are characterized, and two shocks to the economy are analyzed - an increase in the growth rate of labor productivity, and an increase in the tax on labor income - by simulating a calibrated economy.

The effects critically depend on the rate at which labor productivity changes with age. For a high (low) rate, the externality lowers (raises) the steady state propensity to consume out of total wealth. The optimal allocation can be decentralized by a (reverse) unfunded social security system if the rate of labor productivity decline is high (low). In contrast to discrete time OLG models, the optimal steady state capital income tax is zero, in spite of the externality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals meet pairwise and exchange information, which is modeled as both individuals adopting the average of their pre-meeting beliefs. Forceful agents influence the beliefs of (some of) the other individuals they meet, but do not change their own opinions. We characterize how the presence of forceful agents interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even forceful agents obtain some information from others, we first show that all beliefs converge to a stochastic consensus. Our main results quantify the extent of misinformation by providing bounds or exact results on the gap between the consensus value and the benchmark without forceful agents (where there is efficient information aggregation). The worst outcomes obtain when there are several forceful agents who update their beliefs only on the basis of information from individuals that have been influenced by them. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A government consists of a subset of the individuals in the society. The competence level of the government in office determines collective utilities (e.g., by determining the amount and quality of public goods), and each individual derives additional utility from being part of the government (e.g., rents from holding office). We characterize the dynamic evolution of governments and determine the structure of stable governments, which arise and persist in equilibrium. In our model, perfect democracy, where current members of the government do not have veto power over changes in governments, always leads to the emergence of the most competent government. However, any deviation from perfect democracy, to any regime with incumbency veto power, destroys this result. There is always at least one other, less competent government that is also stable and can persist forever, and even the least competent government can persist forever in office. We also show that there is a nonmonotonic relationship between the degree of incumbency veto power and the quality of government. In contrast, in the presence of stochastic shocks or changes in the environment, a regime with less incumbency veto power has greater flexibility and greater probability that high-competence governments will come to power. This result suggests that a particular advantage of democratic regimes (with a limited number of veto players) may be their greater adaptability to changes rather than their performance under given conditions. Finally, we show that royalty-like dictatorships may be more successful than junta-like dictatorships because in these regimes veto players are less afraid of change.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Egorov, Georgy] Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; [Sonin, Konstantin] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University; New Economic School,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014; Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951",,,,,45,45,55,3,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The longer than usual span of the data allows us to obtain more robust results on the fulfilment of the intertemporal budget constraint than most of the previous analyses. Two additional robustness checks are provided. First, we investigate the possibility of structural changes occurring along the period analyzed, using the new approach of Kejriwal and Perron (2008, 2010) to testing for multiple structural changes in cointegrated regression models. Second, we investigate whether the behaviour of fiscal authorities has been non-linear, by means of the procedure of Hansen and Seo (2002) based on a threshold cointegration model. Our results show that (i) the government deficit has been strongly sustainable in the long run, (ii) no evidence is found on any significant structural break throughout the whole period, and (iii) fiscal sustainability has been attained due to the non-linear behaviour of fiscal authorities, which have only acted on the budget deficit when it has exceeded around 4.5% of GDP.","[Bajo-Rubio, Oscar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Derecho & Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Esteve, Vicente] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Esteve, Vicente] Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Valencia; Universidad de la Laguna,"Bajo-Rubio, O (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Derecho & Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, Ronda Toledo S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",oscar.bajo@uclm.es; carmen.diazroldan@uclm.es; vicente.esteve@uv.es,"DIAZ-ROLDAN, CARMEN/AAF-2944-2019; Bajo-Rubio, Oscar/K-3811-2014; Esteve, Vicente/B-1507-2010; Esteve, Vicente/K-4428-2014; DIAZ-ROLDAN, CARMEN/K-6050-2014","DIAZ-ROLDAN, CARMEN/0000-0002-1932-6487; Bajo-Rubio, Oscar/0000-0003-2728-312X; Esteve, Vicente/0000-0003-3308-4995; DIAZ-ROLDAN, CARMEN/0000-0002-1932-6487",,,,,36,20,25,0,7,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,,,J APPL ECON,J.

Our estimation strategy controls for a large set of possible factors influencing cross-country GDP correlation, which allows a comparison of our results with those found in previous studies. We find that bilateral trade, trade similarity, monetary and fiscal convergence, as well as EMU membership lead to more synchronized cycles. Our results show that labor market regulations affect the extent of business cycle synchronization. Disparities in employment protection laws and direct taxation tend to lower international comovement while divergence in union density, unemployment benefits, and indirect taxation enhance cross-country correlations.

Moreover, results demonstrate the necessity of contractual arrangements that guarantee flexibility without exposing trading partners to the risks of opportunism. A separate analysis of contract enforceability through brokers reveals that farmer's age, whether a buyer is a trader, information access and trader-specific investment have a significant positive impact while family size, frequency of transactions, dependency on the trader, duration of the relationship and distance to the trader have a significant negative impact on contract enforceability through brokers. Furthermore, pooled multinomial Logit regression analysis show that traders' non-compliance to contractual obligations are mainly due to the risks related to perishability, seasonality, illiteracy and his type.

With the Asian experience in mind, the aim of this paper is to analyze whether overinvestment due to easy liquidity conditions possibly emerged and contributed to the crisis in CEE.","Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Hoffmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",ahoffmann@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,59,22,23,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0026-1386,,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2010,61.0,4,,,,,711,734,,10.1111/j.1467-999X.2010.04103.x,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,664QH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000282976600009,0

To assess their quantitative impact, we develop a general equilibrium model of fertility and labor market decisions that builds on the labor matching framework of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). We find that females gain substantially with generous policies but this benefit occurs at the expense of a reduction in the welfare of males. Leave policies have important effects on fertility, leave taking decisions, and employment. These effects are mainly driven by how the policy affects bargaining - young females anticipate future states with higher threat points induced by the policy. Because the realization of these states depends on the decisions of females to give birth and take a leave, leave policies effectively subsidize fertility and leave taking. We also find that generous paid parental leaves can be an effective tool to encourage mothers to spend time with their children after giving birth. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

At the non-cooperative equilibrium, the tax level in the high-productivity country is inefficiently high while it is inefficiently low in the other country. A different conclusion emerges when tax revenues are recycled in a public good provision: taxes are inefficiently low in both countries and public good spillovers increase the global welfare.

This issue is particularly important in the housing market, since a number of housing and neighborhood features are unobserved by the econometrician. This paper proposes the use of a well defined type of transaction costs-moving costs generated by property tax laws-to deal with this type of omitted variable bias. California's Proposition 13 property tax law is the source of variation in transaction costs used in the empirical analysis. Beyond its fiscal consequences, Proposition 13 created a lock-in effect on housing choice because of the implicit tax break enjoyed by homeowners living in the same house for a long time. Its importance to homeowners is estimated from a natural experiment created by two amendments that allow households headed by an individual over the age of 55 to transfer the implicit tax benefit to a new home. Indeed, 55-year old homeowners have 25% higher moving rates than those of comparable 54 year olds. These transaction costs from the property tax laws are then incorporated into a household sorting model. The key insight is that because of the property tax laws, different potential buyers may have different user costs for the same house. The exogenous property tax component of this user cost is then used as an instrumental variable. I find that MWTP estimates for housing characteristics are approximately 100% upward biased when the choice model does not account for the price endogeneity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A structural model of inflation is developed and used which combines two different models of price setting behavior: the sticky price model of the New Keynesian literature and the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis. In a framework similar to the Calvo model, I assume that there are two types of firms. One type of firm chooses its prices optimally through forward-looking behavior as assumed in the sticky price model. It uses all available information when deciding on prices. The other type of firm sets its prices under the constraint that the information it uses is sticky as assumed in the sticky information model. It collects and processes the information necessary to choose its optimal prices with a delay. This leads to the sticky price-sticky information (SP/SI) Phillips curve that nests the standard sticky price and sticky information models. Estimations of this structural model show that both sticky price and sticky information models are statistically and quantitatively important for price setting. However, the sticky price firms makeup the majority of the firms in the economy. The results are robust to alternative sub-samples and estimation methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper connects the two disparate phenomena using the notion of real options. It visualizes firms as nodes and the links connecting them as call options that give each pair of interlinked firms the right, but not the obligation, to sink additional resources into a project at some future date conditional on favorable technical/market information. The formation of networks is endogenous as firms establish links with others by appraising their value using option pricing methods. Our model explains the following: why networks are particularly ubiquitous in industries that are subject to high uncertainty; why networks often display an interconnected hubs and spokes architecture; why small (or peripheral spoke) firms often sink resources into relatively higher risk higher return investment projects (and those too with only large. or hub firms); and why so many research alliances are continuously formed and dissolved.

Until now, empirical research on economic growth has found mixed evidence on the influence of civil liberties. Disaggregation of the Freedom House Civil Liberties Index allows a fresh empirical look at the effect of human rights on long-term growth or economic development. Our results show that one of the four subcategories of the index outperforms all available indicators of property rights institutions in explaining long-term economic growth. This subcategory, Personal Autonomy and Individual Rights, captures the level of second generation human rights that affect the mobility of individuals with respect to housing, employment and university education, as well as the level of protection of property rights. This result is robust with respect to reverse causation, important omitted variables such as geography and human capital, as well as to a variety of sensitivity tests. We also discuss in our conceptual framework how civil liberties work as an indicator of the prevalence of the rule of law and how the latter affects growth or development as an essential public input.","[Benyishay, Ariel] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Benyishay, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",benyishay@econ.umd.edu; betancou@econ.umd.edu,,,,,,,32,26,28,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Along with other changes, the reform imposed lifetime time limits for receipt of cash welfare, effectively ending its entitlement nature for these families. Despite dire predictions, previous research has shown that program caseloads declined and employment increased, with no detectible increase in poverty or worsening of child well-being. We reevaluate these results in light of the severe 2007-09 recession. In particular, we examine how welfare reform has altered the cyclicality of the response of caseloads and family well-being. We find that use of food stamps and noncash safety net program participation have become significantly more responsive to the economic cycle after welfare reform, rising more when unemployment increases. By contrast, we find no evidence that cash welfare for families with children is more responsive, and some evidence that it might be less so. We find some evidence that poverty increases more with increases in the unemployment rate after reform, and none that it increases less. We find no significant effects of reform on the cyclical responsiveness of food consumption, food insecurity, health insurance, household crowding, or health.","[Bitler, Marianne P.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Hoynes, Hilary W.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Bitler, MP (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.",,,,,,,,75,57,73,0,22,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Our analysis is based on an applied OLG model of a small open economy with heterogeneous agents featuring a two-pillar pension system modelled after that in the Netherlands (with pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and funded tiers). We explore two policies to avoid underfunding of the pension funds. One emphasizes increases in the contribution rate, while the other emphasizes the reduction of indexation of pensions to price inflation and productivity growth. Our stochastic simulations show that the welfare differences between the two types of policy are generally small. They also show that the pension buffers are highly volatile when the shocks are drawn from realistically modelled multivariate shock processes. Underfunding occurs relatively frequently and in any case substantially more than anticipated by the Dutch supervisor.

Significant nonstationarity and the presence of unit roots were documented for each currency under both study periods. Using ASEAN-4 exchange rates against the Singapore dollar, the Johansen cointegration test showed that there was no cointegrating relationship during the pre-crisis period. However there were two statistically significant cointegrating vectors among ASEAN exchange rates for the post-crisis period. These findings imply that there is low financial integration before the crisis, but that ASEAN countries are financially more integrated after the crisis. This finding also indicates increasingly role of the Singapore dollar in ASEAN. Therefore, the Singapore dollar may be a possible candidate as the common currency for ASEAN. The analysis is repeated by adding the US dollar to the model. The finding ascertains the influence of the US dollar on ASEAN currencies before the crisis.","[Chin, Lee; Azali, M.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Chin, L (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",leechin@putra.upm.edu.my,"Lee, Chin/AAR-5222-2020; MOHAMED, AZALI/ABA-2000-2021","Lee, Chin/0000-0002-8651-2204;",,,,,26,7,7,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The Great Depression followed. The second-worst struck in the fall of 2008 and the Great Recession followed. Commentators have dwelt endlessly on the causes of these and other deep financial collapses. This article pursues modern answers to a different question: why does output and employment collapse after a financial crisis and remain at low levels for several or many years after the crisis. It focuses on events in the United States since 2008. Existing macroeconomic models account successfully for the immediate effects of a financial crisis on output and employment. I will lay out a simple macro model that captures the most important features of modern models and show that realistic increases in financial frictions that occurred in the crisis of late 2008 will generate declines in real GDP and employment of the magnitude that occurred. But this model cannot explain why GDP and employment failed to recover once the financial crisis subsided-the model implies a recovery as soon as financial frictions return to normal.

Allowing for store coverage turns out to have a very significant impact on the estimated structural parameters and on the predictive power of the model. Taking these estimated structural parameters we perform a counterfactual whereby stores carry all products in the market.

To do this, we rely on data from 14 distribution companies between 1996 and 2006. The results indicate that the incentives generated by the reform process led to the firms becoming more efficient. Moreover, the time trend and private management of the distribution companies are variables that positively affect the levels of efficiency, whereas the lower network densities are then the greater the inefficiency.

This study estimates the long-run growth rates, that is, the steady growth paths of the regional economies based on current education subsidies, and explores their effect on human capital accumulation, namely in terms of economic growth while considering the increase in education subsidies. Because greater government subsidies in education induce individuals to invest in human capital, both regions achieve higher economic growth. Moreover, because of the large differences in productivity between the regions, the growth gap widens with evenly raised education subsidy rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find support for this hypothesis in experiments on a new search problem, the Explore-and-Collect Problem, where the player collects utility from an option every time it is tried and options can be recalled. Although the optimal search effort in this problem is much smaller than for the Secretary Problem, people tend to search only marginally less.

Using data on rural Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) we find that low density, high cost markets decrease the ability of the telecommunication service providers to offer DSL, but other factors also play a role. Demand for broadband has become more inelastic over time, marginal increases in speed alone have lost their appeal to customers, and the inclusion of video in a broadband package improves broadband take rates and willingness to pay. Small income elasticities reinforce our finding that broadband has become a necessity. Our analysis shows that price subsidies may not be effective in providing a large boost in demand, but policies that lower the cost of providing video may stimulate broadband adoption indirectly if the savings lead to more affordable bundled communications multimedia packages that users want.","[Glass, Victor; Stefanova, Stela K.] Natl Exchange Carrier Assoc Inc, Whippany, NJ 07981 USA",,"Glass, V (通讯作者)，Natl Exchange Carrier Assoc Inc, 80 S Jefferson Rd, Whippany, NJ 07981 USA.",vglass@neca.org,,,,,,,33,22,32,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We apply Hafner and Herwartz [2006, Journal of International Money and Finance 25, 719-740] Volatility Impulse Response Function (VIRF) to quantify the impact of shock on expected conditional volatility. We observe that a shock has a high positive impact only if its size is large compared to the current level of volatility. The impact of shocks are usually not persistent, which may be a consequence of the non-storability of power. Finally, we estimate the density of the VIRF at different forecast horizons. These fitted distributions are asymmetric and show that large increases in expected conditional volatilities are possible even if their probability is low. These results have interesting implications for market participants whose risk management policy depends on option prices which themselves depend on the characteristics of volatility.

Our results show that oil companies adjust diesel prices upwards faster than they adjust them downwards, and the difference is statistically significant. However we find no statistical evidence for an asymmetry in the adjustment of petrol prices even though the magnitude of estimated coefficients suggests a faster response to rising prices. As diesel pricing is not as competitive as petrol pricing, calls for further government actions and monitoring of the oil market may be justified. Our findings also have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy as the pass-through of crude oil price changes can affect cost-push inflation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our first finding is that cement producers had a considerable amount of market power at the period prior to the first investigation in 1997. In addition, this study shows that, parallel to our initial expectation, competition in the cement market increased thanks to the investigations. The positive effect of the first investigation is found to be especially significant.

We find that the residual ITN displays, unlike the original one, marked signatures of a complex system, and is characterized by a very different topological architecture. Whereas the original ITN is geographically clustered and organized around a few large-sized hubs, the residual ITN displays many small-sized but trade-oriented countries that, independently of their geographical position, either play the role of local hubs or attract large and rich countries in relatively complex trade-interaction patterns.","StAnna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",,"Fagiolo, G (通讯作者)，StAnna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021; Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022","Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352;",,,,,66,112,119,4,68,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

( 2007), this study employs risk biographies to evaluate how three ex-Yugoslav pension systems cope with the social exclusion of the elderly. The article simulates pension entitlements in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia and comes to two broad conclusions. First, the three pension systems that originated from a common legislative base, albeit in countries with marked differences in economic development, now diverge in almost every aspect. Hence, further research should analyse the entire retirement microcosm of the former Yugoslavia and delve deeper into the mechanisms of pension system evolution. Second, the study expounds the pros and cons of the three schemes and argues that none can avoid further reforms. Slovenian public pensions are excessively generous and consequently require fiscal cuts, the Croatian funded tier is too small to complement lower public benefits, and the Serbian arrangements should be a temporary sacrifice to cope with fiscal austerity. The paper complements a traditional overview of the three systems by analysing the problems of each risk biography. It concludes by giving a number of prescriptive recommendations for the future well-being of the elderly in the region.","European Univ Inst, Max Weber Programme, Acad Careers Observ, I-50014 Fiesole, Fi, Italy",European University Institute,"Guardiancich, I (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Max Weber Programme, Acad Careers Observ, Via Fontanelle 10, I-50014 Fiesole, Fi, Italy.",igor.guardiancich@eui.eu,,"Guardiancich, Igor/0000-0002-9255-0725",,,,,24,3,3,0,12,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However, a choice-based elicitation procedure, where participants choose between a gamble and its expected value, yields individual decisions that are indistinguishable from random choice. Sensitivity to elicitation procedure holds between and within participants, and remains when participants are allowed to review and change decisions. The price elicitation procedure is more complex; this finding may be further evidence that an increase in cognitive load exacerbates behavioural anomalies.","[Harbaugh, William T. .] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Harbaugh, William T. .] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Krause, Kate] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Vesterlund, Lise] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University of Oregon; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of New Mexico; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Harbaugh, WT (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,"Harbaugh, William/A-8743-2008","Harbaugh, William/0000-0002-4127-3983",,,,,34,62,73,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

We argue in favour of fitting a parametric functional form to the income distribution for each year, and then modeling the time series of model parameters in terms of the macroeconomic factors, as this better allows us to take into account non-stationarity in the time series. Estimates from models that relate income distribution parameters to cyclical variables in first differences (to account for non-stationarity) suggest that neither inflation nor unemployment have significant effects on income inequality. Compared to the commonly-used method of modelling the income shares directly, our approach indicates that there was no clear cut relationship between macroeconomic factors and the UK income distribution during the last third of the twentieth century.","[Jantti, Markus] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Jenkins, Stephen P.] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Stockholm University; University of Essex,"Jäntti, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",markus.jantti@sofi.su.se; stephenj@essex.ac.uk,,"Jenkins, Stephen/0000-0002-8305-9774; Jantti, Markus/0000-0001-6075-6553",ESRC [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,35,38,0,20,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Similarly to electricity markets, a salient characteristic of CO2 allowances is that the theory of storage does not hold, as CO2 allowances only exist on the balance sheets of companies regulated by the scheme. The main result features positive time-varying risk premia in CO2 spot and futures prices, which are strictly higher for post-2012 contracts ((sic)6-9/ton of CO2) than for Phase II contracts ((sic)0-6/ton of CO2). Contrary to Benth et al.'s (2008) for electricity markets, a positive relationship between risk premia and time-to-maturity is found in the EU ETS. As for relative differences between CO2 futures and spot prices, CO2 futures traded between +1% (December 2008 contract) and +33% (December 2014 contract) above spot prices during February 2008-April 2009. Contrary to Bessembinder and Lemmon (2002) for the electricity market, a positive relationship between risk premia and the variance/skewness of CO2 spot prices is found. The futures-spot bias to the EU ETS explains around 1-6% of the variance of CO2 futures premia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the euro's impact on financial integration is primarily driven by eliminating the currency risk. Legislative-regulatory convergence has also contributed to the spur of cross-border financial transactions.

This paper focuses on institutional contexts without such a mediator. Contributors privately informed on their willingness to pay non-cooperatively offer contribution schedules to an agent who produces the public good on their behalf. In any separating and informative equilibrium of this common agency game under asymmetric information, instead of reducing marginal contributions to free-ride on others, principals do so to screen the agent's endogenous private information obtained from privately observing other principals' offers. Under weak conditions, the existence of a differentiable equilibrium is shown. Equilibria are always ex post inefficient and interim efficient if and only if the type distribution has a linear inverse hazard rate. This points to the major inefficiency of contribution games under asymmetric information and stands in contrast to the more positive efficiency result that the common agency literature has unveiled when assuming complete information. Extensions of the model address direct contracting between principals, the existence of pooling uninformative equilibria, and the robustness of our findings to the possibility that principals entertain more complex communication with their agent.","[Martimort, David] Toulouse Sch Econ, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Toulouse, France; [Moreira, Humberto] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Grad Sch Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Martimort, D (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Toulouse, France.",martimor@cict.fr; humberto.moreira@fgv.br,,,,,,,60,22,24,0,20,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Similarly and actually more systematically, the business economist, Michael Porter, has developed a cluster theory, linking trade (or production) theory to economic geography. This paper extends Porter's cluster theory, which is domestically oriented, to an international context, i.e., international clusters of neighboring countries, and applies this new concept to a possible international cluster in Northeast Asia, including Korea, Japan, China, and Russia. It is often said that Korea is sandwiched between Japan and China. However, economic or business relationships are not zero-sum games. This paper proves that the relationship in this region is more cooperative than competitive. The relationship among the Northeast Asian countries is not just economic, but also cultural. For this purpose, we also consider cultural dimensions in order to enhance the competitiveness of the region, as well as that of the individual countries. The paper goes over some case studies of selected industries and also conducts statistical analysis. The results of this study will provide useful implications for different perspectives: from domestic to international clusters; from competition to cooperation; and from trade to cooperative production and business.","[Jung, Jin-Sup] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Business, Cheongju, South Korea; [Moon, Hwy-Chang] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 151, South Korea",Chungbuk National University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Jung, JS (通讯作者)，Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Business, Cheongju, South Korea.",cmoon@snu.ac.kr; jsjung@chungbuk.ac.kr,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,19,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We show that an efficient entrant may have incentives to target low demand after entry in order to convince the regulator that it needs cheap access in the future. Therefore, the regulator must set access prices, contingent on demand, which penalize the inefficient entrant. We further show that, although linear prices are not always sufficient to promote the investment of an efficient entrant without introducing distortions, two-part tariffs already allow the regulator to achieve this objective.

The effects are generally called rebound effects in the literature. Previous studies have extensively focused on only part of the global economy to study rebound effects, e.g. energy consumption by households, one industry, or one country. However, since the global economy is highly connected among countries, these studies may lead to misleading conclusions if the rebound effects in the rest of the economy are significant. Recently Saunders (2008) analyzes the demand side by taking the global economy as a whole. Wei (2007) also provides a general analysis by using Cobb-Douglas production functions for the global economy. The present article expands Wei (2007) general analysis to explore the rebound effects from an economist's viewpoint by taking the global economy as a whole and applying general forms of production functions. The analysis provides new insights related to rebound effects: we highlight the role of energy supply as a determinant of rebound. We show that the substitution between energy resources and other productive resources is more relevant to long term rebound. We predict that long term rebound may be lower than short term rebound. And we also discover that super-conservation can happen in both the short term and the long term. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM.

In the health care arena, time preferences may be an especially important determinant of many decisions-particularly the use of preventative health care. One potential barrier to patient adoption of preventative screening regimens is that they impose current costs on consumers with the hope of lower costs in the future. Using data from a national survey, we jointly estimate latent discount rate and preventative service demand models using a limited information maximum likelihood estimator (iterated M-estimator).

In contrast to previous studies, a microfoundation of the model leads this uncertainty to generate uncertainty not only about the transmission of monetary policy but also about the transmission of shocks and about a social welfare loss function. In the presence of such uncertainty, this paper finds conditions under which optimal discretionary policy responds to shocks more aggressively than in the absence of the uncertainty. These conditions depend crucially on the persistence of shocks and the magnitude of policy multipliers. To obtain the conditions, taking proper account of uncertainty about the transmission of shocks and about the welfare loss function is of crucial importance.","Bank Japan, Tokyo 1038660, Japan",Bank of Japan,"Kurozumi, T (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Tokyo 1038660, Japan.",takushi.kurozumi@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, what is the pecuniary impact of labor immobility on interregional wage inequality? To answer this question, we derive a simple wage gap equation including educational attainment, market potential and provincial border indicators. The regressions based on city and sector-level data show that, other things being equal, the wage dispersions within Chinese provincial borders are significantly less pronounced than those among provinces. Such border effects on spatial wage differentials, which have been shown to pervasively exist in all sectors considered in the present paper, reflect the distortions generated by migration controls. Finally, we show that despite the recent hukou reforms aimed at relaxing the restrictions on population movement, border effects appear to persisted over the period 2003-2005.","Univ Paris Est, Lab ERUDITE, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Li, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, Lab ERUDITE, Paris, France.",licheng_du@hotmail.com,,,,,,,21,4,4,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,APR,2010,18.0,2,,,,,60,72,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01189.x,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,569WR,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000275634000004,0

Following this line of thought a number of recent papers have reported a positive impact of alcohol consumption on earnings. The rationale for the existence of such a relationship is the positive impact of alcohol on physical and mental health. We conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether such factors as: the estimation technique, the presence of ex-drinkers in the sample, possible sample selection bias and publication bias may all contribute to these findings. An additional suggestion for the positive relationship between alcohol and wages is the presence of a common set of personality traits that determines drinking behaviour and also leads to higher earnings. We examine this relationship by reviewing the literature that investigates if the personality influencing aspects of alcohol consumption influences measures of human capital. We also survey the significant body of research that has examined how alcohol consumption has been found to influence educational outcomes and the work force participation of problem drinkers.","[Lye, Jenny; Hirschberg, Joe] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Lye, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"Hirschberg, Joe/E-3309-2019","Hirschberg, Joe/0000-0001-8354-5433; Lye, Jenny/0000-0002-5938-9095",,,,,73,19,22,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Problems arrive randomly anywhere in this network and must find their way to their respective specialized solvers by relying on local information alone. The organization handles multiple problems simultaneously. For this reason, the process may be subject to congestion. We provide a characterization of the threshold of collapse of the network and of the stock of floating problems (or average delay) that prevails below that threshold. We build upon this characterization to address a design problem: the determination of what kind of network architecture optimizes performance for any given problem arrival rate. We conclude that, for low arrival rates, the optimal network is very polarized (i.e. star-like or centralized), whereas it is largely homogenous (or decentralized) for high arrival rates. These observations are in line with a common transformation experienced by information-intensive organizations as their work flow has risen in recent years.","[Vega-Redondo, Fernando] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] Inst Valenciano Invest Econ, Valencia, Spain; [Arenas, Alex] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Engn Informat & Matemat, Tarragona, Spain; [Cabrales, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Danon, Leon; Diaz-Guilera, Albert] Univ Barcelona, Dept Fis Fonamental, Barcelona, Spain; [Guimera, Roger] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL USA",European University Institute; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Barcelona; Northwestern University,"Vega-Redondo, F (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy.",aarenas@etse.urv.es; acabrale@eco.uc3m.es; leon.danon@gmail.com; albert.diaz@ub.edu; rguimera@northwestern.edu; fernando.vega@eui.eu,"Guimera, Roger/M-9808-2019; Cabrales, Antonio/AAC-1805-2020; Danon, Leon/J-6324-2012; Danon, Leon/AFV-8758-2022; Diaz-Guilera, Albert/A-5218-2009; Arenas, Alex/A-5216-2009","Guimera, Roger/0000-0002-3597-4310; Cabrales, Antonio/0000-0003-0209-0399; Danon, Leon/0000-0002-7076-1871; Danon, Leon/0000-0002-7076-1871; Diaz-Guilera, Albert/0000-0002-3114-0984; Arenas, Alex/0000-0003-0937-0334",,,,,34,9,11,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

In view of the region's economic diversity, we propose a graduated program of informal policy cooperation from weak forms of cooperation to more intensive modes of cooperation such as the adoption of common monetary policy objectives. An array of informal monetary arrangements rooted to the degree of institutional development can improve the effectiveness of both sovereign and regional institutions, and promote integration in East Asia. Drawing upon the European experience with the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), we conclude that East Asia should first embark on other forms of integration to aid in the development of a high degree of real and nominal convergence amongst the regional countries. Only then would an ERM-type system that employs a regional monetary unit become more sustainable and less susceptible to speculative currency attacks in the region.","[Chow, Hwee Kwan; Kriz, Peter Nicholas; Mariano, Roberto S.; Tan, Augustine H.

Because of modelling uncertainty, it is essential that policy evaluations be robust to alternative assumptions. We find that models currently being used in practice to evaluate fiscal policy stimulus proposals are not robust. Government spending multipliers in an alternative empirically estimated and widely cited new Keynesian model are much smaller than in these old Keynesian models; the estimated stimulus is extremely small with GDP and employment effects only one-sixth as large and with private sector employment impacts likely to be even smaller. We investigate the sensitivity of our findings with regard to the response of monetary policy, the zero bound on nominal interest rates and the inclusion of an empirically relevant degree of rule-of-thumb behaviour in the new Keynesian model. In addition, we relate our findings using estimated structural macroeconomic models to the recent literature using reduced-form regression techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study contributes to this literature by reporting results from a laboratory experiment. The experiment is designed to test whether nonmonetary sanctions or rewards alone can yield the optimal level of efficiency in a game with Pareto-ranked equilibria. Performance based disapproval and approval ratings, assigned by group members, are used as proxies for nonmonetary sanction and reward, respectively. Although these ratings are costless and payoff neutral, results show that expression of disapproval facilitates coordination on the most efficient equilibrium. In contrast, statement of approval induces subjects to converge towards the most inefficient outcome. We conclude that induced approval and disapproval ratings have asymmetric behavioral effects on coordination. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Agents can choose from among multiple potentially cooperative actions or can take a secure, self-interested action. We assume that a proportion of the cooperative actions prove effective, while others can be undermined by a predatory action. For this class of games, the set of stable equilibria is identical under the two learning rules. However, we show that the basins of attraction for the efficient equilibria are much larger for cultural learning. We further show that as the stakes grow arbitrarily large, cultural learning always locates an efficient equilibrium while belief-based learning never does. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Global increases have been attributed to income growth in the developing world, diversion of farm products from food to industrial usage, speculation in commodity markets, and energy price increases.

On the one hand, would-be revolutionaries confront a participation problem, whereby no rationally self-interested individual has an incentive to participate in rebellion. On the other hand, individuals face a first-mover problem whereby no rationally self-interested individual has an incentive to lead rebellion. This paper argues that 18th-century merchant sailors who confronted these problems devised a novel institution to facilitate maritime revolution and assist them in overthrowing abusive captains. This institution was called a Round Robin. Round Robins helped overcome both the participation and first-mover problems by aligning the interests of individual sailors desiring mutiny and restructuring the payoffs of leading versus following maritime rebellion.

Surprisingly, these differences are greatest among highly educated and salary paid workers, and persists even after conditioning for demographic characteristics. I explain these differences with two within occupation characteristics. First, relative to natives, immigrants are less likely to supply long work weeks if they work in occupations where the immigrant-native earnings differential is big. Second, immigrants are also less likely to supply long work weeks when they work in occupations with a wide dispersion of earnings. This second result is important, because the occupation dispersion of earnings has been used to characterize changes of the worker's earnings over the worker life cycle (Bell and Freeman, Labour Economics: 8(2), 2001a; Working Time in Comparative Perspective, 2001b; Kuhn and Lozano, Journal of Labor Economics: 26(2), 311-344, 2008), and a good measure of the incentives to supply long hours of work.","Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"Lozano, FA (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",fernando.lozano@pomona.edu,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The model is applied to a US database of heating oil and natural gas futures prices over the period February 2000-February 2009. We find the long-run slope and level relationships between natural gas and heating oil markets, analyze the lead and lag properties between the two energy commodities, the volatilities and correlations between their daily co-movements and evaluate the robustness of these observations to the turmoil experienced by energy markets since 2003.

Theoretically, the effect of labour income risk on consumption changes is decomposed into an aggregate and into an idiosyncratic part. Empirically, aggregate risk is modelled through a GARCH process on aggregate labour income shocks and individual risk is modelled as an unobserved component and obtained through Kalman filtering. Our results Suggest that aggregate labour income Fisk explains a negligible fraction of the variance of aggregate consumption changes. A more important part of aggregate consumption changes is explained by the unobserved component. The interpretation of this component as reflecting idiosyncratic tabour income Fisk is supported by the finding that it is negatively affected by received consumer transfers. Idiosyncratic labour income risk thus matters for the aggregate economy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

EVIDENCE FROM SUBPRIME LOANS,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION; SALES; DECISIONS; DYNAMICS; SECTOR; BANKS,"A central question surrounding the current subprime crisis is whether the securitization process reduced the incentives of financial intermediaries to carefully screen borrowers. We examine this issue empirically using data on securitized subprime mortgage loan contracts in the United States. We exploit a specific rule of thumb in the lending market to generate exogenous variation in the ease of securitization and compare the composition and performance of lenders' portfolios around the ad hoc threshold. Conditional on being securitized, the portfolio with greater ease of securitization defaults by around 10%-25% more than a similar risk profile group with a lesser ease of securitization. We conduct additional analyses to rule out differential selection by market participants around the threshold and lenders employing an optimal screening cutoff unrelated to securitization as alternative explanations. The results are confined to loans where intermediaries' screening effort may be relevant and soft information about borrowers determines their creditworthiness. Our findings suggest that existing securitization practices did adversely affect the screening incentives of subprime lenders.","Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; London Business Sch, London, England",University of Chicago; University of London; London Business School,,benjamin.j.keys@frb.gov; tmukherjee@sorincapital.com; amit.seru@chicagogsb.edu; vvig@london.edu,"Vig, Vikrant/G-6932-2014",,,,,,54,606,755,3,170,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

The existence of territorial differentiation of basic food prices indicates a heterogeneous regional distribution of inflationary pressures. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between the dynamics of basic food goods prices and the average net nominal salary for NUTS 3 level. Furthermore we examined the correlation between regional disparities of consumers' incomes and food prices.

J,"Ajakaiye, O; Ncube, M",,,,"Ajakaiye, Olu; Ncube, Mthuli",,,Infrastructure and Economic Development in Africa: An Overview,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Biannual Workshop of the African-Economic-Research-Consortium,"DEC, 2007","Dar Es Salaam, TANZANIA",African Econ Res Consortium,,F01; O10; G20,,"Evidence abounds to support the view that economy of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been growing in recent times, but there is considerable concern that the growth has not been accompanied by economic transformation. The lack of economic transformation is traceable to low level of investment in transformation activities especially raw material processing industries occasioned, at least in part, by the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has the highest cost of doing business in the world with cost of infrastructure services making up a disproportionately large part of production and trade costs. This is a reflection of serious deficit in the three dimensions of infrastructure, namely quality, quantity and access. Against this background, it was considered topical to devote the plenary session of December 2007 to the issue of infrastructure and economic development in Africa. This volume, therefore, contains the three papers presented at that plenary session. The first paper by Cesar Calderon and Luis Serven on infrastructure and economic development in SSA focused on analysing the linkages between infrastructure and economic development pointing out that the literature on effects of infrastructure on economic development is inconclusive. Noting that physical infrastructures are rarely homogenous and analysing a large panel data for 136 countries, they found that infrastructure development is associated with both higher growth and lower inequality. They also found that while infrastructure made a large contribution to reducing inequality in East and South Asia, the impact was relatively modest in SSA due to poor quality of infrastructure. They concluded that corruption adversely affect impact of infrastructure on productivity and growth stressing, among other things, the importance of independent regulation agencies in offsetting some of the consequences of corruption on infrastructural services. Kennedy K. Mbekeani, in the second paper, presented a review of international experience in infrastructure, trade expansion and regional integration and lessons for Africa. Delving into the relationships between trade, infrastructure and regional expansion, he asserted that improvements in productivity lead to increased trade and can foster regional integration through improved intra-regional trade and industrial relocation. There is persuasive evidence that adequate infrastructure provision is a key requirement for trade liberalisation to achieve its intended objective of efficient resource reallocation and export growth. The paper concluded by providing a summary of some Africa's infrastructure programmes that have the potential to lead to trade expansion and regional integration. Finally, the paper by Mthuli Ncube on financing and managing infrastructure in Africa presents arguments on the relationship between infrastructure investments and economic growth in Africa. Infrastructure encompasses transport, telecommunications, water and sanitation, power and gas, and major water works, and also focuses on quantity versus quality of infrastructure. Ncube also found that, in the literature, the causal nexus between infrastructure capital and economic growth and development, in general, has been ambiguous. However, it does seem one thing is clear, namely that sustainable high economic growth often occurs in an environment where there is a meaningful infrastructure development, although it is not obvious which leads the other. The paper presents the various financing strategies, around Public-Private partnerships (PPPs) and examples of PPP-type arrangement in Africa. Ncube concluded the paper by exploring policy implications of the state of infrastructure and economic growth in Africa.","[Ajakaiye, Olu] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ncube, Mthuli] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC); University of Witwatersrand,"Ajakaiye, O (通讯作者)，African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,,3,16,16,3,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,,,J AFR ECON,J.

An additional $4,000 per year for the poorest households increases educational attainment by one year at age 21, and reduces the chances of committing a minor crime by 22 percent for 16 and 17 year olds. Our evidence suggests improved parental quality is a likely mechanism for the change.","[Akee, Randall K.

The theory considers 'macro' conditions under which an authority group chooses genocide and 'micro' conditions that facilitate the spread of genocide. From the macro perspective, a bargaining model highlights four rational explanations for an authority's choice of genocide: prevention of loss of power, indivisibility, elimination of a persistent rival, and political bias. From the micro perspective, an evolutionary game model shows how supporters of genocide gain the upper hand in group dynamics over resisters and bystanders. The theory and application suggest that the conditions for genocide are not exceptional.","Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Anderton, CH (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",canderto@holycross.edu,,,,,,,77,7,7,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This procedure differs from the maximum likelihood simply because simulated probabilities are inserted into the Log-Likelihood (LL) function. The LL function to be maximized is the sum of the logarithm of the expected choice probabilities; since the logarithmic operation is a nonlinear transformation bias is then introduced. The simulation bias depends on the number of draws that are used in the simulation and on the sample size. Although the asymptotic properties of the MSL estimator are well known, the question is how simulation bias affects parameters estimation and therefore the main outcomes of choice models (for instance value of travel time and market shares). In this paper, we estimate explicitly the simulation bias in mixed logit parameter estimation, using Taylor expansion and we correct the log-likelihood objective function during the maximization process. The method is developed in the context of Monte Carlo simulation. We report significant error reduction on the final objective value but also on the optimal parameters. The method could be extended to randomized quasi-Monte Carlo techniques as long as standard deviations of simulated choice probabilities are calculated. Computation costs can be neglected when using Monte Carlo draws and even when advanced strategies such as adaptive sampling methodology are in use.","[Bastin, Fabian] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Cirillo, Cinzia] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Universite de Montreal; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Bastin, F (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",bastin@iro.umontreal.ca; ccirillo@umd.edu,,"Cirillo, Cinzia/0000-0002-5167-0413",NSERC,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We would like to thank the four anonymous reviewers, whose comments helped to improve this paper.

Unless the income tax rate is too high, the increase in total public funds is associated, in the long run, with higher net mobility, a larger fraction of the skilled workers and higher levels of wealth of all the dynasties. In addition, the reallocation of public expenditures from basic to advanced education can result in lower mobility, a lower long-run size of the skilled workforce, and a lower long-run level of wealth held by rich dynasties, if the transfer of resources comes at the expense of excessively lowering the quality of education at the basic schooling level.","[Ben Mimoun, Mohamed; Raies, Asma] Univ Paris 01, TEAM, F-75231 Paris 05, France",,"Ben Mimoun, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, TEAM, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Mohamed.Benmimoun@malix.univ-paris1.fr,"Ben Mimoun, Mohamed/GQH-8879-2022","Ben Mimoun, Mohamed/0000-0001-5146-4057",,,,,32,1,3,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Since the role of government is needed to change in this global era, the so-called government-size debate has become fierce. This article provides a measure of relative government size in globalization, and clarifies the welfare effect of relative government size in globalization applying a simplified dynamic utility theoretical approach. The main finding is that there is no systematic relationship between relative government size and relative welfare in globalization; such relation depends on behavioural parameters such as the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution of consumption and the disutility of labour. This result suggests that finding prerequisites for government consumption to play a welfare-improving role in globalization is more beneficial than the government-size debate.","Hansung Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul 136792, South Korea",Hansung University,"Choi, YY (通讯作者)，Hansung Univ, Dept Int Trade, 3-389 SamSun Dong, Seoul 136792, South Korea.",yychoi8@unitel.co.kr,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The methodological assumptions and measurement methods of the changing economic policy options are first discussed. The empirical research results confirm the thesis that transformations which occur in the farming sector should be viewed against the background of changes in the macroeconomic environment. It is noticed that, in spite of numerous attempts made in many countries to find more effective methods of stimulating the agricultural development, interventionism remains one of the key mechanisms of exerting influence. Convergences in the directions of economic policy and agricultural policy did not remove existing disproportions in the size of retransfers to the agriculture. Hence the significance of structural differentiations in agriculture and of the macroeconomic situation is maintained. The paper also shows the nature of such changes in the macroeconomic environment, particularly in the labour market and the money market, which can be favourable for stable growth and development of agriculture.","[Czyzewski, Andrzej] Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Makroekon & Gospodarki Zywnosciowej, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, A (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Ekon Poznaniu, Katedra Makroekon & Gospodarki Zywnosciowej, Poznan, Poland.",kmigz@ue.poznan.pl; piotrkulyk@wp.pl,"Kułyk, Piotr/E-1583-2019","Kułyk, Piotr/0000-0003-2786-4020",,,,,32,11,11,0,9,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2010,,2,,,,,189,214,,,,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,610KA,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000278730200004,0

However, the extent to which major trading powers have reduced their imports has differed by trading partner. Like financial contagion, could it be the case that countries that are better integrated in the global trading system via efficient trade facilitation environment suffered the most because of their interconnectedness? Using recent data from the US census bureau, this study finds that the efficiency of the trade facilitation environment actually helped to mitigate the effects of the global slump in demand. Other countries with a better trade facilitation environment suffered less of a drop in their exports to the United States compared to those with a weaker trade facilitation environment.

In our contribution we present a mathematical optimization model describing the additional expenses spent in order to reduce these (usually negative) impacts. The model considers conditions separated into several categories as standard EIA assumes; some of them depending on technical assumptions, other are based on (abstract) utility terms. Moreover, we search for possible uncertainty sources in model parameters and make suggestions how to deal with them. The resulting stochastic programming model is presented; the different models is constructed with a specific example of line construction (highway) in mind.","[Houda, Michal] Univ S Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Econ Fac, Dept Appl Math & Informat, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,,houda@ef.jcu.cz; houda@ef.jcu.cz,"Houda, Michal/D-8708-2016","Houda, Michal/0000-0002-2825-2846",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,"UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,CESKE BUDEJOVICE, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZ-370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-218-2,,,,2010,,,,,,,262,267,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS47,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287979900045,0

The desirable feature of an inequality measure is its decomposability by income sources and by subpopulations. It is known that the indices based on entropy can be decomposed simply into within-group and between-group components, while the Gini concentration index is decomposable only into the sum of the inequality within groups and the inequality between groups, plus a crossover term that takes into account the overlapping across subpopulations. The presence of the third component resulted in interpretational difficulties and induced some scholars to reject the Gini coefficient as a decomposable inequality measure. On the other hand, the crossover term can be treated as an advantage of the Gini index and can be used to complete the inequality analysis by subgroups. In the paper the selected decomposition methods were discussed and then applied to the analysis of income distribution in Poland. The aim of the analysis was to verify to what extent the inequality in different subgroups (and different income sources) contributes to the overall income inequality in Poland. To provide the decomposition of the Gini index by subgroups the population of households was partitioned into several socio-economic groups on the basis of the exclusive or primary source of maintenance. Moreover, the households were divided by economic regions using the Eurostat classification units NUTS I. To complete the analysis the Gini index decomposition by factor components was conducted. This helped to find out which sources of household income have a significant influence on income inequality in Poland.","Univ Lodz, Inst Econ & Stat, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Jedrzejczak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Inst Econ & Stat, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",,"Jędrzejczak, Alina/KBA-3996-2024","Jedrzejczak, Alina/0000-0002-5478-9284",,,,,17,6,6,1,8,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We consider the roles of barriers to migration and immigration amnesties in greater depth and, in particular, we examine the rich country's optimal policies. Encouraging self-selection is optimal under some, but not all, circumstances, because there are mixes of potential immigrants for which the cost of welfare migration is more than offset by the gains from productive workers enticed by a more lenient immigration policy. Furthermore, under plausible assumptions, the rich country's optimum may require a probabilistic rather than a certain amnesty to fine-tune the mix of migrants. Numerical examples illustrate that probabilistic or certain amnesties, addressed to different partitions of the migrant population, are each optimal as the mix of potential migrants changes.","[Karlson, Stephen H.; Katz, Eliakim] No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Karlson, SH (通讯作者)，No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",skarlson@niu.edu,,,,,,,14,1,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using the pooled mean group estimator of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999) for unbalanced panel data for 87 countries over the 1960-2005 period, our empirical results indicate that long-run complementarity between financial development and trade openness coexists with short-run substitutionarity between the two policy variables. But when splitting the data into OECD and non-OECD country groups, this finding can be observed only in non-OECD countries. For OECD countries, financial development has negligible effects on trade. In addition, we find nonlinearity in the relationship in that long-run responses of trade decrease with financial development.

In many cases, the professional's financial interests are at odds with those of the client. We explore this problem in the context of personal bankruptcy. OLS, fixed effects, and IV estimates all show that attorneys play a central role in determining whether households file under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. We present evidence suggesting that some attorneys maximize profits by steering households into Chapter 13 bankruptcy even when the households' objective financial benefits are low and the probability of case dismissal is high.

Burning coconut oil as a fuel is a relatively low-valued end use for the coconut. The labour intensiveness of copra production presents an intractable cost frontier that renders coconut bio-fuel projects uneconomic in most parts of the Pacific. Consequently, those communities that have managed to access alternative markets are unlikely to be attracted back to copra. While copra farmers in low-wage locations in remote Melanesia and Micronesia could benefit from local consumption of coconut bio-fuels, there is a need to explore alternative policies to reduce the Pacific's dependence on imported oil, electrify rural areas and increase rural incomes.","Secretariat Pacific Community, Noumea, New Caledonia",,"Martyn, T (通讯作者)，Secretariat Pacific Community, Noumea, New Caledonia.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,6,ASIA PACIFIC PRESS,CANBERRA,"AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIV, CRAWFORD SCH ECONOMICS & GOVERNMENT, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA",0817-8038,,,PAC ECON BULL,Pac.

It finds that a mixed strategy equilibrium game explains NFL play calling better than standard optimization techniques. When a quarterback is injured and replaced with a less capable backup, standard optimization theory suggests that the offense will run more often, passing less. Our game theoretic model predicts that the offense will not change its play calling because the defense will play against the run more often. Using every first half play from the 11 teams that had a starting quarterback miss action because of injury in the 2006 season, we find that the injury did not alter the likelihood that the offense would pass. We also find that coaches randomly mix passing and running plays, as the mixed strategy games predict.","[McGarrity, Joseph P.] UCA, Dept Econ, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Linnen, Brian] Werner Enterprises, Omaha, NE 68138 USA",,"McGarrity, JP (通讯作者)，UCA, Dept Econ, 304 BBA, Conway, AR 72035 USA.",joem@uca.edu; ml03001@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,10,14,0,13,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

To measure those losses, I use the concept of the proportionate opportunity cost along with various Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility functions. Two sets of asset returns are used with a Vector Autoregressive process for generating joint returns distributions: the original historical asset returns data set and the historical asset returns with extreme values exaggerated. In each case, 1000 alternative sets of assets, including one with a risk-free nominal return, are randomly made available for investment. I show that the optimal portfolio strategy with the short-selling constraint performs almost as well as the unconstrained portfolio strategy for investors with medium and high levels of risk aversion. The results, derived from the original historical asset returns data set, show that investors' welfare losses reach 12.8% of initial wealth when risk aversion is low and reach 13.5% of initial wealth with extreme returns exaggerated. The results in both cases indicate that less risk-averse investors experience greater welfare losses and that the short-selling constraint reduces the cost of sub-optimal diversification.","Western Illinois Univ, Coll Business & Technol, Macomb, IL 61455 USA",Western Illinois University,"Melkumian, AA (通讯作者)，Western Illinois Univ, Coll Business & Technol, 1 Univ Circle, Macomb, IL 61455 USA.",aa-melkumian@wiu.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The income is understood as net income, either from employment or from social benefits. The income disparities were quantified by several measurments. They included Gini coefficient which described inequality of the income distribution. Later, pyramids of income distribution were studied. These showed objective development of income through time.

On the other hand, while the amplitudes of booms and recessions are similar, their lengths differ. Applying the intuition developed in Ball and Mankiw to our model indicates that firms raise prices less frequently during recessions but more frequently during booms, so price-setters respond to booms more quickly.","[Sen, Tinni] Virginia Mil Inst, Dept Econ & Business, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Conlon, John R.] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Sen, T (通讯作者)，Virginia Mil Inst, Dept Econ & Business, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",sensb@vmi.edu; jrconlon@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,5,BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS,BERKELEY,"2809 TELEGRAPH AVENUE, STE 202, BERKELEY, CA 94705 USA",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Two different model versions, 'Keynesian' and 'neoclassical', were used to estimate impacts on endogenous output, employment, value added, and household income. By using a CGE model, this study overcomes the limitations of fixed-price models (such as input-output models) including (1) inability to calculate welfare effects due to fixed prices; and (2) difficulty of addressing supply-side shocks. There are currently few examples of CGE studies addressing fisheries issues appearing in the literature.

A farmer's payoff is the sum of the payoffs from the two prisoner's dilemma games played with his two neighbors. When a farmer dies, his son takes over. The son decides whether to cooperate or defect by considering the actions taken and the payoffs received by the most prosperous members of the group comprising his own father and a set of his father's neighbors. The size of this set, which can vary, is termed the 'span of information.' It is shown that a larger span of information can be detrimental to the stable coexistence of cooperation and defection, and that in well-defined circumstances, a large span of information leads to an end of cooperation, whereas a small span does not.

Obviously, there is a necessity for analysis of the asymmetric effects in the NMS and candidate countries exchange rate volatility. In this article, the TARCH model extended by the concept of implicit target exchange rate is applied on daily data from seven NMS and candidate countries. The results suggest that symptoms of asymmetry were found in volatility of almost all exchange rates while some pose a potential threat to fulfillment of the criterion. By contrast, the most positive results were revealed in Slovakia where the increase in the exchange rate volatility is driven by the appreciation of the national currency and the appreciation-side deviation from the target exchange rate. Such a finding is consistent with the asymmetric fluctuation band which allows substantially larger deviations on the appreciation side.","Silesian Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Business Adm, Karvina, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Stavárek, D (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Dept Finance, Sch Business Adm, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina, Czech Republic.",stavarek@opf.slu.cz,"Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010","Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721",,,,,9,6,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The main contribution of this article to the empirical literature on PPP is that our study is the first to consider PPP hypothesis on alternative exchange rate regimes for LDCs. The bilateral exchange rates of LDCs and the United States, and their respective price levels are considered. Three different time series methodologies are employed: unit-root tests, Engle-Granger (1987) cointegration technique and Johansen multivariate VAR methodology (1988). The cointegration techniques improve the results, which allows the examination of the more frequent long-run relationship between relative prices and nominal exchange rates. Nevertheless, using each of econometric techniques we find only a few and a nearly equal evidence in favour of PPP under the alternative regimes in LDCs. Hence, the main conclusion of our study is that the deviations from PPP in LDCs cannot be attributed to the exchange rate regime system.

These findings suggest that providing more information to potential voters about aggregate political preferences (e.g., through pre-election polls or expert forecasts) may undermine the democratic process. Our analysis reveals that if the distribution of political preferences is common knowledge. then the unique type-symmetric equilibrium leads to a stark neutrality result in which each alternative is equally likely to win the election. By contrast, when citizens are ignorant about the preference distribution, the majority is more likely to win the election and expected voter turnout is lower. Welfare is, therefore, unambiguously higher when citizens possess less information about the preference distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, these quick decisions can be hasty actions that increase the role of the state-controlled firms in the economy and generate non-performing loans in the future. Chinese policy-makers can eliminate the trade-off between maintaining sufficient aggregate demand and ensuring economic efficiency by replacing the present macro-stimulus with new market-friendly growth drivers. Small and medium private banks should be legalized and interest rate liberalized to promote the formation of new private businesses. Farmland should be privatized so that new entrepreneurs would have the collateral to access investment loans. The termination of the household registration system and the adoption of the principle of future home ownership would accelerate high-quality urbanization, whereby the state would build public housing for migrants. China's high economic growth and its integration into the global economy are now threatened by increasing calls in the developed countries, especially in the USA, for protectionism against Chinese exports. As these calls have been prompted by China's chronic trade surplus and by the present deep recession (from the Global Financial Crisis), China should aggressively reduce the trade imbalances (e.g. by removing export rebate, liberalizing imports and modernizing the financial sector) to forestall protectionism.","[Woo, Wing Thye] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Woo, Wing Thye] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Univ Cambridge, Fac Asian & Middle Eastern Studies, Cambridge, England",University of California System; University of California Davis; Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Cambridge,"Woo, WT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",wtwoo@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,43,8,8,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This paper reports the results from a series of experiments comparing the performance of three auction formats in such complex and risky settings. In the experiment, every bidder knows the private value for the project but only a single insider bidder knows the common-value part. In addition to the standard second-price and English auctions we test the qualifying auction, a two-stage format commonly used in the sale of complex and risky assets. The qualifying auction has a fully revealing equilibrium that implements the revenue-maximizing outcome but it also has an uninformative babbling equilibrium in which bidders place arbitrarily high bids in the first stage. In the experiments, the latter equilibrium has more drawing power, which causes the qualifying auction to perform worse than the English auction and only slightly better than a sealed-bid second-price auction. Compared to the two other formats, the English auction is roughly 40% more efficient, yields 50% more revenues, avoids windfall profits for the insider, while protecting uninformed bidders from losses.","[Goeree, Jacob K.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Polydoro, Angelo] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Chen, Roy] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Boone, Jan] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",California Institute of Technology; University of Rochester; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Tilburg University,"Goeree, JK (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Mail Code 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",jacob.goeree@gmail.com,"Chen, Roy/GRJ-8383-2022","boone, jan/0000-0002-0958-2444; Goeree, Jacob/0000-0001-9876-3425",,,,,12,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

During the 2008-2009 legislative session, a debate arose about whether this law should be repealed. Those in favor of repeal attacked the law using the neoclassical arguments of efficiency, competition and lower prices. Those opposed to the law's repeal argued that pharmacists must own pharmacies in order to protect the public's welfare. This paper explores the arguments made for and against this law and draws two major conclusions. First, the arguments made by both sides are flawed because neither side fully incorporates the historical, physical and cultural characteristics of North Dakota communities into their analyses. Second, North Dakota legislators voted overwhelmingly to retain the law. Moreover, prima fascia evidence indicates that the legislators based their decisions on Institutional considerations.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Pharm Practice, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Friesner, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Pharm Practice, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,39,7,9,0,2,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Communication also induces more generous offers when the seller cannot discriminate, and divide-and-conquer offers when the seller call discriminate.

Mortgage defaults and delinquencies are particularly concentrated among borrowers whose mortgages are classified as subprime or near-prime. The main factors underlying the rise in mortgage defaults appear to be declines in house prices and deteriorated underwriting standards, in particular an increase in loan-to-value ratios and in the share of mortgages with little or no documentation of income. Contrary to popular perception, the growth in unconventional mortgages products, such as those with prepayment penalties, interest-only periods, and teaser interest rates, does not appear to be a significant factor in defaults through mid-2008 because borrowers who had problems with these products could refinance into different mortgages. However, as markets realized the extent of the poor underwriting, underwriting standards tightened and borrowers began to face difficulties refinancing; this dynamic suggests that these unconventional products could pose problems going forward.","[Mayer, Christopher] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA; [Mayer, Christopher] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pence, Karen; Sherlund, Shane M.] Fed Reserve Board, Household & Real Estate Finance Sect, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Mayer, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA.",cm310@columbia.edu; Karen.Pence@frb.gov; Shane.M.Sherlund@frb.gov,,"Pence, Karen/0000-0001-5353-5031",,,,,34,291,357,2,48,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

If the input market is very concentrated, entry in the final goods market increases welfare. If the input market is not very concentrated, entry in the final goods market may reduce welfare if the entrant is moderately cost inefficient. Hence, entry in the final goods market is more desirable if (1) the input market is very concentrated or (2) the cost difference between the incumbents and the entrant is either very small or very large.

It is found that recessions have a direct negative effect on total and wage employment creation. There is also a positive effect of recessions on employment-output elasticity and a negative one on employment-wage elasticity. These results can be interpreted as meaning that policies aimed at reducing labour costs would be of limited effectiveness in combating unemployment during recessions. On the other hand, policies to stimulate aggregate demand would have a stronger positive effect on labour market performance at times of crisis. In all cases, the effects are greater for wage employment than for total employment. This suggests that the increasing flows of workers towards the informal sector during recessions can mitigate the impact of lower economic growth on total employment.","ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Navarro, L (通讯作者)，ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile.",lunavarr@uahurtado.cl,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,4,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,DEC,2009,,99,,,,,23,40,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,580YZ,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000276488300002,0

The apparent differences in productivity between sectors imply substantial losses in aggregate productivity. Existing theories of the dual economy rely on exogenous price distortions, and cannot explain why or if these distortions evolve over the course of development. This paper provides a model of the dual economy in which the productivity differences arise endogenously because of a non-separability between the value of market and non-market time in the traditional sector. Incorporating endogenous fertility, the model then demonstrates how a dual economy will originate, persist, and eventually disappear within a unified growth framework. An implication is that traditional sector productivity growth will exacerbate the inefficiencies of a dual economy and produce slower overall growth than will modern sector productivity improvements.","Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Vollrath, D (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, 201C McElhinney Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",,,"Vollrath, Dietrich/0000-0003-2532-2009",,,,,60,35,46,3,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Infinite-dimensional VAR's and factor models. IZA; DP No. 3206]. The main developments are such that the model is 1) interdependent rather than vector autoregressive, 2) estimated by the generalised method of moments and 3) forward-looking. The primary linkage of the country models is provided through the real effective exchange rates of particular countries, while the secondary linkages are through the Chudik and Pesaran cross-sectional augmentations. A series of Monte Carlo experiments confirms that the small cross-dimension of the model and a possible dominance of one country in the panel (Russia) should not distort the results in a significant way. A series of stochastic simulation experiments made with and without the assumption of observational equivalence principle shows a possible spread of the Dutch Disease from Russia to other countries in the model.

Instead, prices respond to excess demand of all securities, despite the absence of a direct link between markets. We propose a model of price pressure that explains these findings. In our model, agents set order prices that reflect the marginal valuation of desired future holdings, called aspiration levels. In the short run, as agents encounter difficulties executing their orders, they scale back their aspiration levels. Marginal valuations, order prices, and hence, transaction prices change correspondingly. The resulting price adjustment process coincides with the Global Newton Method. The assumptions of the model as well as its empirical implications are fully borne out by the data. Our model thus provides an economic foundation for why markets appear to search for equilibrium according to Newton's procedure. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper applies this sequence of tests to Mauritian slave auctions. The theory of dynamic auctions with private and common values suggests that when an informed participant is known to be active, uninformed bidders will be more aggressive and the selling price will be higher. We conjecture that observable family links between buyer and seller entailed superior information and find a strong price premium when a related buyer purchased a slave, indicative of information asymmetry. We then test for adverse selection using sale motivation. Our results indicate large discounts on voluntary as compared to involuntary sales. Consistent with adverse selection, the market anticipated that predominantly low-productivity slaves would be brought to the market in voluntary sales.","[St-Amour, Pascal] HEC Univ Lausanne, CIRANO, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,,,"Dionne, Georges/AAL-6781-2020","Dionne, Georges/0000-0002-0578-1083",,,,,48,11,12,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Gaston",,,BANKING SPREADS IN LATIN AMERICA,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTEREST MARGINS; DETERMINANTS; CREDIT,"Intermediation spreads in Latin America are high by international standards. This paper examines the determinants of bank interest margins in that region using bank- and country-level data from 85 countries, including 14 Latin American economies. The results suggest that Latin America has higher interest rates, less efficient banks, and larger reserve requirements than other regions and that these factors have a significant impact on spreads. However, Latin American countries do not differ markedly from their peers in other aspects that are found important in determining the cost of financial intermediation, such as inflation and bank profit taxation.

For this purpose, we examine the biographical background of 592 supervisory board members in the 29 largest banks and find a pronounced difference in the finance and management experience of board representatives across private and state-owned banks. Measures of 'boardroom competence' are then related directly to the magnitude of bank losses in the recent financial crisis. Our data confirm that supervisory board (in-)competence in finance is related to losses in the financial crisis. Improved bank governance is therefore a suitable policy objective to reduce bank fragility. - Harald Hau and Marcel Thum.","[Hau, Harald] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France; Tech Univ Dresden, Ifo Dresden & CESifo, Dresden, Germany",INSEAD Business School; Ifo Institut; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Hau, H (通讯作者)，INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France.",,,"Thum, Marcel/0000-0002-5071-7849",,,,,40,68,68,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

J,"Kartik, N",,,,"Kartik, Navin",,,Strategic Communication with Lying Costs,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CHEAP-TALK; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; SIGNALING GAMES; STABILITY,"I study a model of strategic communication between an uninformed Receiver and an informed but upwardly biased Sender. The Sender bears a cost of lying, or more broadly, of misrepresenting his private information. The main results show that inflated language naturally arises in this environment, where the Sender (almost) always claims to be of a higher type than he would with complete information. Regardless of the intensity of lying cost, there is incomplete separation, with some pooling on the highest messages. The degree of language inflation and how much information is revealed depend upon the intensity of lying cost. The analysis delivers a framework to span a class of cheap-talk and verifiable disclosure games, unifying the polar predictions they make under large conflicts of interest. I use the model to discuss how the degree of manipulability of information can affect the trade-off between delegation and communication.","[Kartik, Navin] Columbia Univ, San Diego, CA USA; [Kartik, Navin] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Kartik, N (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, San Diego, CA USA.",,,,,,,,40,249,295,3,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.
