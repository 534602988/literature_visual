A general conclusion reached in the literature is that a policy targeted at regional equality may be harmful for economic growth. Such policy therefore should be transformed in such a way that it also promotes the mobility of both people and firms and hence facilitates the possibilities of increased agglomeration. Recent insights from economic theories suggest that agglomeration externalities are not taken into account in the migration decision of firms and people, causing the dynamic urbanisation processes to not necessarily result in a (social) welfare optimum. This is even more so if other welfare effects than GDP and product variety are taken into account. Regional economic development is not sustainable if the dynamic urbanisation processes stemming from agglomeration economies do not lead to a welfare optimum. In this paper we assess the possibility of a non-sustainable regional development path. We conclude that strong additional negative externalities of growing large agglomerations are harder to prove than negative externalities of small agglomerations becoming smaller. Moreover, the size of short run negative effects that will stimulate the migration of people has not been adequately assessed. The European Union should therefore be careful in interpreting place-based costs and benefits of growing, large agglomerations at the detriment of small regions.","[Thissen, Mark] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Van Oort, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; Utrecht University,"Thissen, M (通讯作者)，Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands.",mark.thissen@pbl.nl; f.vanoort@geo.uu.nl,"Roman, Urszula/G-2225-2011; Thissen, Mark/ABA-8140-2020; Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020","Thissen, Mark/0000-0001-7654-3253; Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X",,,,,19,19,20,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Many of them resulted in splitting of the former states and formation of new political units. New countries often emerged or re-emerged after the breakdown of the multinational political entities that had been founded on certain historical events and political power. This process has created new sets of attitudes towards countries and their products among the consumers of the countries that previously belonged to the same political unit. We presume that the most complex scope of perceptions has been developed towards the countries that previously were assumed as possessing formal or informal superiority over others in the conglomerate. When evaluating the products from such countries, consumers may be influenced by the product country-of-origin (COO) factor in a more complex way than usual, where ethnocentrism, nostalgia and possible animosity towards the country are involved. The research disclosed some unexpected findings. Unlike in the other studies on animosity, the analysis showed a correlation among animosity towards the country and the evaluation of its products: In addition, nostalgia appeared to be an important antecedent to animosity and was linked with ethnocentrism. Although these findings may be interpreted on the basis of the specific context analysis, our study outlines several directions for further research rather than draws firm conclusions.","[Urbonavicius, Sigitas; Dikcius, Vytautas; Gineikiene, Justina; Degutis, Mindaugas] Vilnius State Univ, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Urbonavicius, S (通讯作者)，Vilnius State Univ, Dept Mkt, Fac Econ, Sauletekio 9,Bldg 2, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",sigitas.urbonavicius@ef.vu.lt; vytas@ekt.lt; justina@icbaltic.lt; mindtaugas.degutis@riese.lt,"Urbonavicius, Sigitas/AAJ-5474-2020; Barsyte, Justina/JHU-2453-2023","Urbonavicius, Sigitas/0000-0003-4176-2573; Barsyte, Justina/0000-0002-3082-4647; Dikcius, Vytautas/0000-0001-6403-2704",,,,,73,6,7,0,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Largely ignored, however, is that this contraction was easily predicted on the basis of a well-established pattern of land speculation, premature subdivision, and excessive building on marginal land that recurs approximately once every 18 years. Capital locked up in projects that are started during a land bubble is effectively lost during the downturn, leaving the nation without sufficient capital to finance ordinary business operations during the recovery period. The best instrument for avoiding this boom-bust cycle is the property tax and, more specifically, the portion that falls on land. We explore here the ways in which the property tax influences the intensity, timing, and location of development.

We argue that fighting and negotiating are not mutually exclusive methods of resolving disputes between nations-there can often be a useful role for bargaining between a state and agents of its enemy, even when armed conflict has broken out between opposing states. We evaluate the efficacy and normative desirability of selectively substituting bribes for bombs as a means of warfare. We show how inter-country disparities in wealth, differences in military strength, the organization of the bribing and recipient forces, uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, and communications technology call contribute to the efficacy of bribes. We discuss methods for enforcing bargains struck between opposing forces, a key problem in structuring bribes. We also examine the legal status of bribe agreements, under both international and US law. While the former apparently views bribery as legitimate means of warfare. the latter poses a potentially significant obstacle by refusing on public policy grounds to enforce secret contracts made with foreign agents.

Much has been done to quantify the impact of China's economic rise on international trade, but very little has been done to assess its implications for logistics. In this paper, we examine the effects of China's continued economic rise on the Australian logistics sector. Unlike previous work that used partial equilibrium models, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This allows us to capture the direct and indirect ramifications of trade and other economic developments associated with China's economic rise. The results are mixed between sub-sectors, but overall the Australian logistics sector would potentially benefit significantly from China's continued economic rise. However, these potential benefits will hinge partly on the Australian logistics sector's ability to respond to these opportunities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The most electorally dense county has more than 20 times the average number of elected officials per capita. This paper offers the first systematic investigation of the link between electoral density and fiscal outcomes. Electoral density presents a tradeoff between accountability and monitoring costs. Increasing the number of specialized elected offices promotes issue unbundling, reducing slack between citizen preferences and government policy; but the costs of monitoring a larger number of officials may offset these benefits, producing greater latitude for politicians to pursue their own goals at the expense of citizen interests. We predict diminishing returns to electoral density and a U-shaped relationship between the number of elected local officials and government fidelity to citizen preferences. We find that public sector size decreases with electoral density up to a point, beyond which budgets grow as more officials are added.","[Berry, Christopher R.; Gersen, Jacob E.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Berry, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,78,16,22,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Statistical tests have been proposed in the literature to help analysts check for the presence of SETAR-type nonlinearities in observed time series. However, previous studies show that classical nonlinearity tests are not robust to additive outliers. In practice, time series Outliers are not uncommonly encountered. It is important to develop a more robust test for SETAR-type nonlinearity in time series analysis and forecasting. In this paper we propose a new robust nonlinearity test and the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is derived. A Monte Carlo experiment is carried out to compare the power of the proposed test with other existing tests under the influence of time series outliers. The effects of additive Outliers on nonlinearity tests with misspecification of the autoregressive order are also studied. The results indicate that the proposed method is preferable to the classical tests when the observations are contaminated with outliers. Finally, we provide illustrative examples by applying the statistical tests to three real datasets.

Many studies find that this open innovation search model contrasts favorably with the inward-oriented model of the past, although many of these studies still rely on the traditional measures of output such as patent applications. The authors further this research by examining how a concrete measure of financial performance (operating profit) is related to the variables of openness and closedness in innovation strategy. Our approach is unique in the sense that we examine a sample comprising only of small and medium-sized enterprises, categorize firms according to industry, and look at such unique variables as family control of the SME (whether the CEO and/or stockholders are family members) and the SME's exposure in an online financial newspaper. We gather data on 215 Korean SMEs from Korea's Data Analysis, Retrieval, and Transfer System, Worldwide Intellectual Property Search, and the online newspaper Money Today. Findings include the rather surprising result that a closed innovation strategy as represented by family control of the SME relates positively to financial performance.","[Lee, Yong-Gil; Song, Yong-Il] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Policy Planning Dept, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Seung-ho] Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Technol Management & Policy, Taejon 304333, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST),"Lee, YG (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Policy Planning Dept, Hawolgokdong 39-1,Wolsonggil 5, Seoul, South Korea.",yonggil@kist.re.kr,,,,,,,46,17,18,4,91,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The study posits the license to drive as a skill which affects the family as a whole. The consequences of expensive driver's license (DL) within the domain of family structure, gender and its implications for the non-western immigrants in Norway are discussed. Further we analyse how decision-making within a family and the tenets of social exclusion are therefore affected both by the availability of public transport and price of procuring a driving license in the Norwegian context. Through assessing the linkages between expensive driver's license and its substitution elasticity by public transport, we arrive at a surprising possibility that for high values on both factors, an additional increase to the substitution elasticity (improved public transport) may lead to further social exclusion for certain groups through a denied access to driver's license.

J,"Clark, TS",,,,"Clark, Tom S.",,,A Principal-Agent Theory of En Banc Review,JOURNAL OF LAW ECONOMICS & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,DECISION,"This paper adds to the existing literature on en banc rehearings in two ways. First, I incorporate theoretical results from the literature on Supreme Court certiorari decisions and argue that the ideological direction of panel decisions should influence the probability of en banc rehearing only in conjunction with the panel's ideological predisposition. Second, I build upon existing theories of en banc review by incorporating the multiple levels of the judicial hierarchy into the context in which the circuit decides to hear a case en banc. From these insights, I develop and test three hypotheses about the determinants of en banc review. Specifically, I contend that the ideological relationship between a three-judge panel, the full circuit, and the Supreme Court should all interact with the ideological orientation of the panel's decision when the circuit decides whether or not to review the panel en banc. Original data including all en banc rehearings between 1986 and 1996 are then used to test the theoretical predictions. The empirical analysis provides considerable support for the hypotheses. The findings represent two important advances in the study of the judicial hierarchy: They highlight the strategic interaction between ideological disposition and panel composition in the en banc review process and demonstrate the incentives created by the multiple levels of the federal judiciary. More broadly, the theory and findings developed here have implications for strategic auditing in a political hierarchy.

This paper compares four such estimators, realised volatility, realised range, realised power variation and realised bipower variation, by examining their in-sample distributional properties and out-of-sample forecast ranking when the object of interest is the conventional conditional variance. The analysis is based on a 7-year sample of transaction prices for 14 NYSE stocks. The forecast race is conducted in a GARCH framework and relies on several loss functions. The realized range fares relatively wall in the in-sample fit analysis, for instance, regarding the extent to which it brings normality in returns. However, overall the realised power variation provides the most accurate 1-day-ahead forecasts. Forecast combination of all four intraday measures produces the smallest forecast errors in about half of the sampled stocks. A market conditions analysis reveals that the additional use of intraday data on day t - 1 to forecast volatility on day t is most advantageous when day t is a low volume or an up-market day. These results have implications for option pricing, asset allocation and value-at-risk. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

An aggregate statistical measure of museum attendance is calculated in this research and the attendance measure is shown to be countercyclical in nature. When set against federal and other allocations to museums, which are clearly pro-cyclical in nature, an attendance disease may be at least tentatively identified. Efficiency criteria, of course, require that costs are covered in real time. We find, however, that, despite the likelihood that museum attendance is income-elastic and a normal good, attendance varies countercyclically with the business cycle. We suggest that one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that a positive substitution effect on demand outweighs the income effect on demand for museum attendance over the cycle. From a policymaking perspective, these results call for a longer range planning horizon, that is, one that includes the full business cycle rather than just the financial year, as is the current U.S. government practice.","[Skinner, Sarah J.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Econ & Finance, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Jackson, John D.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36830 USA",University of Louisiana Lafayette; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Skinner, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Econ & Finance, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",bobekelund@prodigy.net,,,,,,,26,17,23,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

It finds that labour market experience, working in the public sector, whether a person is overskilled, the sector they work in and their occupation are important determinants of voluntary job change. The paper finds the rate of voluntary job mobility in Ireland trebled over the period 1995 to 2000. The sample is divided into two time periods and a decomposition technique is applied to ascertain how much of the increase in mobility is attributable to compositional changes and how much is due to other factors. Compositional changes explain around one-third of the increase, while the remainder seems to reflect fundamental changes in the operation of the labour market.","[Bergin, Adele] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dublin, Ireland; [Bergin, Adele] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Maynooth University; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Bergin, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,6,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The empirical results document a fall in ownership concentration and a decrease in the power of top institutional owners including the big banks. Hence, the description of German corporate governance as a bank-based system may no longer apply. However, even though the corporate tax reform had a significant effect on ownership concentration and on the power of the top-institutional blockholders, the change in the corporate income tax law did not revolutionise German corporate governance. Ownership concentration in 2005 is still high compared to the Anglo-American economies and an active market for corporate control is not observed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Building on Schilling and Steensma's work of 2001, we apply general systems modularity theory to the Italian case and explain why in some industries there is a greater use of modular organizational forms using data from 68 manufacturing industries. The results of our regression analysis diverge significantly from the US case showing that, in the Italian case, organizational modularity is driven by labor intensity, industry specificities and nation-specific factors.","[Campagnolo, Diego] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, I-35123 Padua, Italy; [Camuffo, Arnaldo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, IOSI, Milan, Italy; [Camuffo, Arnaldo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, CROMA, Milan, Italy",University of Padua; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Campagnolo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",diego.campagnolo@unipd.it,"Campagnolo, Diego/X-6697-2019","Campagnolo, Diego/0000-0002-0996-2535; CAMUFFO, ARNALDO/0000-0001-9039-1057",,,,,89,14,15,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

While culture frees humans from the material dependencies of nature, it also creates new, symbolic dependencies-on customs, traditions, conventions, which a person receives as a member of a certain group and ethnos. Among the many freedoms proclaimed as rights of the individual, there emerges yet another freedom-from one's own culture, in which one was born and educated. Transculture is viewed as the next level of liberation, this time from the prison house of language, from unconscious predispositions and prejudices of the native, naturalized cultures. The case of the Japanese poet Araki Yasusada (1903-1972), a survivor of Hiroshima, demonstrates how transcultural creativity, though cast in the form of a literary hoax, can produce an internationally recognized achievement. Transculturalism is especially needed in world politics, where the factor of fixed cultural identity based on race, ethnos, religion, or ideological commitments turned out to be a source of conflict and violence. This paper argues that the categories of opposition and identity do not preclude the significance of the third category, which is difference. The differences complement each other and create a new interpersonal transcultural community to which we belong, not because we are similar but because we are different. The transcultural perspective opens a possibility for globalization not as homogenization but, rather, as further differentiation of cultures and their dissemination into transcultural individuals, liberating themselves from their dependence from their native cultures. The global society can be viewed as the space of diversity of free individuals rather than that of fixed groups and cultures. It is an alternative to the clash of civilizations and a hope for lasting peace.","Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Epstein, M (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,"Epstein, Mikhail/CAF-8815-2022",,,,,,15,50,61,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

To that end, my paper looks back to the philosophies of G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche-in particular to their vision of a social reconciliation and cultural redemption-as a source of inspiration in our efforts to meet the challenges posed for a philosophy of the future by the global scale of violence, human suffering, and alienation. In what follows, I first offer a comparative analysis of Hegel's project of reconciliation with Nietzsche's project of redemption. I then consider whether or not either philosopher can provide us with a coherent and attractive ethical/sociopolitical alternative for our postmodern world-a world still characterized by global violence, injustice, genocide, ecological degradation, and the prospect of nuclear annihilation.","CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Hicks, SV (通讯作者)，CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The financial question of existence of non-profit organizations is connected with particularities which are derived from their service and non-commercial status in the society. Nowadays the non-profit organizations face harder forms of competition than ever before which inevitably implies a successful management of a difficult task of mastering and applying modem methods of gaining new financial sources so that they are able to ensure the offer of public service in a range that corresponds with the society needs. In this paper we focused on the diversification of financial sources in non-profit organisations The qualitative evaluation of our outputs has been done through primary research of financing non-profit organizations by means of sociological method in form of structured questionnaire. The statistical analysis of the data acquired by primary research did not remain on the level of examination of the isolated variables, we also focused on the comparison of dividing as well as relations among the variables whereby we used adequate mathematical and statistical methods of quantitative data analysis and elaboration. The existence of non-profit organisations is endangered by running out or deficit of present financial sources. That is why the non-profit organisations begin to care for modem techniques and methods of financial funds acquisition. Besides incomes from own activity and donations from entrepreneurial sphere or individual donors, their activity is supported particularly from state grants and community budgets. But public funds for financing of non-profit organisations are not sufficient and it is inevitable so these organisations do not rely only on donation aid of state, and they search the alternative ways of their activities financing and try to diversify the structure of their financial sources. By it the independence from one source, short-term and long-term financial balance, and finally also their permanent sustainability will be ensured.","[Kuvikova, Helena] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Verejnej Ekon, Banskej Bystrici, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Kuvíková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Katedra Verejnej Ekon, Banskej Bystrici, Slovakia.",helena.kuvikova@umb.sk; gabriela.vacekova@gmail.com,"Vacekova, Gabriela/AAY-6823-2021","Vacekova, Gabriela/0000-0003-4804-9682",,,,,14,13,13,6,56,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

As a consequence of globalization and increasing customer expectations, medium-sized less-than truckload carriers operate together in cooperations. Each cooperative member faces a multitude of requirements when constructing a low-cost, feasible set of routes. Among other aspects heterogeneous vehicles, time windows, simultaneous delivery and pick-up at customer locations, and multiple use of vehicles have to be considered. After the determination of an adequate set of routes, the vehicles must be assigned to loading bays at the depot at which the loading and unloading activities can occur. We present a vehicle routing model which integrates the real-life vehicle routing problem and the assignment problem of vehicles to loading bays at the depot. The proposed solution heuristic combines a multi-start and a local search procedure.

First, the hierarchical market economy model discussed by Soskice and Schneider in this special issue contributes to our understanding of some of Latin America's problems. In particular, the model's accent on negative complementarities between large business groups, transnational corporations and the labour market explains the persistent lack of innovation and the maintenance of structural heterogeneity. Second, however, the recent expansion of new production activities in Costa Rica signals the limitations of the model and the need to incorporate the state as a central variable. It was bureaucratic leadership and not private-sector demands that triggered the expansion of social spending and the attraction of more dynamic foreign investors that were behind the emergence of new sectors. In the conclusion, the article extends this argument to the rest of Latin America and calls for an approach that combines the incentive structure of firms and the behaviour of the state.","Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England",University of Oxford,"Sánchez-Ancochea, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, 2 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6JF, England.",diego.sanchez-ancochea@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,66,14,16,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The findings are based on a large set of quantitative and qualitative empirical data collected from angel investors in Germany. Analysis of the data suggests interrelations between investment industries, social networks and the spatial mobility of informal venture capital.

The inconsistent findings have encouraged researchers to further investigate the possibilities whether there exists mediating or moderating variables in the relationship between budget participation and managerial performance. This study attempts to fill up this gap. In this study, a more comprehensive model of participative budgeting that incorporates the element of fairness, motivation and organisational culture is proposed. The first objective of this study is to examine the relationship between budget participation and managerial performance. Secondly, the study aims to examine the mediating role of organisational fairness and motivation in the relationship between budget participation and managerial performance. Finally, the moderating effects of organisational culture on the relationship between budget participation and organisational fairness, motivation and managerial performance are examined.

Through a wavelet multi-resolution analysis, a time series can be decomposed into different timescale components and a model can be fitted to each component to improve the forecast accuracy of the series as a whole. Up to now, the literature on forecasting with wavelets has mainly focused on univariate modelling. On the other hand, in a context of growing data availability, a line of research has emerged on forecasting with large datasets. In particular, the use of factor-augmented models have become quite widespread in the literature and among practitioners. The aim of this paper is to bridge the two strands of the literature. A wavelet approach for factor-augmented forecasting is proposed and put to test for forecasting GDP growth for the major euro area countries. The results show that the forecasting performance is enhanced when wavelets and factor-augmented models are used together.

Albanians are significantly less likely to be asked to visit advertised rental housing in all the three categories, while rental penalties for Albanians are also significant. Interestingly, more discrimination was observed with higher-status rental properties. The outcomes suggest that the existence of isolated and racially segregated housing may be a result of prejudice and/or negative stereotypes against Albanians.","[Drydakis, Nick] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Drydakis, Nick] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Athens 10434, Greece; [Drydakis, Nick] Sci Ctr Study Discriminat, Athens, Greece",University of Piraeus; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Drydakis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",ndrydakis@econ.soc.uoc.gr,"Drydakis, Nick/AAI-1102-2021","Drydakis, Nick/0000-0001-9827-6678",,,,,45,19,24,5,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In this paper, we take a forecaster's perspective in reviewing established principles for validating the atmospheric-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) used in most climate forecasting, and in particular by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Such models should reproduce the behaviours characterising key model outputs, such as global and regional temperature changes. We develop various time series models and compare them with forecasts based on one well-established AOGCM from the UK Hadley Centre. Time series models perform strongly, and structural deficiencies in the AOGCM forecasts are identified using encompassing tests. Regional forecasts from various GCMs had even more deficiencies. We conclude that combining standard time series methods with the structure of AOGCMs may result in a higher forecasting accuracy. The methodology described here has implications for improving AOGCMs and for the effectiveness of environmental control policies which are focussed on carbon dioxide emissions alone. Critically, the forecast accuracy in decadal prediction has important consequences for environmental planning, so its improvement through this multiple modelling approach should be a priority.

To prevent unearned income (economic rent) from adding to the economy's cost of living and doing business, potentially rent-yielding infrastructure should be kept in the public domain as a fourth factor of production.

To this end, we propose a systematic framework by integrating the merits of the analytic hierarchy process for multiple criteria decision making and the strengths of input-output analysis in the assessment of the effects of technology diffusion. The suggested framework is comprised of three consecutive modules: technology priority analysis, country priority analysis and impact analysis of technology transfer. The first two modules deal with technology and country selection as a multiple criteria decision making problem. In the last module, the economic impacts on both the transferor and transferee are estimated in terms of the generated production, value added and employment. A case study shows that the international transfer of geographic information system (GIS) technology from the Republic of Korea to the Philippines is the most effective scenario among those for the members of Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA). We believe that our method can promote rapid and efficient consensus building on the most competitive strategy for the international transfer of marine technology.","[Yoon, Byungun; Hwang, Jinhwan] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Seoul 100715, South Korea; [Lee, Changyong] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Dongguk University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Yoon, B (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Pil Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 100715, South Korea.",postman3@dongguk.edu,"Yoon, Byungun/AAC-6608-2020; Lee, Changyong/W-6486-2018","Yoon, Byungun/0000-0002-1110-4011; Lee, Changyong/0000-0002-1636-9481; Hwang, Jin Hwan/0000-0003-1308-6985",,,,,56,0,0,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Achieving this implies efforts framed in an integral industrial development strategy that is effective and coherent and that fosters the formulation of integral responses to strengthen SAMEs and help them move toward the new paradigm with deep and enduring competiveness, supported by the concept of social business responsibility.

J,"Schipper, L",,,,"Schipper, Lee",,,"Automobile use, fuel economy and CO2 emissions in industrialized countries: Encouraging trends through 2008?",TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fuel economy; Vehicle use; Fuel economy standards,CARS; CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; INTENSITY; TRANSPORT; DEMAND; EUROPE; TRAVEL,"Car use and fuel economy are factors that determine oil demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Recent data on automobile utilization and fuel economy reveal surprising trends that point to changes in oil demand and CO2 emissions. New vehicle and on-road fleet fuel economy have risen in Europe and Japan since the mid 1990s, and in the US since 2003. Combined with a plateau in per capita vehicle use in all countries analyzed, these trends indicate that per capita fuel use and resultant tail-pipe CO2 emissions have stagnated or even declined. Fuel economy technology, while important, is not the only factor that explains changes in tested and on-road fuel economy, vehicle efficiency and transport emissions across countries. Vehicle size and performance choices by car producers and buyers, and driving distances have also played significant roles in total fuel consumption, and explain most of the differences among countries. Technology applied to new vehicles managed to drive down the fuel use per unit of horsepower or weight by 50%, yet most of the potential fuel savings were negated by overall increased power and weight, particularly in the US. Similarly, the promise of savings from dieselization of the fleet has revealed itself as a minor element of the overall improvement in new vehicle or on-road fuel economy. And the fact that diesels are driven so much more than gasoline cars, a difference that has increased since 1990, argues that those savings are minimal. This latter point is a reminder that car use, not just efficiency or fuel choice, is an important determinant of total fuel use and CO2 emissions. We speculate that if the upward spiral of car weight and power slows or even reverses (as has been observed in Europe and Japan) and the now mandatory standards in many countries have the intended effect that fuel use will remain flat or only grow weakly for some time. If real fuel prices of 2008, which rivaled their peaks of the early 1980s. fell back somewhat but still remain well above their early 2000 values. If the prices remain high, this, combined with the strengthened fuel economy standards, may finally lead to new patterns of car ownership, use and fuel economy. However, if fuel prices continue their own stagnation or even decline after the peaks of 2008 and car use starts upward, fuel use will increase again, albeit more slowly. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A simple theoretical model shows that the optimal number of copies is increasing on the expected demand for the film and the revenue share of the distributor and decreasing on the cost of each copy. The model also predicts that the optimal number of copies will decrease with the number of theaters that are vertically integrated with the distributor, as long as running a cinema requires financing a non-negligible cost of capital. The theoretical results are empirically tested using a very rich dataset of films' exhibition patterns in the major Chilean markets.

While there is some literature on the causes of risk of cost overruns in transportation capital investment, little is available on how properly to estimate this risk and how to incorporate risk estimates into project assessment. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are to propose methods for estimating the risk of cost overruns and suggest ways to incorporate it into project decision-making. To these ends we propose distribution-fitting models to elicit the probabilities of cost overruns. These probabilities, in turn, are used as inputs into a decision tree model of project selection. Using a database, made up of observations on a large number of highway projects, the paper shows how empirically this analysis can be carried out. A key conclusion is that the approach proposed here can provide realistic risk estimates, thereby reducing subjective biases in project cost benefit analysis.","[Berechman, Joseph] CUNY, CCNY, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Chen, Li] CUNY, Univ Transportat Res Ctr, CCNY, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Berechman, J (通讯作者)，CUNY, CCNY, Dept Econ, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",jberechman@ccny.cuny.edu; lchen001@ce.ccny.cuny.edu,,,,,,,21,9,9,0,9,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

More specifically it provides an empirical investigation for Slovenia during the period 1994-2003. In order to obtain wide insights, various efficiency measures, calculated with Data Envelopment Analysis, and various farm size indicators are used, based on Farm Accountancy Network Data averaged at production branch levels. The results reveal consistency regarding the farm size-efficiency relationships in the way that the correlation coefficients for each size indicator have always the same sign whatever the efficiency measure. They further suggest that family labour is more crucial than any other production factor in the country's farming economy.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, SI-6104 Primorska, Slovenia; [Latruffe, Laure] French Inst Agr Res INRA, UMR SMART, CS61103, F-35011 Rennes, France; [Latruffe, Laure] UMR1302 SMART, F-35000 Rennes, France",University of Primorska; INRAE,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Cankarjeva 5,Koper Pp 345, SI-6104 Primorska, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; Laure.Latruffe@rennes.inra.fr,"Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",,,,,50,16,16,0,27,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The price of sawnwood and panels would be 15% higher. The price of paper would be 3% higher. Concurrently, the demand for all manufactured wood products would be lower in all countries, but the production would rise in countries with competitive advantage.

Prior work: The paper presents the concepts of data-mining, database, multidimensional data analysis systems, the evolution of data-mining. The authors present the importance and the implications of using these management tools on the day to day activity of the company. The paper points out the advantages and the disadvantages of these new systems for the company. We also underline the usage of data-mining, not just as a management tool, but also as a marketing tool, especially if the companies want to develop a long lasting relation with the consumer in this ever changing global market. Methodology The authors used a quantitative research based on a questionnaire by which the hypotheses were tested. The questionnaire was pre-tested with a qualitative research (focus-group) in order to check the validity of the context. The survey was representatively applied on managers from the 7th Centre Region, Romania. Results Following the results of the analysis, it has been determined that the organizations use data-mining techniques and multidimensional data analysis in a small percentage. The study has revealed that only the medium-sized and large enterprises use data-mining, although all types of companies' have implemented database technologies. Implications This research points out to the managers, the importance of using the data-mining technology and its implications on the company's management system. Starting from the bibliographical research and the study's results we are drawing the attention on the importance of using data-mining and multidimensional analysis systems in business.

In the process of innovation building, spatial relations play an important part. Generally, the regional and local levels are emphasised because of the importance of actors' interactions in the process. After their transition to market economy, the theme of innovation building has become crucial also for post-socialist countries. Thus, innovation support tools are firmly positioned on their political agendas. Clusters and regional innovation systems belong to fundamental innovation support tools on the regional and local levels. This article evaluates selected aspects of clusters and regional innovation systems of post-socialist countries with the Zlin region as the model area. Our conclusions point to a number of ambivalences related to the implementation of the concepts in practice. Firstly, there is a conceptual problem how the institutionalized clusters meet the definition and the essence of the term. The multi-sector Czech-Slovakian Industrial Cluster represents the most extreme case in this regard. Secondly, the institutionalized clusters are typically created on the top-down basis and financed from public resources including EU structural funds. This state is connected with the threads of unnatural character of the process resulting into the stagnancy of cluster development. Thirdly, the ability to stimulate the interest of prospective financial institutions is the main institutional problem. Fourthly, there is no straightforward answer on the innovativeness of the institutionalized clusters. Finally, a low level of specialization in progressive industries is the main problem of innovative environment in the Zlin region. Overall, the current state of regional innovation system in the Zlin region may be denoted as a premature stage of its development.","[Hajek, Oldrich; Novosak, Jiri; Hovorkova, Zuzana] Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu Ekon, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Hájek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu Ekon, Zlin, Czech Republic.",hajek@fame.utb.cz; novosak@fame.utb.cz; hovorkova@fame.utb.cz,"Novosák, Jiří/H-6493-2012; Hájek, Oldřich/H-6464-2012",,,,,,38,9,9,1,32,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Although employers enjoy the prerogative to re-organise their businesses, employees too have their rights not to have their employment terminated unfairly.

This article has a closer look at the competencies of top managers to answer the question of their positive or negative influx on change management processes. Based on a cluster analysis according to Tanimoto, the data of 275 managers show that top managers are completely unwilling to change their behavior. So they never can be seen as role models for change managers. Also the upper management does not foster change according to theoretical approaches. Only the middle and operative management behaves according to literature. So we definitely have to question the different hierarchical roles of managers within the change process and rethink current change management concepts. If top and upper managers show no interest to initiate change, we will have to have a closer look at bottom up processes - as it is already known from the IT perspective.","[Kasper, Helmut; Muehlbacher, Juergen; Nettekoven, Michaela] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Kasper, H (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",Helmut.Kasper@wu.ac.at; Juergen.Muehlbacher@wu.ac.at; Michaela.Nettekoven@wu.ac.at,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,UNIV MARIBOR,KRANJ,"FAC ORG SCI, ECENTER, KIDRICEVA CESTA 55A, KRANJ, 4000, SLOVENIA",,,978-961-232-249-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,36,41,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8BC,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000403116000005,0

Many times, management is considered a way of getting things done by teams. The more evaluated a society is, the more complex the management methods and techniques are. In many systems, the management performance can be easily observed and determined. Management is so connected to leadership, that, sometimes they are confused. It is best when manager is seen as real leader, but this does not happen all the time. A contradiction between management and leadership lead to unprofessional decisions. In the university education, the quality of the education as the main public good has been directly connected to the management performance. Therefore, the analysis of the existing management through leadership features is necessary to be made in order to understand the difficulties of the system and to identify the possibilities to be reorganized. This paper proposes a new reflection on the university system in order to identify strategic elements for universities for the near future based on a strong competitive market.

The use of CAM software for programming a CNC machine tool is very important these days as the number of controller types and specifications has increased, and because the development of CNC machine tools with more than 3 axis makes it more difficult to build suitable NC files. The training process in the field of NC programming can be optimized by employing interactive simulation software to highlight certain concepts and to help students assimilate information and gain competences faster.

The paper proposes to increase the quality of the polymeric parts by choosing easily which plastic is best suited for each application using the author's experience in this field. During time the first author worked and designed molds injection and graduated her PhD in the molding injection technology. The second author developed several programs based on wiki concept using computer virtualization. Also, the authors have complex background of personal experiences during several papers and presentations already published in International Symposiums in this field. MIE run as a wiki software and is an educational knowledge space dedicated to mold injection technology. It is implemented as a software engine, which is an open source that runs on one or more web servers, with the content generally stored in a relational database management system. MIE is a new concept of PMA program, which has been developed by authors to search for the properly polymeric material, a database with many types of polymeric materials, total flexibility of data visualization, information about material properties and producer. Beyond PMA program purpose, this new approach of MIE consists, generally speaking, in a virtual community, e-community or online community which is a group of people that primarily interact via communication media such as letters, telephone, email or Usenet discussion system rather than face to face. We developed a new concept of a mold program and obtained in this manner the optimum molding process. The author's contributions and researches have great implications in the world of the mold engineers, academics and universities staff The methodology developed helps us to save time, money and raw material and give the possibility to a large number of mold engineers and academics staff to interact between them.

We tested the hypothesis that the advantage of groups over individuals in decision-making depends on the group composition. Our study used susceptibility to the framing effect as a measure of decision quality. Individuals were assigned to one of two perspectives on a choice problem. The individuals were asked to indicate their individual preference between a risky option and a risk-free option. Next, they were asked to consider the same (or a related) choice problem as a group. Homogeneous groups were composed of similarly framed individuals, while the heterogeneous ones were composed of differently framed individuals. In comparison to individual preferences, the homogeneous groups' preferences were polarized, and thus the framing effect was amplified; in contrast, the heterogeneous groups' preferences converged, and thus the framing effect was reduced to zero.

Conclusions are that the dialogic philosophical theory on which managerial ethics are based, defined as a human activity, is born in a context where the company cannot separate what is economic from what is social. Under this concept, a company would act morally when its actions or decisions pursue dialogue and later agreement among the groups immersed in the entrepreneurial activity as much as possible.","[Labarca, Nelson] Univ Zulia LUZ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo, Venezuela",,"Labarca, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia LUZ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo, Venezuela.",nelsonlabar-ca66@hotmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,2,8,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The proposed regulations are motivated in part by the concern that the broadband access providers will adopt economically inefficient business models and network management practices due to a lack of sufficient competition in the provision of broadband access services. This paper addresses the competitive concerns motivating net neutrality rules and addresses the potential impact of the proposed rules on consumer welfare. We show that there is significant and growing competition among broadband access providers and that few significant competitive problems have been observed to date. We also evaluate claims by net neutrality proponents that regulation is justified by the existence of externalities between the demand for Internet access and content services. We show that such interrelationships are more complex than claimed by net neutrality proponents and do not provide a compelling rationale for regulation. We conclude that antitrust enforcement and/or more limited regulatory mechanisms provide a better framework for addressing competitive concerns raised by proponents of net neutrality.","[Becker, Gary S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Becker, Gary S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Becker, Gary S.] Univ Chicago, Booth Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Carlton, Dennis W.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Becker, Gary S.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Carlton, Dennis W.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Becker, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gbecker@uchicago.edu; dennis.carlton@chicagobooth.edu; hsider@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,27,20,23,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943) in fact impersonated the idea of scholarly synthesis. Being the son of a Reformist rabbi-these religious roots provided the impulse for his work-he started out as a physician in the industrial suburbs of Berlin; his diagnosis was that he faced social and not medical disease, which consequently brought him to the study of economics. But unlike many mainstream economists today, he insisted on the necessary cooperation between economists and sociologists, ideally in one person. His chair in Frankfurt, showing his own handwriting, was denominated for economic theory and sociology. In this article, I show his contributions with respect to economic aspects of health. These are not well known. Part of the reason is that the field of health economics as it is taught now is very narrow.

This paper provides a point-by-point comparison of that model with the probability of a given player winning the match, as implied by betting odds. The predictions implied by the betting odds match the model predictions closely, with an extremely high correlation being found between the model and the betting market. The results for both men's and women's matches also suggest that there is a high level of efficiency in the betting market, demonstrating that betting markets are a good predictor of the outcomes of tennis matches. The significance of service breaks and service being held is anticipated up to four points prior to the end of the game. However, the tendency of players to lose more points than would be expected after conceding a break of service is not captured instantaneously in betting odds. In contrast, there is no evidence of a biased reaction to a player winning a game on service. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Capital gravitated toward those local governments that could readily convert the income streams of public assets into new financial instruments and that could minimize the risk of nonpayment due to the actions of nonfinancial claimants. This article follows the case of Chicago from 1996 through 2007 as the city government subsidized development projects with borrowed money using a once-obscure instrument called Tax Increment Financing (TIF). TIF allows municipalities to bundle and sell off the rights to future property tax revenues from designated parts of the city. The City of Chicago improved the appearance of these speculative instruments by segmenting and sequencing TIF debt instruments in ways that made them look less idiosyncratic and by exerting strong political control over the processes of development and property tax assessment. In doing so, Chicago not only attracted billions of dollars in global capital but also contributed to a dangerous oversupply of commercial real estate.","Univ Illinois, Urban Planning & Policy Program, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Weber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urban Planning & Policy Program, 412 S Peoria MC 348, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",rachelw@uic.edu,,,,,,,82,304,359,6,135,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

These connections are known in Chinese as guanxi, on which as the basis Chinese exchange a lifetime of favors, resources, and business leverage. This study seeks to study guanxi mechanism, the unique Chinese social-cultural element and its impact on the managerial effectiveness of Taiwanese firms with lean implementation in practice, and an empirical study is constructed to verify our proposal. Results suggest that guanxi and its networks function as the lubrication that eases interpersonal conflicts and as the buffer in solving problems, which in turn upgrades the cooperative efficiency both inter- and intragroups. This article provides an inner view of cultural value, which offers insights that should prove helpful to academics in management and related disciplines as well as to practitioners engaged in Chinese production management.","Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Taichung 411, Taiwan",National Chin-Yi University of Technology,"Wong, ML (通讯作者)，Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, 35,Lane 215,Chung Shan Rd,Sec 1, Taichung 411, Taiwan.",mlwong@ncut.edu.tw,,,,,,,65,6,7,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

I propose a dynamic dominant-firm type of model where the firm's use of market power, when it is discovered by an antitrust agency, will be penalized. Equilibrium entails a threshold market share above which the market tends toward monopoly and below which the market tends to competition. One may propose the region below this threshold to be the safety zone. The size of this region depends on how fast market power depreciates. In industries in which this depreciation is fast and where, as a result, monopoly power is more transitory, the safety zone should be wider, and there should be less policy intervention.","Howard Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20059 USA",Howard University,"Kato, M (通讯作者)，Howard Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",mkato@howard.edu,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We thus combine the ability of nonlinear models to capture the asymmetric features of the business cycle with information on the current state of the economy provided by coincident indicators. Our approach relies upon sequential Monte Carlo filtering techniques applied to time-nonhomogenous Markov-switching models. The transition probabilities are driven by a beta-distributed stochastic component and by a set of exogenous variables. We illustrate, in a full Bayesian and online context, the effectiveness of the methodology.

It argues that governmental bioethics, marked by openness, transparency and participation, can be understood as a form of reflexive government in the realm of science governance. It grew out of the problematization of older forms of science governance based on ideas of effectiveness, scientific expertise and system stability, and operates through structuring and managing proper talk rather than intervening in processes of techno-scientific development. Yet, rather than challenging the commitment to techno-scientific 'progress', it stabilizes it through mechanisms of inclusion, involvement and mobilization: within the framework of proper ethical talk, participation can be employed to pursue rather than oppose system stability.","[Braun, Kathrin; Herrmann, Svea Luise] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Polit Sci, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Moore, Alfred] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Koenninger, Sabine] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Econ Policy Res, Dept Econ Policy, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; University of British Columbia; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Braun, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Polit Sci, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",k.braun@ipw.uni-hannover.de; a.moore@ucc.ie; s.herrmann@ipw.uni-hannover.de; sabine.koenninger@kit.edu,,"Braun, Kathrin Renate/0000-0002-2015-3149; Konninger, Sabine/0000-0001-8515-3687",,,,,50,23,23,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In an empirical application using returns on the S&P 500 index, time-varying model weights provide improved forecasts with substantial economic gains in an investment strategy including transaction costs.

First of all there should be known a reason for determining of investment value of such an entity because it can influence the whole procedure The insurance agency is necessary to be evaluated when it should be sold or purchased, then in cases connected with the new partnership in the company or in cases of mergers, liquidations and comparison of the market value of shares We can find the different approaches of valuating business entities which have their advantages and disadvantages There are three main methods - the yield valuation, the property valuation and the method of the market comparison The yield valuation is hold as the crucial method of valuating and is seen to be the method in the most objective and the most conclusive way On the other hand this kind of valuation is the most demanding because a financial analysis and the internal and external analysis of a business environment are necessary to be done The valuation according this principle describes the market potential of the valuated insurance company and the going-concern principle We can follow the method of bond pricing model which is based on the determining of the market value of the individual assets and liabilities and identification of the equity costs The valuating is like a combination of yield and property valuation of a bank and we get a static view of an insurance company The paper deals also with the method of the market comparison which is applied in the USA because of the requirement of a developed market with sales and purchases of these entities Valuation is based on the price which would be paid for a similar insurance company and it works with market capitalization which we get if we multiply the market value of a bank shares by the number of shares It is difficult to apply this method in the Czech Republic because there are not comparable transactions and the market value of insurance companies is not known In comparison with the yield valuation, the property valuation is based on valuating of all components of the property as a whole which can be seen as an advantage We have to determine the accounting value of the equity and the substance value The valuation of insurance companies is a very demanding process and the authors recommend the following of the procedure of valuating and they mention some problems and difficulties which can appear in the operations of valuating","[Hrdy, Milan] Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Ekon Podniku & Ucetnictvi, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Duchackova, Eva] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Katedra Bankovnictvi & Pojistovnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hrdy, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Ekon Podniku & Ucetnictvi, Plzen, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,7,3,3,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It results not only from the Czech, but also foreign experiences. It points out some discrepancies between expectations and a reality of city marketing, which have not been reflected a lot by a city marketing theory. It shows that a city marketing reality is much more unpretentious than theoretical and practical expectations. Existing researches show that nowadays the theory does not offer any generally accepted procedure how to apply knowledge from general (corporate) marketing in conditions of the cities. In principle, in practice individual cities create their own city marketing models which meet their needs and conditions. The forms of these models are affected especially by a relevance of the problems, willingness of interest groups to cooperate, as well as accessibility of external financial resources (subsidiary programmes). In the city marketing praxis we mainly meet the realization of chancy (ad-hoc), nonconceptual, and situational received actions. If there are any coordination and integrative marketing actions, they occur only in the limited measures. Although city marketing still plays more and more important role by solving the city problems, it is not managing and development conception that could be able to substitute or even root existing conceptions or approaches. It is more likely their proper supplement. Possibilities of marketing use in conditions of the cities, if we compare them with a business environment, are more expressively limited and more difficult to realize (e.g. because of many interest and target groups, increasing complexity of the problems and the ways of their solving, problems of marketing activities finance, etc.). Not only because of particularity and severity of a political environment, where the decisions about marketing activities take place, but mainly because the nowadays cities are the result of a long-term evolution, and it is not possible to change in principle easily or in a short-term period the infrastructure, physical and social environment of the city, as well as the structure of the citizens or economy. City marketing is the flexible and innovative tool of development of the cities, which offers them wide possibilities to experiment.","Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Jezek, J (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",jezekji@keu.zcu.cz,,,,,,,43,11,11,1,30,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Ensuring and improving forest profitability to make NIPF management viable is one of the main challenges faced by this type of landowner. This study empirically explores and assesses management by NIPF owners, through analysing attributes of forest economics (investment in holdings, expenditure on planting and silviculture, public subsidies, along with timber and non-timber incomes). With the aim of predicting outcomes, a multiple regression model was also constructed to investigate and quantify the relationship between socioeconomic and holding factors, and the planting activities carried out by NIPF owners. For this, 103 resident forest landowners in a forest region in northern Spain were interviewed in person, during March 2004, about their commitment to and involvement in land management during the period 1999-2003. The results mainly revealed that attractive forest returns and favourable market conditions for timber production are significant factors for investment in and development of forestry, with personal and family conditions also being important factors in explaining the type of land management carried out. In particular, the multiple linear regression model for forest planting activity correctly explained 84.5% of the variability observed in the study population, indicating that both the investments in and the incomes from forestry play an important role in the activity, as does the size of the holding. The findings may be of interest in promoting public measures related to timber markets and economic incentives for forest management, which will allow landowners to develop economically viable practices, as well as enabling fulfilment of social and environmental demands for sustainable forestry and rural development.

Hence, any expected real depreciation of the euro in the future would not help increase real output. Other findings are that a higher real stock price, a higher EU real interest rate, and a lower expected inflation rate would increase real output and that the coefficient of the ratio of government deficit to GDP is positive but insignificant. Thus, fiscal prudence would be needed in considering deficit-financed spending to stimulate the economy.","[Sergi, Bruno S.] Univ Messina, DESMaS V Pareto, I-98122 Messina, Italy; [Hsing, Yu] SE Louisiana Univ, Dept Business Adm & Finance, Coll Business, Hammond, LA 70402 USA",University of Messina; University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University,"Sergi, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, DESMaS V Pareto, Via T Cannizzaro 278, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",bsergi@unime.it; yhsing@selu.edu,"Sergi, Bruno/AAT-7504-2020","Sergi, Bruno/0000-0002-5050-5651",,,,,23,3,3,1,6,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The evaluation presented in this study is based on the synthesis of selected available indicators (excluding GDP) which can be considered the key prerequisites for or aspects of the economic level of the regions and which emphasize the principles of knowledge economy. The selected indicators are the following: disposable household income, unemployment rate, expenditures on research and development, employment in research and development, employment in knowledge-intensive services and employment in high and medium high-technology manufacturing sector. The evaluation is carried out both as static, when data for 2006 were used, and dynamic, when the change (index) between 2000 an 2006 is calculated. On this basis it is possible to divide the regions in accordance with their economic development as well as their development trends. Another important contribution of this article is the linking of the evaluation based on the synthesis of the above mentioned indicators with the values of regional GDP per capita. On the base of this methodology the authors expressed: 1) static and dynamic value of the composite indicator of the economic level of the regions, 2) The relationship between the values of the composite indicator and regional GDP.","[Zitek, Vladimir; Klimova, Viktorie] Masaryk Univ, Ekon Spravni Fak, Katedra Reg Ekon Spravy, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,zitek@econ.muni.cz; klimova@econ.muni.cz,"Klimova, Viktorie/I-4345-2015; Zitek, Vladimir/I-5431-2015","Klimova, Viktorie/0000-0002-2880-0371; Zitek, Vladimir/0000-0003-4724-2210",,,,,11,4,4,0,8,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZENOTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-5210-9,,,,2010,,,,,,,42,49,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDC19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000312551100006,0

Early efforts to evaluate the impact of this strategy were generally implemented by the agency that also implemented the policy and used small sample, self-report surveys. The paper starts out by discussing the nature and size of travel behaviour changes that are frequently expected in current policy, noting that these are often smaller than the sampling and measurement errors in traditional methods of measuring travel behaviour. The paper then discusses some alternative methods of evaluating voluntary travel behaviour change implementations using panels to reduce sampling error, and using a combination of personal Global Positioning System devices and odometer reading surveys to measure travel patterns. From these considerations, a number of guidelines are suggested for what is required to evaluate Voluntary travel behaviour change. The paper describes three recent case studies in Australia in which such methods have been used and evaluates the methodological approaches used in these studies against the suggested guidelines.

This article evaluates this method as a means to promote commuting by public transport in a field experiment and based on a solid behavioural-theoretical framework. By measuring important antecedents and mediators, the applied approach offers important insights not only on what behavioural outcomes were produced by the intervention, but why they were produced. Copenhagen car owners received a free month travel card, either alone or together with a customised travel plan or a planning intervention. A control group receiving no intervention was also included. Attitudinal variables, car habits and travel behaviour were measured before and immediately after the intervention and again six months later. The only intervention that had an effect was the free month travel card, which led to a significant increase in commuting by public transport. As expected, the effect was mediated through a change in behavioural intentions rather than a change in perceived constraints. As expected, the effect became weaker when the promotion offer had expired, but an effect was still evident five months later. Possible reasons and implications of this are discussed.

To shed light on this question, we consider several possible determinants that may influence the choice of auctions versus negotiations. We then examine a comprehensive data set of private sector building contracts awarded in Northern California during the years 1995-2000. The analysis suggests a number of possible limitations to the use of auctions. Auctions may perform poorly when projects are complex, contractual design is incomplete, and there are few available bidders. Furthermore, auctions may stifle communication between buyers and sellers, preventing the buyer from utilizing the contractor's expertise when designing the project.

Regional job opportunities also have a large effect on the size of a region's population of the creative class. The findings reveal some evidence of a positive relationship among creative class occupation, employment growth, and entrepreneurship at the regional level in a number of European countries.

Empirical studies on the software sector have provided contradictory evidence of the relative importance of different sources of knowledge, the spatial dimension of exchanges of knowledge, and the relevance of different channels for the transmission of knowledge. Recent conceptual work on the geography of knowledge linkages has highlighted that the innovative dynamics of clusters rests on both local and global knowledge flows, that is, the combination of local buzz and global pipelines. However, the buzz-and-pipelines approach fails to provide a precise understanding of the mechanisms by which actors in a cluster gain access to knowledge at different spatial scales. This article goes beyond the buzz-and-pipelines concept and suggests a differentiated typology of knowledge linkages, distinguishing among market relations, formal networks, spillovers, and informal networks. Drawing on a survey of firms and face-to-face interviews with representatives of companies, we demonstrate that in the Vienna software industry, knowledge flows are informal. We found that spillovers and informal networks are highly significant at all spatial scales and are complemented by formalized research-and-development partnerships at the local and national levels. We also show that the character of knowledge linkages is dependent on the nature of innovation. The more radical the innovation, the larger the variety of sources of knowledge and the stronger the diversity of the mechanisms for transferring knowledge.","[Trippl, Michaela; Toedtling, Franz; Lengauer, Lukas] Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Trippl, M (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Inst Reg Dev & Environm, UZA 4,Nordbergstr 15, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",michaela.trippl@wu-wien.ac.at; franz.toedtling@wu-wien.ac.at; lukas.lengauer@wu-wien.ac.at,"Tödtling, Franz/X-3776-2019","Todtling, Franz/0000-0003-1105-5149",,,,,54,146,166,9,111,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Therefore, it is questionable to propose a definition of identities and citizenships that pretends to be totalitarian, absolute and homogenizing, above all, because historically, illustrations have been produced about the domination and homogeneity of subjectivities, creating univocal models of subjects considered objects of cultural analysis. In this sense, it seems reasonable to claim that from these levels of articulation, both identity and citizenship lead us to sacralized truths, mediatised by the inventions of tradition, comprised within the universality and the totality of what is social. Such inventions are precisely those symbolic practices that are commonly accepted as normal and regulating for the phenomenological comprehension of the ontology of being, where diverse social hermeneutics converge. Considering this situation, this essay intends to specify theoretical-reflexive elements for an ethical proposal aimed at fostering a democratic coexistence based on shared interests, that outline what it is to be human in relation, beyond the naturalized social contract; aspects that are discussed from a de-colonial perspective regarding being-and-knowing, facing the understanding that the identities-citizenships connection ought to be assumed from comprehensive, pluralistic and inclusive schemes.","[Vazquez, Belin] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Vazquez, Belin] Univ Zulia, Fac Humanidades & Educ, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Perez Jimenez, Cesar] Univ Oviedo, Enfoque CTS, Oviedo, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; University of Oviedo,"Vázquez, B (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",belinvazquez@gmail.com; perez_jimenez_cesar@hotmail.com,,,,,,,44,2,3,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Data on ex ante road construction prices in Europe suggest a PPP road to be 24% more expensive than a traditionally procured road, ceteris paribus. This estimate resembles reported ex post cost overruns in traditionally procured roads. Thus, the public sector seems to pay a premium on ex ante PPP construction contract prices mostly to cover construction risk transfer.

Subsequently, privacy concerns had an impact on risk-coping behaviors such as seeking out interpersonal advice or additional information (e.g., privacy statement) or refraining from using Web sites that ask for personal information.

We use cross-jurisdiction/pantime data on merger policy to empirically estimate the impact of antitrust actions on future merger frequencies.

Traditionally, researchers have used the average run length (ARL) statistic on results from generated signal occurrences in simulated time series data to calibrate and evaluate these methods, with a focus on timeliness of signal detection. This paper investigates the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) framework, wellknown in the diagnostic decision making literature, as an alternative to ARL analysis for time series monitoring methods. ROC analysis traditionally uses real data to address the inherent tradeoff in signal detection between the true and false positive rates when varying control limits. We illustrate ROC analysis using time series data on crime at the patrol district level in two cities, and use the concept of Pareto frontier ROC curves and reverse functions for methods such as Brown's and Trigg's that have parameters affecting signal-detection performance. We compare the Brown and Trigg methods to three benchmark methods, including one commonly used in practice. The Brown and Trigg methods collapse to the same simple method on the Pareto frontier and dominate the benchmark methods under most conditions. The worst method is the one commonly used in practice.

The research corresponded to a documentary or bibliographic design. The theoretical discussion was centered on the epistemological, conceptual and methodological principles of GST and the feasibility of agro-alimentary security by following a systemic perspective, by reflecting and comparing several authors of agro alimentary thinking. The research made it possible to argue about the feasibility for applying GST to agro-alimentary security by taking into account the contributions that have been derived from different theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject. Conclusions are that the strategies oriented toward achieving agro-alimentary security for the country, from the systemic perspective, must take into account the following interrelated elements: a) the food supply, b) accessibility to food, c) satisfaction of nutritional requirements and d) agro-alimentary policies, both sectorial as well as macroeconomic.","[Jose Perez, Juan] Univ Zulia, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Fac Agron, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Razz, Rosa] Univ Zulia, Fac Agron, Dept Zootecnia, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,,jperez@luz.edu.ve,,,,,,,21,1,2,0,5,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In this context, success of the implementation demands high levels of rationality and procedural justice and low levels of politicizing in the strategic decision-making process.","[Rodriguez-Ponce, Emilio; Pedraja-Rejas, Liliana; Rodriguez-Ponce, Juan] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile",Universidad de Tarapaca,"Rodríguez-Ponce, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile.",erodrigu@uta.cl; lpedraja@uta.cl; jrodrigup@uta.cl,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,24,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

One explanation is that employees' political rights influence corporate governance: systems characterized by strong employees' rights tend to be balanced by strong and concentrated owners. in this approach, the separation between ownership and control is only possible when unions and social democratic parties are sufficiently weak. In this paper we argue that causation runs also in the opposite direction (from strong concentrated ownership to strong employees' protection) and leads to multiple equilibria characterized by alternative co-evolution paths of politics and corporate governance. To empirically assess our theoretical arguments we estimate a simultaneous equation model for workers rights' protection and corporate ownership structure determination by three-stage least squares in a sample of 21 OECD countries. We conclude by arguing that the relative relevance of each flow of causation has important economic policy implications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Socio-economic data for 295 families was studied utilizing frequency distribution and the mean for analyzing them with the program SPSS 9.0, and the family dynamic was evaluated in two cases, applying in-depth interviews in the home. The majority of families with obese children are poor (poverty line and Graffar modified); they present different typology and composition; their members relate more to the obese patient; generally, they are made up of worker parents with nine years of schooling; 70% of their budget is devoted to food and the latter is influenced by the head of the family; food-related behavior reflected cultural and economic aspects; they know the causes and implications of obesity but do not accept it as a problem; they give health priority only when chronic, non-transmittable diseases appear; they consider extemal factors limiting in terms of complying with nutritional treatment. Conclusions are that knowledge of socio-economic, family and environmental characteristics of the obese child empower social and integral care.","[Cabriles, Gonzalez; Jose, William] CANIA, Caracas, Venezuela",,"Cabriles, G (通讯作者)，CANIA, Ave El Algodonal Cruce Con,Ave Intercomunal Antim, Caracas, Venezuela.",wgonzalez_cania@cantv.net,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,5,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

A pooled approach is employed which permits the evaluation of all forecasts for each target variable over 24 horizons simultaneously. It is shown how the pooled approach needs to be set up in order to accommodate the forecasting scheme of the consensus forecasts. Furthermore, the pooled approach is extended by a sequential test for detecting the critical horizon after which the forecast should be regarded as biased. Moreover, heteroscedasticity in the form of target-year-specific variances of macroeconomic shocks is taken into account. The results show that in the analysed period, which was characterised by pronounced macroeconomic shocks, several countries show biased forecasts, especially with forecast horizons of more than 12 months.

More importantly, the results indicate that the PMS mechanisms of professional service firms is not much different from that of mass service firms. The evidence, thus, suggest that PMS is designed in a way that matches the organizational objectives rather than focuses on the uniqueness of service businesses.","[Amir, Amizawati Mohd] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Econ & Business Fac, Sch Accounting, Bangi, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,,amiza@ukm.my; niknazli@iiu.edu.my,"Mohd Amir, Amizawati/HKO-4273-2023","Mohd Amir, Amizawati/0000-0003-2481-9427",,,,,43,0,0,0,4,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,403,423,,,,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500019,0

The problem is formulated as a multiple-criteria location problem. The criteria reflect patients' demand for high-quality and accessible health care. It means that the network should include: (1) high-quality and (2) complex hospitals with a broad range of emergency departments, (3) ensuring good transportation accessibility for most people, and at the same time (4) equitable distributed across the region. The economic criterion emanating from a limited budget is implemented as a constraint on the number of open hospitals. Given a complete network of hospitals and the desired number of hospitals, the model decides (according to the multiple criteria) which hospitals should be closed down. At the same time, it determines the allocation of municipalities to the open hospitals, defining the attraction zone of each hospital. Changing the weights of the objectives, a set of the alternative solutions (hospital networks) may be generated and evaluated. Thus the model can be used as a managerial tool in the process of reducing the hospital network with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the provided medical care. In the case study we have implemented the model in the Slovak Republic conditions. We present two analyses aimed at (1) the impact of reducing the hospital network on the accessibility, and (2) comparison of the mathematical solutions with the current networks of hospitals which have contracts with two biggest health insurance companies.","Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Jánosíková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Transportat Networks, Zilina, Slovakia.",Ludmila.Janosikova@fri.uniza.sk,"Jánošíková, Ľudmila/C-9712-2010","Jánošíková, Ľudmila/0000-0003-3983-6713",,,,,19,4,4,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, in the present version ASPFver.3 a pedestrian agent merely walks straight ahead and simply avoids other agents, and it had been impossible to analyze crowd flows on a large-scale space with a complicated shape, a function is required that enables an agent to walk along a chain of visible target 'waypoints' to each destination, as well as a function the agent keeps the direction to the target. The study introduces newly a target maintaining (Helmsman) function, a concept of waypoint, and update mechanism of targets, and develops the simulator ASPFver4.0 that models an autonomous pedestrian agent on ArtiSoc(KKMAS). The performances tests of these additional functions of ASPFver4.0 are shown. Especially, to successfully model pedestrians' shop-around behavior in a Patio-style shopping mall at Asunal Kanayama, Nagoya, ASPFver4.1 has been also developed by introducing an optimization function of routes by Dijkstra method, and implemented several parameters based on data for survey of the pedestrians' behaviors in this mall. Through the test of four simulation cases; (1) weekday case, (2) weekday double case, (3) holiday case, and (4) at time of a music event in holiday case, the performance of ASPFver4.1 was also verified. Due to a series of these version-ups, we can conclude that ASPF is now available for analyzing crowd flows and density in space with complicated shapes.","[Kaneda, Toshiyuki] Nagoya Inst Technol, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [He, Yanfeng] Hitachi Ltd, Tokyo 187, Japan",Nagoya Institute of Technology; Hitachi Limited,"Kaneda, T (通讯作者)，Nagoya Inst Technol, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",kaneda@nitech.ac.jp; he_yanfeng@hotmail.com,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-4-431-87435-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,107,118,,,,,,12,Economics; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Sociology,BLU06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271014200009,0

Nevertheless, some Chinese automotive companies have ambitions to develop their international business over time. At present, most multinational automotive companies face major strategic problems. From a Chinese automotive perspective, how will these problems impact on possible international growth strategies? Specifically, can innovation help? If so, what are its key components? Equally, is there a case for a more entrepreneurial global strategy by Chinese companies? If so, what does this mean in practice? To explore these questions, we have undertaken a study of the leading global automotive companies and compared them with the leading Chinese firms from a competitive resource-based strategy perspective.

Advertising is commercial promotion of goods, services, companies and ideas, usually performed by an identified sponsor, and performed through a variety of media. Internet advertising is a recent phenomenon. Marketers see internet advertising as a part of an overall promotional strategy. The majority of marketing directors in the world plan to involve the internet into their marketing mix. The paper presents results of the marketing research realised by University of Pardubice in conjunction with University of Zilina. The aim of this research was find out the views of Czech internet users relating with internet advertising. This marketing research of Czech internet users was realised through so-called CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing) method, which is taken as the most up to date way of interviewing of respondent based on internet utilization. There were two basic segments defined as a target group of our research, namely business segment (i.e. firms) and non-business segment (i.e. single internet users). Characteristic sample of this marketing research was random sample of 400 respondents (200 from business segment and 200 from non-business segment) because of overall financial demands of this research and requirement on quick primary data obtaining and follow-up processing. The data obtained from the electronic questionnaire were divided into six categories to both business and non-business segments: 1. Segment identification. 2. Access to the internet and its utilization. 3. Types of internet advertising and perception of advertising by internet users. 4. Demands made on internet advertising. 5. General attitude to internet advertising. 6. SPAM. Some interesting findings resulted from this research, for example to both segments the most acceptable and efficient form of internet advertising is an animated banner. Respondents from both of these segments also thought that successful internet advertising should be credible, understandable, original and polite and also should contain important information related to advertised goods or services.","[Madlenak, Radovan] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Zilina, Slovakia; [Svadlenka, Libor] Univ Pardubice, Dopravni Fak Jana Pernera, Katedra Dopravniho Managementu Mkt Logist, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Zilina; University of Pardubice,"Madlenák, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Zilina, Slovakia.",Radovan.Madlenak@fpedas.utc.sk; libor.svadlenka@upce.cz,"Madlenak, Radovan/A-5369-2011","Madlenak, Radovan/0000-0002-4376-0830",,,,,8,16,16,1,32,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

These concerns have led to substantial interest in promoting various regulatory and voluntary compliance policies to further biodiversity on private forests. These policies, however, might result in additional cost to forestland owners. In this paper, we estimate the opportunity cost of adopting various biodiversity-friendly forest practices. We do this in the context of slash pine, a dominant commercial tree plantation species in Florida. Results suggest that prescribed burning, invasive species control, maintaining streamside buffer zones, and extending timber harvest beyond the optimal rotation age would significantly decrease the profitability of slash pine forestry. If the major objective of landowners is to maximize profits, results indicate that they are less likely to adopt these practices at socially desirable levels without a policy support. More specifically, results suggest that an annual payment of $38-83 per hectare is required for landowners to adopt these practices. The paper further argues that application of mere command-and-control approaches to implement these practices may result in conversion of private forests to other competitive land uses.

J,"Mazel, J",,,,"Mazel, Jaromir",,,CUSTOMER VALUE AND COMPANY NETWORKS,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,Czech,Article,,,,,,Company Networks; Cooperations; Customer Value,,"In recent years, a new attitude about consume market trend has become perceptible. Instead of looking for products, clients are looking for solutions. The key to success lies in creating flexible company networks that promise continuous innovation as answer to customer needs, minimum time-to-market and growth despite often difficult market conditions. However, for the entrepreneurship, this requires flexible product-focused factories with sufficient economies of scale. Synergy comes from creating networks. Conglomerates are nothing new, but they have not always had a good name. For many they are synonymous with slowness and lack of focus. But surely, conglomerates are intended to be worth (much) more then the sum of their parts. Indeed - and they can be: if they manage to create a competitive advantage and synergies throughout the organisation which is an ongoing challenge for management and managers. What are the key qualities for the successful manager profile? The answer is: to be effective. However, a person cannot learn to be like another person; but to a certain extent, it can learn to act like that person. Unfortunately, it is not so simple. Fortunately, it can be learned. Analysis of the bilateral relationship between enterprises and their customers allocates the importance of corporate networks within this context. Creating flexible company networks is the determining factor that promises to add substantial value for customers and so retroactively also for the company - although it points to a much broader approach than in the past. And even though the business model is still young. I definitely expect this business model to gain wider acceptance. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyse this phenomenon, make a contribution toward a better understanding and, finally, to propose ways in which the Customer Value approach can be converted into management of corporate networks.","Univ St Gallen, CH-9000 St Gallen, Svycarsko, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Mazel, J (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dufourstr 50, CH-9000 St Gallen, Svycarsko, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,32,3,3,1,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Oviatt and McDougall's original description of the phenomenon raised this important question, but subsequent empirical studies have yet to provide an answer. The uniqueness of INVs is important to define the phenomenon, and legitimize international entrepreneurship as a distinct area of scholarship. Viewing INVs from the perspective of organizational form suggests new theoretical perspectives, research questions and methods. Thus the empirical literature on organizational form focuses upon decision rights, and tracks measures such as organizational members, channels for information and control, governance and agency. Introducing such measures may provide new and interesting ways of characterizing INVs as compared with the extant literature, and promote comparative research with other types of organization.","[McNaughton, Rod B.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,,,"McNaughton, Rod B/AAF-2181-2020","McNaughton, Rod B/0000-0002-8949-7716",,,,,0,0,0,1,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,185,190,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900014,0

Growth of this sector is very important, but financial stability of individual subjects acting on this market are also very important. Financial stability and its analysis have become one of the key task for the Czech National Bank (CNB) and other national and international institutions during the past few years. Nowadays insurance companies use a large scale of indicators for assessing financial stability. The disclosure of weaknesses in a financial sector and its linkages to development on financial markets and in economic development can contibute to constraint risk connected with it. As a final effect, this can lead to stronger resistance of the financial system against shocks. As indicators of financial stability power in the insurance business are above all considered return on equity, solvency, and capital accuracy. These ones are generally acknowledged financial stability indicators of insurance companies, which are included in European Commission study called Solvency II. For example the insurance companies in the Czech insurance market fulfil criterion of solvency (according to audit results for the year 2006) very well, because their own sources were higher within the level of required solvency rate (100%). Aggregate disponible solvency for all insurance companies was according to recent legal rules three times higher than required solvency in the market of life insurance and 3,3 times in the market of nonlife insurance. This paper deals with the assesment of insurance companie's financial stability in the Czech insurance market from the point of view of return on equity, solvency, and capital accuracy indicators.

Supporters of Geographical Economics consider their mathematical formalism as a conceptual proposal that creates an authoritative context for the development of a theory of economic geography. In contrast, in this paper, it is shown that with the methodological innovations, more convincing explanations are made and relevant formulation of the questions is indeed taken up. However, it limits the logical consistency and extent of validity considerably. The claim of an exact science, as it still prevailed in the old neoclassical regional economic theory, is omitted in the practice of the Geographical Economics. The results of mathematical modelling can be, however, meaningfully classified in today's mainstream economic geography, the methodology of which aims at the explanation of dynamic, socially integrated and historically developing capitalism.","Univ Munster, Inst Geog Arbeitsgebiet Stadt & Reg Entwicklung, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Scheuplein, C (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Geog Arbeitsgebiet Stadt & Reg Entwicklung, Schlosspl 7, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",christoph.scheuplein@uni-muenster.de,"Scheuplein, Christoph/U-7474-2019","Scheuplein, Christoph/0000-0003-2565-2761",,,,,81,1,1,0,4,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

When the going get tough, the tough simply just does not get going, instead it is time to change everything, to forget what went wrong and move on. It is this simple mentality of sweep the garbage under the carpet that makes the main difference between a competitive free market economy and what we have here and now. Changing the poll system was promised to the people as the long awaited victory against corrupted politicians and other categories of undesirable leaders and the people bought it and believe it will be just as advertised. Practically this article analyses the Romanian electorate and the way in which it is prepared for the new poll system and ready to use its advantages in a proper manner. The amount of information about this particular system, the general pinion about it and the changes it will generate, the main benefits of its implementation are some of the main interests of the authors. Determining these factors can be a rather tricky task in a turbulent social environment such as the one specific to the Romanian electorate in general and the inhabitants of Bucharest in particular. Those unique characteristics are nothing more than the results of a troubled evolution in the last decades and, of course, of the mixture of different types of people generated by the economic gravitational phenomenon around the capital city. The diversity of inhabitants can be underlined by using a variety of classifications like ethnic affiliation, religion, origin (as in part of the country), nationality, education, income, qualification.., and this only strengthens up the old saying no one is really from Bucharest. The impact of various media on the citizens strongly contributes to the information / misinformation regarding the new system, and the political factions are using the marketing research more often in order to have more and more efficient campaigns.","[Tatu, Cristi; Catoiu, Iacob; Vranceanu, Diana] ASE Mkt, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,cristitatu@mk.ase.ro; iacob_catoiu@ase.ro; dvranceanu@ase.ro,"Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Diana, Vranceanu/E-1737-2013","Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493;",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,251,261,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS71,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984100035,0

We analyze and synthesize the evidence from managerial accounting, philosophy of social science, organizational theory, strategic management and mental modeling. The analysis indicates that the dynamic, complex and uncertain environment of their operation may challenge any reliance upon valid causal models. Additionally, due to cognitive limitations and judgmental biases, managers may fail to trace correct cause-and-effect understanding of the value creation in their organizations.

The main results show that Romanian companies are oriented rather to competitive approach than to anti-competitive strategies. However, the implementation of marketing strategies is still reduced Thus, the competitive strength of many Romanian companies is low.

The structural coupling argument emphasizes the right strategies linking foreign technology with domestic conditions, given the governance structure of the industry. The paper compares the processes of different strategic coupling in the Korean and Taiwanese PC industries during the 1980s, individual but overlapping technology licences of big Korean firms versus joint licences by the public research institutes in Taiwan, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) as the momentum for the vertical integration within firms in Korea versus those for the expansion of subcontracting network in Taiwan, and overseas R&D investment on an individual firm basis in Korea versus co-funding and joint ventures in Taiwan. The Korean and Taiwanese cases have implications for other developing countries. The chances of successful technology upgrading are high when domestic assets such as industry structure, government policy and human resources are properly combined with the strategic needs of global lead firms in the industry. It is important for firms and governments in developing countries to find suitable ways of strategic coupling based on a good understanding of the global governance structure of the industry, as well as their domestic advantages.","Konkuk Univ, Seoul 143701, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Bae, Y (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, 1 Hwayang Dong, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",ybae@konkuk.ac.kr,,,,,,,51,3,3,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We identify three measures used to value crowding (a time multiplier, a monetary value per time unit and a monetary value per trip), and associated ways of representing crowding in stated preference experiments. Although a number of different types of crowding in terms of location are identified, namely in-vehicle, access-way, entrance and platform/station, the majority of reviewed studies investigate only in-vehicle crowding. Despite the different characteristics of the reviewed studies, they all report that crowding would increase the value of travel time savings, which can be viewed as an additional component of generalised time. This paper also comments on the role that the WTP for crowding reduction can play in project appraisal, and suggests some important avenues for future public transport crowding valuation research.

These schemes typically involve the reallocation of road space for exclusive use by buses, presenting commuters with potentially competing incentives: buses on BRT routes can run faster and more efficiently than buses running in general traffic, potentially attracting commuters to public transit and reducing congestion through modal shift from cars. However, a secondary impact may also exist; remaining car users may be presented with less congested road space, improving their journey times and simultaneously acting as an incentive for some bus-users to revert to the car. To investigate the potential for these primary and secondary impacts, we develop a prototype agent-based model to investigate the nature of these interactions and how they play out into system-wide patterns of modal share and travel times. The model allows us to test the effects of multiple assumptions about the behaviors of individual agents as they respond to different incentives introduced by BRT policy changes, such as the implementation of exclusive bus lanes, increased bus frequency, pre-boarding ticket machines and express stops, separately and together. We find that, under our assumptions, these policies can result in significant improvements in terms of individual journey times, modal shift, and length of rush hour. We see that the addition of an exclusive bus lane results in significant improvements for both car users and bus riders. Informed with appropriate empirical data relating to the behavior of individual agents, the geography and the specific policy interventions, the model has the potential to aid policymakers in examining the effectiveness of different BRT schemes, applied to broader environments.

First, the paper presents a method to calculate the walking distance related to transit trips, and a totally disaggregate trip assignment model. The walking distance involved in every transit trip is then associated to the individuals' characteristics to estimate the number of steps made by the population in the whole transit system. Results show that, in average, a transit trip involves 1250 steps, required to access and egress the network as well as to transfer between routes or modes. Thus, a round trip represents 2500 steps, which account for 25% of the recommended volume of physical activity per day. Hence, analysis shows that the volume of walking varies according to attributes of the traveler (general decrease with age, higher for men) and of the trip (study and work trip involve more steps, the use of train generates more steps). A regression model confirms that these variables significantly affect the number of steps involved in transit trips. Such positive outcome, for the traveler himself, is an innovative argument to promote the use of transit that is also aligned with current sustainable transportation goals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, the indicator is applied to two different examples: one, a Spanish region with low economic productivity and another in Africa. Since the traditional poverty line has no meaning here, a new method is used to compute a poverty hyper plane replacing the role the poverty line performed in classic studies.

However, they are overwhelmingly considered in financial and economic terms, neglecting important dimensions, such as gender and patriarchal family structures. This article contributes to rectifying this oversight by analyzing flows of remittances resulting from Albanian migration to neighboring Greece. We draw on a detailed questionnaire survey with 350 remittance-recipient households in rural southeast Albania and 45 in-depth interviews with a selection of these respondents and with remitters living in the Greek city of Thessaloniki. We found that gender is interlinked with generation and life-course stages within the context of Albanian patriarchal norms and that remittances are shaped accordingly. Although remitting to older parents is a filial duty for unmarried sons, upon marriage only the youngest son has this responsibility-other sons send small amounts as tokens of respect and love. Sending remittances is overwhelmingly seen as a male thing. Single young women rarely migrate on their own for work abroad. Meanwhile any remittances sent by married daughters to their parents are considered unofficial, referred to as  coffee money. Within nuclear households, some increased power-sharing among husband remitters and wife recipients takes place. However, the latter are far from passive recipients, since they struggle to combine caring for children and the elderly with farmwork or day labor. We conclude that a deeper understanding of how remittances are gendered can be gained by placing their analysis within the migratory and sociocultural context into which they are embedded.","[King, Russell] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Castaldo, Adriana; Vullnetari, Julie] Univ Sussex, Sussex Ctr Migrat Res, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"King, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",R.King@sussex.ac.uk; A.Castaldo@sussex.ac.uk; J.Vullnetari@sussex.ac.uk,,"Vullnetari, Julie/0000-0003-1578-8622",,,,,89,24,25,1,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We show that the principal optimally designs contracts to create ambiguity about agents' abilities. This may make it optimal to contract on relative performance measures, even though the extant rationales for such schemes are absent. Linking the structure of contracts to organizational design, we show that it can be optimal for the principal to adopt an opaque organization where performance is not verifiable, despite the constraints that this imposes on contracts.

The adoption of a standard can, however, raise competition concerns. After the adoption of the standard, the chosen technology may lack effective substitutes. The owner of an intellectual property (IP) right essential to the technology may indeed use the additional market power that may be gained through standardization (competitors being absent ex-post) to charge higher prices to locked-in licensees. To mitigate such a hold-up risk, standard setting organizations usually require patent holders to disclose their relevant IP rights ex-ante and/or to commit to license IP on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. This article suggests a methodology to assess whether FRAND commitments are violated, from a competition perspective. The proposed methodology extends the framework proposed by Cecilio Madero and Nicholas Banasevic by outlining four necessary conditions for an ex-post licensing behavior to be considered anticompetitive, in violation of FRAND commitments.","European Commiss, DG Competit, Chief Economist Team, London, England",,"Mariniello, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Competit, Chief Economist Team, London, England.",mario.mariniello@ec.europa.eu,,"Mariniello, Mario/0000-0002-8695-8708",,,,,13,22,22,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In the research we used a classical econometric model for aggregated series of data of a group of transition countries, and individually for Croatia and Poland. We determine a significant regression interconnection between fiscal and balance of payments deficits for the group of transition countries, and individually for Croatia, with the exception of Poland and Eurozone. Furthermore, we explore the interdependency of these deficits with the growth rate of gross domestic product of analysed CEE countries and Croatia, where we obtain only partially significant regression results. The final conclusion of the analysis is the existence of significant inverse relationship of balance of payments and fiscal deficits of aggregates of transition economies and Croatia. Growth rates of gross domestic product loosely depend on the balance of payments deficit of groups of transition countries, which cannot be concluded for Croatia. In the case of relationship between the growth rate of gross domestic product with current budget deficits of the analyzed group of transition countries we do not obtain satisfactory significance. From the entire analysis we can conclude that the policy of reducing the balance of payments deficit with the secondary goal of reduction of budget deficit and a decrease in foreign debt, in present condition, has a pro-recessionary effect for the majority of transition countries.",,,"Zdunic, S (通讯作者)，Stjepana Ljubica Vojvode 12, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",stjepan.zdunic1@zg.t-com.hr,,,,,,,29,2,3,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Estimates of this hypothesis use e. g. overall cash data. But, for the case of Germany, the growing DM cash amounts in circulation did not only accompany transactions in the national economy, they also disseminated in hoards and in international uses. A series of adjusted cash figures is derived which shows the maximum dimension of national cash uses either for official or black activities. The adjusted cash figures in general grew less fast than overall cash, private consumption, GDP or M1 respectively. They even diminished relative to sales figures which often are accused of being a basis for black activities. This enhances the presumption that, contrary to some contentions in the literature, black activities during the times of the DM-regime played a minor or even decreasing role in Germany.","Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-55268 Nieder Olm, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Graf, G (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Weinbergstr 32, D-55268 Nieder Olm, Germany.",graf-a-g-n-o@t-online.de,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Our proposed updating procedure considers the correlation and dynamics of bookings both within the booking horizon and between successive product instances. The approach is tested on real hotel reservation data and shows a significant improvement in forecast accuracy. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The spatial distribution of amenities is shown to be a major determinant of urban development patterns; and the role of amenities is reinforced by increasing returns, which promote agglomeration and human capital accumulation. Cases of partial urbanization and full urbanization of population are distinguished from each other and the economy's possible transformation from one state to another is investigated. The spatial distribution of amenities and increasing returns affect human capital accumulation, which affects the trajectory of economic growth.

When workers differ according to the value imputed to leisure, we show that, under some conditions, two wages emerge in equilibrium. The commuting cost not only affects the land market but also the labor market through wages. Workers' productivity also affects housing prices and this impact can be positive or negative depending on the location in the city. We then run some numerical simulations to reproduce some stylized facts about the labor-market outcomes of black and white workers. We find that a reduction in commuting costs for all workers reduces the unemployment rate of white workers and the profit of all firms but increases the wage of all workers (black and white) and raises the fraction of firms posting the high wage.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Zenou, Yves] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Zenou, Y (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",yves.zenou@ne.su.se,,"Zenou, Yves/0000-0001-6516-0812",,,,,43,7,8,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Data collection techniques were the survey and the interview. The instruments were validated by five (5) social management experts, obtaining a 0.99 reliability. Results indicate that in both business social responsibility dimensions, the elements that make it up do not constitute an ideal framework for considering the Lago Mall Shopping Center to be a socially responsible business.

Level of service (LOS) attributes representing the performance of transportation system and characteristics of travelers including their households are major factors determining the travel demand. Information on actual choice and characteristics of travelers is obtained from a travel survey at an individual level. Since accurate measurement of LOS attributes such as travel time and cost components for different travel modes at an individual level is critical, they are normally obtained from network models. The network-based LOS attributes introduce measurement errors to individual trips thereby causing errors in variables problem in a disaggregate model of travel demand. This paper investigates the possible structure and magnitude of biases introduced to the coefficients of a multinomial logit model of travel mode choice due to random measurement errors in two variables, namely, access/egress time for public transport and walking and cycling distance to work. A model was set up that satisfies the standard assumptions of a multinomial logit model. This model was estimated on a data set from a travel survey on the assumption of correctly measured variables. Subsequently random measurement errors were introduced and the mean values of the parameters from 200 estimations were presented and compared with the original estimates. The key finding in this paper is that errors in variables result in biased parameter estimates of a multinomial logit model and consequently leading to poor policy decisions if the models having biased parameters are applied in policy and planning purposes. In addition, the paper discusses some potential remedial measures and identifies research topics that deserve a detailed investigation to overcome the problem. The paper therefore significantly contributes to bridge the gap between theory and practice in transport. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using 431 road projects evaluated in the integrated transport planning process in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany (IGVP NRW) this paper examines the evaluation dimensions traffic safety (fatalities) and travel time in private passenger transport. The unit values of traffic fatalities and travel time are varied, and the effects of the variations on the rank order of the projects are examined. Target conflicts between safety and travel time are studied as well as the contribution of these two dimensions to the total benefit values. The sensitivity analysis shows that the evaluation results are fairly stable against variations in unit values of travel time and fatalities. The relevance of traffic safety in terms of its contribution to total benefit as well as in terms of the unit value appears to be relatively minor. The unit value of travel time is higher than that of lifetime. Some projects turn out as feasible in the evaluation even though they are likely to increase the number of fatalities. The paper therefore suggests the higher weighting of traffic safety in CBA. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, possible implications of main productivity factors impact on further export competitiveness have been foreseen.","[Travkina, Irina; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Travkina, I (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",irina.travkina@vgtu.lt; manuela@vgtu.lt,"/I-3713-2019; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022","/0000-0002-9667-3730; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730",,,,,32,18,19,8,31,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Two key innovations have been registration and notification laws, which, respectively, require that offenders provide identifying information to law enforcement and mandate that this information be made fully public. We study how registration and notification affect the frequency and incidence across victims of reported sex offenses. We present evidence that registration reduces the frequency of reported sex offenses against local victims (for example, neighbors) by keeping police informed about local sex offenders. Notification also appears to reduce crime, not by disrupting the criminal conduct of convicted sex offenders, but by deterring nonregistered offenders. We find that notification may actually increase recidivism. This latter finding, consistent with the idea that notification imposes severe costs that offset the benefits to offenders of forgoing criminal activity, is significant, given that notification's purpose is recidivism reduction.","[Prescott, J.

In order to measure the full impact of subcontracting relationships on innovation, we take into account the possible interaction between process and product innovations. The empirical test is based on 93 small firms operating in pure subcontracting industries. Using a bivariate probit model, we give evidence that process and product innovations are not independent choices. The test confirms the positive impact of collaborative outsourcing agreement on the subcontractor's probability to innovate whatever the type of innovation. Finally, the results show that process and product innovations are reinforced by different inter-organizational practices and tools as well as distinct absorptive capabilities. This suggests important implications for subcontractors' competitive position.","Univ Savoie, IREGE, Innovat & Networks Grp, F-74942 Annecy Le Vieux, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Bocquet, R (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie, IREGE, Innovat & Networks Grp, 9 Rue Arc En Ciel,BP 240, F-74942 Annecy Le Vieux, France.",rachel.bocquet@univ-savoie.fr,,,,,,,52,8,8,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Particularly the early phases of NPD processes are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity, a phenomenon commonly recognized in literature as the fuzzy front end of NPD. A clear understanding of the term fuzziness is lacking in NPD literature, but some terms that have been used to describe it are uncertainty (Moenaert, De Meyer, Souder, & Deschoolmeester, 1995; Reid & de Brentani, 2004; Zhang & Doll, 2001), ambiguity (Kim & Wilemon, 2002), chaos (Koen et al., 2001), and complexity (Khurana & Rosenthal, 1998). The term fuzzy is hence used to label situations characterized by lack of accurate knowledge. Extending Zack's (2001) model of knowledge problems, this paper provides a framework to classify components of fuzziness and to relate earlier scholars' use of concepts such as ambiguity, equivocality, lack-of-clarity and uncertainty to each other. Since presence of ambiguity is one form of lack of knowledge, I argue that resolving ambiguity is associated with knowledge creation. Furthermore, I discuss how it is possible to separate useless from useful ambiguity and thus purposefully exploit ambiguity in a targeted manner to create new knowledge in innovation. I substantiate this claim by comparing research by Brun and colleagues (Brun, S ae tre, & Gjelsvik, 2008, 2009) about how ambiguity occurs and develops in NPD processes, with Nonaka's (1994) model of knowledge creation in innovation and Kolb's (1984) model of experiential learning. This theoretical paper has two contributions. Firstly, it draws on literature from organizational and knowledge management literature and provides a framework to classify the different components of fuzziness. Secondly, it draws on literature from innovation management, knowledge management and learning theory and provides an account of how ambiguity-as a component of fuzziness-has a useful role in the knowledge-building process in NPD.","[Brun, Eric] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Ctr Innovat Res, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,,eric.brun@uis.no,"Brun, Eric/AAD-9071-2021",,,,,,30,0,0,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,159,166,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800021,0

The versatile and interactive nature of the Internet medium represents new opportunities and challenges for the advertising agencies that transcend their traditional role as developers of creative contents and campaigns. The paper discusses how this transformation process affects services in the new online market communication regime. Based on a case study on how the Internet affects the advertising industry and its related actors the paper argues that the introduction and growth of Internet-based market communication leads to a convergence of creative, strategic and technical services. It is suggested that this represents a new production and market communication space in which the end consumer often plays a more pro-active and participatory role. The paper argues that the convergence of skills and services across advertising and information and communications technology can be viewed as a Jacobian cluster mutation across related and co-evolving industrial agglomerations.

We apply this framework to examine two new phenomena: the internationalization of firms from emerging nations and the technological convergence, both of which occur in an industrial sector where innovation is a key success factor. Several dichotomies used in innovation research were blended into a new theoretical framework The technological-invention vs. socio-economic-impact dichotomy (which is at the very center of the generally accepted definition of innovation) was related to the technology-push vs. demand-pull dichotomy (which corresponds, on the one hand, to the firms' market disruption capabilities, and, on the other hand, to the management of the competitive and market forces that conversely impact them). The innovation strategies extracted from the literature on the subject of innovation were classified into four functional quadrants comprising: Market (selection), Technology, Organization and Marketing. A study of 44 firms was carried out, which involved the meta-analysis of 87 case-studies with the multiple-case-study method The qualitative information contained in the case-studies was converted into quantitative data using a codification instrument based on our framework The results show that challengers from other sectors conformed less to the marketing strategies. In addition, challengers from emerging nations conformed more to these strategies, while conforming less to the technological strategies.

Arguments that support or criticize the current system of intellectual property rights protection are based on economic and philosophical perspectives. Own empirical research based on the most recent data from the EU and other countries support the substantial importance of strong intellectual property protection for innovativeness. However, the results cannot stipulate whether the old reward system is the best alternative. Second, alternative mechanisms to stimulate innovativeness and technological progress are introduced and analysed.

The article focuses also on the role of the academic area in the development of the learning and creative society, contributing to the design of new knowledge and technology embedded products and services, and new advanced organizational processes. This paper is based on a previous research project (Knowledge management architecture in environmental, social and economic areas, designed to support the sustainable regional development strategy'', financed under the National Research Programme 2007-2013, code: 896, contract 383/2007), and especially on the quantitative and qualitative results related to the role of the education in general and of the universities in particular for the sustainable development. The study took into consideration the specific Romanian situation, compared with the other European countries. The analysis demonstrated the major contribution of the education, especially the higher education, in achieving Lisbon indicators and also in ameliorating the human development. The paper is based on a desk research, involving a quantitative analysis (statistical data for the Romania and other European countries) and also a qualitative study. The concrete results consist in an improved trinomial model for a better communication among the main actors of the sustainable development: research and education entities, public administration and governance entities and market and NGOs entities. The knowledge transfer from the academic area to the market and governance area stand also for an important outcome of the research. The results of this research have a direct impact on the sustainable development and on the competitiveness. A major contribution could be the impact for the governance in order to create a knowledge-based decisional system.

The new realm characterizing markets allows for the possibility to find sustained or temporary competitive advantage across firms that in turn affects their performance and innovative capabilities. The leading hypothesis in strategic management suggests that firms' sustained superior performance arises from sustained or temporary competitive advantage. In this sense, some scholars have argued that firms in hypercompetitive markets should be able to develop temporary competitive advantage. The possibility to find (sustained or temporary) competitive advantage and dynamic capabilities allow thus for an accurate explanation on firm performance. Dynamic capabilities are likely to be essential to the survival of firms in industrial environments which can be characterized as hypercompetitive that allow for temporary competitive advantage. In emerging economies, local firms should be engaged in developing their own dynamic capabilities and competitive advantages if they want to successfully compete in markets. This research inquires about the nature of competitive advantage and firm performance in emerging economies. The Law of Proportionate Effects served as a referent model to explain growth dynamics of firms. We test for the validity of the Law of Proportionate Effects given the possibility to find competitive advantages into Mexican firms. The research is developed in two steps. We test firstly for the validity of the Gibrat's Law (dynamic capabilities) through applying three different panel unit root tests to data from industrial sectors in Mexico. Second, we test for the existence or not of sustained competitive advantages into Mexican firms. The theoretical approach adopted in this research supports the idea that dynamic capabilities are more likely to be developed in industrial sectors where local firms are more abundant. Evidence supports the idea that multinational firms in emerging markets would be just transferring their own capabilities to their local subsidiaries to compete in these markets.","[Gomez, Mario; Carlos Rodriguez, Jose] Inst Invest Econ & Empresariales, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico",,,gomez_ininee@hotmail.com; rodriguez_ininee@hotmail.com,"Gómez, Mario/U-2587-2017; Rodríguez, José Carlos/D-6797-2016","Rodríguez, José Carlos/0000-0002-0942-8017",,,,,48,1,1,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,400,407,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800049,0

Park and Ride (P&R) is one such system implemented widely in the UK, especially in historic towns and cities with limited road and parking space in the centre. Some cities (e.g. Rome and London) have also implemented forms of 'access control' to reduce congestion and/or pollution in central areas. This paper describes a feasibility analysis of a unique application studied for potential implementation in Southampton the integration of P&R with access control on a key corridor in Eastern Southampton where traffic demand is likely to increase significantly in the coming years because of new housing developments. The system concept is a P&R facility with express buses to the City centre, keeping the corridor free-flowing for these buses (and other traffic) using a combination of bus lanes and access control. Following an outline of the policy context and system design, this paper then describes the corridor and network modelling undertaken to predict the impacts of the scheme and alternatives of it. This has been based mainly on the CONTRAM dynamic traffic assignment model, which covers the whole of Southampton and its surrounding motorway network. The assessment of the benefits of the various options in this scheme showed that the combination of P&R with signalised access control was the best option to improve the movement of people on the corridor.

Insights from the French Forest Sector Model,JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon storage; Biomass energy; Forest sector modeling,SEQUESTRATION; PRODUCTS,"As European countries move towards steeper cuts in greenhouse gases emissions, questions are mounting, in the forest sector, about the best balance between policies that favor carbon sequestration in biomass, and policies that favor fossil-fuel substitution, with potentially conflicting implications for forest management. We provide insights on this debate by comparing the environmental and economic implications for the French forest sector of a stock policy (payment for sequestration in situ), a substitution policy (subsidy to fuelwood consumption), and a combination thereof - all calibrated on the same price of carbon. To do so, we use the French Forest Sector Model (FFSM), which combines a dynamic model of French timber resource and a dynamic partial-equilibrium model of the French forest sector. Simulations over the 2010-2020 period show that the stock policy is the only one that performs better than business-as-usual in terms of carbon. In the substitution policy, cumulative substitution benefits are not sufficient to offset carbon losses in standing forests over this biologically short, but politically relevant period of time. And the combination policy does not perform better. However, the stock policy has negative impacts on consumers welfare, its costs are increasing over time as carbon is accumulated, and it raises political economy questions about the negotiability of the reference against which excess carbon is measured.

We start with the well-known normal dynamic linear model, also known as the normal linear state space model, for which sequential state learning is available in closed form via standard Kalman filter and Kalman smoother recursions. Particle filters are then introduced as a set of Monte Carlo schemes that enable Kalman-type recursions when normality or linearity or both are abandoned. The seminal bootstrap filter (BF) of Gordon, Salmond and Smith (1993) is used to introduce the SMC jargon, potentials and limitations. We also review the literature on parameter learning, an area that started to attract much attention from the particle filter community in recent years. We give particular attention to the Liu West filter (2001), Storvik filter (2002) and particle learning (PL) of Carvalho, Johannes, Lopes and Poison (2010). We argue that the BF and the auxiliary particle filter (APF) of Pitt and Shephard (1999) define two fundamentally distinct directions within the particle filter literature. We also show that the distinction is more pronounced with parameter learning and argue that PL, which follows the APF direction, is an attractive extension. One of our contributions is to sort out the research from BF to APF (during the 1990s). from APF to now (the 2000s) and from Liu-West filter to Storvik filter to PL. To this end, we provide code in R for all the examples of the paper. Readers are invited to find their own way into this dynamic and active research arena.

J,"Moore, S",,,,"Moore, Stephen",,,Understanding and managing anti-social behaviour on public transport through value change: The considerate travel campaign,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Anti-social behaviour; Public transport; Tolerance; Crime; Policing,CRIME,"This article explores anti-social behaviour on public transport, regarded as a major problem by most transport authorities in Britain. It has been estimated that a passenger increase of more than 11.5% in Britain could be achieved if public concerns over anti-social behaviour could be allayed. The article starts by noting that combating anti-social behaviour has generally been seen as the remit of police and enforcement officers. However, research carried out for Transport for London indicates that for the majority of the travelling public, the forms of anti-social behaviour, which concerns them is more likely to be low-level behaviour, ranging from groups of young people behaving boisterously to people eating food or talking loudly on mobile phones. Using the 'problem solving approach' structure, the article then examines the process by which Transport for London has partially 'uncoupled' anti-social behaviour from criminal activities and then treated the two issues as related but distinct. As a result, a series of policing and enforcement initiatives have been introduced to prevent crime, but a different, unique approach has been taken towards controlling anti-social behaviour. Rather than being tackled as a form of low level criminality, antisocial behaviour is viewed as the outcome of clashing values about appropriate behaviour on public transport. Therefore, the answer to anti-social behaviour lies in minimising these values clashes, rather than concentrating on enforcement against perpetrators. The article describes the resulting large-scale media campaign the Considerate Traveller Campaign, which was launched in 2008 with the aim of increasing tolerance and consideration for others. The article concludes with a summary of the early evaluation of the campaign, which suggests that it is having some positive effect in changing values and argues that in the longer run, it may be possible to amend the behaviour on public transport without relying so heavily on enforcement measures.

This raises the question of whether the privileged rules of Article 106 TFEU apply alongside the specific public procurement rules, which are set out in secondary EU legislation. Looking at Article 106 TFEU through public procurement spectacles Skovgaard Olykke identifies the determination of 'what is a contract' as a central issue for the application of the public procurement Directives. Where SGEIs are provided through in-house arrangements there will not be a 'contract' and where an SGEI is entrusted through a legislative act, this will also not satisfy the requirements of a 'contract'. A different set of problems arise where the entrustment of a SGEI take place by a service concession. The procurement Directives, subject service concessions to a special regime and service concessions are exempted from the Directives but under tight conditions. This raises the question as to whether Article 106(2) TFEU could be applied. Although this question has been debated in the academic literature, it has not been explicitly applied in litigation before the ECJ. However, Skovgaard Olykke argues that in recent cases Article 106(2) TFEU could be the basis for the rulings, creating a new approach to contracts where SGEI are provided even where the Teckal criteria (see ECJ, Case C-84/03 Commission v. Spain [2005] ECR I-139, para 39; cf. ECJ, Case C-480/06 Commission v. Germany [2009] ECR I-4747) are not fulfilled. If this is the outcome of the case law, it gives a renewed role for Article 106(2) TFEU at a time when many commentators are questioning its continued existence in the TFEU.","[Olykke, Grith Skovgaard] Juridisk Inst, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",,,goe.jur@cbs.dk,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,3,TMC ASSER PRESS,J N DEN HAAG,"R J SCHIMMELPENNINCKLAAN 20-22, J N DEN HAAG, 2517, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-6704-733-3,LEG ISS SERV GEN INT,,,2011,,,,,,,103,120,,10.1007/978-90-6704-734-0_5,0.0,,,18,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BVN53,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000291967200005,0

The growth in debts, credits, finance in general, changing behaviour of financial institutions and bankers, traders, financiers, their very short-term horizon, their huge bonuses, high bank profits, for capitalism unaccepted morals are some of the things, which have come to the surface. How did the financial crisis start and spread out to the whole world; how were the transitional economies of former Yugoslavia affected; what was the theoretical or ideological foundation for the capitalism we had; what is the morality of capitalism or a market economy - these are the questions touched upon in the first chapters. At the end, and as a conclusion of the paper, there are thoughts and/or ideas about the changes in capitalism to be expected. Financial reforms are crucial for the developed world and they may trigger more profound changes. For transitional economies such reforms are neither essential nor sufficient. The financial crisis has just exposed their problems as more serious and more difficult to overcome than previously thought. Their problems are largely the problems of the real sectors of their economies.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Ribnikar, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",ivan.ribnikar@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Our results do not appear to be driven by the endogeneity of underwriter reputation or VC backing.

We show that applying the usual tools of market power analysis to firms in regulated industries can lead to predictably erroneous outcomes. Prices set by regulatory fiat at below-cost levels would cause what we term the reverse cellophane fallacy. The uneconomically low prices cause other services to appear to be weaker substitutes than they would be at compensatory prices and therefore lead to improperly narrow market definitions and erroneous inferences of market power. This in turn leads to the self-perpetuation of regulation, in which regulators insist on finding that the incumbent lacks market power before deregulating prices, whereas the artificially restricted prices lead to an erroneous inference of market power. We test this hypothesis empirically by examining a sample of geographic markets (incumbent exchange service areas) in a single U.S. state in 2004. Our findings indicate that the relative absence of competition in rural areas should not be interpreted as evidence that the incumbent would be able to exercise market power absent price regulation.","[Aron, Debra J.; Burnstein, David E.] LECG LLC, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Aron, Debra J.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University,"Aron, DJ (通讯作者)，LECG LLC, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",daron@lecg.com; dburnstein@lecg.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We assume that interaction occurs in a democratic environment, where representative institutions design norms according to the perceived voters' support. Minority protection is strong when social reaction to discrimination is high. Interestingly, when discriminators harm members of weak social groups more if they do not react against discrimination, an initial increase in minority protection immediately reduces the level of social unrest, giving rise to fluctuations, as protest starts again when discrimination is back to high levels.

The procedural rules surrounding private litigation may account for some of these differences. This paper explores the effect of rules concerning contribution among multiple defendants who are jointly and severally liable for a cartel infringement. The no-contribution rule is shown to lead to higher levels of aggregate damages and more information revelation to the private plaintiff. However the no-contribution rule also has the potential to neutralise any public leniency programme, thereby possibly reducing the number of cartels detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Most of the literature has been based on single and/or hypothetical schemes and has a number of limitations, such as the potential differences in attitudes that might depend on whether users have actually experienced the gains of tolling are not considered. This paper gives further insight into user attitudes towards road user charges and overcomes some of the limitations observed in the literature. In particular, we examine attitudes towards six different Norwegian toll schemes with different characteristics and at different stages of implementation. The results show the following: (i) road users think negatively of tolls irrespective of the type of scheme or stage of charging: (ii) negative attitudes are highly correlated with the level of information given to users on the intentions of the tolling prior to implementation and (iii) toll levels significantly impact attitudes. Further, it is shown that attitudes vary significantly with socioeconomic characteristics. These findings demonstrate that governments need marketing strategies that clearly explain the benefits to users beforehand. Some of these strategies are proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The law of population, as described by Thomas Robert Malthus, asserts that population growth is ultimately limited by the means of subsistence, and therefore preventive checks on population growth (e.g., voluntarily limiting the number of births) are necessary to avoid the grim prospect of inevitable human suffering when the means of subsistence cannot support the population. Economists, demographers, and other social scientists have produced volumes of exegesis on Malthus's work. This article assesses how representative economists of the Austrian School have interacted with Malthus's law of population.","USAF Acad, Dept Econ & Geosci, Colorado Springs, CO 80840 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; United States Air Force Academy,"Barrows, SP (通讯作者)，USAF Acad, Dept Econ & Geosci, 2354 Fairchild Dr,Suite 6K12, Colorado Springs, CO 80840 USA.",stephen.barrows@usafa.edu,,,,,,,53,3,3,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The increase in global transport flow has contributed to bringing two themes to the centre of attention: making transalpine transportation easier and reducing the negative impact of this on the Alpine environment. The resulting debate has shown that there are conflicting transport policy proposals. The main reasons behind such differences are not so much the different evaluations of the trends in transalpine transport, and not only the diverging local and national interests, but rather the implicit reference to three alternative policy paradigms: 'competition', 'sustainability' and 'de-growth'. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to identify the links between policy paradigms and the transalpine transport policy framework; 2) to propose a multilevel and multi-criteria approach to transalpine transport policy. The explicit consideration of policy paradigms and the structured participation of citizens and stakeholders are at the heart of such a new and more widely shared approach.","[Marletto, Gerardo] Univ Sassari I, DEIR, Sassari, Italy; [Marletto, Gerardo] Univ Sassari I, CRENoS, Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Sassari,"Marletto, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari I, DEIR, Sassari, Italy.",marletto@uniss.it,,,,,,,57,3,3,0,9,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

It shows that the rates that must be imposed in an urban area in order to maintain pollutant concentration and congestion due to traffic within acceptable levels is heavily dependent on the distribution of the urban population's willingness to spend. This fact severely limits the reliability of any method for calculating road pricing rates based on theoretical analysis, so that an experimental approach seems necessary. The paper shows that a relation exists between the toll rate per kilometer of trip and the average traffic congestion, which is typical of each urban area and can be determined experimentally by successively imposing three different rates and measuring the corresponding congestion levels. The relation can then be used to determine the pricing scheme when the purpose of road pricing is to maintain both the congestion and the environmental effects due to urban traffic below acceptable thresholds. An example shows how the model can help policymakers in decision-making processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The philosophy behind these area-based policies is that integrated initiatives to deal with the physical, economic and social aspects of these urban neighbourhoods, will lead to the most effective solution. This paper focuses on the 'integrated' aspect of area-based policies in the Netherlands. We find that there is an unbalanced relationship between policies that focus on physical interventions and those that focus on social interventions. Also, findings show that some area-based initiatives claiming to be using an integrated approach are not. 'Integration' is often a term used by policy-makers but not implemented.

J,"Bartóková, L",,,,"Bartokova, Ludmila",,,THE EVOLUTION OF THE MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS OF V4 COUNTRIES,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,monetary policy transmission mechanism; exchange rate; interest rates; inflation targeting,,"Monetary policy measures cannot directly affect the economy. Their impact is usually indirect and mediated through various channels of monetary transmission. The choice of particular transmission mechanism is determined by several factors that include the specific conditions of each economy, the range of monetary tools that can be used by central bank as well as the various external factors. The paper explains the functioning of a monetary transmission in general, and then focuses on the particular types of transmission channels used by each of the central banks, chosen for analysis. The paper outlines the evolution of monetary policy transmission mechanisms in V4 countries from the beginning of the transformation process till present days. It compares the operational targets of V4's monetary policies, their ultimate goals and the tools applied to achieve these goals. It also compares the common and distinct features of their respective monetary policies. As can be seen, these countries were mainly focusing on the maintaining of price and exchange rate stability at the beginning of the transformation process. Usually the double monetary objectives were used, and served as the nominal anchors to monetary policy. NBS, CNB, NBP used fixed exchange rates in order to establish the currency stability, and had been monitoring the evolution of the money supply for the price stability. MNB however could not apply this type of monetary strategy as a consequence of slightly different initial economic conditions. MNB therefore chose the exchange rate target as the primary target, and had been closely monitoring its evolution in the narrow fluctuation band. The gradual change of economic situation, brought about by the ongoing transformation process, resulted in the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate regime and the transition to more liberal regimes. This change was closely followed by the alternation of ultimate monetary policy goals that became solely oriented on the price stability. All of the analysed central banks adopted the regime of inflation targeting whether it was in its pure form as the explicit inflation targeting or in the form of so- called inflation targeting lite.","Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon Teorii, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Bartóková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Katedra Ekon Teorii, Kosice, Slovakia.",ludmila.bartokova@tuke.sk,"Bartokova, Ludmila/AAA-7128-2020","Bartokova, Ludmila/0000-0001-8662-660X",,,,,26,4,4,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Because research in this field of media economics is rare, especially with regard to newly established communities, this study analyzes what drives community adoption and how direct and indirect financial incentives influence user participation. Extending Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior, this article shows, in 2 empirical studies, that network size significantly affects adoption in newly established communities. The results of the first study indicate a strong effect of indirect financial incentives (saving money) on the intention to adopt. The second study indicates that direct financial incentives (earning money) may well help increase the network's size without altering user motivation through crowding-out effects. It is interesting to note that the presence of direct financial incentives attracts new users, but it does not increase usage.","[Becker, Jan U.] Univ Kiel, Inst Innovat Res, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Clement, Michel] Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt & Media, Hamburg, Germany; [Schaedel, Ute] Hamburg Media Sch, Dept Media Management, Hamburg, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Hamburg,"Becker, JU (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Innovat Res, Westring 425, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",becker@bwl.uni-kiel.de,"Clement, Michel/GQQ-1785-2022","Clement, Michel/0000-0001-6769-6709; Becker, Jan/0000-0003-4561-3399",,,,,57,13,15,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

In the present work we test the existence of a positive relationship between offshoring intangibles and firm performance. To reap the full benefit of offshoring, firms are required to integrate and coordinate activities and knowledge; integration and coordination become difficult when activities are knowledge intensive as in the case of intangibles. We argue that the positive relation between offshoring intangibles and performance is strengthened if firms retain part of the knowledge related to the offshore outsourced activity, which reduces the risk of knowledge fragmentation and eases coordination and control. Our analysis suggests that some coherence between what a firm outsources abroad and what it offers positively moderates the relationship between offshoring intangible activities and firm performance.","[Ceci, Federica; Masciarelli, Francesca] Univ G DAnnunzio, DASTA, Dept Business Stat Technol & Environm Sci, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Ceci, F (通讯作者)，Univ G DAnnunzio, DASTA, Dept Business Stat Technol & Environm Sci, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",f.ceci@unich.it,"de Lima, Andréia/G-8040-2014; CECI, Federica/N-7217-2014","MASCIARELLI, FRANCESCA/0000-0002-6922-4091; CECI, Federica/0000-0002-6998-8534",,,,,109,13,15,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Coping is the process of expending efforts to solve personal and interpersonal problems and reducing stress induced by unpleasant and stressful situations. Two broad strategies of coping are identified; problem-based coping refers to a cognitively-based response behavior that includes efforts to alleviate stressful circumstances while emotion-based coping involves behavioral responses to regulate the affective consequences of stressful events. The purpose of this research is to analyze relationships among the coping strategies used by entrepreneurs and a set of antecedents influencing the selection of coping strategies. The methodology used is based on structural equation modeling and empirical data of 469 entrepreneurs from two European countries. Our results show that problem-based coping facilitates well-being and venture performance. In addition, our findings also support interaction effects of founder centrality and contextual conditions of venturing on the extent entrepreneurs engage in coping. We believe that our insights can help in training entrepreneurs in the development of effective coping strategies that are context dependent. In specific, our results suggest entrepreneurs to engage in problem-focused strategies when they want to effectively address the economic aspects of their lives whereas when they engage in emotion-based strategies they seem to increase the self-knowledge they need to start subsequent ventures and facilitate learning from failure. Future studies on coping strategies could study the interplay of coping strategies used to resolve challenging social situations that various stakeholders of practicing entrepreneurs impose.","[Drnovsek, Mateja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Wincent, Joakim] Lulea Univ Technol, Entrepreneurship Dept, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Wincent, Joakim] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",University of Ljubljana; Lulea University of Technology; Umea University,"Drnovsek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mateja.drnovsek@ef.uni-lj.si; daniel.ortqvist@ltu.se; wincent@usbe.umu.se,"Drnovšek, Mateja/AAQ-1716-2020; wang, bo/D-4056-2014; Örtqvist, Daniel/I-9265-2019","Ortqvist, Daniel/0000-0001-6921-1779",,,,,84,23,33,0,58,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

It also included government activities proxied by health expenditure and monetary policy proxied by broad money supply though; emphasis was on energy consumption. Using the Johansen co-integration technique, it was found that there existed a long run relationship among the series. It was also found that all the variables used for the study were I(1). Furthermore, unidirectional causality was established between electricity consumption and economic growth, domestic crude oil production and economic growth as well as between gas utilization and economic growth in Nigeria. While causality runs from electricity consumption to economic growth as well as from gas utilization to economic growth, it was found that causality runs from economic growth to domestic crude oil production.

The basic context of these changes is given by the Act No. 108/2006 Coll, on social services and its implementing regulations. These standards define not only the fundamental form of the system of social services but also the context of transformation activities. Large residential social care services, which often have been working with only minor changes for many decades and in which social services are still provided mainly collectively, often by the personnel without adequate training, skills and background, must be transformed into a form, which will be able to respond to the specific needs of the people with disabilities or seniors. This implies that the institutions will cease to provide the service to all clients in the same way and instead they should create a number of differentiated social services that can respond to the individual needs of people. This transition process is complicated by the fact that several different actors enter there and their cooperation is not systematically addressed. The transformation of a large institution into a provider of differentiated social services is a complex change in the organizational, procedural and personnel sphere, and therefore there is a need to manage it. In social services, the changes in the personnel area are particularly important because the quality of services depends primarily on the human factor. The selected personnel strategy should result in maximizing the potential of the employees and the teams, but it should also take into account the human aspect of the change, then the attitudes of the workers, their personal settings and the concerns and expectations of the potential changes. They may result from the changes in roles, changes in requirements, changes in the organizational structure or the allocation of resources but also from the changes in philosophy, values and principles of the organization. Theoretical knowledge is supplemented by the selected findings of the indicative qualitative research survey conducted in the six selected social service facilities which have implemented or are currently implementing some transformation steps. The work includes an outline of the recommendations for the staff working in the organizations that will only make transformation steps. These are proposals for the work with the personnel working in order to involve employees into the process of change and to reduce the tension and uncertainty of the ongoing changes.","[Kostecka, Jan] Proutek, Obcanske Sdruzeni, Kardasova Recice, Czech Republic; [Furmanikova, Lada; Styvarova, Dita] Univ Jana Evangelisty Purkyne Usti Nad Labem, Fak Socialne Ekon, Katedra Socialni Prace, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Kostecka, J (通讯作者)，Proutek, Obcanske Sdruzeni, Kardasova Recice, Czech Republic.",honza@proutek.cz; lada.furmanikova@ujep.cz; dita.styvarova@ujep.cz,,,,,,,27,1,1,1,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In particular, it seeks to answer whether cable subscribers are better off in competitive markets than in concentrated markets. This article estimates the impact of mergers by examining Korea's regional market-share data for MVPD operators with a hierarchical-choice model. First, the estimation results show that the consumer value of the CATV platform, in terms of the category values in a nested logit model, was significantly lower in the concentrated markets than in the more competitive markets. Second, the study compares these findings with those in the literature about the U.S. market. The following question is prompted: Why is direct broadcast satellite competitive with CATV in the United States but not in Korea? This article points out that differences in regulatory policies, particularly as they relate to the treatment of vertically integrated networks, do have significant effects on the effective boundary of MVPD competition across platforms. To support this argument, this article provides details on the policies and market characteristics of the Korean MVPD industry.","[Lee, Sang-Woo] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Rhee, Hongjai] Ajou Univ, Coll Business Adm, Suwon 441749, South Korea",Yonsei University; Ajou University,"Lee, SW (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, 262 Seongsanno, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",leesw726@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,21,8,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

Despite some opinions that say that financial derivatives cause deformations in prices at financial markets, volume of sales of financial derivatives are annually rising. Financial derivatives brought with themselves large opportunities for position creating. They can be used not only for trading, but for hedging and arbitrage as well. Nowadays, financial derivatives, namely options, are used to provide new banking products of treasury management. Yields of treasury instruments are in certain way derived from the yields gained from other regular financial instruments on financial market. Banks use option strategies to create financial positions that are divided into smaller parts and, consecutively, sold to clients of banks as new products. Especially, option strategies are used to emit investments certificates. Situation on financial markets forces banks to create new products that bring higher potential profits at lower level of risk. The investments certificates are one of favourite instruments used. The paper deals with option strategy and its usage in creating the treasury products in banks. We focus on Inverse Vertical Ratio Call Back Spread strategy as the one, which can be used for specific investment certificates creation. The aim of the paper is to find the way of creation of Speed certificates, so called Sprint certificates, Double Chance certificates or Double-up certificates. We analyze this type of certificates, derive the profit function in analytical form and we propose the way of its creation through Inverse Vertical Ratio Call Back Spread option strategy.","Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Soltés, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Bankovnictva Investovania, Kosice, Slovakia.",Michal.Soltes@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Michal/AAA-5822-2020","Šoltés, Michal/0000-0002-1421-7177",,,,,3,38,38,0,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We use a bivariate model of real GDP and five energy variables: energy consumption in industry and households, oil consumption, primary energy production and net energy imports. Since we found cointegration for all of the tested relationships, we use an Error Correction Model (ECM) which also allows us to distinguish between long and short term relationship among the variables. The empirical results provide clear support of causality that runs from real GDP growth to all energy variables. Our results differ from most of the studies analysing developing countries and are similar to those investigating developed, post-industrial economies with strong tertiary sector.

Subject to criticism on account of imperfect enforcement, the patent law system has produced a stock of patents which has grown rapidly alongside economic growth. The success rate of patent applications is similar across the country despite the considerable regional disparities in income and in the level of innovation. This paper presents a simple model of patent production in China derived from the patent law system that also considers the relevant contextual factors that could influence innovation. The main innovation input of R&D personnel is found to be a significant determinant of patents. While per capita GDP increases the propensity to innovate across all regions, notable heterogeneity exists whereby the coastal, central and interior areas are associated with different factors that produce innovation and influence the innovation process. The paper concludes that China's imperfect IPR system is nevertheless generating innovation as the country develops and hinges on the key factor of researchers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This paper accounts for the historical emergence of one such law: the Christian ban on taking interest-a doctrine that shaped the evolution of numerous financial contracts and related organizational forms. A game-theoretic analysis and historical evidence suggest that the Church's commitment to providing social insurance for its poorest constituents encouraged risky borrowing, which the Church attempted to limit by banning interest. The analysis highlights the applicability of the rational choice framework to seemingly irrational actions and laws, the role of nonmonetary sanctions in circumventing commitment problems, and the importance of economic forces vis-a-vis ideology.","Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Rubin, J (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA.",,,"Rubin, Jared/0000-0002-3133-7947",,,,,53,11,11,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

In most applications, the moving average terms are excluded for ease of estimation. We propose a new class of periodic unobserved component models (PUCM). Parameter estimates for PUCM are readily interpreted; the estimated coefficients correspond to variances of the measurement noise and of the error terms in unobserved components. We show that PUCM have correlation structure equivalent to that of a periodic integrated moving average (PIMA) process. Results from practical applications indicate that our models provide a natural framework for series with periodic autocorrelation structure both in terms of interpretability and forecasting accuracy.

The key question of this paper, derived from past research in law and economics, is whether these particular compensation systems include elements that may contribute to the prevention of industrial accidents. While the three countries examined here all have at least some incentive-based elements, notably in the way those systems are financed, there appears to be room for improvement both in Belgium and Great Britain. The German case study leads to the proposition that giving an organisation the responsibility for both compensation and prevention may have a beneficial effect on the accident rate.","Maastricht Univ, METRO Inst Transnat Legal Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Philipsen, NJ (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, METRO Inst Transnat Legal Res, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",niels.philipsen@facburfdr.unimaas.nl,,"Philipsen, Niels/0000-0002-2101-6840",,,,,27,8,8,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In this context, Filipino seafarers find themselves embedded in a dynamic transnational system that facilitates their entry into the cruise industry yet structures a diminution of their protection under the law. This process represents a rollback of historical protections that have favored seafarers in U.S. courts. This case calls into question how laws and legal framings serve to buttress labor relationships between people and places, thereby shaping economic geographies. Thus, this article illustrates the power of a legal geographic framework to examine economic relationships and therefore to shed light on how economic globalization is facilitated and shaped at multiple scales. It offers a geographic perspective on how the legal and the economic are implicated in one another and suggests that further attention to legal geographic aspects of economic and labor geographies would be useful for analyzing the maintenance of inequalities in the global system.","Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Terry, WC (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, 709 Bull St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",terrywc@mailbox.sc.edu,,"Terry, William/0000-0002-0338-0569",,,,,68,33,34,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Overall levels of local customers and suppliers are only modestly important, but new entrants seem particularly drawn to areas with many smaller suppliers, as suggested by Chinitz (1961). Abundant workers in relevant occupations also strongly predict entry. These forces plus city and industry fixed effects explain between 60% and 80% of manufacturing entry.

We found that a portfolio of related competences at the plant level increases significantly productivity growth of plants, in contrast to plant portfolios consisting of either similar or unrelated competences. Based on the analysis of 101,093 job moves, we found that inflows of skills that are related to the existing knowledge base of the plant had a positive effect on plant performance, while the inflow of new employees with skills that are already present in the plant had a negative impact. Our analyses also show that geographical proximity influences the effect of different skill inflows. Inflows of unrelated skills only contribute positively to plant performance when these are recruited in the same region. Labour mobility across regions only has a positive effect on productivity growth of plants when this concerns new employees with related skills.","[Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Eriksson, Rikard; Lindgren, Urban] Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, SE-90787 Umea, Sweden",Utrecht University; Umea University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl; rikard.eriksson@geography.umu.se,,"Eriksson, Rikard/0000-0003-3570-7690; Lindgren, Urban/0000-0003-2796-3547",,,,,63,206,221,2,84,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The underlying argument is that by attracting talented people, regions are better geared to meet the demand of competences of the knowledge economy and become more competitive. This article focuses on the migration of the creative class in Sweden. Three questions, central to recent theoretical claims but until now overlooked, are addressed: (i) Do members of the creative class move more often compared to other migrant groups (ii) Are they more selective in their destination choices, favouring regions with a favourable people climate (iii) Do their reasons for migration differ from those of other migrant groups Employing unique Swedish survey and register data, the results show that the migration rates of the creative class are only marginally higher than for other groups. The results, moreover, show that most migration activities for the creative class take place just after finishing university and that the creative class people move for jobs rather than place. The presented empirical findings of the article do not support central theoretical arguments about the mobility of the creative class. In light of these findings, the article concludes with discussing why the creative class theory has become so influential despite the lack of empirical evidence.","[Hansen, Hogni Kalso] Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Niedomysl, Thomas] Inst Futures Studies, SE-10131 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University,"Hansen, HK (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Box 117, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",hogni.kalso_hansen@circle.lu.se; thomas.niedomysl@framtidsstudier.se,"Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/ABB-2367-2020","Hansen, Høgni Kalsø/0000-0001-6174-1417",,,,,35,198,209,6,105,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The change of the public organization is typologically framed in several categories of patterns, which are known in the literature related to this specific field. The analysis focuses both on the deliberate and planned change. The change management implies the modification of certain essential subsystems, for instance the organizational structure and the organizational culture. The management patterns used by the public organization submit to the known prescriptive approaches. As a corollary of the globalization phenomenon, the international integration, and in the case of Romania European integration in the European Union, accelerate the process of change in a convergent manner, which generates similar characteristics of the public organizations.","[Bacanu, Bogdan] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,,b.bacanu@unitbv.ro,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,3,9,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000001,0

They feel that improved quality, in the final analysis, does not pay off. Two related reasons why the firm cannot improve its quality arc normally offered, namely, improving quality costs too much, more than what can be achieved in additional revenues and new business, and improving quality means that productivity will go down, which the organization cannot afford. As Pickworth observes: As managers, we recognize the need to improve quality, and we also realize that we must raise productivity. But it has long been accepted thinking that increases in productivity are likely to come at the expense of quality, and that improvement in quality will increase operating costs. Caught in this apparent dilemma, managers often concentrate on either quality or productivity, but not both. Far too often attention to productivity is given priority, and how to improve quality remains an unsolved problem. Both of these reasons for why quality cannot be improved are related to cost considerations. To increase quality requires too much resources and incremental costs, and it lowers productivity, which leads to higher costs per unit. Both reasons are wrong, and are based on an insufficient understanding of the relationships between quality and productivity on the one hand and the use of resources and the sources of costs and revenues on the other. As Leonard and Sasser say, ... efforts to raise quality almost always result in heightened productivity ... [and]... efforts to raise productivity usually pay off in better quality. However, they add that in order to achieve positive results, managers will have to develop a new and correct understanding of the relationship between quality and costs. If managers are able to define this relationship, they are probably able to exploit the strengths of it as far as, among other things, production effectiveness and employee satisfaction and profitability are concerned.","[Dumitrescu, Luigi] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,luigi.dumitrescu@ulbsibiu.ro,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,121,128,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS71,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984100016,0

We tested for the significance of macroeconomic and banking sector variables that condition non-performing loan ratios and the hypothesis of procyclicality between economic activity and improving banking-sector results in the Baltic States, Bulgaria and Romania. The theory of procyclicality between economic activity and the non-performing loan ratio was proven. The increased economic activity improved the loan portfolio quality of the banking sector, as indicated by a lower NPL ratio. Due to a high share of loans denominated in a foreign currency and the fact of productivity gains in the tradable sector, the appreciation of the real exchange rate contributed to an improvement in loan portfolio quality. The procyclicality of banking sector performance and high economic activities growth could be a signal of an economy overheating and therefore a slowdown in economic activity is likely to accelerate the growth of the non-performing loan ratio in the Baltic States, Bulgaria and Romania.","[Festic, Mejra; Repina, Sebastijan; Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribor, EPF Fac Econ & Business, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Festic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, EPF Fac Econ & Business, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",mejra.festic@eipf.si; sebastijan.repina@eipf.si; alenka.kavkler@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,61,11,11,1,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In some cases, producing both the quantity and quality of habitat needed and the timber desired is all but impossible. In other cases, a delicate balance that achieves both objectives can be struck. The objective of this study was to quantitatively estimate monetary gains and losses and changes in timber inventories relative to the timber growing stock when producing more or less habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) (Picoides borealis). USDA Forest Service vegetation data, habitat ratings, and economic variables were compiled for those regions of Mississippi best suited for RCWs. Data was then analyzed with Spectrum, the USDA Forest Service-based forest planning software. Models maximizing such objectives as net present value (NPV) alone as well as five different levels of RCW habitat quality over a 50-year rotation were developed. Revenue foregone, acres and volumes harvested, land expectation value (LEV), and equivalent annual income (EAI) were compared for all objectives for the South Central Hills and Pine Belt regions of Mississippi (1,036,208 acres) for three ownership types. As expected, when maximizing for any quality level of RCW habitat, revenue forgone was higher ($0.11-$49/acre/year) than for NPV alone. Volume harvested for high-quality habitat ranged from 152,296 to 10,237,649 cunits, while harvests from low-quality habitat ranged from 637,491 to 116,357,673 cunits. Lower levels of habitat management allowed for an increased emphasis on timber harvesting. In general, we determined that increases in habitat quality resulted in lower timber harvest levels and increased revenue forgone than regimes maximizing NPVs. While this result may be expected, of greater importance are the relative differences between regimes and the ability to use these values for policy decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

The regional divergent development processes were regarding the localisation of the direct foreign investments in the counties of the Usti Region proved; the structure of the foreign investors in the industrial zones in the counties of the Usti Region shows some kind of asymmetry in the socio-economic development of the region in the east-west gradient. The differentiation between the regions in the localisation and the structure of the foreign investors is partially influenced by its previous socio-economic development. The higher risk of the asymmetric development within the Usti Region is in the concentration of the direct foreign investments that are more dependent on the economic cycle. This fact proves also the example of the industrial zone Triangle in the western part of the region, where the production that needed lower initial investments was located. These subjects radically cut down or finished its production in relation with the economic crisis.

While it has been much criticized, it is now being seen by some as the inspiration for the alternative to neo-liberalism that the new left-wing governments in the region are seeking to implement. In the light of this, a critical examination of what these ideas mean in practice is of major importance. This article argues that the new model of governance that has helped transform the Irish economy over the past two decades bears resemblance to key tenets of the CEPAL paradigm. The article begins by surveying the recent literature on state reform in Latin America, highlighting certain themes that emerge but also issues that are insufficiently developed. It goes on to outline key elements of the ECLAC neo-structuralist paradigm and examines how the Irish 'model' echoes its twin objectives of changing productive patterns with social equity, as well as many of the key policy instruments it recommends. Having established the relevance of the Irish case, the article then examines the implementation of two core features of the Irish 'model' - industrial policy and anti-poverty policy.

This triggered inflation as the prices of imported products gapped upward. To offset the imminent inflationary effects and attract foreign exchange, the Reserve Bank raised interest rates, resulting in slower domestic growth. The critical question was the cause of the currency depreciation. We argue here that the rand's decline was the result of a concatenation of internal and external factors, specifically the way the operations of the global financial markets magnified and exacerbated the effects of internal financial policy decisions. The article illustrates the heightening connectivity between domestic policy decisions aimed at regulating the national economy and the globalizing financial markets that operate on an altogether different logic. The Reserve Bank's attempt to regulate the local foreign exchange regime in concert with the corporate use of financial instruments to circumvent these exchange controls led to a relatively illiquid currency market that was easily susceptible to attack by speculative capital. The end result was a crippling devaluation that especially hurt the impoverished black South African majority in the process of getting on its feet economically, thereby adding a further constraint on the consolidation of post-apartheid democracy.","[LiPuma, Edward] Univ Miami, Dept Anthropol, Miami, FL 33124 USA; [Koelble, Thomas A.] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Miami; University of Cape Town,"LiPuma, E (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Anthropol, POB 248106, Miami, FL 33124 USA.",elipuma@comcast.net,,,,,,,66,7,10,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

While the extant networking literature implicitly recognizes clients as influential in rapid internationalization, their specific contributions to the process have not undergone detailed scrutiny to date. Consequently, the chapter explores the various ways in which clients can act as a knowledge conduit and a valuable resource in the internationalization effort. Important dimensions of the relationships between clients and rapidly internationalizing firms include their role in: international small firm formation; internationalization through client followership; reputation-building; innovation and new product development; lessening entry barriers; and social capital and human resource acquisition. The authors posit that the network approach and both the resource-based view (RBV) and the knowledge-based views (KBV) of internationalization may be extended by further exploration of these issues. Propositions are developed and concluding remarks presented, including implications for public policy-makers.","[Loane, Sharon] Univ Ulster, Sch Int Business, Coleraine, Londonderry BT52 1SA, North Ireland; [Bell, Jim] Univ Ulster, Int Business Entrepreneurship, Coleraine, Londonderry, North Ireland",Ulster University; Ulster University,"Loane, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Sch Int Business, Coleraine, Londonderry BT52 1SA, North Ireland.",,,"Loane, Sharon/0000-0003-0588-2236",,,,,0,7,7,0,6,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"GLENSANDA HOUSE, MONTPELLIER PARADE, CHELTENHAM GL50 1UA, GLOS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-84720-830-9,,,,2009,,,,,,,91,105,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BSP51,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000285291900008,0

The present scientific article is located within this frame of reference; its central aim is to generate some reflections about economic globalization and its socio-cultural implications in Latin America For such purposes, the study recurred to a research model supported by the qualitative paradigm, based on a documentary theoretical interpretive bibliographic design as route to approach the phenomenon under investigation. For development of the documentary analysis from a critical interpretive perspective, the study used the hermeneutic method, assumed as a reflexive process based on the interpretation and analysis of textual discourse. Among the most important conclusions of the article is the observation that modernity, as a civilizing paradigm, assumed the term economic globalization as a model to relate man to goods and services production markets, which have entered a crisis, and with them, culture as well.","[Mesino Rivero, Ledis] Univ Fermin Toro, Toronto, ON, Canada; IUTEP, Maracaibo, Venezuela",,,,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Moreover, with the implementation of enterprise risk management (ERM), where risks are to be aggregated across different types of risk and across business units to obtain enterprise-wide risk situations, financial institutions are integrating their business lines performance management with risk management. Hence, management accounting systems which are crucial for control and performance management will be closely linked to risk management. The aim of this study is to explore the linkages between MAS, ERM and organizational performance by examining the MAS information characteristics that match the ERM implementation and the joint effects of MAS and ERM on organizational performance. The research method involved administering a questionnaire to 106 financial institutions listed on the Malaysian Central Banks website and the respondents are the chief financial officer (CFO) or the most senior positions in the finance department of the institutions. 16 post-survey semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected respondents. The findings from the survey and the post-survey interviews show that MAS and risk management complement each other. However, there was not enough evidence to fully support the role of risk management in enhancing the relationship between MAS and organizational performance.

In this paper we set out to answer two questions, based upon a survey of 1,122 knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) firms in the province of Quebec, Canada. First, do KIBS firms in different regions display different propensities to innovate? If so, this will be taken as prima facie evidence that there is some connection between local context and innovation. Second, can any regional level explanatory variables be found to explain the different levels of regional innovation? We find evidence that geographic patterns of innovation exist amongst KIBS firms in Quebec, although they are not those expected if there were a connection between local territory and innovation. We find that innovation first decreases with distance from the core of metropolitan areas, then, after 30-50km, begins to increase again, though this pattern is not the same for all sub-sectors. This pattern is in keeping with recent theoretically derived expectations relating to the geography of innovation.","[Shearmur, Richard] Univ Quebec, INRS UCS, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada; [Doloreux, David] Univ Ottawa, Tefler Sch Management, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Ottawa,"Shearmur, R (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, INRS UCS, 385 Sherbroooke E, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",richard.shearmur@ucs.inrs.ca,"Doloreux, David/Y-7368-2019","Doloreux, David/0000-0001-7101-2170",,,,,45,50,60,0,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The delay in the production of audited financial statements not only affects the usefulness of the information but also the relevancy and reliability of the documents. Despite the importance of timely release of financial information, little has been done to investigate the cause of audit report lag -that is, the main reason of financial reporting delay, especially in newly industrialized countries such as Malaysia. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to identify factors that affect the timeliness of audit reports of Malaysian listed companies. Based on a sample of 873 listed companies, the results of the study indicate that the time taken to conclude the audit work is around 101 days. The shortest is 14 days, while the longest is 272 days. The multivariate results show that type of auditor, financial company, profitability and company size significantly reduced the time taken to prepare audit report. On the other hand, type of audit report and leverage significantly increase the time taken to conclude the audit work.","[Siddik, Wan Nuraniah Wan Mustapha] Int Univ Coll Technol Twintech Bangi Branch, Bangi, Malaysia",,,sham1202@uum.edu.my,"Abidin, Shamharir/GQA-7365-2022",,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,737,749,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500036,0

Results show that, (1) at the collective level, the opportunities to punish would improve the cooperation if. the effectiveness of punishment exceeds a certain threshold, and average contributions increases along with the effectiveness. However, the opportunities to reward is ineffective in facilitating cooperation, which is independent of the effectiveness of reward; (2)at the individual level, the opportunities to punish(reward) fails to induce the punished(rewarded) subjects' consequent contributions except when the effectiveness of punishment (reward) equals 2 (4); (3) the payoffs in the reward treatments show a significant higher level than that in the punishment treatments with peer effectiveness except when the effectiveness equals 1.

A self-administered survey questionnaire was mailed to 100 companies randomly selected from the Malaysian business directory. Thirty one completed questionnaires were returned and analysed. The results indicate that IC strategic orientation affects the extent of both IC development initiatives and adoption of innovative management accounting practices. However, the extent of implementation of innovative management accounting practices is explained by the extent of IC development initiatives implemented, rather than by IC strategic orientation. The findings suggest that management accounting innovations are adopted where they are efficacious.","[Yau, Foong Soon; Ting, Tan Wei] Univ Putra Malaysia, Grad Sch Management, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,,syfoong@putra.upm.edu.my,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,1,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,144,160,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500006,0

The complexity of transaction relationships involving independent firms of contributors (e. g. architect, engineers, main contractor) leads to interesting insights into how control works within a project-based construction company. A case study method is adopted to investigate the case, using a triangulation data collection, including interviews, observations and documentation analysis. Contracts are generally used to create project organization, but unavoidably incomplete. Hence, formal contract is not the only solution to the control and coordination problems. The framework extends transaction cost economics (TCE) propositions by suggesting that informal or social control mechanisms would encourage cooperative behavior of transacting parties and may also influence a transaction relationship's control structure. The findings suggest that by selecting familiar or known contributors and with reputation to some extent mitigate control problems and thereby reduce the need for costly formal controls. The study leads to an understanding that formal control mechanisms (as suggested by TCE) are blended with informal, social-based controls when inter-firm relationships are complex due to task interdependencies and incomplete contract.","[Zin, Rosliza Mat] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business Accounting, Jitra 06010, Kedah, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,,rosliza@uum.edu.my,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,189,201,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500008,0

We focus on the causality tests across frequency bands as well as the usual Granger causality tests. Especially for the emerging countries the causality goes from the economic growth to consumer confidence but not vice versa. This argument basically supports the findings of Gunes and Uzun (2010) as well as Balkyte and Tvaronaviciene (2010), which claim that in emerging countries consumers are not able to trigger the economic growth with their confidence due to their subsistence level of income. Besides, causality from consumer confidence to retail sales, which is a proxy for the consumer expenditures, is detected. As in Basdas and Celik (2010), we also obtain significant differences whenever the frequency domain causality tests are employed instead of usual Granger causality tests in time domain.","[Mermod, Ash Yuksel] Marmara Univ, Dept Business Adm, FEAS, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dudzeviciute, Gitana] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Marmara University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Mermod, AY (通讯作者)，Marmara Univ, Dept Business Adm, FEAS, Istanbul, Turkey.",asliyuksel@marmara.edu.ir; gitana.dudzeviciute@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,38,6,7,2,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Specifically, we argue that online ticker searches serve as a valid proxy for investor sentiment - a set of beliefs about cash flows and investment risks that are not necessarily justified by the facts at hand - which is generally associated with less sophisticated, retail investors. Based on prior research on investor sentiment, we expect online search intensity to forecast stock returns and trading volume, and also expect that highly volatile stocks, which are more difficult to arbitrage, will be more sensitive to search intensity than less volatile stocks. In a sample of S&P 500 firms over the period 2005-2008, we find that, over a weekly horizon, online search intensity reliably predicts abnormal stock returns and trading volumes, and that the sensitivity of returns to search intensity is positively related to the difficulty of a stock being arbitraged. More broadly, our study highlights the potential of employing online search data for other forecasting applications. (C) 2011 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J,"Devlin, A; Jacobs, M",,,,"Devlin, Alan; Jacobs, Michael",,,JOINT-VENTURE ANALYSIS AFTER AMERICAN NEEDLE,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SPORTS LEAGUES; OPPORTUNITY,"The basic operational premise of the U. S. antitrust system posits that one can reliably demarcate business conduct into two distinct classes, specifically unilateral and concerted behavior. Professional sports leagues and other complex ventures confound this premise, engaging in arrangements that display both unilateral and concerted qualities. In 2010, the Supreme Court decided the American Needle case, which effectively asked in which category the conduct of professional sports leagues belonged. Rejecting the lower courts' determination that the IP-licensing activities of the NFL constituted unilateral action, the Court held that much intra-and extra-league activity is concerted, and thus subject to full rule-of-reason analysis. American Needle answered a simple question correctly, but failed to address a number of crucial issues about the permissible scope of joint-venture conduct, the nature of a single entity, and the application of the rule of reason to sports leagues and comparable ventures. We argue that distinguishing a sports league's core activities from its other kinds of conduct is neither a workable nor a legitimate means of conducting antitrust analysis. If that distinction is unworkable for sports leagues, it is equally unworkable for other joint ventures. We offer some thoughts on how courts and scholars should interpret American Needle, and we formulate a framework within which to assess the antitrust legality of intra-and extra-league restraints. We conclude that, in analyzing the business conduct of joint ventures, courts should appeal to a hypothetical bargain that would occur ex ante between the prospective members of the relevant venture, at the time of the venture's formation and thus under conditions of economic uncertainty. To the extent that the members would agree to adopt a particular practice to promote the effective functioning of the league, where the league faced efficiency-ensuring competition, that practice should satisfy any antitrust concerns. This approach suggests that the NFL's exclusive licensing of its members' IP ought to pass muster under the rule of reason.","[Devlin, Alan] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jacobs, Michael] Depaul Univ, Coll Law, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",University of Chicago; DePaul University,,alan.devlin@stanfordalumni.org; mjacobs@depaul.edu,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The aim of SCM is to find illegal collusion on legal markets with observable market data. It uses expected behavior patterns such as low level of capacity utilization, slackness of price adjustments to exogenous shocks, excess rates of return, nearly constant capacities, less price changes and lower variance of capacity growth rate. However, the testing of cost efficiency is lacking so far. Following Leibenstein's (Am Econ Rev 56:392-415, 1966) X-inefficiency theory, we assume that cartel members face lower competition and hence, tend to be less cost efficient. Therefore, we enhance SCM and use cost efficiency as a further marker in order to detect cartels. We apply SCM to the German cement cartel and find empirical support for some markers. The proposed methodology may be used for antitrust screening and regulatory purposes.","[von Blanckenburg, Korbinian] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Geist, Alexander] Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, Munster, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Munster,"von Blanckenburg, K (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany.",korbinian@vonblanckenburg.de; Alexander.Geist@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,42,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We compare the US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) practice of predicting the total number of passengers using macroeconomic variables with an equivalently specified AIM (aggregating individual markets) approach. The AIM approach outperforms the aggregate forecasting approach in terms of its out-of-sample air travel demand predictions for different forecast horizons. Variants of AIM, where we restrict the coefficient estimates of some explanatory variables to be the same across individual airports, generally dominate both the aggregate and AIM approaches. The superior out-of-sample performances of these so-called quasi-AIM approaches depend on the trade-off between heterogeneity and estimation uncertainty. We argue that the quasi-AIM approaches exploit the heterogeneity across individual airports efficiently, without suffering from as much estimation uncertainty as the AIM approach.

We find that semi-collusion leads to less advertising (but higher advertising prices) and lower copy prices which is beneficial for readers. Under certain circumstances, semi-collusion may even benefit advertisers as newspaper circulation is higher. In addition, total welfare may rise due to semi-collusion. Results under full collusion are ambiguous. However, even under full collusion newspaper copy prices may decrease and welfare may increase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A popular but unrealistic analysis, which combines real-time data for CLI and final vintage data for IP as predictor variables, obscures the actual predictive content of the CLI, in the sense that in that case, the improvements in forecast accuracy relative to a univariate AR model are not significant. The CLI appears to be less useful for forecasting growth rates of the Conference Board's Composite Coincident Index (CCI) in real time, as a univariate AR model performs better. This result is mostly due to its disappointing performance during the first five years of the forecast period. The CLI may not be the best way of exploiting the information contained in the underlying individual leading indicator variables.

With this incorporation, two models, an aggregate one sector model and a disaggregated multi-sector model, are estimated and used in density forecasting of the US real GDP growth rate. The experiment shows that use of the disaggregated version of the model, which incorporates price expectation effects along with modern Bayesian MCMC estimation and prediction techniques, produces more precise density forecasts than those yielded by either an aggregate version or benchmark forecasting models.

In particular, it provides new methods for comparing the efficiency of the two predictors. The methods are based on an encompassing representation for the two predictors, which enables us to derive their properties quite easily under a maintained model. The paper provides an analytical expression for the mean square forecast error of the two predictors and derives useful recursive formulae for computing the direct and iterated coefficients. From an empirical standpoint, we propose estimators of the AR coefficients based on the tapered Yule-Walker estimates; we also provide a test of equal forecast accuracy which is very simple to implement and whose critical values are obtained using the bootstrap method.

Specifically, we examine how the functional areas of R&D, manufacturing and marketing contribute to the absorption of knowledge coming from different external knowledge sources. The econometric results on a representative sample of Swiss firms show that non-R&D-based AC plays a significantly different role compared to the standard R&D-based one that is typically considered in studies on AC. We also reveal that AC is organized through a specialization of external knowledge absorption across functional areas. In particular, we find: (1) R&D is particularly important as an absorber of knowledge from public research organizations for product innovation; (2) manufacturing is important as an absorber of supplier knowledge for product innovation and of competitor knowledge for process innovation; and (3) marketing helps to absorb customer knowledge for product and process innovation as well as competitor knowledge for product innovation. We further investigate the differences between product and process innovation and find that marketing-based AC is more important for the former, although the overall analysis of these differences is less conclusive. In short, we show how functional areas play a role in the organization of AC and that firms may need an ambidextrous strategy to innovate effectively based on both upstream-and downstream-based AC.","[Bogers, Marcel] Univ So Denmark, Mads Clausen Inst Prod Innovat, SPIRE Ctr, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Lhuillery, Stephane] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol, CEMI MTEI, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lhuillery, Stephane] ICN Business Sch, F-57070 Metz Technopole, France",University of Southern Denmark; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Bogers, M (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Mads Clausen Inst Prod Innovat, SPIRE Ctr, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",bogers@mci.sdu.dk,"Bogers, Marcel/D-5523-2011","Bogers, Marcel/0000-0002-7942-3561",,,,,117,54,59,2,128,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

After investigating the Turkish urban conservation policy agenda, and the recent changes in the urban and socio-spatial structure of Istanbul, it examines the European Union-funded regeneration initiative of Fener and Balat, a declining neighbourhood in the Historic Peninsula.

Even though there is no consensus on the relationship between TQM and organizational performance, most researchers concluded that performance can be improved through TQM practices. Regarding the relation between innovation and organizational performance, there has been a consensual opinion, among researchers, supporting a direct positive relationship.

In knowledge-based economy, capturing and leveraging the value of Intellectual Property (IP) is generally held to be the path to sustainable wealth creation and societal benefits. Economic prosperity depends heavily on exploiting innovation capacity, improving competitiveness, and enhancing productivity. University is the main source for developing future creative entrepreneurs and it engages with other sectors in research and knowledge transfer. Commercialization of the university's innovation is essential for creating added value for the university, the surrounding region and the whole society. The role of university has been enlarged to include not only teaching and researching but also regional development under the name of entrepreneurial university. In current dynamic era, universities are facing many challenges such as: internationalization and massive competition. Meanwhile, most of applied strategies in the university have failed in the talking-doing gap. A top-down approach that starts with vision/mission statements is an obvious meaning of statements substitute actions. A new generation of strategic formulation processes that mitigates the gap should be identified. This research provides a new formulation process that is called (ABDSD). It is based on action not a description of action. The qualitative methodology has been used meanly a combination of tools such as: (1) Documentation and (2) Case-studies. Two universities have been chosen as an example of how to analyze and to benchmark their activities. Then, eight universities have chosen for applying and validating this methodology. The feedback from the eight universities was highly positive. This dynamic approach mitigates the implementation problems and allows the university to change its strategy successfully to gain a competitive advantage. The research consists of a literature review, strategy formulation processes, drawing a profile for each university's competitive advantages, and finally it provides recommendations that enhance the strategy of the university.","[Hassanin, Mahmoud] Tomas Bata Univ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,,hassanien@fame.utb.cz,"Hassanin, Mahmoud/JMR-1036-2023",,,,,,23,1,1,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,436,445,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800054,0

Under the lack of a consistent theory of entrepreneurship, an individual learns as (s)he 'does'. Educators actually facilitate the practice of trainees which leads them to obtain knowledge, to cultivate skills and it may also alter their attitudes towards business venturing. Reflection promoted during the courses is considered essential for the whole learning process. The theory of planned behaviour implies further the hypothesis that real entrepreneurial initiatives can result from underlying entrepreneurial intentions. In this frame, a measure of the impact of entrepreneurship education can be perceived as the number of consequent business start-ups from students who followed entrepreneurial courses. However, such a measure oversimplifies the objectives of fostering an entrepreneurial mindset which is the main goal of entrepreneurship education. The improvement of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, the quality of opportunities recognized, the adoption of innovation are, for instance, aspects inherently involved in the consequences of entrepreneurial learning. In the present paper, we present quantitative results for a non-business department in Greece as to discuss the impact of the entrepreneurship education provided. The present data is a subset of a global sample on the impact of entrepreneurship education in more than thirty countries; a project leaded by Illinois State University. The results are indicative for the Greek science student population examined. Further results on the alteration of conceptions about successful entrepreneurship due to the course are also shown, indicating a systematic shift of perceptions towards knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship. Difficulties to consistently develop statistical measures for the impact of entrepreneurship education concern its fundamental pedagogic approach, i.e. action learning, which is highly individualistic. Even though significant changes occur in the individual level, the corresponding shift in the group (or class) level may not be unique. Since entrepreneurship education is widely provided in modern higher education, the present work aims to contribute towards the understanding and quantitatively mapping the impact of entrepreneurial courses.","[Kakouris, Alexandros] Univ Athens, Career Off, Athens 11528, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,,akakour@phys.uoa.gr,"Kakouris, Alexandros/I-9175-2018","Kakouris, Alexandros/0000-0002-1484-9019",,,,,20,2,2,0,16,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,504,509,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800061,0

It further reveals that the impacts of falling transport costs and shipment time on international trade growth could be discounted, if uncertainty arises in the arrival time of the imported goods. This in turn suggests that reduced uncertainty, which is possibly the results of transportation improvements, might have contributed to the growth experienced in world trade growth over the past several decades.

The current trend of increased international involvement of SMEs on one hand and lack of academic research concerning their intentions to internationalize is a strong motivation for investigating International Entrepreneurship (IE). Scholars in different disciplines had shown much interest in understanding IE through variety of perspectives and theories. Each discipline mostly focuses only on its own theories and models, which has limitations in terms of analyzing and understanding entrepreneur from a bigger picture. Furthermore, there are conflicting results on the influence of cultural values on entrepreneurship due to the indirect effects of values on intentions and behavior. Although existing literature on international business and culture suggests the integration of values and intention, there was no empirical study conducted to prove the relationships to the best of our knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to study the motivation behind international and domestic small and medium entrepreneurs' intentions to export to new markets as the intersection of international marketing, sociology and psychology of entrepreneur, i.e. a multi-disciplinary approach, which is the essence of entrepreneurship. This paper aims to contribute to the body of knowledge through the integrative conceptual framework of values (Schwartz et al., 2001), beliefs and intentions in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) for a broader understanding of individual entrepreneur's motivation to internationalize their businesses. This cross-sectional study will include 400 Small and Medium sized entrepreneurs from a nationally representative sample of SMEs in Malaysia. Data will be collected in the form of multiple-item questionnaire answered by individual entrepreneur defined as owner cum manager of small and medium enterprises drawn from food, beverages and agriculture industries. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be employed in this study to test the hypothesized model consisting of latent and observed variables.

We present a model of a profit-maximizing sawmill, and analyze the production and investment decisions of thirty large-scale Finnish sawmills. The model allows the investigation of required policy incentives that enable sawmills to realize the production targets set for pellets.

This aspect is important as there was no prior analysis to identify these dimensions for this particular case of web sites. Another important aspect of this research is that the instrument was created using items from Fogg's (2001) instrument enriched with particular items specific for the analysed target and the type of web sites. As a result, there were identified new dimensions of credibility. The methods to asses credibility used in past researches rely on information focused on one or a number of certain websites or on past experience and knowledge of a user. From this point of view, there is no scale to match exactly every assessed website or all types of websites. Research procedure is combined. In the first stage we use the focus-group method, followed by a survey in the second stage. We created the instrument as a result of the qualitative and documentary studies. This procedure is a reliable one as these research steps contributed to build a new instrument to collect data for the specific case of presentation commercial web sites. We processed data using Principal Components method under SPSS for the exploratory factor analysis. We identified 11 factors (Sincere communication, Ease of use, Real world feel, Company's experience, Trust, Framing adds, Expertise, Exterior site label, Connection between site and user, Site information support, Magnitude of site) with EigenValue > 1. In our research, we obtained 3 scales with low but acceptable internal consistency. A future research direction is developing a new qualitative research to investigate these scales and improve them. The theoretical implication of this research consists in identifying the dimensions for the particular case of presentation commercial web sites. The practical implication is given by the possibility to compute the impact of each dimension in the overall construct (Fogg, 2001). The originality of the paper is given by the credibility approach only for this type of web sites. This is the reason that the study brings out new credibility dimensions, unspecified before by the scientific literature.","[Manolica, Adriana; Ciobanu, Oana; Bobalca, Claudia; Sasu, Constantin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,,manolica@uaic.ro; ciobanu.oana@uaic.ro; iuliana.bobalca@uaic.ro; csasu@uaic.ro,"Manolica, Adriana/AAK-4579-2021; Stoian, Claudia/R-1828-2016",,,,,,13,0,0,1,25,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,157,160,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900040,0

TQM in some papers is defined as a philosophy of quality, but in others as a managerial system. There were many expectations and deception from TQM philosophy. This paper reviews the interpretations that are given in the literature and concludes that TQM is a management method through the system. The analysis of quality management systems shows that there is not the definition of the quality system from different documents to be completed. For this purpose we examined some quality systems by representative companies worldwide and our findings have reveal that we can identify three generations of systems today. From this it concludes that TQC, TQM, CWQC are methods of leadership by the quality system. The paper suggests that the TQM method do not only able to be used for management of quality assurance activities, but also for management the entire company.

PTDC/AUR/70607/2006). In this project, the case studies were preceded by an extensive online questionnaire with the aim of contributing to producing an overall view of the status of design in Portuguese manufacturing industry, namely, to assess the impacts of design on competitiveness (see, for example, the initiative of the Danish Design Centre 2003). In line with the nature of the project of which this case study is a part, the emphasis will be on the role of design in companies. The conceptual basis of the study is the relationship between design and the dynamics of innovation of enterprises. Contextually, we are looking at a case of entrepreneurship (business initiative and development) based on design-driven innovation and the proposition of new meanings (Verganti 2009). Design takes on the role, therefore, of enhancing the client's experience, in conjunction with the general management, R&D, marketing and the commercial and operating structure of enterprises (Brown 2009). In recent years, the case study methodology has become popular in the study of firms and their routines. This is what is meant by the method of cases that will be used to focus on Climar, S.A. - a Portuguese SME in the business of lighting solutions, which was created in 1977. The conclusion that will be drawn is that greater insertion of the design function within the company as well as continued investment in design people will be necessary conditions for sustaining the future of this Portuguese SME. In the context of a new economic era, this case study demonstrates how the design strategy can expand the pure good to complex service. The aim is to offer global lighting solutions as experience and new meaning for clients and markets: the power of entrepreneurship.","[Monteiro-Barata, Jose] Tech Univ Lisbon ISEG UTL, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,,jmbarata@iseg.utl.pt,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-908272-14-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,655,664,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCJ88,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310338800079,0

The first presents Bourdieu's felt motivations for crucial professional choices and his perspective on the links between his social habitus and his scholarly style. In the second, Bourdieu collected three essays first published in 1962, 1972 and 1989 on the enforced celibacy of the eldest sons in Bearn, his region of origin in southwest France. Read together, these books show that Bourdieu's scientific work evolved in tandem with the development of his own scientific habitus, a process in which reflection on both familiar and strange social environments is carefully balanced.

Observation of his significant emotional reactions directs his attention in particular ways and helps him to structure the Bearn studies. His ability to notice and render scientifically significant in appropriate sociological texts such personal responses is also trained through studies of other related but different social phenomena - the agricultural society of Algeria, habitus and symbolic power in various social fields in France.

To achieve that three questions were used related to: company objectives, execution and message structure, IMC tools. IMC is a process designed to optimize the efficiency of marketing communication through better coordination of communication efforts measured by customer feedback Previous studies have focused in particular on IMC in large enterprises and research is therefore required to study IMC in SMEs. Also, such research may offer a better vision of the entire marketing process in SMEs, because, according to some authors (Percy, 2008), the owners of these companies tend to handle all marketing activities alone, without to call a specialist from outside the company. This study used both case analysis, comparing the views of the company and those of the customers to the literature and theory in the field, as well as cross-analysis when it were investigated the differences between the points of view of the firm and those of its clients. Three of the company objectives have a greater importance: increased sales, competitive advantage and effectiveness of promotional activities. There are not significant differences between the company and the customer point of views related to the execution and message structure. Companies have a more positive attitude towards different IMC tools. Companies must set their targets carefully to fit into their overall strategy. An effective mix of objectives will bring benefits to customers. If previous studies were often conducted in terms of either company or from a customer perspective, this paper has combined the two perspectives. In this way has been identified the way the company can significantly improve its long-term relationship with its customers.","[Sasu, Luciana] Tech Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",GH Asachi Technical University,,office@lucianasasu.ro; c.sasu@uaic.ro,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,16,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-2-3,,,,2011,,,,,,,205,208,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI18,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306939900052,0

Because of this issue, real role models for the entrepreneurial education for youths are missing. The transition in Romania started in 1990 and was more difficult than in other central and eastern European countries. It is recognized that communism destroyed the entrepreneurial system. In Romania, a number of universities have started to develop programs for entrepreneurship through models and case studies, in which students are encouraged to develop their own business plans and ideas through creative methods.

Using 185 completed surveys from hotel customers, the paper did an empirical study to explore the relationship between customer participation and service quality. Independent-samples T test and path analysis confirmed that the more participation a customer devoted in a service process, the shorter the gap between his expectation and perception.

The problems manifest in European peripheral countries that are also members of the Eurozone, that is, Ireland, Spain, and Greece, have roots in domestic policy mistakes. However, the European context of these policy profiles also needs to be taken into account. The creation of the Euro initially yielded large credibility gains for the weaker economies, extending low interest rates across the Eurozone. But it also introduced a set of perverse incentives toward fiscal expansion which were supposed to be managed at domestic level. Weak European coordinating capacity meant there were few effective external disciplines on national decision making. The sanctions built into the Stability and Growth Pact proved more controversial and, therefore, less constraining than originally envisaged. The problems accumulating in the weaker economies made them particularly exposed to crisis when the downturn came. The crisis is not merely one of peripheral economies' policy errors, but extends to the design of European decision making and the management of monetary union, and to the underlying structural differences in relative trade capabilities between Eurozone member states. These issues are explored with reference to the Irish case: the crisis of the Irish and other peripheral economies points to a number of unresolved difficulties at the heart of European politics.","[Avellaneda, Sebastian Dellepiane] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Hardiman, Niamh] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University of Antwerp; University College Dublin,"Avellaneda, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",sebasdellepiane@gmail.com; Niamh.Hardiman@ucd.ie,"Hardiman, Niamh/AAM-7013-2021","Hardiman, Niamh/0000-0002-3233-0181",,,,,68,9,9,0,42,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We argue that entrepreneurs are strongly incentivized to maximize earnings when leverage is high in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse credit decisions and firm liquidation. Our empirical tests focus on the effects of leverage on firm profitability and growth in earnings during a 5-year window after start-up for a large and unique sample of newly established ventures in Belgium. Accounting for the endogeneity of leverage, the data reveal that more highly indebted business start-ups are not only more profitable but also realize larger earnings growth. Moreover, the positive effect of leverage on firm profitability intensifies as the venture matures.","[Franck, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lessius Hogesch, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Franck, Tom] Natl Bank Belgium, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Huyghebaert, Nancy] Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [D'Espallier, Bert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lessius Hogesch, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",KU Leuven; European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Franck, T (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lessius Hogesch, Berlaimontlaan 14, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",tom.franck@nbb.be; Nancy.huyghebaert@econ.kuleuven.be; Bert.despallier@lessius.eu,,"D'Espallier, Bert/0000-0001-7567-2520",,,,,32,4,4,2,31,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The traffic levels, measured as vehicles per hour, in 2006 are compared to traffic levels in 2005. The evaluation also covers the effect on the retail market and possible environmental effects. We also seek to investigate what the traffic levels would have been today if the cordon had still been in operation. We find that the closing of the Trondheim toll cordon has lead to increased traffic levels in the peak hours, with an average increase of 11.3% in the former charging hours of 06:00-18:00. On an average, the hours between 14:00 and 18:00 experienced an increase in traffic of 15.5%, whilst traffic in the evenings and nights decreased. Model results suggest that the removal of the toll cordon has caused the private car to increase its modal share at the expense of passengers per car, public transport and cycling/walking. The increase in the total number of trips would have been more uniformly distributed among the alternatives if the toll cordon had still been in operation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Social entrepreneurship and its business model are a novel solution for a social problem; they create social value and arc considered effective, efficient, and sustainable. The objective of this paper is to show that social entrepreneurship can be an innovative model for addressing the marked rural exclusion that has existed in Mexican farming ever since the agro-exporting phase began and the neoliberal model was adopted. Review of the case under study is based on an analysis of the term social entrepreneurship and its implications, linked to an analysis of rural Mexican problems. To corroborate the theoretical analysis, in-depth interviews with community activists, as well as field observations and a review of information databases on the company network that has been formed, were carried out. Findings seem to show that a social enterprise can be a very plausible response to help small producers return to production and be competitive.","Univ Michoacana, Div Estudios Posgrado, Fac Econ Vasco Quiroga, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico",Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo,"Núñez, GP (通讯作者)，Univ Michoacana, Div Estudios Posgrado, Fac Econ Vasco Quiroga, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico.",guadalupe_palacios@fevaq.net,"Palacios, Guadalupe/N-9878-2013; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012",,,,,,13,0,0,0,28,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Tort reform may reduce costly damage awards and defensive medicine. On the other hand, tort reform may increase health care costs by reducing doctors' caretaking or increasing questionable treatments. Reducing health care costs should increase health insurance coverage rates, while cost increases should decrease coverage rates. We find that between 1981 and 2007 damage caps, collateral source reform, and joint-and-several liability reform increased health insurance coverage among price-sensitive groups between one-half and one percentage points each. We conclude that tort reform reduces health care costs, at least for price-sensitive groups.

A novel aspect of our analysis is that we compare the estimates based on auction, retail, and wholesale prices. Although auction prices are based on actual transactions, they provide a thick market only for high quality, expensive wines and may overestimate climate's effect on farmer revenues. Wholesale prices, on the other hand, do provide broad coverage of all wines sold and probably come closest to representing the revenues of farmers.

Today's organizations develop their management functions giving importance to quality, whether in the final product or the entire organization. Correct quality management implies that the entire organization takes on quality in an integral manner for itself and its surroundings.

J,"Schmid, HB",,,,"Schmid, Hans Bernhard",,,PHILOSOPHICAL EGOISM: ITS NATURE AND LIMITATIONS,ECONOMICS AND PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ALTRUISM,"Egoism and altruism are unequal contenders in the explanation of human behaviour. While egoism tends to be viewed as natural and unproblematic, altruism has always been treated with suspicion, and it has often been argued that apparent cases of altruistic behaviour might really just be some special form of egoism. The reason for this is that egoism fits into our usual theoretical views of human behaviour in a way that altruism does not. This is true on the biological level, where an evolutionary account seems to favour egoism, as well as on the psychological level, where an account of self-interested motivation is deeply rooted in folk psychology and in the economic model of human behaviour. While altruism has started to receive increasing support in both biological and psychological debates over the last decades, this paper focuses on yet another level, where egoism is still widely taken for granted. Philosophical egoism (Martin Hollis' term) is the view that, on the ultimate level of intentional explanation, all action is motivated by one of the agent's desires. This view is supported by the standard notion that for a complex of behaviour to be an action, there has to be a way to account for that behaviour in terms of the agent's own pro-attitudes. Psychological altruists, it is claimed, are philosophical egoists in that they are motivated by desires that have the other's benefit rather than the agent's own for its ultimate object (other-directed desires). This paper casts doubt on this thesis, arguing that empathetic agents act on other people's pro-attitudes in very much the same way as agents usually act on their own, and that while other-directed desires do play an important role in many cases of psychologically altruistic action, they are not necessary in explanations of some of the most basic and most pervasive types of human altruistic behaviour. The paper concludes with the claim that philosophical egoism is really a cultural value rather than a conceptual feature of action.","[Schmid, Hans Bernhard] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Schmid, Hans Bernhard] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Basel; University of St Gallen,"Schmid, HB (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,30,3,3,1,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Although farmers can use, inter alia, the cash forward contracting and/or the derivatives market to manage price risk, few farmers actually participate in forward pricing. A similar reluctance to use forward pricing methods is also found internationally. A number of different model specifications have been used in previous research to model forward pricing behaviour which is based on the assumption that the same variables influence both the adoption and the quantity decision. This study compares the results from a model specification which models forward pricing behaviour in a single-decision framework with the results from modelling the quantity decision conditional to the adoption decision in a two-step approach. The results suggest that substantially more information is obtained by modelling forward pricing behaviour as two separate decisions rather than a single decision. Such information may be valuable in educational material compiled to educate farmers in the effective use of forward pricing methods in price risk management. Modelling forward pricing behaviour as two separate decisions is thus a more effective means of modelling forward pricing behaviour than modelling it as a single decision.","[Jordaan, H.; Grove, B.] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Jordaan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",,"Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637; Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727",,,,,24,2,2,0,10,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"RM EMS 4-51, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It is found that, in contrast with transportation systems that were expanded in response to increased demand, the rapid expansion of the streetcar system during the electric era has been driven by other forces and to a large extent led land development in the Twin Cities. The main forces that have driven this process include technological superiority, monopoly, close connections with real estate business and people's reliance on the streetcar for mobility. Proximity to the streetcar is found to be a crucial factor that determines the distribution and development of residences: it is observed that residential density declines with the distance from streetcar lines, and significantly drops beyond a walkable distance; it is also observed that gaining a closer access to streetcar lines within 800 m (about a half mile) predicts the increase in residential density to a significant extent.","[Xie, Feng; Levinson, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Engn, RP Braun CTS Chair Transportat Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Xie, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Engn, RP Braun CTS Chair Transportat Engn, 500 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",xiex0055@umn.edu; dlevinson@umn.edu,"Levinson, David Matthew/A-8554-2012","Levinson, David Matthew/0000-0002-4563-2963",,,,,22,33,37,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

But these groups are small, and the evidence of their effect on housing prices is anecdotal and limited. We argue that artists, bohemians and gays affect housing values through two kinds of mechanisms: an aesthetic-amenity premium; and a tolerance or open culture premium. To examine this, we introduce a combined measure of bohemian and gay populations-the Bohemian-Gay Index. We conduct statistical analyses to test the performance of this measure against other variables expected to affect housing values-income, wages, technology and human capital. The findings indicate that the Bohemian-Gay Index has a substantial direct relation with housing values across all permutations of the model and across all region sizes. It remains positive and significant alongside variables for regional income, wages, technology and human capital. The Bohemian-Gay Index also has a substantial direct correlation with other key variables, particularly income, indicating an additional indirect effect on housing values.","[Florida, Richard] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Martin Prosper Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mellander, Charlotta] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Prosper Inst Scandinavia, Jonkoping, Sweden",University of Toronto; Jonkoping University,"Florida, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Martin Prosper Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada.",florida@rotman.utoronto.ca; charlotta.mellander@jibs.se,"Florida, Richard/AAD-7585-2020",,,,,,47,90,100,2,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In this paper a multinomial model is implemented to analyse which factors determine the decision to appeal against the verdicts of trial courts. Use of a dataset of motor insurance claims revealed differences between the determinants of a claimant's decision to appeal and those of insurers. Among other results it is shown that discrepancies regarding the permanent disability sustained affect the insurer's decision to appeal. In contrast, the claimant pays more attention to differences in the stated temporary disability. Evidence of the claimant's higher risk-averse behaviour is found. Conclusions are drawn regarding which factors could reduce the percentage of appealed cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The social desirability of these policies is compared in a model in which the government's information about landowners' valuations is imperfect. Under this assumption, the policy of purchase possesses the market test advantage that the government obtains land from an owner only if its offer exceeds the owner's valuation. However, the policy suffers from a drawback when the land that the government needs is owned by many parties. In that case, the government's acquisition will fail if any of the owners refuses to sell. Hence, eminent domain becomes appealing if the number of landowners is large. This conclusion holds regardless of whether the land that the government seeks is a parcel at a fixed location or instead is a contiguous parcel that may be located anywhere in a region.","Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Shavell, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,13,25,30,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

The data used in this study are the responses of 2,625 innovative firms to the 2003 Statistics Canada Innovation Survey on services. The empirical results suggest the presence of three patterns of complementary innovation capabilities, one pattern of substitute activities and finally, four patterns of innovation capabilities that are independent from each other. Hence, the results suggest the presence of complementarities: first, between internal RD, external RD, acquisition of equipment and machinery, and marketing activities; second, between external RD, acquisition of equipment and machinery, acquisition of external knowledge and marketing activities; third, between acquisition of equipment and machinery, acquisition of external knowledge and marketing activities. Such complementarities lead to the conclusion that, in practice, managers of KIBS firms consider the consolidation of these capabilities jointly instead of separately. The paper also discusses issues related to patterns of capabilities that are substitutes and independent from each other. The results of this study also show significant heterogeneity in the determinants of the different patterns of innovation capabilities.","[Amara, Nabil; Landry, Rejean; Halilem, Norrin] Univ Laval, Fac Business, Dept Management, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Traore, Namatie] Stat Canada, Small Business & Special Survey Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Laval University; Statistics Canada,"Amara, N (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Business, Dept Management, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",nabil.amara@mng.ulaval.ca,"Halilem, Norrin/H-2653-2017","Halilem, Norrin/0000-0001-7970-4884; Amara, Nabil/0000-0002-2179-2516",,,,,71,17,19,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

In this context the paper analyzes the magnitude of these interventions in developed countries and the extent in which these interventions affect competition policies. The conclusion is that due to the particular circumstances of these interventions as well as due to their time limit they are not affecting in the long run the competition environment but they may rather change the approach to competition. This overall research approach is then applied to the specific conditions of Romania where during 2009 there were no significant measures of state intervention as result of a combination of internal economic and political crises. From this point of view Romania appeared as an atypical subject in the European Union context. The explanation found is that the level of development of Romania determines competition issues which are not synchronized with those of more developed member states.,"Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest 012101, Romania",,"Bonciu, F (通讯作者)，Romanian Amer Univ, Bd Expozitiei 1B,Sector 1, Bucharest 012101, Romania.",fbonciu@gmail.com,"Bonciu, Florin/HZH-5604-2023",,,,,,30,1,1,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Based on an extended study of slum enumeration and the politics of slum demolitions in Delhi, I show that each of these two moments relied on an epistemologically different set of calculative practices - one statistical, the other aesthetic - to render the slum intelligible and secure rule. I specifically show how the statistically rigorous calculative practices of the first moment encountered various technical difficulties and political challenges in producing a governing intelligibility, thus leading to the unruliness of slum space. In response, a new set of governmental techniques operating through the dissemination of aesthetic norms and codes re-secured rule over slums. I describe this shift in governmental technique to demonstrate that the dissemination of aesthetic norms can be both more governmentally effective and practically implementable than the statistical deployment of governmental truths. This suggests the need to expand our understanding of the epistemology of government to include attention to a more diverse array of governmental technologies, some more aesthetic than strictly calculative.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Ghertner, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, 310 Barrows Hall 3050, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ghertner@berkeley.edu,,"Ghertner, D.

The purpose of this study is to discuss the choice of the standard of corporation social responsibility (in the following, it is replaced by CSR) for the multinational or global corporation on the basis of analyzing the Apple's SRC policy in the case of Apple's supplier-Foxconn in 2009, according to the conservative-liberalcontinuum proposed by Warnock Davies (2006,2010). Design/methodology/approach- Using the conservative-liberalcontinuum proposed by Warnock Davies (2006, 2010), this paper describes the choice of CSR's policy in the company's internationalization. Findings- Generally, a company's CSR policies and behavior are not covered by a single on the conservative-liberal continuum; it perhaps reflects a complex mix. Research limitation/implications- This study is only limited to one case and then puts forward some ideas about a company's CSR policy choice. In future, much more cases should be introduced to testify these ideas. Originality/value-This study is trying to apply the conservative-liberal continuum to Apple's supplier CSR incident.

The research explores how firms should frame their cross-border physical flows of goods and the configuration of their value-adding processes for taking advantage of diagonal cumulation of origin. The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth case study of effects of the 'SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin' on changes in the transaction cost structure of a selected Slovenian firm operating within the household-appliance sector in one of the Western Balkan Countries. Based on eligibility of local subsidiary for using origin of goods in its import/export transactions the cost calculations were made for its products and then three different business scenarios were developed for showing the effects of the mechanism on transaction cost changes of a firm. The paper concludes that, at the conceptual level, the mechanism of diagonal cumulation of origin may serve as an effective institutional cross-border trade-promoting tool.","[Jurse, Milan; Logozar, Klavdij; Vide, Romana Korez] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Trade Goods & Serv, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Vide, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Trade Goods & Serv, Razlagova 14-20, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",milan.jurse@uni-mb.si; klavdij.logozar@uni-mb.si; romana.korez-vide@uni-mb.si,"Logožar, Klavdij/C-6760-2012","Logožar, Klavdij/0000-0001-8496-3397",,,,,53,2,2,0,8,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This paper addresses the key factors determining the economic position of migrant entrepreneurs in the urban economy in the Netherlands, with an application to Amsterdam. So far, little information on success conditions for migrant entrepreneurship is available, while quantitative knowledge on critical success factors (CSFs) is lagging far behind the rapid growth of migrant entrepreneurs in big cities like Amsterdam. The present study serves to fill this knowledge gap, by paying attention to the entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants, the role of their social networks, and the innovative potential of new growth markets in a modern city. In order to provide a solid assessment of CSFs for migrant entrepreneurs, and to understand business performance in a competitive urban environment, this study will investigate the entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants in Dutch cities from a micro-economic perspective. Due insight into individual entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants is needed to develop an urban business culture in which migrants are no longer a source of problems but of great socio-economic opportunities, both for the migrant groups concerned and the vitality of cities. Our research employs a comparative statistical analysis of empirical findings in the city of Amsterdam in order to map out opportunities, success conditions and bottlenecks for migrant entrepreneurs. Given our largely categorical (i.e. qualitative or soft) database, we will employ a qualitative causal pattern recognition technique, namely, rough set analysis, to systematically assess the conditions for successful entrepreneurship of migrants.","[Nijkamp, Peter; Sahin, Mediha] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Baycan-Levent, Tuezin] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, TR-80626 Istanbul, Turkey",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Istanbul Technical University,"Nijkamp, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",pnijkamp@feweb.vu.nl; msahin@feweb.vu.nl; tuzin.baycanlevent@itu.edu.tr,,"Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,59,15,21,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Since the DEA is non-parametric linear program model, the estimated efficiency might be biased if there is data aggregation in DEA. It is proposed that both the inter-input aggregation and inter-output aggregation will make the estimated technical efficiency biased downwardly. Following some discussions on the technical efficiency bias caused by data aggregation in data envelopment analysis, this study presents the up-ward bias in the allocative efficiency caused by inter-output aggregation. However, hitherto, we have not observed any studies on considering how to utilize this character of DEA in methodology extensions for multi-output production system. Therefore, this paper originally proposes that the 'traditional' allocative efficiency can be decomposed for multi-product system. Then, the method to obtain decomposed allocative efficiency components is provided. In fact, the meaning of results from this paper is outside the DEA method, and the generality of the findings in this paper can provide useful information for researchers who concern the decision-making process in allocating resources for multi-product production system. Finally, an empirical example to show how to use the method in decomposing allocative efficiency for multi-product production system is also presented in the paper. In addition, some empirical situations (in both the agricultural sector and the industrial sector) are provided to tell us when we should use this method. Although this paper only provides a two-stage allocating process, the method developed here can be easily extended for the three-stage allocating process or even more complicated production system.","[Zhang, Tao] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Zhang, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",Taozhang7608@hotmail.com,"ZHANG, TAO/K-3795-2019","ZHANG, TAO/0000-0002-2400-7624",,,,,9,2,2,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, there is a mounting body of empirical evidence showing that accurate forecasting in the economic and business world is usually not possible. In addition, there is huge uncertainty, as practically all economic and business activities are subject to events we are unable to predict. The fact that forecasts can be inaccurate creates a serious dilemma for decision and policy makers. On the one hand, accepting the limits of forecasting accuracy implies being unable to assess the correctness of decisions and the surrounding uncertainty. On the other hand, believing that accurate forecasts are possible means succumbing to the illusion of control and experiencing surprises, often with negative consequences. We believe that the time has come for a new attitude towards dealing with the future. In this article, we discuss the limited predictability in the economic and business environment. We also provide a framework that allows decision and policy makers to face the future - despite the inherent limitations of forecasting and the uncertainty, sometimes huge, surrounding most future-oriented decisions.

Such aggregation can make it virtually impossible to identify small amounts of variation in homicides due to executions. Therefore, this study uses data that are disaggregated down to daily and city levels to test whether executions have a short-term deterrent effect. Little consistent evidence is found that Texas executions deter Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston homicides from 1999 to 2004. The analysis also does not consistently support the hypotheses that the deterrent effect should be more evident for local executions or executions that received local media coverage.","Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hjalmarsson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, 4131 Van Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",rhjalmar@umd.edu,,,,,,,31,14,16,3,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

J,"Picker, RC",,,,"Picker, Randal C.",,,THE GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH SETTLEMENT: A NEW ORPHAN-WORKS MONOPOLY?,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper considers the proposed settlement agreement between Google and the Authors Guild relating to Google Book Search (GBS). I focus on three issues that raise antitrust and competition policy concerns. First, the agreement calls for Google to act as agent for rightsholders in setting the price of online access to consumers. Google is tasked with developing a pricing algorithm that will maximize revenues for each of those works. Direct competition among rightsholders would push prices towards some measure of costs and would not be designed to maximize revenues. The consumer access pricing provision might very well fail a challenge under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Second, and much more centrally to the settlement agreement, the opt-out class action will make it possible for Google to include orphan works in its book search service. Orphan works are works as to which the rightsholder cannot be identified or found. The opt-out class action is the vehicle for large-scale collective action by active rightsholders. Active rightsholders have little incentive to compete with themselves by granting multiple licenses of their works or of the orphan works. Plus under the terms of the settlement agreement, active rightsholders benefit directly from the revenues attributable to orphan works used in GBS. We can mitigate the market power that will otherwise arise through the settlement by expanding the number of rights licenses available under the settlement agreement. To do that, we should take the step of unbundling the orphan works deal from the overall settlement agreement and create a separate license to use those works. All of that will undoubtedly add more complexity to what is already a large piece of work, and it may make sense to push out the new licenses to the future. That would mean ensuring now that the court retains jurisdiction to do that and/or giving the new registry created in the settlement the power to do this sort of licensing. Third, there is a risk that approval by the court of the settlement could cause antitrust immunities to attach to the arrangements created by the settlement agreement. As it is highly unlikely that the fairness hearing will undertake a meaningful antitrust analysis of those arrangements, if the district court approves the settlement, the court should include a clause-call this a no Noerr clause-in the order approving the settlement providing that no antitrust immunities attach from the court's approval.","[Picker, Randal C.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Picker, Randal C.] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Picker, Randal C.] Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Picker, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",r-picker@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,12,15,16,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

J,"Stephan, A",,,,"Stephan, Andreas",,,AN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE EUROPEAN LENIENCY NOTICE,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A study of the Directorate General for Competition's (DG Competition) 1996 Notice on the non-imposition or reduction of fines in cartel cases suggests that it largely failed to induce members of active cartels to self-report. Instead, immunity and fine discounts were predominantly awarded in cases where cartels were failing, or had already failed. A majority of leniency cases followed (or were broadly contemporaneous to) equivalent investigations by the U. S. Department of Justice. All but one EU only leniency case had failed before self-reporting occurred. Moreover, nearly half of leniency cases concerned closely related infringements in the chemicals industry. The majority of those U.S.-EU leniency cases had failed (or were failing) at the time of self-reporting. A preliminary analysis of the revised 2002 notice suggests less reliance on U. S. successes, but still more cartels connected to previous infringements in the chemicals industry. A central challenge is preventing the leniency program from providing a way for failed cartelists to tame the end game, or to use leniency as a strategic tool to put former cartel members (now competitors once more) at a disadvantage. Such cases risk overwhelming DG Competition with leniency applications that do little to enhance deterrence.","[Stephan, Andreas] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Law Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Stephan, Andreas] Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of East Anglia,"Stephan, A (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich Law Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",a.stephan@uea.ac.uk,"Stephan, Andreas/HOF-0933-2023",,,,,,37,21,21,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

A discrete Euler process becomes a classical stationary process if 'time' is transformed property. By moving from one time domain to another, one may deform certain time-varying data to non-time-varying data. With these non-time-varying data on the deformed timescale, one may use traditional tools to do parameter estimation and forecasts. The obtained results then can be transformed back to the original timescale. For datasets with an underlying discrete Euler process, the sample M-spectrum and the spectra estimator of a Euler model (i.e., EAR spectral) are used to detect cycles of a Euler process. Beam response and whale data are used to demonstrate the usefulness of a Euler model.

This neoliberalization of European economies has been underpinned by the perceived threat of globalization and global competition leading to the wholesale restructuring of European economies over the past three decades. However, this article does not assume that globalization and neoliberal integration have homogenization effects; rather, it argues that neoliberalization as a process has produced varieties of neoliberalism across Europe and not one hegemonic form of capitalism.

The main objective of the research was to focus on the common financial problem areas in information technology industry, especially in software companies and with the cooperation of the controllers find out the forms of financial analysis and the solutions for the company performance. The information technology cluster is divided into two sub-sectors: software and hardware. The software sector, which is covered in this report, includes companies involved in a broad range of activities, ranging from those that develop off-the-shelf software products to those that provide custom computer programming, computer systems design or data processing services. Major software companies are: Ciber Inc., Cisco Systems, eBags.com, EMC Corporation, Encoda Inc., Evolving Systems Inc., IBM, Intrado Inc., Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems Inc., ViaWest, Webroot Software Inc. etc. The research was made as personal interviews with the company controller(s). Out of all contacted controllers in state Colorado, 75 % were willing to have a personal meeting to help us with our analysis. We arranged the most common financial areas in examined companies in ten groups and explained them in more detail. The most common financial problem areas, which we set up with the cooperation of the controllers in examined companies, are: the investments in accounts receivable is increasing, the investments in inventory is increasing, he investments in fixed assets in increasing, the funding supplied by accounts payable is shrinking, the return on equity is worsening, sales are declining, the company is no longer making money at historical sales levels, material costs are increasing, freight costs are increasing, direct labor costs are increasing. Also we pointed to the importance different financial analyzes which could be used in the companies when the financial symptoms appear.","[Bencova, Marianna] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Kal'avska, Anna] Univ Mateja Bela, Ekon Fak, Inst Manazerskych Syst Dp Poprad, Banskej Bystrici, Slovakia",Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Matej Bel University,"Bencová, M (通讯作者)，Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, 121 St Stephens Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",mariannabencova@rcsi.ie; Anna.Kalavska@umb.sk,,,,,,,8,5,5,1,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In the Polish insurance market, effects of globalisation are visible through, among others, the processes of acquisitions and mergers. In the first years of 21(st) century, the insurance market in Poland witnessed a number of mergers. An important question to rise though is their effectiveness. Were the merging efforts calculated well enough to prove profitable for the insurance companies? In this context, the main objective of the following paper is to present theoretical and practical aspects of mergers among the Polish insurance market entities. A working hypothesis can be defined in the following way: merger and acquisition processes in the long run enhance the effectiveness of insurance companies. The paper is divided into four parts: first two are theoretical and based on related literature. Remaining parts are practical implementation of research hypotheses and conclusions.","Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Bernat, T (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, Ul Mickiewicza 64-12, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",bernatom@o2.pl,"Bernat, Tomasz/J-4433-2019","Bernat, Tomasz/0000-0003-0010-9578",,,,,32,5,5,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A linear combination of the realized volatilities calculated at two different frequencies is used as benchmark to evaluate the volatility forecasting ability of the conditional variance models (GARCH (1, 1)) at different sampling frequencies. From the analysis, it is found that sampling at 30 minutes gives the best forecast for daily volatility. The forecasting ability of these models is deteriorated. however, by the non-normal property of mean adjusted returns, which is an assumption in conditional variance models. Nevertheless, the optimum frequency remained the same even in the case of different models (EGARCH and PARCH) and different error distribution (generalized error distribution, GED) where the error is reduced to a certain extent by incorporating the asymmetric effect on volatility. Our analysis also suggests that GARCH models with GED innovations or EGRACH and PARCH models would give better estimates of volatility with lower forecast error estimates.

It starts by clarifying the distinction between data, information and knowledge, trying to reveal that knowledge is a function depending on data, context and understanding. When we talk about understanding, we talk about human being involvement in the complex knowledge gathering process. But knowledge needs not only to be enriched, but also to be preserved in time in order to be transmitted to other people starving for it. This implies managing knowledge, a topic carefully detailed in this paper. The role of information technology in knowledge management is an essential consideration for any company wishing to exploit emerging technologies to manage its knowledge assets. Yet, knowledge management, as this work aims to prove, is not only about technology; it is mainly about people, processes and practice, about social aspects, culture, vision, incentives, commitment and trust issues. The question for knowledge management is how to make technological systems more like those of people. Human memories dynamically adjust to reflect new experiences. A dynamic memory is by nature a learning system. No knowledge management system learns. But it needs to learn in order to actually work properly. This is why the relationship between human beings and knowledge management would never be destroyed, but only supported by any new technological means.","[Hudea, Oana Simona (Caraman)] Nicolae Titulescu Univ, Fac Social & Adm Sci, Bucharest, Romania",,,caraman_simmy2005@yahoo.com; tomagsorin62@yahoo.com; razvan-mihail.papuc@drept.unibuc.ro; agapleov@yahoo.com,"Toma, Sorin-George/AFC-5952-2022","Toma, Sorin-George/0000-0001-9116-7751",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,119,127,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000019,0

This article shows that if there is only 1 sender who has a conditional preference for maintaining its credibility in reporting accurate information and if the receivers face a coordination situation without information about their opponents' types, the sender could influence the receivers to make decisions according to the sender's primary preference by manipulating the information through the media, which makes the report common knowledge. This is true even when the sender and the receivers have contradictory primary preferences. This result extends to the cases in which the sender has imperfect information or in which the sender's primary preference is to maintain its credibility. In the case of multiple senders, however, when there is enough competition among the senders or when simultaneous reporting takes place, the receivers could play their favored outcome against senders' preferences, which sheds light on a solution to the media manipulation problem.","Lahore Univ Management Sci, Dept Econ, DHA, Lahore, Pakistan",Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Jung, HM (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Dept Econ, DHA, Lahore, Pakistan.",hanjoon@lums.edu.pk,"Jung, Hanjoon/AAK-5523-2021",,,,,,44,13,14,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

In addition, in this paper, the author analyses the growth of the informal economy in developing and countries in transition. Namely, the paper was prepared with a special emphasis on the transitional and developing countries, using bibliography and information made available by the ILO and our own research results. The author concludes that the existence of the informal economy can no longer be considered as a temporary phenomenon. The average size of the hidden economy in the 1990s in transition countries was more than twofold than that of the developed market economies. It has proven to be a major source of employment and income generation for the poor, and thus understanding the informal sector provides valuable tools in the fight against poverty. At the same time, the author stresses that women in the informal sector face significant obstacles: low pay; lack of access to such resources as capital, education, and training; and exclusion from the policy-making process. Macro- and micro-economic policies, including structural adjustment, most often do not take given factors and their negative impacts on women into account, especially on those that belong to marginal groups or those that are exposed to a larger poverty risk. Because that, the author also considers the battle against discrimination in relation to women workers.","Inst Econ Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",Institute of Economic Sciences,"Markovic, MR (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Sci, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia.",mradovic@gmail.com,"Radovic-Markovic, Mirjana/GPX-3324-2022; Markovic, Mirjana Radovic/J-3392-2017",,,,,,20,3,3,1,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Strategic decisions are hard to describe in formal way, as there are individual and subjective characteristics, which are difficult or impossible to formalize, and therefore some authors consider strategic decision making more as an art than as the science. On the other hand, conditions for decision making are becoming more and more complex; there are unlimited amounts of data but less time to process them. The use of modem IT technologies can help to overcome some of these difficulties, but final decision belongs to manager.","[Mohelska, Hana; Tucnik, Petr] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,,hana.mohelska@uhk.cz; petr.tucnik@uhk.cz,"Tučník, Petr/AAF-9744-2019","Tučník, Petr/0000-0002-6705-8974",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7041-227-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,80,83,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCL96,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310659200011,0

The general objective was to make a situational diagnosis about street children in Venezuela and formulate proposals focused on improving their quality of life, based on empirical verification of a policy model designed by Rodriguez (2001). Methodology was based on the elaboration of a state of the art (SA) and a systematic review of literature (SRL). This permitted verifying a set of causes common to the problem as well as the non-existence of national public policies, official statistics, monitoring and evaluation systems and databases with information about the population affected and the different institutions working in the area, all of which are indispensable for the decision-making process and the elaboration of public policies. The existence of street children constitutes a public problem that requires the immediate design of effective, efficient and efficacious public policies on the part of the Venezuelan State. These should be the product of an ample, inclusive study that considers not only the participation, the contribution and the accumulated experience of diverse public and private institutions that have worked in the area, but also of the children and adolescents themselves who experience street life.","[Rodriguez-Mora, Yudey J.] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dpto Ciencias Sociales, Caracas 1080, Venezuela; [Rodriguez-Mora, Yudey J.; Lopez-Zambrano, Maria A.] Univ Simon Bolivar, Unidad Polit Publ, Caracas 1080, Venezuela",Simon Bolivar University; Simon Bolivar University,"Rodríguez-Mora, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Simon Bolivar, Dpto Ciencias Sociales, Caracas 1080, Venezuela.",yrodrig@usb.ve; marialejandra_lopez@uppusb.org,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Furthermore, the knowledge flows within and between regions are assumed to have different characteristics. Until now, hardly any study has examined those latter assumptions empirically. This study aims to provide empirical insights by analysing whether there are differences in the characteristics of regional and non-regional inter-organizational knowledge flows in the Dutch computing services and life sciences industry. The results indeed show significant differences. Confirming the assumptions in the literature, regional knowledge flows are characterized by a higher number of face-to-face contacts, while the knowledge exchanged through non-regional knowledge flows is more valuable. The relations between the duration and the social base of the knowledge flow and its spatial scale are less straightforward.","[Weterings, Anet] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Ponds, Roderik] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Weterings, A (通讯作者)，Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands.",anet.weterings@pbl.nl,,,,,,,44,39,43,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Policy regimes and operating environments differ markedly, however. Here we examine how these differences impact on the NPD strategies of biopharmaceutical firms in the USA and three major EU economies (the UK, France and Germany). Our analysis suggests four key differences between firms' NPD strategies in the two areas. First, while levels of R&D intensity and continuity are broadly similar in the two areas, US firms have notably stronger patent profiles, and are significantly more active in technology licensing than their European counterparts. Second, product development cycles are significantly longer in the USA than among our European respondents. Third, the nature of the product development pipeline is very different in the USA and the major European economies covered by our study: US firms conduct early stage development of more compounds than European firms but take only a similar number to market. Fourth, we see broadly similar levels of alliance activity in our US and European respondents at both the early and late stages of the NPD process. These results suggest a greater substitution of market for hierarchy in US firms' NPD strategies, reflecting differences in the availability and structure of government support in the USA and Europe.","[Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Ctr Small & Medium Sized Enterprises, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Xia, Tianjiao] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Cambridge, England",University of Warwick; University of Cambridge,"Roper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Ctr Small & Medium Sized Enterprises, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",stephen.roper@wbs.ac.uk,"roper, stephen/P-1088-2016","Xia, Tianjiao/0000-0001-7686-4460",,,,,118,4,4,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This view has been reinforced by the aftermath of the international financial crisis, which commenced in mid-2007. A key policy response has been to focus on the ratio of private sector credit to GDP for an economy, observing, in particular, significant deviations between the actual and long-run trends of the ratio.

Related literature suggests the following factors: a firm's appropriability strategy, absorptive capacity, startup and size. Using the 2006 Korean Innovation Survey of service industries, I test whether and how these factors influence the degree of openness for Korean service firms. I find the following: first, a firm becomes more open to external sources by about 0.04 units when the appropriability strategy becomes tighter in one additional scale. Second, a firm becomes more open by 0.513 units when the share of highly educated employees increases by 1%. A startup is less open than an established firm by up to 0.457 units. As firm size increases in terms of employment by 1%, the firm becomes more open by 0.02 units. In Korean service industries, having highly educated employees and being a startup seem to be more influential factors for a firm's openness.","KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, Seoul 130868, South Korea",KDI School of Public Policy & Management,"Moon, S (通讯作者)，KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 87 Hoegiro, Seoul 130868, South Korea.",seongwuk@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,13,14,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The results show that the intensity of backward subcontracting in the domestic economy was important in domestic and export intra-industry purchases. The significant technological variables were that less-integrated firms showed higher intensities than more-integrated firms. Econometric results show that technological intensity is positively correlated with productivity and export-orientation; this infers that technology matters in economic performance. The Probit estimations confirm that domestic supplies matter in labour productivity and export-intensities, but not in technological intensities. Low export-intensities need not discourage technological upgrading if inward-oriented firms operate as subcontractors supplying exporters. Governments should be encouraged to examine the nexus between suppliers, buyers and economic performance to stimulate national inter-firm production synergies to increase competitiveness by domestic firms.","[Rasiah, Rajah] Univ Malaya, Ctr Regulatory Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Bin Mohamad, Mohd Rosli] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Entrepreneurship & Business, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Sanjivee, Puvanesvaran] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Universiti Malaya,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Ctr Regulatory Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rajah@um.edu.my,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011",,,,,46,7,8,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The most popular non-Bayesian approaches use either asymptotic approximations or bootstrapping to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the forecast. The practice in the empirical literature has been to assess the uncertainty of multi-step forecasts by connecting the intervals constructed for individual forecast periods. This paper proposes a bootstrap method of constructing prediction bands for forecast paths. The bands are constructed from forecast paths obtained in bootstrap replications using an optimization procedure to find the envelope of the most concentrated paths. From extensive Monte Carlo study, it is found that the proposed method provides more accurate assessment of predictive uncertainty from the vector autoregressive model than its competitors.

Beside the usual panel data models, we use panel models that explicitly account for spatial dependence between the GRP growth rates. In addition, the possibility of spatial effects being different for different groups of provinces (Interior and Coast) is allowed for. We find that both pooling and accounting for spatial effects help substantially to improve the forecast performance compared to the benchmark models estimated for each of the provinces separately. It is also shown that the effect of accounting for spatial dependence is even more pronounced at longer forecasting horizons (the forecast accuracy gain as measured by the root mean squared forecast error is about 8% at the 1-year horizon and exceeds 25% at the 13-and 14-year horizons).

Previous research explores the impact of transport on social exclusion but does not study the downstream impacts on well-being. To explore this relationship measures of subjective well-being are compared across four groups: (i) people who are neither transport disadvantaged nor socially excluded, (ii) transport disadvantaged only, (iii) socially excluded only and (iv) both transport disadvantaged and socially excluded. The paper explores which component aspects of social exclusion and transport disadvantage have the greatest impact on well-being and which social groups are most likely to face transport disadvantage and social exclusion together.

This paper examines a number of approaches to forecasting short- to medium-term air traffic flows. It contributes as a rare replication, testing a variety of alternative modelling approaches. The econometric models employed include autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) models, time-varying parameter (TVP) models and an automatic method for econometric model specification. A vector autoregressive (VAR) model and various univariate alternatives are also included to deliver unconditional forecast comparisons. Various approaches for taking into account interactions between contemporaneous air traffic flows are examined, including pooled ADL models and the enhanced models with the addition of a world trade variable. Based on the analysis of a number of forecasting error measures, it is concluded that pooled ADL models that include the world trade variable outperform the alternatives, and in particular univariate methods; and, second, that automatic modelling procedures are enhanced through judgmental intervention. In contrast to earlier results, the TVP models do not improve accuracy. Depending on the preferred error measure, the difference in accuracy may be substantial.

It explores two key conceptual differences between the leading world city network studies of Alderson and Beckfield and the work of the Global and World City (GaWC) Research Network. The first is the sectoral differentiation of the data, in which the former focuses on multinational corporations in all industrial sectors and the latter specifically targets only advanced producer services. The second involves methodological differences that lead to dissimilar network structures. Alderson and Beckfield made only a basic hierarchical differentiation of the firms, while the GaWC study used a more elaborate classification method. Combining these approaches, we explore firms' global and regional interdependencies (their centrality within their network and its structure). Using a single data set of the top 100 global multinationals (2005) and their ownership linkages with thousands of subsidiaries in 2,259 unique cities worldwide. The findings not only reveal the nodal centralities and linkage structures within the all industrial sector network and the producer service sector network but also show a strong correlation between these two networks, specifically toward the apex of the economic systems, and evidence of the coexistence of hierarchical and heterarchical city network structures.","[Wall, Ronald Sean] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Urban Management IHS, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Knaap, G.

We address this question by letting students allotted the role of public servants receive a bribe and choose between reporting (whistleblowing), opportunism and reciprocity (delivery of a contract to the briber). Those acting as businesspersons choose whether or not to publicize at the end of the game. Male businesspersons more often depart from maximizing payoffs and allocate resources to punishing opportunistic public servants. Instead of acting opportunistically, some public servants tend to reciprocate or report. We find that female public servants are less inclined to reciprocate. Their resistance towards corruption is found to relate less to a willingness to report. Survey data from international households shows that men are more confident that bribes will be reciprocated, supporting our results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Risk-based pricing is common in private insurance markets but rare in government assurance programs. We analyze accidental underground fuel tank leaks-a source of environmental damage to water supplies-over a 14-year period, using disaggregated (facility-level) data and policy variation in financing the cleanup of tank leaks over time. The data indicate that eliminating a state-level government assurance program and switching to private insurance markets to finance cleanups reduce the frequency of underground fuel tank leaks by more than 20 percent. This corresponds to more than 3,000 fuel tank release accidents forgone over 8 years in one state alone, a benefit in avoided cleanup costs exceeding $400 million. These benefits arise because private insurers mitigate moral hazard by providing financial incentives for tank owners to close or replace leak-prone tanks prior to costly accidents.","[Yin, Haitao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Kunreuther, Howard] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Pennsylvania,"Yin, HT (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,34,15,16,0,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Moreover, migrant wives' employment decreases temporarily, and there are significant selection effects in migration and employment amongst non-migrants.","Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester C04 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Rabe, B (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester C04 3SQ, Essex, England.",brabe@essex.ac.uk,,"Rabe, Birgitta/0000-0001-8632-0088","ESRC [ES/H00811X/1, ES/F000537/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F000537/1, ES/H00811X/1, RES-518-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,27,31,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

First, we briefly discuss the constraints associated with the canonical 'Cobb-Douglas-Dixit-Stiglitz-Spence-Samuelson' NEG setup originally used by Krugman in 1991. We outline the key features of his core-periphery (CP) model and highlight what results are robust to changes in functional forms and agglomeration mechanisms. We also selectively review the literature that amends the original CP model in various directions and discuss what qualitative insights do change. Our conclusion is that progress within the straightjacket of Krugman's original framework is unlikely to produce path-breaking new insights. Second, we suggest that there are potentially large payoffs to stepping outside of the established framework and to extend the NEG approach into various directions that have to date received only little attention. Heterogeneity, cities, transportation, public policy and calibration are avenues along which NEG needs to make progress.","[Behrens, Kristian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Behrens, Kristian] Univ Quebec Montreal, CIRPEE ESG, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Behrens, Kristian; Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] CEPR, London, England; [Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] Univ Geneva, Dept Econ Polit, Geneva, Switzerland; [Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] London Sch Econ LSE, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England; [Robert-Nicoud, Frederic] London Sch Econ LSE, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Geneva; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Behrens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",behrens.kristian@uqam.ca,,"Robert-Nicoud, Frederic/0000-0003-2241-1946",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,99,17,19,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Therefore, discounting costs by the probability of death and taking into account the benefit of wealth consumption are socially inefficient. Moreover, even for the individual under risk of death, the investment in risk reduction is excessive. We discuss market mechanisms that could correct the inefficiencies; we argue that willingness to pay as a criterion for valuing life should radically change; and we show how the results of the economic analysis of tort law should be modified.

The aim of this paper is to measure the technical efficiency of Italian cruise terminals in the Mediterranean Basin when public and private actors participate in the management of terminals. Cruise terminal efficiency is measured by the calculation of the production function with multi-outputs. We apply stochastic frontier analysis based on the distance function.

In order to obtain relevant and complete information regarding the subject of this paper work, the authors have developed a survey that was sent to approximately 500 companies, in different sectors and regions of the country. The survey contains questions regarding environmental protection, the best available technology (BAT) and, also, questions about accessing and managing funds. The results showed that companies that were surveyed have plans to modernize their production capacity by investing in best available techniques. To reduce the gaps across the European Union, Romanian companies need to replace old and polluting technologies with others cleaner and more efficient.

Exploring the case of contested carbon market designs in global climate governance, however, this article argues that performativity analysts have so far failed to pay sufficient attention to the political dimensions of marketization. Adopting insights from recent materialist approaches to the politics of techno-science, the article addresses this imbalance by outlining three modalities of techno-economic citizenship, as these interfere with the shaping of specific carbon market designs. Drawing on web-based research tools and document analysis, each modality is illustrated via transnational environmental NGO practices of contestation, particularly in the global South. The performativity programme, it is concluded, stands to gain from conceptualizing politics as dynamic assemblages of collective actors, sites of contestation and technologies of witnessing. Re-framing performativity in this direction allows for a reintegration of economics into a wider political ecology of contested eco-sciences.","[Blok, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Blok, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Sociol, Aster Farimagsgade 5,Box 2099, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",abl@soc.ku.dk,,"Blok, Anders/0000-0002-3403-698X",,,,,61,42,47,2,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Romanian IT firms which are able to face the crisis effects are characterized by a market-driven thinking that is more focused on customers than competitors. Understanding customers buying criteria is essential in highly competitive software markets, while designing and using a Competitive Intelligence tool will help their management teams to find the best strategic options in view to improve the market position. In this way, we consider that the Cultural Intelligence pattern that we developed and discussed in the last part of the paper can be a powerful strategic tool for the IT project managers.","[Capatina, Alexandra; Nistor, Rozalia; Cristea, Dragos] Univ Dunarea de Jos Galati, Galati, Romania; [Capatina, Alexandra] Al I Cuza Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Capatina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Dunarea de Jos Galati, Galati, Romania.",acapatana@ugal.ro; rnistor@ugal.ro; dcristea@ugal.ro,"Cristea, Dragos/AAY-2781-2020; Capatina, Alexandru/A-7596-2018; Nistor, Rozalia/AAT-6859-2020; Cristea, Dragos Sebastian/AAS-2435-2020","Cristea, Dragos/0000-0001-8227-4854;",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/1.5/S/59184],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/1.5/S/59184 Performance and excellence in postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.",,13,0,0,0,1,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-606-12-0139-6,,,,2011,,,,,,,72,77,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH0UN,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000396639800011,0

Moreover, the fitness of the standard for Basel II Accord which proposed the minimum requirement of 8% of capital to risk-weighted assets is discussed in this study. The records of the data system in a bank listed by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) were used as the empirical data in this research.

Structures and processes concerned with setting up and developing end-user markets have gained much less attention.

The present paper proposes a conceptual framework for analyzing TIS substructures oriented at specific end-user markets. We apply this framework to the creation and maturation of different market segments for photovoltaic applications in Germany.

Thus extended income, which includes household production, should be more equally distributed than money income. Previous studies have confirmed the greater equality of extended income and speculated that the result is due to the weak correlation between money income and household production. We also confirm this result and identify the true reason. We show that the weak correlation cannot be the explanation and that virtually all of the difference in measured inequality between the two measures is due to the addition of a large constant the average value of household production to money income.","[Frazis, Harley; Stewart, Jay] US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Stewart, J (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, 2 Massachusetts Ave, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",Stewart.Jay@BLS.GOV,,,,,,,22,26,28,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The transition process has generated structural modifications in these countries, which were especially reflected at the level of the formal institutions (adjustments regarding the functionality of the free market, the contractual relationships, the compliance of the law primacy and the property). Obviously, certain transformations were manifested within the informal institutions as well (the organizational culture, specific customs of the geographical space) and although the influence of the latter, for sure, does have repercussions to a certain extent on the economic development, the evolution of the informal institutions is the one which is determined, to a greater extent, by the dynamics of the formal ones. That is why the main purpose of this paper is to achieve an empirical analysis, which will take into account indicators such as: the level of compliance with the private property right, the GDP/capita, the governmental expenses for the protection of the property and the application of the law. Based on this analysis, is expected that the research results to highlight the manner in which this specific institution will influence the growth paths in the Central and Eastern European countries and consequently, to lead to the increase of the awareness degree regarding its importance.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Ctr European Studies, RO-700507 Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Frunza, R (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Ctr European Studies, Bvd Carol I 19, RO-700507 Iasi, Romania.",ramona.frunza@uaic.ro,"Tiganasu, Ramona/AAG-8631-2021","Tiganasu, Ramona/0000-0002-5921-7023",,,,,53,5,5,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This paper examines travel behaviour to arts and cultural activities and how this relates to social inclusion. Research literature associated with these issues is examined and then an analysis of a household travel survey in Melbourne, Australia, is undertaken to explore how travel to arts and cultural activities varies by income, car ownership and location. The paper outlines a range of evidence linking participation in arts and cultural activities and positive outcomes for social inclusion. Arts and cultural activities do not fit well into traditional household travel survey definitions of trip purposes. There is also no definitional difference between travel to activities and 'participation' or 'attendance' in arts and cultural activities. This is unfortunate since social outcomes may vary by participation or attendance. Travel survey analysis shows that like other activities trip rates to arts and cultural activities increase with income. However higher participation is demonstrated for zero- and one-car households, which contrasts with previous research of work, education and social travel. Higher participation is also demonstrated for those living in inner parts of the city. The paper suggests that most travel to arts and cultural activity is quite localised and hence much travel may be led by the diversity and range of local opportunities provided. These are particularly high in inner parts of the city. A high share of travel is also demonstrated for older people, who are thought to have the time and desire for greater participation in arts and cultural activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The article, which is primarily based on review of literature, identifies the impacts of tolling in four key policy areas: economic efficiency, regional development, regional redistribution and democracy. Toll financing may change the ranking of projects but does hardly reduce construction costs. The recurrent budget has been quite stable and toll revenues therefore represent net additional resources for road investment.

Several control methods are available but forest managers are constrained by cost, availability, and environmental concerns. As a result forest managers must decide how to allocate limited conservation resources over heterogeneous landscapes. We develop an attribute-based contingent valuation approach that allows us to perform cost-benefit analysis on control programs and inform the distribution of mitigation effort over land units that provide different types of environmental services. We use this approach to examine conservation efforts on three land management units in the southern Appalachian Mountains: Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests. Managers of these forests are focusing their efforts on specific conservation areas chosen for their importance to human-use or ecological services. The result is a network of sites that implicitly defines a tradeoff between ecological and human-use services. Our survey is designed to examine the public's perception of this tradeoff and estimate WTP for hemlock conservation programs. The estimated benefits of conserving hemlocks in the study area outweigh the cost of the mitigation programs by two orders of magnitude. We find that there is substantial support for protection of hemlock stands providing ecological services with very little human-use value. Further, we show that benefits from the current mitigation strategy could be increased by shifting effort to protect more ecological services at the expense of sites that generate primarily human-use value.

Prior work: The reform of oral health services has been especially focused lately, because of some phenomena specific to these times, such as the world economic crisis. Within this context, a new management of economic evaluation is important in dentistry, as it allows the diminishing of costs by choosing a strategy that is less costly but, at the same time, leads to positive results consisting in the decrease of the subjects suffering from oral diseases. Methodology: The study sample included 2 groups of children aged 7-8 years, with multiple dental caries, who presented to the dental offices in Iasi. The first program included a classic and less expensive filling material and children in the second program received treatment of caries with more expensive materials. At the end of the study, after 12 months, we evaluated the economic management of these programs: the efficiency of the two types of treatments, their costs, and the benefit for oral health. Results: The costs of the two types of treatments were different, much higher for the preventive treatment compared to the curative one, and the difference were statistically significant (p = 0.012). As to their efficiency, the preventive program, although more expensive, proved to be more efficient than the curative one, with statistically significant differences (p = 0.034). Implication: At present, the sanitary policy is focused on a new management and economic strategies of cost reduction. An oral health program can be implemented only if its efficiency, advantages or disadvantages are defined in the first stage. In this context, the present study was aimed to present the results of this first stage, so that the policy makers can apply new strategies with low costs and moderate benefit for oral health. Originality value: The originality of the study is reflected in the study hypothesis, assessment of a new health management in dentistry, analyzing costs and efficiency of the two dental programs currently used in dental practice, as well as in the pragmatic perspective of the research, that should determine a positive change management in the present crisis with high prevalence of the dental caries of children in Romania.","[Murariu, Alice Mirela; Hanganu, Carmen Stela] Univ Med & Pharm Gr T Popa Iasi, Fac Med Dent, Dept Community Dent, Iasi, Romania",Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,,murariu_alice@yahoo.com; carmenhanganu1957@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,697,700,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000175,0

The second aim is to describe the recent competitive position of the Czech economy and to identify strengths and weaknesses of the Czech Republic resulting from these international rankings.","[Necadova, Marta] Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Prague, Czech Republic; [Scholleova, Hana] Univ Econ, Dept Business Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Necadová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Prague, Czech Republic.",necadova@vse.cz,,,,,,,6,6,6,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,440,450,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200044,0

The paper is focused on three-parametric lognormal distribution, because it is most common in analyzing incomes. Using data from the Informational system of average income this paper compares quality of models. The Informational system of average income gathers data about person's hourly wages from two sectors - business and non-business. Data set is divided by gender, education, type of job, age and so on. The Informational system of average income publishes on its web sites quartiles and other characteristics for each mentioned groups. Models are made separately for business and non-business sector. For both sectors are constructed 5 models which uses different method of estimating parameters of the lognormal distribution and this thesis describes quality and differences between these models. The thesis also shows some problems appearing when we use lognormal distribution in analyzing incomes. There are described options of usage the lognormal distribution in analyzing incomes. The thesis demonstrates the fact that the curve of lognormal distribution density function is applicable model which is reliable especially in the wide central part of incomes distribution.","[Nedved, Jakub] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,xnedj06@isis.vse.cz,,,,,,,2,0,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,451,463,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200045,0

We desire to measure this performance through indicators based on profit, such as asset profitability, the profitability of shareholders' equity, profit margin or earnings per share, or by using certain indicators based on cash flow. The paper relies on a quantitative, empirical investigation, a mainly inductive approach based on outlining some general conclusions, taking into consideration the results obtained from the particular case study, and the results obtained from the representative sample of analyzed entities. Within the entire paper we intend to use a varied palette of research methods, such as document analysis, comparative method, external observation, and other methods of mathematical and statistical nature. The result of the paper is the construction of a representative sample of entities restructured through merger, a sample which is dedicated to processing and interpreting the indicators based on accounting information, by applying a quantitative analysis (establishing statistical weight and evolution), and a qualitative analysis of certain gross results. The paper can be a useful reference for students, for researchers interested in mergers, but also for practitioners and general public engaged within this type of operations, or for those interested in subtending their merging decision, and also for the entities involved in this study which can exploit the information in this research.

Quantifying and indexing regulatory quality to a singular ranking constructs a best practice model that characterizes regulation in the highest-ranked states. States that outcompete others in transferring regulatory best practices from higher-ranked states are rewarded with an improved international reputation for having investor-friendly policies. By helping to attract the interest of foreign investors, the production of higher competitiveness rankings serves as an extraterritorial state strategy for gaining from globalization. This article details the reform strategy that was used to produce the (post-Soviet) Republic of Georgia's 2006-2009 vault up the EDBI rankings. These higher rankings were the centerpiece of an investment-promotion campaign that accompanied strong inflows of foreign direct investment. Making full use of EDBI as a strategic resource for promoting increased foreign investment involved the composition of an institutional assemblage of the Georgian government, USAID, and the World Bank's Doing Business project. Ethnographic research revealed how power geometries emerged among the assembled organizations to enable the transfer of EDBI's best practice regulations in some areas, and to impede it in others. The case study reveals how limits to policy transfer are created by geographic context and how EDBI rankings can be exploited to obfuscate problematic business conditions that are overlooked by its measurement methodology.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Schueth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog, 414 Social Sci Bldg,267 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",schu1341@umn.edu,,,,,,,140,43,44,2,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The objectives are: the comparative analysis of the organizational culture dimensions in the academic environment of Danubius University of Galati; the realization of a semantic distinction between value, norm and cultural dimension, with the help of foreign teachers that are part of the academic community of Danubius University. Throughout the article we will make use of the already developed theories, which provide the analytical framework for the case studies in universities. As the aim of the article is mostly a normative one, it makes use of the already classical methodological systems: the formal deductive system (Leibnitz), the inductive consensual system (Locke), the synthetic representation system (Kant) and the interdisciplinary pragmatic system (Singer & Churchman). The main methods employed are observation and methodological research about the integration of foreign teachers in the specific environment of the Romanian educational system. They aim to capture the diversity of organizational forms and structures, in relation to specific cultural contexts. The diachronic approach, namely the analysis of facts in their historical evolution, is used. The research presents the phenomenological approach which studies phenomena, processes and cultural facts in their evolution in time and space. The outcome of the study shows that the academic environment from Danubius University of Galati, by means of the foreign teachers who have constantly activated in the educational process is prepared to interact with other persons who have different values and different methods of perceiving the proximity. This study is addressed to administrators from international universities offering them a model for collaboration and a better knowledge of people from their proximity. It is also useful for different enterprises when, in order to reach top performance, knowledge of the other's cultural background is necessary.

There is no reason to suppose an existence of some really notably important statistical correlation between the corruption and the economic performance. Question is whether some relationship between the corruption and the economic performance exists. Of course the economic performance depends mainly on different circumstances, who have more direct influence than corruption. But the corruption can be considered as one of factors that influences the business environment. And the business environment affects transaction cost and in some cases also other cost. The level of the corruption depends on many different circumstances, for example on historical and social conditions and on traditions. But the corruption is influenced by factor like the legal environment, mainly law enforcement. And these factors have a significant impact on conditions for business. The Corruption Perception Index published each ear by Transparency International is used as an indicator of the corruption. The economic performance is assessed by GNP per capita with regard to growth rate.","[Soukupova, Jana] Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,,jasoukup@vse.cz,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-77-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,581,590,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BDJ83,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000313565200056,0

The responsibility of project manager is to keep his project team in proactive working temper. Project team has to be wary of risks and opportunities and engaged in the risk management process. Project stakeholders are an important part of the risk management process and project manager is responsible for communication with them. If needed, he has to find experts to consult special problems to avoid future complication. Qualitative analysis ranks project risks and opportunities by their impact on the project and probability of occurrence. This is important for planning response strategies for every single risk or opportunity. Both unacceptable risks and opportunities we want to take require having a suitable response plan. The plan has to be controlled continuously and updated according to the current changes. Quantitative risk evaluation provides numerical values of the expected impact of risks and opportunities. The goal of this paper is to show how project risk is managed in conditions of Czech and Slovak manufacturing companies. The paper is divided into three main parts. The first part is an in-depth literature search focused on risk project management. This part shows what the ideal risk management process should look like.

The new methodology uses and explores the benefit of these in order to obtain even more valuable information about the one day visit of a particular visitor. This will help the science centers improve their concept and educational environment. The main difference from already presented methodologies consists in the way of observation, using a pair of special glasses with the ability to record audio and video. Thanks to these glasses, the observer does not have to be present in person, so, in the end, more realistic data about natural behavior of the visitors are collected. Especially the audio data, which allow us to hear the conversations and the immediate opinion and understanding of the visitors, are very valuable. By applying this method, the science centers will gain information on the depth of the visitor's learning experience, on how the learning took place as well as on the spatial and time division of the visit and learning process and, finally, on the visitors' personal reflections.","[Suldova, Alena] Techmania Sci Ctr Ops, Plzen 31600, Czech Republic; [Cimler, Petr] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Suldová, A (通讯作者)，Techmania Sci Ctr Ops, Plzen 31600, Czech Republic.",alena.suldova@techmania.com; cimler@kmo.zcu.cz,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,7,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This paper presents a newly introduced production process entitled ProJIT, within the company mentioned before. Research specialists think that small production companies represent a problem in environmental protection. Today many of us are dealing with problems which concern environmental pollution, this being caused by a great deal of factors. One of these factors could be the technological processes used by SMEs. The finding of a production process which doesn't pollute the environment and which also helps minimizing the expenses, represents a great interest. The present paper is built on some fundamental topics of production management (e.g. the technological production process), environmental protection (regarding to find/develop an adequate production process, which doesn't cause environment pollution). In order to achieve the objectives mentioned, we used a case study, resulted in a method entitled ProJIT and according to this, quality was controlled in every production phase. When finding qualitative shortcomings, production would be stopped, and the shortcomings remedied. The use of ProJIT resulted in lower costs, a more optimal production process, and in minimized pollution. Therefore this system will be used continuously within the Chemi Ceramic Ltd. The limitations of the results can be the human resources and the machinery used throughout the production process. The present study can be useful for researchers (in the domain of SMEs' production processes) and quality assessors, because of its new production process and its continuous quality controlling system. The newly introduced process, called ProJIT brings contribution to the SMEs, due to its continuous controlling (which has the aim to eliminate qualitative shortcomings) and to its cost-lowering and production optimizing nature.","[Turoczy, Zsuzsanna] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,,turoczyzsuzsi@yahoo.com; liviu.marian@yahoo.com; chemicer@clicknet.ro; posztocska@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,165,168,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000042,0

In order to ensure a high-level education, MET requires costly equipment, such as simulators and training ships and that means huge sums of money. It is easy to conclude that not all institutions can offer high-quality MET especially because Maritime Education is more expensive than it should be. Training for seafarers has evolved rapidly to include a whole range of approaches and techniques. In particular, reliance on traditional face-to-face and on-the-job training has changed, giving way to the increased use of even more advanced and realistic simulators and other forms of computer-based training. There is every indication that the management of shipboard systems will become even more advanced and integrated in the years to come and training will have to keep up with that progress. The shipping industry needs to recruit high quality seafarers and train them to high standards to reflect the changing nature of shipboard operations and demands for officers to possess a wider range of skills. This means that the price of cutting back on investment in training will be even greater than it was in the past. Hence, knowledge is becoming more and more specialized and a highly educated workforce is paramount for continuous economic growth in developed countries, especially in MET Indeed, there is an increased awareness of the importance of change in maritime business management, in economic growth theory and in development thinking. This reflects the increasing complexity in processes, products and services maritime business experiences. We note that efficient knowledge transfer in MET is facilitated by three factors: improved understanding as a result of a continuous communication, the existence of common references and competences and complementary knowledge bases motivating exchange. Technology, innovation and knowledge are the central factors contributing to economic growth. Innovation happens in a dynamic interaction between actors, like the shipping industry. Furthermore knowledge is not seen as a public good that is freely available for everyone; rather knowledge can be local and tacit. Therefore, knowledge could be the change that could be applied in order to obtain a high quality in MET We observe that the use of the Internet in the setting for this study poses some challenges related to those factors. When interaction does not happen face to face but through a technological interface, it might be more difficult to establish a broad basis for communication as the spectre and interactivity in the communication is somewhat reduced. Where cooperation happens across cultures and between actors in countries with different levels of development (this happens onboard a merchant ship where the crew members have different nationalities and cultures), common references and competences might be scarcer. On the other hand, there is a greater chance that complementary knowledge bases exist and this can give a motivation for knowledge transfer to happen. These observations will be useful when investigating cooperation taking place between researchers.","[Varsami, A.; Popescu, C.; Batranca, G.] Constanta Maritime Univ, Constanta, Romania",Constanta Maritime University,,anastasia.varsami@yahoo.com; corypopescu25@yahoo.com; gbatrinca@martest.net,"Batrinca, Ghiorghe I/A-1866-2014",,,,,,7,0,0,0,12,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,KOMOTINI,"UNIV CAMPUS, KOMOTINI, 69100, GREECE",,,978-960-99486-3-0,,,,2011,,,,,,,457,460,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBI19,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306940000115,0

Our findings show that when game, playoff, and consecutive season uncertainty measures are all included in estimating attendance for individual games, only the metrics that are related to the home team's standing are significant. These metrics include the change in performance from the previous season and the importance of the game in qualifying for the playoffs.","[Winfree, Jason A.] Univ Michigan, Program Sport Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tainsky, Scott] Univ Illinois, Dept Recreat Sport & Tourism, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Winfree, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Program Sport Management, 1402 Washington Hts 2114, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tainsky@illinois.edu; jwinfree@umich.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020",,,,,,16,35,38,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

During almost two years of consultations and dissemination, the report met with broad acceptance among government officials, development professionals, and researchers. Policymakers grappling with difficult spatial development issues have found the report's analytical framework compelling and its policy guidance useful. An exception to this generally favorable reception has been the reaction from a number of economic geographers. In this article, we respond to criticisms about the report's scope, guiding framework, and policy implications that are emphasized in the accompanying articles in this issue of Economic Geography. In conclusion, we agree with economic geographers such as Rodriguez-Pose who call for critical engagement with the report and with the more detailed follow-up studies that use the WDR 2009's framework.

There are, however, quite substantial social costs associated with a policy of toleration, and this begs the question as to why such a variance should exist. In this paper we claim that, due to the globalisation of crime, if a single country should break the chain of accountability, then it will provide a safe haven for criminals and attract the total financial proceeds of crime. Because smaller economies are best able to insulate themselves from the costs of crime, we argue that smaller countries bear only a tiny share of the total costs relative to the potential benefits of investment that money laundering offers, and so have a higher incentive to tolerate the practice compared to their larger neighbours. As such, we claim that the existence of a money laundering market is due to a policy of AML 'defection', and that the degree of 'defection' depends largely on the size of the country. We present a simple model of policy competition which formalises this intuition, and conclude by exploring a number of policy recommendations which flow from this. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Gregory; Teece, David J.",,,INNOVATION SPILLOVERS AND THE DIRT ROAD FALLACY: THE INTELLECTUAL BANKRUPTCY OF BANNING OPTIONAL TRANSACTIONS FOR ENHANCED DELIVERY OVER THE INTERNET,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; HETEROGENEITY; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; MONOPOLY; PRODUCT; OUTPUT,"In October 2009, the Federal Communications Commission proposed net neutrality regulations, including a new rule that would have the effect of banning optional business-to-business transactions between broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) and content providers for enhanced delivery of packets over the Internet. The proposed nondiscrimination rule would have the ironic effect of actively discriminating against any kind of content or application that is differentiated by its need for greater assurance of higher quality transmission across the Internet (known as quality of service, or QoS) than undifferentiated best-effort delivery can offer. This result not only would reduce static efficiency by encouraging higher consumer prices, but also would reduce dynamic efficiency by retarding innovation. The proposed rule manifests an inverse relationship between means and ends, for it would actively thwart the Commission's stated purpose of promoting innovation both in and at the edges of the network. These economic considerations set the bar very high for those who claim that the new regulation is needed to prevent theoretical harms that have not materialized in more than a decade of real-world experience. By now, the economic arguments in favor of network neutrality regulation have coalesced around three principal theories. The first is the theory that, if permitted to charge suppliers of content or applications for optional higher quality delivery, network operators will ignore positive spillover effects and set charges at higher than socially optimal levels. The second is the theory that vertically integrated network operators will foreclose independent providers of Internet content and applications. A third and less clearly articulated theory is that the broadband ISP will degrade the quality of best-effort delivery of Internet packets-reducing the quality of best-effort delivery to that of a dirt road-as a means of coercing suppliers of content or applications into purchasing superior QoS. We show that none of these three theories of harm is plausible. Certainly, none justifies the proposed across-the-board ban on optional business-to-business QoS transactions between ISPs and content providers-transactions that could prove particularly valuable to smaller content providers looking to differentiate their offerings from and compete with larger content rivals that have the scale and resources to meet their QoS needs with third-party or self-deployed content delivery networks.","[Sidak, J.

The objective of this work was to analyze the role of these consolidators in integrating a social network that facilitates market transactions and production activity improvement. The detailed study of four specific cases made it possible to conclude that consolidators are more than simple brokers; they also act as agents who transfer knowledge, customs and experiences, making the design and manufacture of local handicrafts attractive to international markets. The consolidator also facilitates producer-customer relations, consolidates the production of many manufacturers, negotiates and endorses commercial contracts.

We base our analysis on the work of Schnytzer, Lamers, and Makropoulou (2008), who showed that insider trading in the 1997-1998 Australian racetrack betting market represented between 20% and 30% of all trading in this market. They showed that the presence of insiders leads opening prices to deviate from the true winning probabilities. Under these circumstances, forecasts of race outcomes should take into account an estimate of the extent of insider trading for each horse. We show that the added value of this new variable for profitable betting is sufficient to reduce the losses when only prices are taken into account. Since the only variables taken into account by either Schnytzer et al. (2008) or this paper are price data, this is tantamount to a demonstration that the market is, in practice, weak-form efficient.

In this paper, I review the key buy-side economic questions and analytic frameworks that are likely to be at the forefront in future investigations of health plan mergers. In particular, I explain how industry structure implies that shares of purchases from individual providers as well as area-wide shares of purchases are likely to inform antitrust analysis of potential monopsony harm in health plan mergers. I also discuss the appropriate treatment of government payers in calculating and assessing buy-side market shares. I conclude with a discussion of how competition and market power in downstream markets for the sale of commercial insurance interact with the potential exercise of monopsony power in upstream markets for the purchase of provider services.","Bates White LLC, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Capps, CS (通讯作者)，Bates White LLC, 1300 Eye St NW,Suite 600E, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",cory.capps@bateswhite.com,,,,,,,6,4,4,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

It contributes to the existing literature by first developing a conceptual framework that focuses on both opportunism risk and communication problems to explain how physical proximity among firms can be an alternative to internal organization. Second, this study tests this relationship through the use of firm-level data from 10,955 establishments in the Spanish meat industry. Results confirm that establishments located in agglomerated areas internally undertake fewer stages of the value chain. We also find that this relationship is weaker than expected and fades at distances greater than 2.5 km, which may be explained by the particular characteristics of this industry.","[Diez-Vial, Isabel; Alvarez-Suescun, Emilio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Org Empresas, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Diez-Vial, I (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Org Empresas, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",diezvial@ccee.ucm.es; emilio.alvarez@ccee.ucm.es,"Diez-Vial, Isabel/ABF-9207-2020",,,,,,53,9,10,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This reform liberalized prices and relieved many entry barriers in the profession, while keeping the professional standard in place. We use the concept of entry thresholds developed by Bresnahan and Reiss (1991) to infer on the effect of entry on competition before and after the regulatory reform. We find that entry affects conduct in the Dutch notary profession as a second notary office in a market requires a much larger market size than a monopoly office to be profitable, suggesting that profit margins drop with entry. Yet, we find no significant differences between entry thresholds ratios before and after the regulatory reform. We discuss potential explanations for the sluggishness of entry in the profession and implications for policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We find that significantly more students who are enrolled in economics courses judge price increases as fair than students enrolled in other courses. Moreover, this tendency strengthens the more training in economics the students receive. In addition, fewer students with advanced economic education judge allocation through the local community as fair when compared to first-year students in economics courses or other students. These results stand in contrast to results obtained by Frey et al. (J Econ Educ, 24:271-281, 1993) on the same survey.

One particularly significant fraud involves excessive claims for the rebate of VAT on exported goods. This fraud has two interesting features. First, it requires the collusion of an intermediary to supply the false documentation that supports a rebate application. Second, the punishment schedule is convex-with capital punishment used in major fraud cases. These features ensure that the payoff function of a firm engaging in fraud is strictly concave in the level of fraud. This gives a well-defined optimization without the need to appeal to risk aversion. We show that the existence of fraud does not affect the real output decision of the firm nor the tax policy of the government. Audit resources can be used to detect firms engaged in fraud as well as the intermediaries who supply false documents. Under reasonable assumptions it is shown that resources should be focused on detecting firms and not intermediaries. Finally, if the government must take action on fraud a convex punishment scheme is shown to be optimal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This could be because the price increase can mitigate an output-structure distortion: if there are two goods which have the same marginal cost, then, under some conditions, the good in higher demand (the efficient good) will have a higher markup rate than the other good (the inefficient good). This suggests that the output structure is distorted in favor of the inefficient good, since the higher markup rate of the efficient good should lead to a considerable increase in demand for the inefficient good.","Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chungli 32001, Taiwan",National Central University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, 300 Chung Ta Rd, Chungli 32001, Taiwan.",mcchang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,32,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Therefore, unmarried fertility may be positively associated with future crime. Alternatively, in an environment in which social stigma attached to nonmarital fertility is high, many low-match-quality parents will marry, and children reared in these families may actually be worse off than if their parents had not married. We explore these effects empirically, finding that over the long run unmarried fertility is positively associated with murder and property crime but that the degree of social stigma has affected this relationship. For instance, our results suggest that some marriages in the 1940s and 1950s were of such low quality that the children involved would have been better off in single-parent households; however, this finding is reversed for marriages in the 1960s and there-after-many marriages that would have benefited children were forgone.","[Tamura, Robert] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,,,"Tamura, Robert/AAI-7510-2020",,,,,,72,7,10,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Central to the production of an urban middle class in China are new forms and practices of family culture that are anchored in a market ideology of education. The article argues that the idea and practice of school choice among urban middle-class families is part of a naturalized consumerist dynamic in China wherein the transformation of education into a market-supplied commodity is legitimated and animated within a neo-liberal discourse of competition, meritocracy and self-determination. Family life and decisions, while seemingly afforded a new degree of autonomy from state intervention, are not outside the workings of official power, but intimately tied to state policies and agendas.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Social & Cultural Studies Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Crabb, MW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Social & Cultural Studies Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mwcrabb@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,48,43,53,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Two determining factors could influence this: constraints linked to the search for complementary resources and possibilities to connect with partners. An empirical study on collaborations established by several laboratories of the University of Poitiers with companies confirms this hypothesis. Searching for specific resources means fewer potential partners are available and explains the small number of local collaborations and the high number of partnerships with certain regions. However, these constraints alone do not suffice to determine the spatial scale of such collaborations. Analysing how connections are established particularly reveals that partners generally prefer to renew collaborations rather than initiate new ones. This leads to the existing geography of partnerships being reinforced.","Univ Poitiers, UFR Sci Econ, Lab CRIEF, F-86022 Poitiers, France",Universite de Poitiers,"Ferru, M (通讯作者)，Univ Poitiers, UFR Sci Econ, Lab CRIEF, 93 Ave Recteur Pineau, F-86022 Poitiers, France.",marie.ferru@univ-poitiers.fr,,,,,,,61,17,17,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The development of the woman-centred family occurred in dialogue between urban women activists and the state, which increasingly perceived the advantages of mobilizing married women to raise healthy children, organize neighbourhoods, care for the family's elderly and take responsibility for saving the family's money.","Princeton Univ, Dept Hist, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Garon, S (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Hist, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",garon@princeton.edu,,"Garon, Sheldon/0009-0007-0741-4424",,,,,53,16,20,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Therefore, China's corresponding measures should include promoting the quality and structure of export commodities, improving technical standards and product certification systems, establishing effective early-warning mechanisms for technical trade barriers, strengthening international exchange and cooperation, and implementing products diversification and market diversification strategies, etc.","[Huang Fanhua] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,,fhhuang@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,AMERICAN SCHOLARS PRESS,MARIETTA,"3238 HARVEST WAY, MARIETTA, GA 30062 USA",,,978-0-9845209-1-6,,,,2010,,,,,,,386,390,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTV50,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000288188100073,0

The study was descriptive and analytical using qualitative methodology and techniques of the semi-structured interview, content analysis and the family test, integrated through triangulation. The interviewees were school-age children (between 7 and 12 years old) whose mothers are incarcerated in the Women's Annex of the Maracaibo National Jail, and the legal guardians who are their custodians. Results indicate that the interviewed children, whose mothers are in prison, tend to develop psychological difficulties such as separation anxiety, stress and depression; in social terms, they have difficulties with self-regulation, social regulation and self-esteem. It is recommended that the State develop programs to offer these children appropriate shelter, protection and psychosocial guidance in overcoming difficulties resulting from deprivation and the dislocation of mother and family.","[Inciarte Gonzalez, Alicia] Univ Zulia, Fac Humanidades & Educ, Div Postgrad, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela; [Sanchez de Calles, Gloria] Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Polit, Inst Criminol, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"González, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Fac Humanidades & Educ, Div Postgrad, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",ainciart@gmail.com; Glosanchez@cantv.net; Flaviaocando@hotmal.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,19,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

In particular, we apply a similar suite of models to four different datasets and aim at identifying combination methods that perform well throughout different series and variations of the model suite. We pool individual densities using linear and logarithmic combination methods. The suite consists of linear forecasting models with moving estimation windows to account for structural change. We find that combining densities is a much better strategy than selecting a particular model ex ante. While combinations do not always perform better than the best individual model, combinations always yield accurate forecasts and, as we show analytically, provide insurance against selecting imappropriate models. Logarithmic combinations can be advantageous, in particular if symmetric densities are preferred.

Big retail chains expand their retail strategies and activities to many countries especially in East Asia, Middle and Eastern Europe and Latin America. Similar trends have been evident in the Czech Republic. Socio-economic and political changes in the 1990s accompanied by the process of economic transition, private enterprise development, procedures relating to demonopolisation, and decentralisation have brought dramatic changes in the retail sector. Evaluating the internationalization process of the Czech retailing, four periods can be distinguished in its development after 1990. The first period (1990 - 1994) was characterized by many organizational and ownership changes in the retail structure that brought its fragmentation. The first concentration tendencies associated also with the entry of foreign retailers were apparent in the second period (1995 - 1997). In that period of time, many international retailers came to the Czech market and tried to strengthen their position there. This brought not only stronger competition, new retail strategies and activities but also new retail formats such as discount stores, hypermarkets or cash-and-carry stores. The presence and position of the international retailers demonstrated by their turnover and ranking in TOP 10 was getting stronger. The period in 1998 - 2000 can be characterized by relatively high level of internationalization and growing concentration and integration tendencies. International retailers were constantly increasing their market share and significantly influencing the retail scene in the Czech Republic. However, the development of the Czech retailing was not so dynamic after 2000. The development of retailing concentrated more on qualitative changes that were evoked by growing competition and needs to satisfy consumers.","Tech Univ Liberci, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Mkt, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Simová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Mkt, Liberec, Czech Republic.",jozefina.simova@tul.cz,,"Simova, Jozefina/0000-0003-0809-8180",,,,,27,12,12,1,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This article proposes a forest-energy programme that will contribute to reducing the risk of forest fires in this Atlantic Region of Southern Europe. We apply the contingent valuation method to assess a programme whereby 10% of the electricity produced from coal, fuel oil and gas would be replaced by electricity generated in biomass power plants. The programme would begin implementation in 2005 and it would take 6 years (up to 2010) before we reach the 10% goal. The results show that Galician households are willing to pay a mean of 38 Euros per year. In addition, we have introduced an innovative procedure to detect protest responses related to the payment vehicle in a contingent valuation.

The financial system in the Central European countries is traditionally based on banks and credit market. Therefore, we see the necessity for modelling of the credit market and assessment of the factors that determine development of the credit market. The aim of the paper is to analyze long-run relationships in the Czech Republic's credit market and to reveal significant determinants of the volume of credits disbursed. We apply cointegration analysis and vector error correction modelling on quarterly data to test existence of equilibrium relationships in credit supply and credit demand during the period 1994 - 2007. The results suggest positive influence of GDP and interest rate on the volume of credits provided. However, the VECM estimation does not prove the existence of a statistically significant long-run equilibrium relationship explaining the credit demand. The credit supply frequently and substantially departed from the equilibrium level. The results show that the more available sources the banks have the higher is the volume of credits provided. Likewise, more profitable the lending activity leads to higher volume of credits disbursed. The widest gap between the current credit supply and equilibrium level can be observed in the first half of 2001. At the same time, we witnessed a sharp decline in volume of the credits disbursed. All together can be interpreted as a sign of the credit crunch in the Czech banking sector. The credit supply has exceeded its long-run equilibrium since 2002. Banks probably respond to the growing credit demand and disburse credits as intensively as possible, which would result in deterioration of the credit portfolio quality.","[Stavarek, Daniel; Vodova, Pavia] Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Financi, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Stavárek, D (通讯作者)，Slezska Univ Opave, Obchodne Podnikatelska Fak Karvine, Katedra Financi, Opava, Czech Republic.",stavarek@opf.slu.cz; vodova@opf.slu.cz,"Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010; Klepkova Vodova, Pavla/ABG-2948-2020","Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721; Klepkova Vodova, Pavla/0000-0003-0382-5174",,,,,12,11,11,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The objective of the research was to analyse the motives of entrepreneurs starting their own business and to determine factors that affect the success of SMEs. The empirical research was conducted according to 11 motivational items of entrepreneurs to establish their own business and 17 items affecting entrepreneurs' success. Four motivational factors are obtained in this research (greater business achievement, independence, intrinsic factor and job security), as well as seven factors affecting entrepreneurs' success (position in society, interpersonal skills, approval and support, competitive product/service, leadership skills, always to be informed and business reputation). Based on these results and their comparison with the empirical findings in other countries, it may be concluded that motivational factors of entrepreneurs are generic in developing countries. The results showed that there was a lack of motives concerned with sustainable development of enterprise in a long run. On the other hand, there is a variety of different success factors affecting entrepreneurs, which primarily depend on the current situation in the local environment.","[Stefanovic, Ivan] Business Acad, Link Grp, Belgrade, Zemun, Serbia; [Prokic, Sloboda] Serbian Econ Ctr, Belgrade, Serbia; [Rankovic, Ljubodrag] Knjaz Milos Ad, Arandelovac, Serbia",,"Stefanovic, I (通讯作者)，Business Acad, Link Grp, Cara Dusana 34, Belgrade, Zemun, Serbia.",ivan.stefanovic@link.co.rs; sloboda.prokic@abs.rs; rankovic.ljubodrag@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,32,45,1,36,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This paper highlights the interaction among property rights, transaction costs, and the empty core. Our experimental results indicate that the existence of the core is an important determinant of bargaining generally and the Coase theorem in particular. They confirm our conjecture that when the core is empty and property rights are ill defined, Coasean efficiency breaks down. Among other results, our experiments show that the number of inefficient (non-Pareto-optimal) agreements and bargaining rounds with cycling are significantly greater when the core is empty than when the core exists, especially when property rights are ill defined. Our results suggest an economic role for specific property right arrangements to resolve the empty core.","[Aivazian, Varouj A.; Callen, Jeffrey L.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [McCracken, Susan] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",University of Toronto; McMaster University,"Aivazian, VA (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,17,7,7,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

First, admitting Ellsberg choices as rational leads to behaviour, such as sensitivity to irrelevant sunk cost, or aversion to information, which most economists would consider absurd or irrational. Second, we argue that the mathematical objects referred to as beliefs in the ambiguity aversion literature have little to do with how an economist or game theorist understands and uses the concept. This is because of the lack of a useful notion of updating. Third, the anomaly of the Ellsberg choices can be explained simply and without tampering with the foundations of choice theory. These choices can arise when decision makers form heuristics that serve them well in real-life situations where odds are manipulable, and misapply them to experimental settings.","[Al-Najjar, Nabil I.; Weinstein, Jonathan] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Al-Najjar, NI (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",al-najjar@northwestern.edu; j-weinstein@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,48,105,108,0,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Colleges and universities in the United States currently invest a vast amount of resources in order to attract well-qualified students. Costly activities like advertising, infrastructure investments, the recruitment of academic stars, or the granting of merit-based tuition discounts can be interpreted as different forms of market signaling in the sense of Spence. According to some social science authors, these signaling activities have reached a dimension that has to be classified as excessive or socially wasteful from a welfare-economic viewpoint. The present article makes some conceptual remarks on this excessive-signaling hypothesis, and intends to contribute to the debate about the (potentially) harmful and beneficial effects of competition in higher education.",,,,mause@uni-bremen.de,,"Mause, Karsten/0000-0001-6195-1860",,,,,45,15,30,0,19,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Based on sector data on employment, it is examined to which extent border regions experience positive (or negative) spillovers from neighbouring regions. The analysis proves that Europe's internal borders still suffer from lower spillovers which gives them a structural disadvantage as compared to non-border regions. The hypothesis that this is due to low levels of labour mobility has been supported by various studies. The analysis also shows, however, that border regions of weaker performing economies (Germany and Belgium) experience positive cross border spillovers from stronger neighbouring economies (the Netherlands).

In the transition to a knowledge-based economy, many emerging Asian countries have attempted to raise their national investments to develop their science and technological capability. This study attempts to compare the growth behavior of science and technology of selected emerging countries (China, Malaysia, and Thailand) with that of the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) (Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) using logistic growth function with a dynamic carrying capacity. Japan is also included in the study to provide a benchmark for advanced science and technological development. While a dynamic self-propagating growth is found for the science and technology of the NIEs, the corresponding growth potential is relatively lower and static for the emerging economics. Unlike in Japan where the growth potential of science and technology has seemingly reached a plateau, the NIEs are still reaping the dynamics of the interaction between science and technology, and the emerging economies are at the initial stage of this development process.","[Wong, Chan-Yuan; Goh, Kim-Leng] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Wong, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",wongcy111@gmail.co; klgoh@um.edu.my,"Goh, Kim-Leng/B-3949-2009; WONG, CHAN YUAN/C-1044-2010","Goh, Kim-Leng/0000-0002-2367-8303;",,,,,56,11,11,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

These mergers provide the opportunity to study important market power issues in China's airline markets. Given that increased concentration and multimarket contact are the main legacies of an airline merger, the effects of mergers on these variables can raise the potential for the exercise of market power. However, an examination of the period 2002-2004 during which the Chinese airline mergers occurred shows that the resulting increased concentration and enhanced multimarket contact did not have important consequences for airfares in Chinese city-pair markets. The presence of Hainan Airlines appears to have played an important role in suppressing the airfares charged by China Eastern and China Southern.","[Zhang, Yahua] Univ So Queensland, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Fac Business, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Round, David K.] Univ S Australia, Ctr Regulat & Market Anal, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; University of South Australia,"Zhang, YH (通讯作者)，Univ So Queensland, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Fac Business, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",shane.zhang@usq.edu.au,"round, david k/C-2705-2009","Zhang, Yahua/0000-0003-1522-3402",,,,,60,21,24,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We propose a new bivariate mixture multiplicative error model and show that it is a good fit to Nikkei 225 index call and put option implied volatility (IV). A good model fit requires two mixture components in the model, allowing for different mean equations and error distributions for calmer and more volatile days. Forecast evaluation indicates that, in addition to jointly modeling the time series of call and put IV, cross effects should be added to the model: put-side implied volatility helps forecast call-side TV, and vice versa. Impulse response functions show that the TV derived from put options recovers faster from shocks, and the effect of shocks lasts for up to six weeks. (C) 2009 International Institute of Forecasters.

To achieve this, it proposes determining the labor hysteresis record, considering long-term, comprehensive data from the 1965-2003 period. First, a theoretical review was made that permits defining the operative concept of hysteresis, connected with the explicative proposal for endogenizing recurrent disturbances in the activity level of the unemployment rate trajectory, considering, for this purpose, the impact of the dynamic of petroleum income on the previous disturbance record of the Venezuelan economy. Secondly, the study proceeded to empirically verify the hysteresis hypothesis. For this, unit root tests were performed whose results contributed evidence in favor of the aforementioned record for the period under consideration. Derivations from both the Phillips-Perron unitary root test as well as the Dickey-Fuller test suggest that the historical series of unemployment variables follows a process of random progress due to which the trajectory of this variable presents a long memory. In other words, the climbing behavior of unemployment rate values, associable with recurrent disturbances in the GDP, does not dissipate during the period under consideration, showing rather a conduct without return for the values of the variable under consideration.","[Barboza Perez, Maribel; Hernandez, Luis] Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Pérez, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Fac Ciencias Econ & Sociales, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",marecon@cantv.net,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Besides Markov switching, threshold autoregressive (TAR), and smooth transition autoregressive, (STAR) regime switching models, we also estimate univariate models in which conditional heteroskedasticity is captured by GARCH and in which predicted volatilities appear in the conditional mean function. We find that capturing nonlinear effects may be key to improving forecasting. In contrast to other G7 countries, US and UK asset return data are special, requiring that non-linear dynamics be modeled, especially when using a Markov switching framework.

At the same time, the impact of tobacco control policies on smoking rates and their effectiveness on decreasing cigarette consumption are also analyzed. Consumers are distinguished in four smoking groups in concurrence to smoking status, and dichotomous indicators are constructed to describe tobacco control policies, psychosocial, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. The empirical analysis estimates an ordered probit model with sample selectivity. The results indicate the absence of selectivity bias for cigarette consumption; hence, the subsample of smokers comprises a random independent sample and smoking participation and cigarette consumption form distinct stages of smoking behavior. Most of the psychosocial factors are found to be statistically significant in the econometric analysis, implying the main determinants of smoking behavior. In addition, total smoking bans in workplaces and educational institutions comprise efficient policy tools for decreasing cigarette demand, while partial smoking restrictions are accrued to be ineffective in reducing smoking participation.","[Raptou, Elena] Democritus Univ Thrace, Komotini, Greece; [Mattas, Konstadinos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Agr Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Katrakilidis, Constantinos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Raptou, E (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Komotini, Greece.",elenra@agro.auth.gr; mattas@auth.gr; katrak@econ.auth.gr,,"Mattas, Konstadinos/0000-0001-8304-4292",,,,,79,1,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

For international firms, likelihood of corporate default increases with the ratio of inventories to total assets but decreases with net profits and net sales.","[Arslan, Oezguer; Karan, Mehmet Baha] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Arslan, Ö (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",mbkaran@hacettepe.edu.tr; arslan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"KARAN, MEHMET BAHA/I-8458-2013","Arslan-Ayaydin, Ozgur/0000-0002-1977-6752",,,,,27,18,20,0,32,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Repeated food crises (dioxin-infested chickens, mad cow disease) bring back into discussion the option of a type of agriculture based exclusively on a maximum profitability. Consumers want healthier food choices that respect nature. Many of them, shocked by the global economic unbalance, keep an eye on the origin of the products that are presented to them and the conditions under which they are made. Fair trade provides the means to act through responsible shopping, in order to act against poverty and help regulate international trade. In this new perception of trade, help and assistance relations between the North and the South are replaced by fair trade relations who avoid unfair trade between producers and consumers. In this context, business companies must have the initiative to suggest ways to find alternatives that match their expectations and, at the same time, encourage a sustainable development. It is up to them to constantly improve the quality and the dynamic of the offer so that it better matches the expectations of producers, on one hand, and the consumers, on the other, so that fair trade can be a success, both at a commercial level and as far as its impact on the human development of the populations from underdeveloped countries.","[Belascu, Lucian] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,,lucian_belascu@yahoo.com,"BELASCU, LUCIAN/Q-5282-2019","BELASCU, LUCIAN/0000-0002-7711-3746",,,,,13,0,0,1,3,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,27,31,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS71,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984100004,0

They believe that the global knowledge economy involves the thorough integration of the global economy, continuous innovation and networks rather than hierarchies and that these factors are foreign to the operational logic of the developmental state and thus render it obsolete. This article contends that the global economy is not as open as supposed, and that the challenges posed by the knowledge economy, while genuine, tend to be uneven. Focusing on Korea's information technology sector and relying on documentary and interview data, the present article suggests that, while the Korean state no longer relies on its erstwhile finance and regulation strategies, it has continued to articulate development visions and sought to achieve them through deploying public resources to structure the market. Rather than going into eclipse, the Korean developmental state has been reconfigured.","[Chu, Yin-wah] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Sociol, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chu, Yin-wah] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Hong Kong,"Chu, YW (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Sociol, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ywchu@hkbu.edu.hk,,"Chu, Yin Wah/0000-0002-4943-4964",,,,,79,31,36,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The universal concept of human rights is considered as a regulative principle for the possible critique of any state, including a democratic one. Moreover, the philosophical justification of the universal regulative principle for evaluating these states is vital for progressive political change and for the politics of human rights. At the heart of the analysis is Kant's concept of human rights as freedom. It is opposed to a more utilitarian interpretation of rights and political paternalism. Kant's philosophy helps us to better understand the meaning of the definition of human rights as inherent, sacred, and inalienable, as formulated by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. Kant makes these meanings explicit, and he elaborates on the moral-philosophical explanations of humanitarian rights. His philosophy of law was developed in a process of a systematic criticism of political paternalism (which is the flip side of dependence). Kant developed his definition of individual freedom in opposition to authoritarian paternalism, utilitarian arbitrariness, and the despotism of paternalistic benevolence. The categorical imperative is threefold: the imperatives of morality, right, and peace. Thus it could be interpreted as the categorical imperative of peace. The analysis shows the ongoing relevance of Kant's ideas and their recent development by the theorists of discourse ethics and of cosmopolitan democracy. It affirms that the solution to the problems of securing peace and protecting human rights can only be achieved by peaceful means, based on the international rule of law.","[Demenchonok, Edward] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy, Moscow 117901, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences","Demenchonok, E (通讯作者)，Ft Valley State Univ, Ft Valley, GA 31030 USA.",,,,,,,,20,17,19,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The purpose of this paper is to reflect some of the most important characteristics of the lifelong learning and adult training process in Europe and Romania, starting from the necessity of developing such a concept. Lifelong learning was the response or even the defense against a changing, frightening and unknown technological, economic, social and political environment; it became a concept as slippery and multifaceted as the environment in which it exists. The literature is very rich in this field; studies developed by different institutions (The Council of Europe, UNESCO, and OECD) or by specialists (Sutton, 1996; Maehl, 2000; Field 2000; Keogh, 2007) emphasize the importance of the concept and of the concept implementation's in sound policies designated to solve some of the technological, social and economic development consequences. The methodological approach followed in this paper is specific to descriptive studies, secondary data being the main source of the argumentation developed and of the conclusions drawn at the end. The analysis that sustains the present paper concludes to the necessity of integrating the concepts features in the policies established at the level of education, labor market and public administration. However, differences existed between countries and between regions, at the level of the EU and Romania require a decentralized approach, and a focusing on developing not only instruments of intervention but also on creating an evaluation framework meant to analyse the efficiency and effectiveness of the implemented programs.","[Diaconu, Mihaela] Univ Pitesti, Pitesti, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti,,diaconu_m2005@yahoo.com; milena_zaharia@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,8,"LUCIAN BLAGA UNIV SIBIU, ROMANIA",SIBIU,"FAC ECON SCI, STR CALEA DUMBRAVII NO 17, SIBIU, 00000, ROMANIA",,,978-973-739-775-1,,,,2009,,,,,,,64,69,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BTS70,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000287984000011,0

Previous research on ABC have examined pertinent issues related ABC implementation such as the levels of ABC adoption in various countries, the reasons for implementing ABC, the problems related to ABC and the critical success factors influencing ABC.

Based on the research gaps identified, a research framework is proposed for the current study. In this study, in addition to the behavioral, organizational and technical factors examined in prior research, the proposed framework adds additional independent variables, organizational structure and organizational culture, as the independent variables that could affect ABC success. In addition, to examine whether the relationship between the independent variables and ABC success is affected by the cultural values of managers in two different countries, Malaysia and China, a moderating variable, national culture, is included in the proposed framework.","[Fei, Zhang Yi; Isa, Che Ruhana] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,,,"ISA, C.R./B-8360-2010",,,,,,35,0,0,0,20,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"INST TENAGA, BANGI 43600, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-942-923-7,,,,2009,,,,,,,127,143,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BBC87,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000306479500005,0

The paper finds that CEO turnover is negatively related to both current and lagged firm performance as measured by ROA and RPE (Relative Performance Evaluation) for non-state-controlled firms, while insensitive to performance measures for state-controlled firms. In addition, CEO compensation is positively related to firm performance, but state ownership and control weaken this positive relation. Moreover, state control reduces the effectiveness of internal governance mechanisms such as the board of directors and supervisory committee. Overall, empirical results in the paper indicate that state ownership and control weaken managerial incentives and internal monitoring among publicly listed firms in China.","[Lin, Chen] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Su, Dongwei] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; Jinan University,"Lin, C (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chenlin@cityu.edu.hk; tdsu@jnu.edu.cn,"Su, Larry/AAH-8426-2021","Su, Dongwei/0000-0002-6306-1850",,,,,51,11,13,1,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

However, this paradigm is not without its challenges brought about by the need for autonomy of agents in the system. While some problems can be solved by making the interaction protocol either strictly competitive or strictly cooperative, some other models require the system to incorporate both interaction schemes for improved performance. In this paper, we study how the seemingly contradictory effects of these two behaviours can be exploited for distributed problem solving by considering a flexible job shop scheduling problem in a dynamic order environment. The system is modeled using federated agent architecture. We implement a simple auction mechanism at each processing center and a global reinforcement learning mechanism to minimize cost contents in the system. Results of simulations using the cooperative-competition approach and the strictly competitive model are presented. Simulation results show that there were improvements in cost objectives of the system when the various processing centers cooperated through the learning mechanism, which also provides for adaptation of the system to a stream of random orders.","[Opadiji, Jayeola Femi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Kaihara, Toshiya] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University; Kobe University,"Opadiji, JF (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",femi@kaede.cs.kobe-u.ac.jp; kaihara@cs.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Kaihara, Toshiya/M-5611-2016; Opadiji, Jayeola/GLT-8482-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-4-431-87435-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,119,130,,,,,,12,Economics; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Sociology,BLU06,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000271014200010,0

Their features and patenting activities are examined in relation to the size of their organizations. Compared to those from medium and large companies, the inventors working in small firms are less productive in terms of patent applications. However, according to different indicators, it emerges that there is no difference in the average quality of patented inventions of the two groups. Nevertheless, one-third of small applicants evaluates negatively its patenting experience, while this is true for only a tiny fraction of larger patentees.

Beside that, we also analyze two different kinds of relationships to prove that relationships, which stimulate further development of companies, create value more indirectly than relationships, which just support economical stability of companies.","[Skapa, Radoslav; Kubatova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,,skapa@econ.muni.cz; kubatova@econ.muni.cz,"Škapa, Radoslav/H-4410-2013; Švandová, Eva/AAE-2416-2020; Svandova, Eva/C-7492-2015","Škapa, Radoslav/0000-0003-4361-7070;",,,,,4,0,0,0,2,GAUDEAMUS,HRADEC KRALOVE,"UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE, ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7041-227-5,,,,2009,,,,,,,313,319,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BCL96,,,,,2024-03-08,WOS:000310659200046,0

The results of the study discover positive relationship between stock performance and sufficiency of equity capital.

We argue that the conventional finding is driven by the endogenous nature of campaign spending: initiative proponents spend more to support their ballot measure when, without that spending, their ballot measure is more likely to fail. We address this endogeneity by using an instrumental variables approach to analyze a comprehensive data set of ballot propositions in California from 1976 to 2004. We find that both support and opposition spending on citizen initiatives have strong, statistically significant, and countervailing effects. We confirm this finding by looking at time series data from early polling on a subset of these measures. Both analyses show that spending in favor of citizen initiatives substantially increases their chances of passage, just as opposition spending decreases this likelihood.","[de Figueiredo, John M.] Duke Univ, Sch Law, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [de Figueiredo, John M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ji, Chang Ho] La Sierra Univ, Riverside, CA 92515 USA; [Kousser, Thad] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"de Figueiredo, JM (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sch Law, 210 Sci Dr,Box 90360, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",jdefig@duke.edu,,"Kousser, Thad/0000-0002-5489-5837",,,,,69,19,22,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The predominance of the public sector in the supply of water was not always the case, however; private firms dominated US water supply throughout most of the 19th century. This article analyzes the puzzle of why water and sanitation systems were the only major utilities to become predominantly public by, first, reexamining historical accounts of the problems of contracting for water services in light of modern theories of economic organization and, then, evaluating hypotheses derived from those accounts using data on 373 waterworks serving US municipalities with populations over 10,000 in 1890. Among other results, municipal ownership is found to be related to the distribution of population and commerce within a city in ways that suggest that frictions between cities and private companies over system extensions and improvements played a significant role in the shift to municipal ownership.","Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Masten, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",semasten@umich.edu,"Masten, Scott E/A-2167-2008",,,,,,85,29,36,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

A modern counterpart to the 19(th)-century focus on land can be found in the 20(th)-century concern with the establishment of intellectual property rights that fence off a portion of the creative commons in order to construct temporary monopolies. Captured in the open source movement where licenses that specify property rights are adopted in order to provide a great deal of flexibility in terms of how ideas are used and shared, a strong connection can be drawn between this modern movement and the work of Henry George. Building a connection between the two provides greater clarity in terms of understanding how in a modern technology-based economy, progress can be achieved without poverty.","Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Niman, NB (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, 15 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",neil.niman@unh.edu,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We show that partial delegation enables the informed party to earn information rents without creating quantity distortions. First-best quantities are traded in equilibrium.

J,"Gorecki, PK",,,,"Gorecki, Paul K.",,,TOO MANY UNNECESSARY MERGER NOTIFICATIONS IN IRELAND?,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The market for corporate control plays an important role in ensuring that assets are deployed in an efficient and effective manner. However, on occasion, mergers might lead to a reduction in competition and a consequent rise in prices and/or other anticompetitive effects. Ireland's Competition Act 2002 provides that all mergers that meet certain financial thresholds must be notified to Ireland's Competition Authority so that they are subject to a competitive effects assessment. However, there are concerns that the notification thresholds result in many mergers with little or no nexus to Ireland being notified. While it is the case that the vast majority of merger notifications do not raise competition concerns, Ireland is not out of line with other jurisdictions that have mandatory notification thresholds such as the European Union and the United States. Nevertheless, that should not lead to complacency. This article quantifies the impact of reforms made in 2006 and 2007 by the Competition Authority and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Ireland's merger notification thresholds. The evidence suggests that these tighter, better specified thresholds led to a reduction of at least 40 to 50 percent in the number of merger notifications. However, more could be done, albeit probably to a lesser extent than the earlier reforms. Applying the International Competition Network's Recommended Practices for Merger Notification Procedures, a series of proposals are made in this article for revising the merger notification thresholds to better select mergers with a nexus to Ireland. Such moves should facilitate a more effective and efficient market for merger control by reducing transaction costs involved in the merger process as well as allowing Competition Authority resources to be deployed elsewhere, a not inconsiderable advantage in a period of austerity.","[Gorecki, Paul K.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Gorecki, Paul K.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",paul.gorecki@esri.ie,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In particular, they face challenges of informed consent that require them to make decisions that support their well-being. Building on current knowledge of factors that diminish decision-making capacity with age, this study examines conditions under which aging consumers acquiesce to informed consent, when not fully informed. The conceptual framework and research propositions regarding the key factors influencing consumer vulnerability during the informed consent process are (1) cognitive changes, (2) sensory factors, (3) financial changes and (4) sender and receiver interaction.

Data from the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) survey are used to study four main research questions: (1) How has teen mode choice changed from 1986 to 2006? (2) How do these choices vary as teens transition from the 13-15 age group to being of driving age (16-19)? (3) How do these choices vary across the different urban and suburban regions of the GTA? (4) What are some of the differences between teen travel and adult travel? Results show that in general, active transportation has decreased, while auto-passenger mode shares have increased across the region. The younger group walks more and the older group takes transit more for both school and discretionary travel. Jurisdictions with better transit supply and orientation have higher transit mode shares for school trips, but discretionary trips have very low transit mode shares. Walk mode shares for both school and discretionary travel are similar across all jurisdictions, regardless of whether they are urban or suburban. In contrast to adult travel in the GTA, built form characteristics and transit supply do not appear to have a direct relationship with teen mode choice. Urban form appears to exert an indirect influence on teen travel. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Under these circumstances, the importance of distance should have diminished over time, which would constitute a boon for countries that are far from the main centers of economic activity. However, one of the best-established empirical results in international economics is that bilateral trade decreases with distance. This apparent contradiction has been labeled the missing globalization puzzle. We propose yet another explanation for this apparent contradiction that is based on the concept of geographic neutrality, which we use to construct indicators of international trade integration for two different scenarios: when distance matters and when it does not. Our results indicate that the importance of distance varies greatly across countries, as revealed by disparate gaps between distance-corrected and distance-uncorrected trade-integration indicators for different countries. Some factors that are rooted in the literature explain away the discrepancies, but their importance varies according to the trade-integration indicator that is considered-trade openness or trade connection.","[Arribas, Ivan; Perez, Francisco] Fac Econ, Dept Fonaments Anal Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ & Ivie, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Arribas, I (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Dept Fonaments Anal Econ, Campus Dels Tarongers,Av Dels Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",ivan.arribas@uv.es; francisco.perez-garcia@uv.es; tortosa@uji.es,"Arribas, Ivan/F-4245-2016; Perez Garcia, Francisco/F-1090-2017; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/B-1205-2017","Arribas, Ivan/0000-0001-7600-8066; Perez Garcia, Francisco/0000-0003-4724-3598; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/0000-0002-7873-1714",,,,,79,14,17,1,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The empirical analysis is based on the Korean Innovation Survey 2005 and uses probit regression models and matching estimators. It found that government funding generally has a positive effect on innovation output at the firm level. When it comes to the level of innovativeness, however, it is revealed that government financial support has a positive, but statistically insignificant, effect on achieving high innovativeness. This finding is especially noteworthy considering how hard the government has tried to level up the novelty of its national innovation system, promoting enterprises to being developers and not just adopters in the innovation process.

J,"Dale, G",,,,"Dale, Gareth",,,Lineages of Embeddedness: On the Antecedents and Successors of a Polanyian Concept,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET,"P>Since the 1980s, much debate has revolved around Karl Polanyi's concept of the dis/embedded economy, generating some light and not a little heat. This paper looks at three reasons that account for part of the heat. It begins by tracing the sources upon which Polanyi drew. They include Karl Marx, Ferdinand Tonnies, and Max Weber, along with anthropology of the inter-war period, and German and American Institutionalist economics. After exploring the differing ways in which these varying currents conceptualize the relationship between economy and society, I explore the different interpretations of what Polanyi means by embeddedness, and the different purposes to which contemporary economic sociologists have put the term. For some, he is held up as the originator of a line of sociological analysis that treats the economy as a subsystem embedded in a social system. In this reading the emphasis is upon the moral underpinnings of market behavior, in contrast to the naturalism of Ricardo, Malthus and their heirs. For others, his disembedding thesis contains a more radical tale: of the market economy coming to dominate society, bringing forth a sorcerer's apprentice world of untrammeled market forces that, although human creations, lie beyond conscious human control.","Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Dale, G (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",gareth.dale@brunel.ac.uk,"Dale, Gareth/AAV-7142-2020","Dale, Gareth/0000-0003-4991-6063",,,,,71,34,41,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Method 1 ignores the sampling variability of the threshold parameter estimator. Method 2 corrects the finite sample biases of the autoregressive coefficient estimators before constructing BPIs. Method 3 takes into account the sampling variability of both the autoregressive coefficient estimators and the threshold parameter estimator. Method 4 resamples the residuals in each regime separately. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that (1) accounting for the sampling variability of the threshold parameter estimator is necessary, despite its super-consistency; (2) correcting the small-sample biases of the autoregressive parameter estimators improves the small-sample properties of bootstrap prediction intervals under certain circumstances; and (3) the two-sample bootstrap can improve the long-term forecasts when the error terms are regime-dependent.

To accomplish this, a conceptual model was proposed and contrasted in which the unit of analysis adopted was the dyadic relationship maintained between manufacturing companies and their principal distributors. Results provided empirical evidence indicating that the manufacturer's organizational learning is a relevant antecedent to the results achieved in relational interchanges. Thus, a greater degree of OL in the manufacturing company directly affects the main distributor's satisfaction and also acts indirectly on its degree of loyalty. It also proves that organizational learning directly empowers the manufacturer's entrepreneurial results.","[Lopez Sanchez, Jose Angel] Univ Extremadura, Dept Direcc Empresas & Sociol, Badajoz, Spain; [Santos Vijande, Maria Leticia; Trespalacios Gutierrez, Juan Antonio] Univ Oviedo, Dept Adm Expresas, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Oviedo, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; University of Oviedo,"Sánchez, JAL (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Direcc Empresas & Sociol, Badajoz, Spain.",jangel@unex.es; lsantos@uniovi.es; jtrespa@uniovi.es,"Santos-Vijande, Maria Leticia/Q-6109-2017; López-Sánchez, José Ángel/G-4875-2015","Santos-Vijande, Maria Leticia/0000-0001-8021-5201; López-Sánchez, José Ángel/0000-0003-1889-0307",,,,,28,0,0,0,6,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

The vintage differences and forecasts induce parameter breaks close to the end of the sample, too close for standard maximum likelihood techniques to produce precise parameter estimates. A supplementary procedure estimates the statistical properties of the end-of-sample observations that behave differently from the rest, allowing inferred probabilities to reflect the breaks. Empirical results using real-time data show that these techniques improve the ability of a Markov switching model based on GDP and GDI to recognize the stall of the 2001 recession.

In this paper, I explain these differences by differential household behavioral responses to programs. I find evidence that the mortality effect varies by observable determinants of household allocation to children. Additionally, I find that households improve malaria prevention for children that receive vitamin A supplements and that this effect varies by the same household allocation determinants.","Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Yarnoff, B (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",byarno2@uic.edu,,"Yarnoff, Benjamin/0000-0002-5147-1588",,,,,27,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

While protecting the generality of defendants in the criminal process, we show that under certain reasonable assumptions this procedural mechanism may hurt innocent defendants by inducing prosecutors to adjust their behavior to their detriment. The main rationale for our thesis is that, if forced to reveal exculpatory information, the prosecutor might not look for that information in the first place, and in turn this could harm the innocent under certain reasonable conditions. We extensively discuss our results in the context of the economic literature on criminal procedure.

In this article, we consider the extent to which these propositions are affected by the presence of asymmetric transaction costs, and we offer a reformulation of the Coase theorem which takes into account asymmetrical transaction costs. Our analysis combines several insights from the existing literature on property-type vesus liability-type remedies, identifying the conditions for the superiority of each type of remedy. Further, we consider the possible use of mixed remedies and identify the optimal scope of such solution.","[Parisi, Francesco] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Luppi, Barbara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Modena, Italy; [Luppi, Barbara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Reggio Emilia, Italy; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Bologna,"Parisi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",barbara.luppi@unimore.it; parisi@umn.edu,"Parisi, Francesco/CAJ-0100-2022; Luppi, Barbara/J-3175-2016","Parisi, Francesco/0000-0003-2807-2279; Luppi, Barbara/0000-0002-1969-9099",,,,,23,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.
