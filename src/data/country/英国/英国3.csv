However, if there is uncertainty on a potential violator's guilt, judges' and juries' willingness to impose punishment may decrease in its magnitude. Thus, increasing the magnitude of punishment may backfire, when the reduced punishment probability is anticipated by potential violators. Based on a theoretical model, our paper is the first to analyze the interdependency of violation and punishment behavior in a laboratory experiment, and to contrast it to the standard partial equilibrium perspective on deterrence that considers the punishment probability to be independent of the fine size. Varying both the magnitude of fines and the degree of uncertainty shows that, in case of legal uncertainty, the deterrent effect of higher fines is far less pronounced than if the punishment probability was exogenous.

Within a general stochastic learning-by-doing model, there is a potential inefficiency in the market provision of firm-specific training. In order to determine whether this inefficiency is in fact present, we analyze two special cases of the model: the accelerated productivity-enhancement model and the accelerated learning model. In both models, the inefficiency is indeed present. However, the nature of the inefficiency depends on the balance between the two key components of training, namely productivity enhancement and employee evaluation. In the accelerated productivity-enhancement model, training results in an increase in productivity enhancement but no change in employee evaluation, and training is overprovided by the market. In the accelerated learning model, training results in a proportionate increase in both productivity enhancement and employee evaluation, and training is underprovided by the market. In both cases, turnover is inefficiently low. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Four databases were investigated using a strategy refined through a highly sensitive filter for systematic reviews. References were screened and a search for grey literature was performed. Identified citations were scrutinized against pre-defined eligibility criteria and data were extracted using a customized extraction template. Evidence on known group validity, convergent validity and responsiveness was extracted and reviewed by narrative synthesis. Quality of the included reviews was assessed using a modified version of the AMSTAR checklist. Thirty reviews were included, sixteen of which were of excellent or good quality. The body of evidence, covering more than 180 studies, was heavily skewed towards EQ-5D, with significantly fewer studies investigating HUI3 and SF-6D, and very few the 15D and AQoL. There was also lack of head-to-head comparisons between GPBMs and the tests reported by the reviews were often weak. Where there was evidence, EQ-5D, SF-6D, HUI3, 15D and AQoL seemed generally valid and responsive instruments, although not for all conditions. Evidence was not consistently reported across reviews. Although generally valid, EQ-5D, SF-6D and HUI3 suffer from some problems and perform inconsistently in some populations. The lack of head-to-head comparisons and the poor reporting impedes the comparative assessment of the performance of GPBMs. This highlights the need for large comparative studies designed to test instruments' performance.","[Finch, Aureliano Paolo; Brazier, John Edward; Mukuria, Clara] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 1 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Finch, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 1 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",APFinch1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Finch, Aureliano/AAU-5885-2021; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,48,69,72,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, little evidence exists about the scale of the net benefits. By developing a new method for identifying the demand curve, this paper estimates the consumer surplus associated with heating, transport and lighting over more than two hundred years and identifies the gains from key energy transitions. For certain energy transitions, the increase was dramatic, reflecting the transformations in society and lifestyles that mobility and illumination provided in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Yet, the net benefits related to heating technologies only rose modestly. Finally, due to saturation effects of the demand for energy services, future technological developments and energy transitions may benefit consumers ( though not necessarily society as a whole) less than those in the past.","[Fouquet, Roger] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environment, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fouquet, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environment, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.fouquet@lse.ac.uk,,"Fouquet, Roger/0000-0003-4732-0821",ESRC; Grantham Foundation,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Grantham Foundation,"I would like to thank Elizabeth Baldwin, Eric Beinhocker, Alex Bowen, Rafael Calel, Mona Chitnis, Antoine Dechezlepretre, Simon Dietz, Dave Donaldson, Doyne Farmer, Eli Fenichel, Meredith Fowlie, Tim Foxon, Ken Gillingham, Michael Greenstone, Jim Hammitt, David Hendry, Cameron Hepburn, Jonathan Hersh, Daniel Heyen, Matt Kotchen, Ralf Martin, Kyle Meng, Tanya OGarra, Peter Pearson, Carlota Perez, Robert Pindyck, Neil Rickman, Lutz Sager, Gregor Semieniuk, Steve Sorrell, Richard Tol, Frederick van der Ploeg, Dirk Jan van de Ven, Catherine Wolfram and Dimitri Zenghelis for their comments and discussions.

Two instruments of favoritism are considered: head starts that are added to the bids of specific contestants and multiplicative biases that give idiosyncratic weights to the bids. In the all-pay auction, head starts are more effective than biases while optimally combining both instruments even yields first-best revenue. In the lottery contest, head starts are less effective than biases and combining both instruments cannot further increase revenue. As all-pay auctions revenue-dominate lottery contests under optimal biases, we thus obtain an unambiguous revenue-ranking of all six combinations of contest formats and instruments.

It aims to overcome the limitations of existing empirical literature by building a new urban population dataset that allows the construction of a set of Herfindahl-Hirschman-lndices which capture a country's urban structure in a more nuanced way than the indicators used hitherto. We find that, contrary to the general perception, urban concentration levels have on average decreased or remained stable (depending on indicator). However, these averages camouflage diverging trends across countries. The results of the econometric analysis suggest that there is no uniform relationship between urban concentration and economic growth. Urban concentration is beneficial for economic growth in high-income countries, while this effect does not hold for developing countries. The results differ from previous analyses that generally underscore the benefits of urban concentration at low levels of economic development. The results are robust to accounting for reverse causality through IV analysis, using exogenous geographic factors as instruments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We relax the last assumption by allowing for asymmetric unawareness and examine under which conditions speculative behaviour emerges. We find that if common knowledge is assumed (as in the settings of Aumann, 1976 and Milgrom and Stokey, 1982), unawareness cannot generate speculation. This is not true, however, in settings where no common knowledge is assumed, such as speculation in equilibrium (Geanakoplos, 1989) and betting that is always beneficial (Morris, 1994), unless stronger conditions on awareness are imposed.

National and global contributions are found to be equally important across the G7 although considerable differences exist between countries. Uncertainty, and especially cross-country uncertainty, is important in propagating the effects of shocks and generates around 20% of countries' persistent output movements on average.

The SupF type tests are motivated by alternatives where the parameters display a small number of breaks at deterministic points in the sample, while the Cramer-von-Mises alternative is one where the coefficients are random and slowly evolve through time. In order to allow for an unknown degree of persistence in the predictors, and for both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity in the data, we implement the tests using a fixed regressor wild bootstrap procedure. The asymptotic validity of the bootstrap tests is established by showing that the asymptotic distributions of the bootstrap parameter constancy statistics, conditional on the data, coincide with those of the asymptotic null distributions of the corresponding statistics computed on the original data, conditional on the predictors. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the bootstrap parameter stability tests work well in finite samples, with the tests based on the Cramer-von-Mises principle seemingly the most useful in practice. An empirical application to U.S. stock returns data demonstrates the practical usefulness of these methods. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

J,"Gibbons, A",,,,"Gibbons, Andrea",,,The Five Refusals of White Supremacy,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM; RACE; GEOGRAPHIES; PRIVILEGE,"This article draws on the work of Charles Mills to posit white supremacy as a global political, economic, and cultural system. Resistance among people of color is, and has always been, widespread. The focus here, however, is on what Mills (1997: 18) describes as the epistemology of ignorance among whites themselves, serving to preserve a sense of self as decent in the face of privileges dependent upon obvious injustices against (nonwhite) others. Five themes are identified within a broad and multidisciplinary range of literature, described here as the five refusals of white supremacy. These are points at which white ignorance must be actively maintained in order to preserve both a sense of the self and of the wider structures of white privilege and dominance. There is a refusal of the humanity of the otherand a willingness to allow violence and exploitation to be inflicted. There is a refusal to listen to or acknowledge the experience of the otherresulting in marginalization and active silencing. There is a refusal not just to confront long and violent histories of white domination, but to recognize how these continue to shape injustice into the present. There is a refusal to share space, particularly residential space, with resulting segregated geographies that perpetuate inequality and insulate white ignorance. Finally there is a refusal to face structural causescapitalism as it has intertwined with white supremacy from its earliest beginnings. To undo one requires the undoing of the others. For each refusal there is a potential affirmation, presented here in the hope that each might provide an understanding of the breadth of work required to dismantle white supremacy and of the multiple points for intervention.(a","[Gibbons, Andrea] Univ Salford, Sustainable Housing & Urban Studies Unit, Salford, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Gibbons, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salford, Sustainable Housing & Urban Studies Unit, Salford, Lancs, England.",a.r.gibbons1@salford.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,12,16,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This raises a more general question about the relationship between reasoning and spontaneous intentions, including in the individual case. I show that the tension need not arise in accounts that separate intentions from intentionality, as they can deny spontaneous intentions while retaining spontaneous intentionality in both the individual and the collective case. However, individual reasoning is a special case in the team reasoning model and spontaneous individual intentions are plausible, so it would be advantageous for team reasoning theorists to be able to account for spontaneous intentions in the collective case. In order to do this, we need to show how spontaneous intentions are compatible with reasoning. I consider how reasoning is understood in philosophy, economics, and cognitive science, and I show how spontaneous collective intentions can be reconciled on at least some accounts of what it is to do reasoning, which are compatible with the way reasoning is used in the team reasoning literature. I argue that we should think of team reasoning as a computational-level model, as used in cognitive science. I draw on research from philosophy of computation, and show how, on some theories, the view of reasoning as computation has sympathetic implications for theories of group agency, as it would allow that groups can be reasoners.","[Gold, Natalie] Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Gold, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Oxford, England.",natalie.gold@rocketmail.com,,"Gold, Natalie/0000-0003-0706-1618",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant [283849]; European Research Council (ERC) [283849] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),Work on this paper was supported by funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n. 283849.,,81,3,3,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The success of private schools in Britain in delivering high academic achievements and better-paid jobs has been attributed to these schools engendering high self-evaluations, greater aspirations and social networks. Using recently repaired data on secondary school type from the 1970 British Cohort Study, we find that internal locus of control, aspirations and access to networks, but not self-esteem, are raised by private schooling. Locus of control and aspirations (but not networks or self-esteem) each have modest effects on earnings at age 42. Yet only a small part of the private school earnings premium is accounted for by all these factors. Much of the premium is due, rather, to educational attainments. This evidence suggests that strategies to strengthen self-evaluations or aspirations in state schools will contribute little on their own to the objective of greater equality or social mobility.","[Green, Francis; Parsons, Samantha; Sullivan, Alice; Wiggins, Richard] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Green, F (通讯作者)，UCL, Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019","Green, Francis/0000-0002-6786-5012","ESRC [ES/K007238/1]; ESRC [ES/K007238/1, ES/M001660/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007238/1, ES/M001660/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),UCL Institute of Education.

The literature has predominately focused on the case in which bidders are ex-ante symmetric and privately informed, and finds that aggressive bidding such that payoffs are negative is common (the winner's curse). In practice, bidders often only have access to public information, and use this information to form (possibly differing) beliefs. In addition, a bidder who is not privately informed may face bidders who are. We examine bidding behavior of both informed and uninformed bidders, and vary the information structure they face. We find that uninformed bidders underbid dramatically and persistently, while informed bidders tend to overbid in the two bidder case. Our results highlight the importance of correctly modeling the information available to bidders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate this issue using a large (N = 7753) sample from the UK. In contrast to earlier studies, quantile regression is used to allow the relationship between arts attendance and other controls and happiness to vary across different levels of happiness. The relationship found in prior studies is confirmed, but the quantile regression results show that the nature of the relationship varies across the distribution of the happiness variable. A significant relationship is found at the lower quartile, and a moderate relationship (significant at the 10% level) is found at the median level.","[Hand, Chris] Kingston Univ, Kingston Business Sch, Kingston Hill, Surrey KT2 7LB, England",Kingston University,"Hand, C (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Kingston Business Sch, Kingston Hill, Surrey KT2 7LB, England.",c.hand@kingston.ac.uk,"Hand, Chris/A-3509-2008","Hand, Chris/0000-0002-4472-6618",,,,,55,25,25,4,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This paper analyses 162 INDCs (Intended National Determined Contributions), or climate action plans, to assess whether and how countries plan to use REDD + in their implementation the Paris Agreement. Our analysis suggests that REDD + continues to have political traction. Many tropical countries still have expectations of REDD +, and hope that public and private donors will support chronically underfunded domestic conservation programs. However, the expectations are not formulated in detail. We argue that until the questions of how to finance REDD + and how to deal with the drivers of deforestation are resolved, REDD is unlikely to move quickly from formulated INDCs plans to implementation on the ground.","[Hein, Jonas] CAU Kiel, Inst Geog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Hein, Jonas; Pauw, Pieter] German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Guarin, Alejandro] Int Inst Environm & Dev, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1X 8NH, England; [Fromme, Ezra] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Pauw, Pieter] Stockholm Environm Inst, Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Pauw, Pieter] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Kiel; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Stockholm Environment Institute; Utrecht University,"Hein, J (通讯作者)，CAU Kiel, Inst Geog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",hein@geographie.uni-kiel.de; alejandro.guarin@iied.org; Pieter.Pauw@die-gdi.de,,"Pauw, Pieter/0000-0002-9323-2577; Guarin, Alejandro/0000-0003-2692-4677",,,,,53,62,67,1,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90,,,,,,7,11,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.005,,,5,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430766300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper develops an example in which MLU induces an ambiguity averse maxmin expected utility (MEU) decision-maker to (1) prefer a bet on an ambiguous over a risky urn and (2) be more willing to bet on the ambiguous urn compared to an (ambiguity neutral) subjective expected utility (SEU) decision-maker. This is challenging, since prior to observing (symmetric) draws from the urns, the MEU decision-maker (in line with the usual notion of ambiguity aversion) actually preferred the risky over the ambiguous bet and was less willing to bet on the ambiguous urn than the SEU decision-maker. The identified switch in betting preferences is not due to a violation of dynamic consistency or consequentialism. Rather, it results from MLU's selection of extreme priors, causing a violation of the stability of set inclusion over the course of the updating process.","[Heyen, Daniel] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Heyen, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.",D.Heyen@lse.ac.uk,,"Heyen, Daniel/0000-0001-9606-1817","German Research Foundation [GO 1604/2, HE 7551/1-1]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank the editors and two anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions.

We account for the endogeneity of schooling using quantile instrumental variable estimation as developed in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Kowalski (). We use pooled data from four cross-sectional Household Income Expenditure Surveys. The results show that an extra year of schooling on the part of the most educated adult member in the household can increase welfare (proxied by real per capita consumption expenditure) by 3.8 percent on average. However, the effect varies considerably across the welfare distribution: At the lower end, around the 20th and 25th quantiles, an extra year of education increases welfare by 6 and 5 percent, respectively, while at the median it is around 3.5 percent. At the higher, 90th quantile it is much less, at 1 percent. Thus the marginal effect of schooling on welfare is significant and positive at all levels of the welfare distribution, but highest at the lower and middle quartiles. This result is different from findings in the literature that tend to show larger effects at higher quantiles, when endogeneity is uncorrected.","[Himaz, Rozana] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Headington Rd, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Himaz, Rozana] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Econ Dept Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Aturupana, Harsha] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Oxford Brookes University; University of Oxford; The World Bank,"Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Headington Rd, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.;Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSAE, Econ Dept Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rhimaz@brookes.ac.uk,,"Himaz, Rozana/0000-0003-0895-8144",,,,,35,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In our experiment, the players endogenously negotiate contracts. In line with contract theory, the contractibility of the outcome plays a crucial role when effort is a hidden action. If the outcome is contractible, most players overcome the hidden action problem by agreeing on incentive-compatible contracts. Communication is helpful, since it may reduce strategic uncertainty. If the outcome is non-contractible, in most cases low effort is chosen whenever effort is a hidden action. However, communication leads the players to agree on larger wages and substantially mitigates the underprovision of effort. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

After 1914, citations to recent research from abroad decreased and paper titles became less similar (evaluated by latent semantic analysis), suggesting a reduction in international knowledge flows. Reduced international scientific cooperation led to a decline in the production of basic science and its application in new technology Specifically, we compare productivity changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad, to changes for scientists who relied on frontier research from home. After 1914, scientists who relied on frontier research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals, produced less Nobel Prize nominated research, introduced fewer novel scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the text of subsequent patent grants. The productivity of scientists who relied on top 1% research declined twice as much as the productivity of scientists who relied on top 3% research. Furthermore, highly prolific scientists experienced the starkest absolute productivity declines. This suggests that access to the very best research is key for scientific and technological progress.","[Iaria, Alessandro] Univ Brighton, Brighton, E Sussex, England; Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Brighton; University of Warwick; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Iaria, A (通讯作者)，Univ Brighton, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,,Sloan Research Project on the Economics of Knowledge Contribution and Distribution; ERC [335573]; European Research Council (ERC) [335573] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Sloan Research Project on the Economics of Knowledge Contribution and Distribution; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),Waldinger gratefully acknowledges start-up funding from the Sloan Research Project on the Economics of Knowledge Contribution and Distribution and funding from ERC Starting Grant no. 335573.,,79,50,62,5,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Responses of the term structure factors to oil market shocks are shown to differ contingent on the underlying sources that drive oil price shocks and the country's dependence on oil. Oil market-specific demand shocks result in increases in the level factor in oil-importing countries, but have no such effect in oil-exporting countries. Oil supply disruptions have short-lived negative responses of the slope factors in the US and Canada, associated with loosening monetary policy, whilst demand side shocks tend to lead to increases the slope in all countries. Overall, oil supply and demand shocks jointly account for a considerable amount of the observed variation in the term structure of interest rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, monetary policy can directly affect the liquidity and balance sheet strength of firms through existing loans. We show that firms-especially financially constrained firms-with more unhedged loans display a stronger sensitivity of their stock price, cash holdings, inventory, and fixed capital investment to monetary policy. This effect disappears when policy rates are at the zero lower bound, revealing a new limitation of unconventional monetary policy. The floating-rate channel is at least as important as the bank lending channel operating through new loans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To address the challenges experienced by this community, the EU adopted a specific EU Roma policy - the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies' (2011) - which, together with EU funds, supports Member States with integration of the Roma at the national level. This article argues that the economic framing of the EU Roma policy is underpinned by an economic investment myth: namely, that the EU can only address rights violations as a means to achieving the EU's economic ends. It is shown that this myth undermines the EU's legal and constitutional human rights commitments post-Lisbon, according to which the EU has now the legal capability - but lacks the political will - to tackle rights violations such as discrimination in a manner that is not linked to the functioning of the common market.","[Iusmen, Ingi] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Iusmen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Sch Social Sci, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",i.iusmen@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,3,4,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using daily S&P 500 index returns, model confidence set estimations provide strong evidence that the most important model feature is the non-affinity of the variance process. Despite testing alternative specifications during the turbulent market regime of the global financial crisis of 2008, we find no evidence that either finite- or infinite-activity jump models or other previously proposed model extensions improve the out-of-sample performance further. Applications to Value-at-Risk demonstrate the economic significance of our results. Furthermore, the out-of-sample results suggest that standard jump diffusion models are misspecified.

This comes to add to social and economic pressures applied to these countries under their process of market liberalization and economic integration, instigated at least in part by the very ENP process. In those conditions, questions of spatial cohesion and thus of regional convergence and divergence become increasingly salient, as the elimination of (social and) spatial imbalances is both a precondition for the legitimacy and successful implementation of the reforms aiming at market liberalization and economic integration and a core objective of such reforms. In this paper, we examine the spatial dynamics of population growth in the ENP countries prior to the recent destabilization in the region, using two complementary approaches-an analysis of the impact of agglomeration on growth and an analysis of club formation in population concentrations (convergence-divergence). We find that, on the whole, the ENPCs South space was characterized in recent years by evidence of regional convergence in the sense that population concentrations were becoming more diffused across regions; while the ENPCs East exhibited stronger and more consistent evidence of regional divergence (increased concentration of population). These findings suggest that agglomeration and cumulative causation forces are more strongly in operation in the more advanced, at least in terms of EU relations, countries of the ENP East, where also the pull factor of the EU economy is stronger.","[Kallioras, Dimitris; Petrakos, George] Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, PO 38 334 Volos, Volos, Greece; [Monastiriotis, Vassilis] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Cowdray House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Thessaly; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Monastiriotis, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Cowdray House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",dkallior@uth.gr; V.Monastiriotis@lse.ac.uk; petrakos@uth.gr,"Kallioras, Dimitris/C-5315-2014; , Vassilis/AAI-9243-2021","Kallioras, Dimitris/0000-0003-3060-3745; , Vassilis/0000-0003-3709-3119; Petrakos, George/0000-0001-6542-6799",Project Sharing KnowledgEAssets: InteRregionallyCohesive NeigHborhoods (SEARCH) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme European Commission [FP7-SSH-2010.2.2-1 (266834)],Project Sharing KnowledgEAssets: InteRregionallyCohesive NeigHborhoods (SEARCH) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme European Commission,The research was supported by the Project Sharing KnowledgEAssets: InteRregionallyCohesive NeigHborhoods (SEARCH) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme FP7-SSH-2010.2.2-1 (266834) European Commission.

Different network meta-analysis models have been used to analyse these different data types. Objective This aim of this article was to establish the impact of using the different models on effectiveness, costs and health utility estimates. Methods We analysed a dataset used in a recent network meta-analysis of severe hypoglycaemic events conducted to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations regarding basal insulin choice for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. We fitted a model with a binomial likelihood reporting odds ratios (using a logit link) or hazard ratios (complementary log-log link), a model with a Poisson likelihood reporting hazard ratios and a shared-parameter model combining different types of data. We compared the results in terms of relative effects and resulting cost and disutility estimates. Results Relative treatment effects are similar regardless of which model or scale is used. Differences were seen in the probability of having an event on the baseline treatment with the logit model giving a baseline probability of 0.07, the complementary log-log 0.17 and the Poisson 0.29. These translate into differences of up to A 110 pound in the yearly cost of a hypoglycaemic event and 0.004 in disutility. Conclusion While choice of network meta-analysis model does not have a meaningful impact on relative effects for this outcome, care should be taken to ensure that the baseline probabilities used in an economic model are accurate to avoid misrepresenting costs and effects.","[Keeney, Edna; Dias, Sofia] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Dawoud, Dalia] Royal Coll Physicians, Natl Guideline Ctr, London, England; [Dawoud, Dalia] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt",University of Bristol; Royal College of Physicians; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Keeney, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",edna.keeney@bristol.ac.uk,"Dawoud, Dalia M/N-9741-2019; Dias, Sofia/F-1922-2010","Dawoud, Dalia M/0000-0002-2105-1937; Dias, Sofia/0000-0002-2172-0221",National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; MRC [MR/M005232/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/M005232/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was undertaken in part by Dalia Dawoud working at the National Guideline Centre, which received funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The analysis uses a unique panel data set constructed for the purpose of this paper. It contains district inequality measures based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, data on disaster affected population and other economic and social indicators. Employing a panel fixed effects estimator, we find that contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as measured by the Theil index. Findings are robust across various inequality metrics, sub-samples and alternative estimators such as Ordinary Least Squares and System GMM. However, natural disasters do not affect household expenditure inequality. Either households behave as if they have a permanent income or all households reduce their expenditure proportionately irrespective of their income level in responding to natural disasters. Natural disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income inequality but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality. Income of richer households is mainly derived from nonagricultural sources such as manufacturing and business activities and non-seasonal agricultural activities. Poorer households have a higher share of agricultural income. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Keerthiratne, Subhani; Tol, Richard S.

Unfortunately, infrastructure, battery degradation and consumer awareness are only some of the challenges to a faster development of this technology. This paper offers a qualitative comparative analysis that draws on a subsample of 227 semi-structured interviews on electric vehicles with both transportation and electricity experts from 201 institutions and 17 cities within the Nordic region to discuss the reasoning and arguments behind V2G incentives and policy mechanisms. A frequency analysis of the most coded V2G responses favours an update of the electricity market regulation - in particular in relation to electricity taxation and aggregator markets - and support for pilot projects. However, the analysis overall implies that V2G, in contrast to EVs, is a technology for the market and by the market. One that will develop on its own over time. More in-depth, our analysis shows the debates around V2G and how its perspective differs per country, pending available frequency capacity and flexible production (hydro power). The paper calls for a further development of flexible electricity markets, support for pilot projects, and attention to information and planning.","[Kester, Johannes; Noel, Lance; de Rubens, Gerardo Zarazua; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Aarhus University; University of Sussex,"Kester, J (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",j.kester@btech.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Kester, Johannes/0000-0001-5384-0247; Zarazua de Rubens, Gerardo/0000-0002-6698-2516",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are appreciative to Xiao Lin for her help in gathering parts of the data, and for the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 Center on Innovation and Energy Demand and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant 4182-00033B Societal Implications of a Vehicle-to-Grid Transition in Northern Europe, which have supported elements of the work reported here.

We elicited willingness to pay for public risk reducing initiatives under three different but outcome equivalent presentation format. Results from a discrete choice experiment demonstrate that presentation format influences the valuation of mortality risk reductions, which to varying degrees depends on the respondent's level of concern and numeracy. Marginal willingness to pay for a risk reduction increases significantly when framed in terms of avoided fatalities compared to corresponding frequencies. Furthermore, we find that less numerate respondents are more influenced by the inclusion of the number of fatalities in the presentation format The same pattern is observed for respondents who express a higher degree of concern for a traffic accident.

The data indicate that the proportion of females among workers, managers, directors and board members is higher in foreign affiliates than in domestic firms of comparable size operating in the same industry. Foreign affiliates are also more likely to offer flexible working arrangements, telecommuting and childcare subsidies as well as employ foreign workers. These effects are visible almost exclusively in older affiliates. The analysis of foreign acquisitions combining propensity score matching with a difference in differences suggests that increase in the female labour share takes place a few years after the ownership change. All these patterns are in line with the view that it takes time to transplant corporate culture to an overseas affiliate.","[Kodama, Naomi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kodama, Naomi] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan; [Javorcik, Beata S.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Javorcik, Beata S.] CEPR, London, England; [Abe, Yukiko] Hokkaido Univ, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Hokkaido University,"Kodama, N (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.;Kodama, N (通讯作者)，RIETI, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Kodama, Naomi/HNB-9949-2023","Javorcik, Beata/0000-0001-6089-6679","Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI grant [JP26590045, JP15H03358]; Joint Usage and Research Center; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03623, 15H03358] Funding Source: KAKEN","Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Joint Usage and Research Center; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors are grateful to Richard Kneller, two anonymous referees and seminar participants at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry (RIETI), the University of Technology Sydney and the Australian National University (Crawford School) as well as participants of the International Association for Applied Econometrics (IAAE) conference in Milan (June 2016) for their comments and suggestions.

This study revisits this discrepancy while focusing on information-search in decisions from experience. We report findings from a lab-experiment with three treatments: a standard version of decisions from description and two versions of decisions from experience: with and without a 'history table' recording previously sampled events. We find that people sample more from lotteries with rarer events. The history table proved influential; in its absence search is more responsive to cues such as a lottery's variance while in its presence the cue that stands out is the table's maximum capacity. Our analysis of risky choices captures a significant DE gap which is mitigated by the presence of the history table. We elicit probability weighting functions at the individual level and report that subjects overweight rare events in experience but less so than in description. Finally, we report a measure that allows us to compare the type of DE gap found in studies using choice patterns with that inferred through valuation and find that the phenomenon is similar but not identical across the two methods.","[Kopsacheilis, Orestis] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Kopsacheilis, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",orestiskopsacheilis@gmail.com,,"Kopsacheilis, Orestis/0000-0001-8794-6672",ESRC [ES/K002201/1],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),I am grateful to Robin Cubitt and Chris Starmer for their guidance throughout the research process as well as to Valeria Burdea for helpful advice and support during data collection.

The same applies to UK nationals residing in other Member States who will lose their EU citizenship status. Unexpectedly, 3.9 million EU citizens have been transformed into guests' or foreigners' in communities they call their own'. Although naturalization in the state of residence might be seen to furnish a secure and fully recognized status for EU citizens, I argue that it is not an adequate policy option.

The results indicate that the incidence of energy taxes is partly shifted on to the rural sector through rural-urban migration. The results thus highlight the importance of modeling the features particular to developing countries and the economic general equilibrium effects when assessing the impact of environmental taxation in those countries.,"[Kuralbayeva, Karlygash] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Kuralbayeva, Karlygash] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kuralbayeva, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",k.z.kuralbayeva@lse.ac.uk,,,Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI); Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI); Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Financial support by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy",,46,4,5,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper explicitly tackles parameter space exploration and calibration of ABMs by combining machine-learning and intelligent iterative sampling. The proposed approach learns a fast surrogate meta-model using a limited number of ABM evaluations and approximates the nonlinear relationship between ABM inputs (initial conditions and parameters) and outputs. Performance is evaluated on the Brock and Hommes (1998) asset pricing model and the Islands endogenous growth model Fagiolo and Dosi (2003). Results demonstrate that machine learning surrogates obtained using the proposed iterative learning procedure provide a quite accurate proxy of the true model and dramatically reduce the computation time necessary for large scale parameter space exploration and calibration.

The optimal UI replacement rate is the conventional Baily-Chetty replacement rate, which solves the trade-off between insurance and job-search incentives, plus a correction term, which is positive when an increase in UI pushes the labor market tightness toward its efficient level. In matching models, most wage mechanisms do not ensure efficiency, so tightness is generally inefficient. The effect of UI on tightness depends on the model: increasing UI may raise tightness by alleviating the rat race for jobs or lower tightness by increasing wages through bargaining.","[Landais, Camille] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Michaillat, Pascal] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02906 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Brown University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Landais, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.landais@lse.ac.uk; pascal_michaillat@brown.edu; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Michaillat, Pascal/0000-0003-2381-7470","Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California Berkeley; British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K008641/1]; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Sandler Foundation; ESRC [ES/M010341/1, ES/K008641/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California Berkeley; British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Sandler Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This work was supported by the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California Berkeley; the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number ES/K008641/1), the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and the Sandler Foundation.",,40,47,49,1,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

This paper examines whether this policy is desirable. The optimal UI replacement rate is the Baily-Chetty replacement rate plus a correction term measuring the effect of UI on welfare through labor market tightness. Empirical evidence suggests that tightness is inefficiently low in slumps and inefficiently high in booms, and that an increase in UI raises tightness. Hence, the correction term is positive in slumps but negative in booms, and optimal UI is indeed countercyclical. Since there remains some uncertainty about the empirical evidence, the paper provides a thorough sensitivity analysis.","[Landais, Camille] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Michaillat, Pascal] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Brown University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Landais, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.landais@lse.ac.uk; pascal_michaillat@brown.edu; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Michaillat, Pascal/0000-0003-2381-7470","Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California-Berkeley; British Academy; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K008641/1]; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Sandler Foundation; ESRC [ES/M010341/1, ES/K008641/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California-Berkeley; British Academy; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Institute for New Economic Thinking; Sandler Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California-Berkeley, the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number ES/K008641/1), the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and the Sandler Foundation.",,52,29,32,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

In this paper we propose a new heuristic which we term the Bayesian Peer Influence (BPI) heuristic. The BPI accords with Bayesian updating for all (conditionally) independent information structures. More generally, the BPI can be used to analyze the effects of correlation neglect on communication in networks. We analyze the evolution of beliefs and show that the limit is a simple extension of the BPI and parameters of the network structure. We also show that consensus in society might change dynamically, and that beliefs might become polarised. These results contrast with those obtained in papers that have used the DeGroot heuristic.

As part of a broad strategy to achieve sustainable urban mobility, bike-sharing services could contribute to car usage decrease, especially for short-distance trips. However, most of the developing countries have limited quantified evidence regarding the factors affecting bike sharing choice and this hinders policy makers from effectively promoting bike-sharing usage. The case study city is Taiyuan, which operates one of the most in demand bike-sharing schemes in China. This research investigates the factors affecting mode choice behavior with a focus on bike sharing, and explores the effectiveness of different policy options aiming at increasing bike sharing ridership. Nested logit and mixed nested logit models are developed using both stated preference and revealed preference data. Policy effectiveness is studied by examining modal split changes. The results reveal the significant negative impact of air pollution on bike-sharing choice. Nevertheless, improving air quality is found to be less effective in promoting bike-sharing ridership than improving bike-sharing service itself (e.g. through access time saving, travel cost saving); although it is more effective in suppressing private car usage.","[Li, Weibo; Kamargianni, Maria] UCL, UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England",University of London; University College London,"Li, WB (通讯作者)，UCL, UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",weibo.li.10@ucl.ac.uk; m.kamargianni@ucl.ac.uk,"Kamargianni, Maria/AAK-2234-2021","Kamargianni, Maria/0000-0003-1320-1031; LI, WEIBO/0000-0001-6607-7084",Shanxi Transportation Research Institute,Shanxi Transportation Research Institute,"We sincerely appreciate the support from Shanxi Transportation Research Institute in their funding and advice provided during the data collection.

We exploit the variation in exposure to competition from China, following its accession to the WTO in 2001, across Mexican municipalities and estimate the effect of international competition on the individual decision to migrate. Controlling for individual and municipality features, we find that individuals living in municipalities more exposed to Chinese import competition are more likely to migrate to other municipalities within Mexico, while a negative effect is found on the decision to migrate to the US. In particular, we find that Chinese import competition reduces migrants' negative self-selection: the rising international competition lowers the likelihood of low-educated, low-income people to migrate to the US, by making them more financially constrained. We do not find any evidence that changes in demand for Mexican workers in the US drive our results.","[Majlesi, Kaveh] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Majlesi, Kaveh] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Narciso, Gaia] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Narciso, Gaia] CReAM, London, England",Lund University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Trinity College Dublin,"Narciso, G (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dept Econ, Arts Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland.",kaveh.majlesi@nek.lu.se; narcisog@tcd.ie,"Narciso, Gaia/AAB-2955-2022","Narciso, Gaia/0000-0003-3532-6337",,,,,29,12,13,3,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We adopt an innovative approach which is based on a class of model-free interest rate volatility (VXI) indices we derive from options traded on the CBOE. The empirical analysis indicates substantial interest rate volatility risk for medium-term instruments which declines to the levels of the equity market only as the tenor increases to 30 years. We show that this risk appears to be priced in the market and has a significant time-varying relationship with equity volatility risk. US Treasury market volatility is appealing from an investment diversification perspective since the VXI indices are negatively correlated with the levels of interest rates and of equity market implied volatility indices, respectively. Although VXI indices are affected by macroeconomic and monetary news, they are only partially spanned by information contained in the yield curve. Motivated by our results on the magnitude and the nature of interest rate volatility risk and by the phenomenal recent growth of the equity volatility derivative market, we propose the use of our VXI indices as benchmarks for monitoring, securitizing, managing and trading interest rate volatility risk. As a first step in this direction, we describe a framework of one-factor equilibrium models for pricing VXI futures and options on the basis of empirically favored mean-reverting jump-diffusions.

This paper examines the differing productivity growth paths of some 85 British cities since the beginning of the 1970s, and explores how far these paths reflect differences across cities in the pace and nature of structural change. We find that while northern cities led productivity growth over 1971-91 southern cities then led after 1991. However, at the same time, the rate of productivity growth slowed across almost all cities between these two periods. We find evidence of considerable structural convergence across cities and a general tendency for the degree of specialisation to fall. This then leads to a decomposition analysis which identifies the relative contribution of between-sector (structural change) and within-sector effects to city productivity growth. The analysis reveals that structural change - and especially the shift from manufacturing to services - has had a negative impact on productivity growth across all cities, but that within-sector productivity developments while positive and outweighing structural change effects, have also declined over the past 45 years, as well as varying across cities. These findings point to the need for further research on the causes of this slowdown in 'within-sector ` productivity growth and why those causes appear to differ from city to city. They also point to the need for a 'place-based' dimension to policies aimed at improving national productivity performance.","[Martin, Ron; Gardiner, Ben; Evenhuis, Emil] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Southampton; University of Cambridge,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Evenhuis, Emil/J-4659-2019; Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","Evenhuis, Emil/0000-0001-8473-245X; SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",ESRC [ES/N006135/1]; ESRC [ES/N006135/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research for this article was undertaken as part of a project funded by the ESRC (ES/N006135/1) into Structural Transformation, Adaptability and City Economic Evolutions, as part of its Structural Transformations Programme.

We show that a tariff determined by the current level of accumulated pollution can induce the time path of emissions optimal for the downstream (polluted) country. But if the upstream (polluting) country can lobby the downstream government to impose lower tariffs, distortions brought by corruption and foreign lobbying lead to a rise in the upstream country's social welfare, and to a decrease in social welfare in the downstream country. Thus, the usefulness of trade policy as a tool for encouraging cooperation and internalizing transboundary externalities depends critically on the degree of governments' susceptibility to foreign political influence.","[Mason, Charles F.; Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mason, Charles F.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England; [Umanskaya, Victoria I.] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",University of Wyoming; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Occidental College,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Mason, CF (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu,"Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173",,,,,44,6,6,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This is a relatively understudied element of the fuel switching literature in both developed and emerging economies. This research adds to this literature by examining the adoption time-path of network gas as a heating fuel. We merge a unique dataset on gas network roll-out over time, with other geo-coded data and employ an instrumental variables technique in order to simultaneously model supply and demand. Results indicate a non-linear relationship between the proportion of households using gas as their primary means of central heating and the length of time the network has been in place in each area. Proximity to the gas network, peat bogs, and areas which have banned the consumption of bituminous coal also affect gas connections. Variations in socioeconomic and dwelling characteristics at area level can also help explain connections to the gas network. A better understanding of this variation is crucial in designing targeted policies and can aid network expansion decisions. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The stated purpose of the Regulation was to prohibit the placement of illegally produced timber within EU markets and thereby promote more sustainable management of the world's forests. Drawing on sixty interviews and written records from nine member states across the EU, we identify variables to explain differences in the levels of political support, and formal and practical implementation of the Regulation. Through systematic assessment, we find that countries that are relatively wealthy, are significant importers of high risk wood, and that have active civil societies were most likely to support the Regulation and to implement its requirements in a timely manner. In contrast the poorest countries least engaged in high risk imports face the greatest challenges with compliance, suggesting an unequal distribution of costs relative to responsibilities.","[McDermott, Constance L.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, 5 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Sotirov, Metodi] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Forest & Environm Policy Grp, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Freiburg,"McDermott, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, 5 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",constance.mcdermott@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Sotirov, Metodi/T-8199-2019","Sotirov, Metodi/0000-0002-3548-707X; McDermott, Constance/0000-0002-5238-0936",European Union [FP7-282887],European Union(European Union (EU)),"We thank our collaborators Mareike Blum, Laura Dieguez, Eva Kehayova, Panagiotis Koulelis, Gaia Pasqualotto, Sophie Schwer, and Maike Stelter for their support throughout data collection and data analysis.

For completeness, when assessing the 'carbon footprint of their business activities, food retailers should also included the greenhouse gas emissions caused by their disposal of waste food, which will vary with the waste disposal option used. However, there is lack of quantitative guidance for food retailers on the net GHG emissions that are incurred in the disposal of specific food types by the various disposal options available. Here, we calculate the net GHG emissions of eight different waste disposal options for five core food types using life cycle assessment, accounting for both emissions incurred in transport and processing, and those mitigated by the creation of useful products. We also assess the extent to which the embodied emissions in waste foods at the retail checkout can be mitigated by each disposal option. In addition to food specific results, we calculate mass-weighted averages using data from a mid-sized retail chain. We find a strong correlation between net emissions and the energy density of foods, and the following mass weighted disposal hierarchy (from best to worst, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions): donation of edible food to food banks; anaerobic digestion; conversion to animal feed; incineration with energy recovery; aerobic composting; landfill with gas collection and utilisation; landfill with gas collection and flaring; landfill without gas collection. If waste food from retailers is unfit for human consumption, to minimise greenhouse gas emissions it should be disposed of by conversion to animal feed or anaerobic digestion. For all food types, landfill is the worst disposal option.","[Moult, J. A.; Hewitt, C.

Under asymmetric learning about workers' productivity, the market takes job assignments (or promotions) as a signal of quality and bids up the wages of a promoted worker, leading to inefficiently few promotions (Waldman, M. 1984. Job Assignments, Signalling, and Efficiency 15 RAND Journal of Economics 255-67). Breakup fees can mitigate such inefficiencies by shielding the firm from labor-market competition, but they reduce turnover efficiency when there are firm-specific matching gains. We show that it is optimal to use breakup fees if and only if the difference between the worker's expected productivity in the pre- and post-promotion jobs is small. Also, the relationship between the optimality of breakup fees and the importance of firm-specific human capital is more nuanced than what the extant literature may suggest.","[Mukherjee, Arijit] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Vasconcelos, Luis] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Michigan State University; University of Essex; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",arijit@msu.edu,"Mukherjee, Arijit/B-2165-2012","Vasconcelos, Luis/0000-0002-2952-5674",,,,,53,11,11,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Consequently, much effort has been focused on how to integrate these different resources in larger and mature electricity systems such as the use of capacity markets in addition to energy-only markets. This paper argues that the effectiveness of competition is limited by the size of an electricity system and there is a threshold size (and associated characteristics such as tropical locations, lack of access, and the prevalence of remote communities of consumers) below which competition will not produce the expected outcomes. This paper contributes to the policy discourse by discussing the reform of small electricity systems to integrate renewable energy via the means of three case studies: Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Australia's Northern Territory. The paper concludes that electricity reforms and renewables can be complementary in small systems when supported by appropriate instruments and incentives. We draw policy lessons for other small systems that are pursuing a triad of objectives including electricity reform, large-scale renewables development and improving energy access.","[Nepal, Rabindra] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Sen, Anupama] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England",Massey University; Durham University; University of Oxford,"Nepal, R (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Massey Business Sch, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",R.N.Nepal@Massey.AC.NZ,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206",,,,,46,13,13,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116,,,,,,19,29,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.013,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430758200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

These impediments, which may be unique to RDs or also apply to common diseases but are particularly pertinent in RDs, are diverse and interrelated. Objective: To develop for the first time a catalog of primary impediments to RD research and HTA, and to describe the cause and effect of individual challenges. Methods: Challenges were identified by an international 22-person expert working group and qualitative outreach to colleagues with relevant expertise. A broad range of stakeholder perspectives is represented. Draft results were presented at annual European and North American International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) congresses, and written comments were received by the 385-strong ISPOR Rare Disease Review Group from two rounds of review. Findings were refined and confirmed via targeted literature search. Results: Research-related challenges linked to the low prevalence of RDs were categorized into those pertaining to disease recognition and diagnosis, evaluation of treatment effect, and patient recruitment for clinical research. HTA-related challenges were classified into issues relating to the lack of a tailored HTA method for RD treatments and uncertainty for HTA agencies and health care payers. Conclusions: Identifying and highlighting diverse, but interrelated, key challenges in RD research and HTA is an essential first step toward developing implementable and sustainable solutions. A collaborative multistakeholder effort is required to enable faster and less costly development of safe, efficacious, and appropriate new RD therapies that offer value for money.","[Nestler-Parr, Sandra] Rare Access Ltd, Royal Leamington Spa, England; [Korchagina, Daria] Univ Paris Sud, Mental Hlth & Publ Hlth Unit, INSERM, U669, Paris, France; [Toumi, Mondher] Aix Marseille Univ, Publ Hlth & Chron Dis Lab, Marseille, France; [Pashos, Chris L.] Takeda Pharmaceut Int Inc, Global Outcomes & Epidemiol Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Blanchette, Christopher] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, Charlotte, NC USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] ISPOR, Sci & Hlth Policy Initiat, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Morel, Thomas; Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Kalo, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, ELTE, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Kalo, Zoltan] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Gatermann, Ruediger] CSL Behring, Biotherapies Life, Healthcare Policy & External Affairs Europe, Marburg, Germany; [Redekop, William] Erasmus Univ, Hlth Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; KU Leuven; Eotvos Lorand University; CSL; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC","Korchagina, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud, 97 Blvd Port Royal, F-75679 Paris, France.",dko@creativ-ceutical.com,"Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020; Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011","Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005; Morel, Thomas/0000-0002-0690-5359",,,,,112,67,69,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21,5,,,,,493,500,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.004,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753344,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432175400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is heightened by the fact that the production of goods and services is becoming increasingly global with countries relying on each other through trade. As such, it is important to have a mechanism in place to understand the environmental burden shifts from one country to another. To this end, this paper exploits a paradox in global environmental analysis, which stems from a false decoupling between economic and production systems as observed in most developed nations, which results in improved territorial emissions of these developed countries at the expense of developing countries. Ecological unequal exchange is one such contemporary ecological economic concept that is used to highlight such asymmetric transfer of embodied natural resources and biophysical indicators between countries. Attempts at environmental impacts reduction efforts has largely focused on carbon emissions but given the complex supply chain created through globalisation and international trade, it is important to consider other important metrics such as land and water use alongside carbon emissions to drive environmental policies that will holistically address ecologically unequal exchanges. For developing countries in Africa where the dependence on land use and water use for agricultural activities are crucial to the development of national economies and in combating poverty, an assessment of these metrics has become even more paramount. Against this backdrop, the current work draws upon the theoretical constructs of multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework to trace country specific sectorial-level flows of the aforementioned metrics between a representative developed nation, UK, and 27 African regions in order to fully examine their ecological exchanges. Key findings in the study suggest that for water consumption and land use, there is a net externalisation of these impacts for all the 27 African regions by the UK. It was also determined that the extent of the imbalance between the UK and the African region is exceedingly far greater for water consumption. It is recommended that in formulating a robust multi-national environmental policy where so many factors are at play, country specific and industry targeted approach to ecological unequal exchange between nations provides better and improved insight into addressing ensuing environmental issues.","[Oppon, Eunice; Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq; Koh, Lenny] Univ Sheffield, Ctr Energy Environm & Sustainabil, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Oppon, Eunice; Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq; Koh, Lenny] Univ Sheffield, Adv Resource Efficiency Ctr, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Acquaye, Adolf] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7PE, Kent, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Kent,"Oppon, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Ctr Energy Environm & Sustainabil, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",epoppon1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq/AAE-3181-2021; Oppon, Eunice/JOK-0459-2023","Ibn-Mohammed, Taofeeq/0000-0003-2454-0303; Acquaye, Adolf/0000-0003-0430-2498; Oppon, Eunice Pokuaa/0000-0002-5959-3221",,,,,71,18,18,5,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We combine a spatial econometric approach with stochastic frontier analysis to control for unobserved environmental conditions when measuring efficiency of electricity distribution utilities. Our empirical strategy relies on the geographic location of firms as a source of information that has previously not been explored in the literature. The underlying idea is to utilise data from neighbouring firms that can be spatially correlated as proxies for unobserved cost drivers. We illustrate this approach using a dataset of Norwegian distribution utilities for the 2004-2011 period. We show that the lack of information on weather and geographic conditions can be compensated with data from surrounding firms. The methodology can be used in efficiency analysis and regulation of other utilities sectors where unobservable cost drivers are important, e.g. gas, water, agriculture, fishing.","[Orea, Luis] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain; [Alvarez, Inmaculada C.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England",University of Oviedo; Autonomous University of Madrid; Durham University,"Orea, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain.",lorea@uniovi.es,"Orea, Luis/K-5298-2014; Alvarez, Inmaculada C/K-5808-2014",,Government of the Principality of Asturias; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),Government of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),This research was partially funded by the Government of the Principality of Asturias and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

The first effect can be understood as the re-assignment of offshore tasks to immigrant workers. The second can be seen as a cost cutting effect due to immigration, and the third as a trade-cost reducing effect. To test the empirical significance and size of these effects, we exploit differences in immigrant inflows across U.K. labor markets and a new firm-level dataset on U.K. service firms. We find that immigrants increase overall productivity in service-producing firms, revealing a cost cutting impact on these firms. They also reduce the extent of country-specific off shoring, consistent with a reallocation of tasks, and they increase country-specific exports, consistent with a reduction in bilateral communication and trade costs.

In our model, trading venues make technological investments and compete for investors who choose where and how much to trade. Faster venues charge higher fees and attract speed-sensitive investors. Competition among venues increases investor participation, trading volume, and allocative efficiency, but entry and fragmentation can be excessive, and speeds are generically inefficient. Regulations that protect transaction prices (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission trade-through rule) lead to greater fragmentation.

We show that an equilibrium in which consumers start their search at the largest marketplace and continue in the descending order of size, always exists. Despite charging lower prices, firms in larger marketplaces earn higher profits. Under free entry, all firms cluster in one marketplace provided that search frictions are large enough.

This paper introduces a new agent-based model which simulates this adoption by considering decision-making of individual households based on household income, social network, total capital cost of the PV system, and the payback period of the investment, where the final factor takes into account the economic effect of FiTs. After calibration using Approximate Bayesian Computation, the model successfully simulates observed cumulative and average capacity installed over the period 2010-2016 using historically accurate FiTs; setting different tariffs allows investigation of alternative policy scenarios. Model results show that using simple cost control measures, more installation by October 2016 could have been achieved at lower subsidy cost. The total cost of supporting capacity installed during the period 2010-2016, totalling 2.4 GW, is predicted to be (sic)14 billion, and costs to consumers significantly exceed predictions. The model is further used to project capacity installed up to 2022 for several PV cost, electricity price, and FiT policy scenarios, showing that current tariffs are too low to significantly impact adoption, and falling PV costs are the most important driver of installation.","[Pearce, Phoebe] Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Slade, Raphael] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Pearce, P (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",phoebe.pearce15@imperial.ac.uk; r.slade@imperial.ac.uk,"Pearce, Phoebe/AFT-3579-2022","Pearce, Phoebe/0000-0001-9082-9506; Slade, Raphael/0000-0002-5297-4224","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK [EP/K036734/1]; EPSRC [EP/K036734/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Raphael Slade was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK, through the SUPER-GEN Bioenergy Hub project Bioenergy value chains: whole systems analysis and optimisation (EP/K036734/1).",,70,35,37,0,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116,,,,,,95,111,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.060,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430758200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Targeted reviews of PubMed, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Highly Specialised Technologies (HST), and the Scottish Medicines Consortium's (SMC's) ultra-orphan submissions were performed. Results: A total of 19 PubMed studies, 3 published NICE HSTs, and 11 ultra-orphan SMC submissions were eligible for inclusion. In rare diseases, a number of different factors may affect the model's ability to comply with good practice recommendations. Many products for the treatment of rare diseases have an incomplete efficacy and safety profile at product launch. In addition, there is often limited available natural history and epidemiology data. Information on the direct and indirect cost burden of an orphan disease also may be limited, making it difficult to estimate the potential economic benefit of treatment. These challenges can prevent accurate estimation of a new product's benefits in relation to costs. Approaches that can address such challenges include using patient and/or clinician feedback to inform model assumptions; data from disease analogues; epidemiological techniques, such as matching-adjusted indirect comparison; and long-term data collection. Conclusions: Modeling in rare diseases is often challenging; however, a number of approaches are available to support the development of model structures and the collation of input parameters and to manage uncertainty.","[Pearson, Isobel; Bothwell, Ben; Knight, Christopher] RTI Hlth Solut, Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England",Research Triangle Institute,"Knight, C (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England.",cknight@rti.org,,"Knight, Christopher/0000-0001-6428-0505; Pearson, Isobel/0000-0003-3931-8457",,,,,57,34,35,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21,5,,,,,515,524,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.008,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753347,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432175400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Household-level data were collected from irrigated and rainfed agro-ecosystems. In each ecosystem, the geographical information on residential and farm-plot neighborhood structures was recorded to compare household-level spatial dependency among four types of neighborhoods. A Bayesian stochastic frontier approach that integrates spatial dependency was used to address the effects of neighborhood structures on farmers' performance. Incorporating the spatial dimension into the neighborhood structures allowed for identification of the relationships between spatial dependency and technical efficiency through comparison with nonspatial models. The neighborhood structure at the residence and plot levels were defined with a spatial weight matrix where cut-off distances ranged from 100 to 1,000 m. We found that spatial dependency exists at the residential and plot levels and is stronger for irrigated farms than rainfed farms. We also found that technical inefficiency levels decrease as spatial effects are more taken into account. Because the spatial effects increase with a shorter network distance, the decreasing technical inefficiency implies that the unobserved inefficiencies can be explained better by considering small networks of relatively close farmers over large networks of distant farmers.","[Pede, Valerien O.; McKinley, Justin] IRRI, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Areal, Francisco J.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Singbo, Alphonse] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [McKinley, Justin] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Kajisa, Kei] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, 4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of Reading; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Monash University; Aoyama Gakuin University,"Pede, VO (通讯作者)，IRRI, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines.",v.pede@irri.org,"Areal, F.

Both prior and posterior beliefs of Receivers about Senders' types are elicited, as well as beliefs of Senders about Receivers' strategies. In the experiment, subjects often start with diffuse uniform beliefs and update them in view of observations. However, the speed of updating is influenced by the strength of initial beliefs. An interesting result is that beliefs about the prior distribution of types are updated slower than posterior beliefs, which incorporate Senders' strategies. In the medium run, for some specifications of game parameters, this leads to outcomes being significantly different from the outcomes of the game in which a common prior is induced. It is also shown that elicitation of beliefs does not considerably change the pattern of play in this game.","[Possajennikov, Alex] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Decis Res & Expt Econ CeDEx, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Possajennikov, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Ctr Decis Res & Expt Econ CeDEx, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",alex.possajennikov@nottingham.ac.uk,"Possajennikov, Alex/ABG-8223-2021","Possajennikov, Alex/0000-0001-8887-8165","School of Economics, University of Nottingham","School of Economics, University of Nottingham","I would like to thank the School of Economics, University of Nottingham, for financial support and CeDEx for providing access to the infrastructure to run the experiment.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned as the evidence review group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), the ERG report and the NICE guidance produced by the appraisal committee (AC) for the use of ticagrelor in England and Wales. The ERG critically reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS. The systematic review conducted as part of the CS identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT), PEGASUS-TIMI 54. This trial reported the time to first occurrence of any event from the composite of cardiovascular death, MI and stroke as the primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.84 ticagrelor 60 mg BID vs. placebo, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.95). The population addressed in the CS was a subgroup of the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial population, i.e. the 'base-case' population, which comprised patients who had experienced an MI between 1 and 2 years ago, whereas the full trial population included patients who had experienced an MI between 1 and 3 years ago. While the ERG believed the findings of this RCT to be robust, doubts concerning the applicability of the trial to UK patients were raised. The company submitted an individual patient simulation model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg BID + ASA versus ASA only. Parametric time-to-event models were used to estimate the time to first and subsequent (cardiovascular) events, time to treatment discontinuation and time to adverse events. The company's base-case analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 20,098 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The main issues surrounding the cost effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg BID + ASA were the use of parametric time-to-event models estimated based on the full trial population instead of being fitted to the 'label' population (the 'label' population comprised the 'base-case' population and patients who started ticagrelor 60 mg BID within 1 year of previous adenosine diphosphate inhibitor treatment), the incorrect implementation of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) of the individual patient simulation, and simplifications of the model structure that may have biased the health benefits and costs estimations of the intervention and comparator. The ERG believed the use of the full trial population to inform the parametric time-to-event models was not appropriate because the 'label' population was the main focus of the scope and CS. The ERG could not investigate the magnitude of the bias introduced by this assumption. The PSA of the individual patient simulation provided unreliable probabilistic results and underestimated the uncertainty surrounding the results because it was based on a single patient. The ERG used the cohort simulation presented in the cost-effectiveness model to perform its base-case and additional analyses and to obtain probabilistic results. The ERG amended the company cost-effectiveness model, which resulted in an ERG base-case ICER of A 24,711 pound per QALY gained. In its final guidance, the AC recommended treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg BID + low-dose ASA for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults who have had an MI and are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events.","[Pouwels, Xavier G.

Fifty percent of students signed up to this software, so when combined with a further first-year mathematics and statistical methods unit, without message board software, this enabled the opportunity to use a difference in difference methodology to find the causal impact of message board software on student examination performance. The results suggest that students who actively engage with message boards perform significantly better than students who sign up for the message boards, but neither ask, nor answer, questions. However, the results for the impact compared to non-participants is mixed, and may be related to behavioural change in students.","[Proud, Steven] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Proud, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England.",Steven.proud@bristol.ac.uk,"Proud, Steven/ABB-7387-2020","Proud, Steven/0000-0002-0289-1842",,,,,11,0,0,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

We outline techniques to unambiguously link records to various freely available institutional registers. In particular, we offer guidance on overcoming the substantial challenges of heterogeneous provision and administrative recording errors in the absence of Uniform Resource Identifiers, namely in the form of an approximate, domain-specific record-linkage' type matching algorithm. As an illuminating example, we construct a cleaned database of 24,581,192 local government payments subject to the Local Transparency Codes which total 169.87bn pound in value. We overcome various challenges in a detailed examination of the procurement of services by local government from the voluntary sector: an important contemporary issue due to the rise of the Big Society' political ideology of the early 21st century.

We make the argument that despite the centralized nature of practices, the manner in which inclusion takes place can vary significantly depending on structural features of local networks and governance factors, especially social capital and the role of lead organisations. Social network analysis allows us to investigate how different patterns of bonding, bridging and centrality of key actors in agricultural clusters can influence diffusion of knowledge. We frame this discussion through a typology that allows us to identify diverse scenarios of inclusion of small producers. This is then used to guide an empirical analysis of two agri-food clusters of small producers in Peru (mango) and Colombia (palm oil). Judicious use of mixed methods and the typology can prove useful to explain diverse patterns of inclusion which have important implications for small-scale agricultural producers.","[Ramirez, Matias; Bernal, Paloma] Univ Sussex, Sch Business & Management, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England; [Clarke, Ian] Univ Greenwich, Dept Syst Management & Strategy, London, England; [Hernandez, Ivan] Univ Ibague, Ibague, Colombia",University of Sussex; University of Greenwich,"Ramirez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Business & Management, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9QE, E Sussex, England.",mr230@sussex.ac.uk,,"Ramirez, Matias/0000-0002-3846-691X",British Academy [SG50694],British Academy,"The authors would like to thanks the British Academy for their support (Grant SG50694) and APEM, PROMANGO and CENIPALMA for facilitating interviews.

In this study, its investigators noticed that some interviewers did not fully explain the C-TTO task to respondents. Evidence from a follow-up study in 2014 confirmed that when interviewers followed the protocol, the distribution of C-TTO responses widened. Objectives: To handle the data quality issues in the C-TTO responses by estimating a hybrid interval regression model to produce a Spanish EQ-5D-5L value set. Methods: Four different models were tested. Model 0 integrated C-TTO and DCE responses in a hybrid model and models 1 to 3 altered the interpretation of the C-TTO responses: model 1 allowed for censoring of the C-TTO responses, whereas model 2 incorporated interval responses and model 3 included the interviewer-specific protocol violations. For external validation, the predictions of the four models were compared with those of the follow-up study using the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Results: This stepwise approach to modeling C-TTO and DCE responses improved the concordance between the valuation and follow-up studies (concordance correlation coefficient: 0.948 [model 0], 0.958 [model 1], 0.952 [model 2], and 0.989 [model 3]). We recommend the estimates from model 3, because its hybrid interval regression model addresses the data quality issues found in the valuation study. Conclusions: Protocol violations may occur in any valuation study; handling them in the analysis can improve external validity. The resulting EQ-5D-5L value set (model 3) can be applied to inform Spanish health technology assessments.","[Ramos-Goni, Juan M.; Oppe, Mark] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Ramallo-Farina, Yolanda] Canary Isl Hlth Serv, HTA Unit, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Univ Navarra, Navarra, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Ramos-Goni, Juan M.; Ramallo-Farina, Yolanda; Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Res Network Chron Dis REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of Navarra; Glasgow Caledonian University; National University of Singapore; University of Oxford,"Ramos-Goñi, JM (通讯作者)，EuroQol Res Fdn, Execut Off, C Calvario 271-B 1IZQ, Tacoronte 38350, Canary Islands, Spain.",jramos@euroqol.org,"prades, jose luis pinto/AGJ-9700-2022; prades, jose luis pinto/B-7069-2008; Ramallo-Fariña, Yolanda/AAE-9355-2021","prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; Ramallo-Fariña, Yolanda/0000-0002-1541-3989; Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544",Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y Fomento de la Investigacion; Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [PI12/02103]; EuroQol Research Foundation,Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y Fomento de la Investigacion; Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional(European Union (EU)); EuroQol Research Foundation,"This study was financially supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Subdireccion General de Evaluacion y Fomento de la Investigacion, Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion 2013-2016, and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (grant no.

Platform pricing strategies that could incentivise consumers to participate in a two-sided electricity platform market are discussed. The research is based on original data from a discrete choice experiment on electricity service contracts that was conducted with 1,892 electricity consumers in Great Britain in 2015. We estimate a flexible mixed logit model in willingness to pay space and exploit the results in posterior analysis. The findings suggest that while consumers are willing to pay for technical support services, they are likely to demand significant compensation to share their usage and personally identifying data and to participate in automated demand response programs involving remote monitoring and control of electricity usage. Cross-subsidisation of consumers combining appropriate participation payments with sharing of bill savings could incentivise participation of the number of consumers required to provide the optimal level of demand response. We also examine the preference heterogeneity to suggest how, by targeting customers with specific characteristics, smart electricity service providers could significantly reduce their customer acquisition costs.

The context is postnatal mental health, where although advocates for investment often include longer-term and family problems in describing the burden of postnatal depression, economic evaluations are usually limited to mothers' effects with a relatively short time horizon. This discrepancy may lead to suboptimal allocation of healthcare resources. Methods: The question of whether such boundary extensions could make a difference to decision-making is explored using decision analytic models, populated with data from the literature, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical preventive intervention under alternate boundary-setting approaches. Results: The results suggest that broader boundaries, particularly extension of the time horizon, could make substantial differences to estimated cost-effectiveness. Inclusion of family effects without extension of the time horizon had little impact, but where a longer time horizon was used, family effects could make a significant difference to the conclusions drawn from cost-effectiveness analysis. Conclusions: Considerations in applying broader boundaries include the substantial resource requirements for evaluation, potential equity implications, relevance to decision-makers, methods for inclusion, and the interpretation and use of such results in decision-making. However, this context underscores the importance of considering not only caregiving but also family health effects, and illustrates the need for consistency between the arguments presented to decision-makers and the analytical approach taken in economic evaluation.","[Ride, Jemimah] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Heslington, England",University of York - UK,"Ride, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",jmimah.ride@york.ac.uk,,"Ride, Jemimah/0000-0002-1820-5499",,,,,63,3,3,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21,5,,,,,573,580,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.016,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753355,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432175400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

While studies of universities' knowledge transfer performance have so far focused on patent commercialisation and research contracting with industry, it is increasingly acknowledged that universities engage in a broader range of knowledge transfer activities, including consulting, public engagement and provision of knowledge-intensive services. When these are taken into account, less research-intensive universities, and those with a greater share of staff in the arts and humanities, improve their relative efficiency. More specialised, older and larger institutions are more efficient performers, while research intensity is no longer a strong predictor of efficiency.","[Rossi, Federica] Birkbeck Univ London, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Rossi, F (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",f.rossi@bbk.ac.uk,"Rossi, Federica/AFP-2812-2022","Rossi, Federica/0000-0002-5869-4469",,,,,85,13,14,4,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Health economists have developed a set of highly sophisticated analytical methods for assessing efficiency, but less attention has been paid to formally incorporating equity considerations into analyses. As a result, where equity is considered is often informal, ad hoc and/or simplistic. This paper is a proposal for a mechanism for formally incorporating equity within the decision process. It begins with an overview of the current literature on equity weighting. It then considers the case of a single equity domain and illustrates how this is currently applied in practice by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It then proposes a more comprehensive method for considering the multi-attribute equity state, where a population exhibits more than one trait considered worthy of differential weighting. Finally, the paper proposes a mechanism by which this could be applied in practice, and concludes with a discussion of the challenges for applying multi-attribute equity weighting.","[Round, Jeff] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Bristol; University of Alberta,"Round, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",jeff.round@bristol.ac.uk,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Round, Jeff/0000-0002-3103-6984; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980",,,,,39,21,23,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

As tropical countries undertake REDD + readiness, vital questions arise around the equity of REDD + interventions. In particular, there has been much critique of the impact of REDD + on local forest communities, and whether these interventions serve to entrench or address existing inequalities and the structural causes of poverty. Taking Ghana's REDD + process as a case study, McDermott et al.'s (2013) 'equity framework' is used to systematically examine the contextual, procedural and distributive dimensions of equity, based on fieldwork carried out from July 2014 to March 2016. This study draws on stakeholder perspectives and document analysis to draw conclusions about the equity of Ghana's REDD + process. Our study shows that Ghana's national REDD + strategy, legal texts and documents aim to ensure that all actors, including local forest communities, are considered 'subjects of equity'. However, according to stakeholder perspectives and general forest laws and policies, there are multiple barriers to realizing the intended goals of equity. Firstly, the complex, multiple and unclear tenurial arrangements inhibit distributive equity. Secondly, uneven stakeholder knowledge and capacity hamper effective engagement in decision-maldng and limit procedural equity. Thirdly, contextual factors that are remnants of colonial structures and systems, and that serve competing political and economic interests through resource exploitation impact distributive equity. The 'equity framework' reveals that historical contextual factors impact the achievement of equity through REDD +, even with right government policies and strategies in place.","[Saeed, Abdul-Razak] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [McDermott, Constance] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Boyd, Emily] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Reading; University of Oxford; Lund University,"Saeed, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England.",abdul-razak.saeed@pgr.reading.ac.uk; constance.mcdermott@ouce.ox.ac.uk; emily.boyd@lucsus.lu.se,"Boyd, Emily/KEE-8802-2024","McDermott, Constance/0000-0002-5238-0936; Saeed, Abdul-Razak/0000-0003-0952-2166","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, UK [GHCS-2013-116]","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, UK","This research was supported by the Commonwealth Scholarship CommissionGHCS-2013-116, UK, as part of a doctoral research.",,64,17,17,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90,,,,,,48,58,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.006,,,11,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430766300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The MENA region panel is divided into three subgroups of countries: GCC panel (containing the Gulf Cooperation Council countries), N-GCC panel (containing countries that are not members of the Gulf Cooperation Council), and North African countries (called MATE Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt). Using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), we find that transport energy consumption significantly adds to economic growth in MENA, N-GCC and MATE regions. Transport infrastructure positively contributes to economic growth in all regions. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality analysis shows the feedback effect of transport energy consumption and transport infrastructure with economic growth. The empirical results add a new dimension to the importance of investing in modem infrastructure that facilitates the use of more energy-efficient modes and alternative technologies that positively affect the economy with minimizing negative externalities.","[Saidi, Samir] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Akhtar, Pervaiz] Univ Hull, Fac Business Law & Polit, Management Syst & Logist, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Akhtar, Pervaiz] IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France",Universite de Sfax; Montpellier Business School; University of Hull; IESEG School of Management,"Saidi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.",samir.saidi@fsegs.rnu.tn; muhdshahbaz77@gmail.com; Pervaiz.Akhtar@hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,110,95,97,4,56,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

There is however little empirical examination of how actors from politics, government, civil society and non-governmental organisations regard the role of public engagement in climate and energy policy. Research is lacking as to their views on the desirability of active citizen participation or indeed whether they draw on the findings from social science research in forming strategies and policy. This paper presents an analysis of interviews with policy experts and deliberative seminars held with non-governmental stakeholders acting in an intermediary capacity between climate policy and the public. A comparison of four policy scenarios was used to explore intermediaries' beliefs about the role of the public in delivering the UK's Climate Change Act targets. The results reveal a general antipathy to policies that seek to 'engage' the public and a lack of knowledge amongst seminar participants about how insights from the social sciences can be used to build and sustain public engagement. This research exposes the need to assess the means by which public engagement can better be understood, integrated and most effectively utilised for sustainable progression towards climate targets.","[Shaw, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford Univ Ctr Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Hurth, Victoria] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Capstick, Stuart; Cox, Emily] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Tower Bldg,Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, Wales; [Capstick, Stuart; Cox, Emily] Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Tower Bldg,Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, Wales",University of Oxford; University of Plymouth; Cardiff University,"Shaw, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford Univ Ctr Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",Chris.Shaw@climateoutreach.org; Victoria.Hurth@plymouth.ac.uk; CapstickSB@cardiff.ac.uk; CoxE3@cardiff.ac.uk,"Cox, Emily/AAE-3359-2020","Cox, Emily/0000-0002-8169-3691",Impact Accelerator Account from the ESRC [IAA-HT14-006],Impact Accelerator Account from the ESRC,"This research was funded by an Impact Accelerator Account from the ESRC. award number IAA-HT14-006.

International trade, by eliminating the duplication of coordination costs, leads to a greater variety of tasks, each produced at a larger scale than in autarky. The greater variety of tasks implies greater division of labor and hence gains from trade. Extending the model to two factors of production yields the additional result that if the two countries are sufficiently similar in their relative endowments, then both factors of production can experience gains from trade.","[Soo, Kwok Tong] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Soo, KT (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",k.soo@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Soo, Kwok Tong/0000-0002-2960-3097",,,,,36,0,0,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We apply recent methodological advances in the estimation of production functions together with information on prices and quantities to estimate physical productivity, markups, marginal costs and proxies for product quality. Using a propensity score reweighting estimator, we find that acquisitions are associated with increases in quantities and markups and lower marginal costs on average. These changes are most pronounced if acquirers are located in technologically advanced countries. We also provide evidence that the quality of products increases while quality-adjusted prices fall upon acquisitions. Our results indicate that knowledge transfer from foreign acquirers to domestic firms, predicted by theories of multinational firms, can materialize in both cost- and quality-based gains and benefit both firms and consumers.

While urban shops have been explored in detail, often in ways that highlight their role in a parallel transformation in consumption patterns, little attempt has been made to look inside village shops or examine the character and practices of rural retailers. This article addresses this lacuna and offers fresh insights into the shifting position of village shops in these broader economic, business, and social changes. Taking a long view of the period c. 1660-1860, it draws on a wide range of sources to examine the stock sold and the degree of specialization exhibited by village shops, and the changing trading practices of village shopkeepers, including the provision of credit, the pricing of goods, and marketing activities. In doing so, the article highlights both long-term continuities and important innovations of the type that also characterize urban shops, and argues that village shops, while central to rural social and economic networks, were also intimately bound into broader retail systems.","[Stobart, Jon] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Bailey, Lucy] Univ Northampton, Northampton, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Northampton,"Stobart, J (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,"Stobart, Jon/0000-0002-9771-4741",,,,,76,8,9,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The clinical efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (in addition to phosphate binders and vitamin D and/or analogues [PB/VD]) was evaluated in three phase III studies, including two placebo-controlled trials and a head-to-head study versus the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a decision-analytic model for economic evaluation of etelcalcetide compared with cinacalcet. Methods We developed a life-time Markov model including potential treatment effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and subjects' persistence. Long-term efficacy of etelcalcetide was extrapolated from the reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the phase III trials and the available data from the outcomes study in cinacalcet (EVOLVE trial). Etelcalcetide was compared with cinacalcet, both in addition to PB/VD. We applied unit costs averaged from five European countries and a range of potential etelcalcetide pricing options assuming parity price to weekly use of cinacalcet and varying it by a 15 or 30% increase. Results Compared with cinacalcet, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of etelcalcetide was (sic)1,355 per QALY, (sic)24,521 per QALY, and (sic)47,687 per QALY for the three prices explored. The results were robust across the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our modelling approach enabled cost-utility assessment of the novel therapy for SHPT based on the observed and extrapolated data. This model can be used for local adaptations in the context of reimbursement assessment.","[Stollenwerk, Bjorn; Parfrey, Patrick] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Stollenwerk, Bjorn] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Iannazzo, Sergio] SIHS Hlth Econ Consulting, Via Sebastiano Caboto 45, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Akehurst, Ron] BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Akehurst, Ron] Univ Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Adena, Michael] Datalyt Pty Ltd, 19-12 Trevillian Quay, Kingston, ACT 2603, Australia; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Dehmel, Bastian; Belozeroff, Vasily] Amgen Inc, One Amgen Ctr Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Parfrey, Patrick] Mem Univ, POB 4200, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow; Amgen; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Stollenwerk, B (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland.;Stollenwerk, B (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",bjoerns@amgen.com,"Stollenwerk, Björn/G-5408-2013; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Stollenwerk, Bjorn/0000-0002-3189-409X",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),"Financial support for this study was provided by Amgen.

Nevertheless, when the health states being valued are temporary, the TTO approach may be unsuitable. A variant of TTO-chained TTO-has been suggested to be used when the health states are temporary, but little research has been done on how chained TTO should be conducted. Objectives: To systematically review the use of chained TTO in valuing temporary health states. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using the following major databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, EBM Reviews, and PsycINFO. Abstracts(full articles if necessary) were screened by two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. Results: The resulting number of articles for review was low (n = 9). All the reviewed studies used face-to-face interviews, most had small sample sizes (<100), and all studies valued a small number of health states (<7), with time horizons typically ranging from 4 weeks to 1 year. All studies discussed methodological issues of using chained TTO, and some compared the results with those generated using other preference elicitation methods. Conclusions: Chained TTO appears to be feasible, consistent, and responsive and allows the valuation of temporary health states that would improve the efficiency and accuracy of decision making in health and health care. Nevertheless, the evidence is limited due to the low number of relevant studies in the literature. Further research is needed to examine the performance and validity of chained TTO compared with conventional TTO in the valuation of temporary health states.","[Stoniute, Julija; Mott, David John; Shen, Jing] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Hlth Econ Grp, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mott, David John] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Shen, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Hlth Econ Grp, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England.",jing.shen@ncl.ac.uk,"Mott, David/H-8548-2018","Mott, David/0000-0001-5959-8447",Health Foundation,Health Foundation,The development of this work was funded by the Health Foundation for an internship project.,,24,8,10,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21,5,,,,,605,611,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3015,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753359,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432175400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use the index decomposition analysis to derive the true energy efficiency by separating out the impact of structural shifts in economic activity on energy intensity. We then employ both STSM and LSDVC models to examine and quantify the impact of the energy efficiency on CO2 emissions accounting for non-economic factors such as consumers' lifestyle, attitudes and environmental awareness. The application for 30 OECD countries shows that at the group level, the decline in energy intensity predominately occurred due to improvements in energy efficiency while at the country level, there are mixed contributions from improvement in energy efficiency and structural shift to the decline in energy intensity. The econometric results show that income has the most significant positive impact on CO2 emissions but improving energy efficiency makes the biggest contribution to driving down CO2 emissions. The method further enables the separate assessment of non-economic behavioural effects, which are found to exert a non-trivial influence on CO2 emissions in parallel with changes in energy efficiency. We conclude that energy efficiency remains a key option but that there is also a need for additional policies aiming for behavioural and other non-economic changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines countries' unilateral incentives to achieve supply security through capacity reserves and market integration in a multinational electricity market. Capacity reserves protect consumers against blackouts and extreme prices, but distort the market. Market integration reduces supply imbalances, but requires network investment. Equilibrium capacity reserves can be too high or low, but network investment is always insufficient relative to the total welfare maximizing level. Capacity reserves are smaller when there are financial markets or when aimed at solving domestic supply constraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We access a rarely studied U.S. bank-level regulatory dataset to assess at a quarterly frequency how changes in the U.S. Federal funds rate (before the crisis) and quantitative easing (after the onset of the crisis) affect changes in cross-border claims by U.S. banks across countries, maturities and sectors, and also affect changes in claims by their foreign affiliates. We find robust evidence consistent with the existence of a potent global bank lending channel. In response to changes in U.S. monetary conditions, U.S. banks strongly adjust their cross-border claims in both the pre- and post-crisis period. However, we also find that U.S. bank affiliate claims respond mainly to host country monetary conditions.

Instead, there is growing evidence that EU asylum harmonization has safeguarded existing standards and even enhanced the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees in Europe. We seek to explain this by building on the insights of principal-agent theory. We argue that delegation to supranational institutions can strengthen non-majoritarian policy dynamics and shield EU policy-makers from populist pressures for further immigration restrictions that national governments are often confronted with. We support this argument empirically through a systematic longitudinal analysis of the evolution of EU asylum policies. In particular, we seek to assess the motivation for and impact of greater delegation to EU institutions on rights developments for asylum-seekers and refugees. We also explain to what extent EU policy-making has changed with the EU's response to the Syrian refugee crisis'.","[Thielemann, Eiko; Zaun, Natascha] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Zaun, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.v.zaun@lse.ac.uk,,"Zaun, Natascha/0000-0002-0436-6275",Eidgenossisches Departement fur Auswartige Angelegenheiten,Eidgenossisches Departement fur Auswartige Angelegenheiten,The authors would like to thank three anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

First, the meaning of a CE threshold and the key assumptions involved (perfect divisibility, marginal increments in budget, etc.) are highlighted using a hypothetical example, and the use of historic/heuristic estimates of the threshold is noted along with their limitations. Recent endeavours to estimate the empirical value of the thresholds, both from the supply side and the demand side, are then presented. The impact on CE thresholds of future directions for the field, such as thresholds across sectors and the incorporation of multiple criteria beyond quality-adjusted life-years as a measure of 'value', are highlighted.

To identify these self-control types, I design an experiment in which the temptation was to read a story during a tedious task. The identification strategy relies on a two-step procedure. First, I measure commitment demand by eliciting subjects' preferences over menus that did or did not allow access to the story. I then implement preferences using a random mechanism, allowing to observe subjects who faced the choice yet preferred commitment. A quarter to a third of subjects can be classified as self-control types according to their menu preferences. When confronted with the choice, virtually all of them behaved as they anticipated and resisted temptation. These findings suggest that policies restricting the availability of tempting options could have larger welfare benefits than predicted by standard models of present bias.","[Toussaert, Severine] London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Toussaert, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England.",S.Toussaert@lse.ac.uk,,"Toussaert, Severine/0000-0002-2491-6713",,,,,57,40,49,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2018,86,3,,,,,859,889,,10.3982/ECTA14172,http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA14172,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GI0XJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000434093400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analysed 35 process measures of quality of care covering 13 medical conditions using English Longitudinal Study of Aging data linked to area of residence indicators. Greater GP density had a statistically significant and positive association with quality of care, and distance to GP practice had a statistically significant and negative association. The effects were concentrated in indicators of care related to cardiovascular diseases and arthritis, and on specific indicators for diabetes, incontinence and hearing problems. The results suggest that better primary care supply can improve quality of care.","[Vallejo-Torres, Laura; Morris, Stephen] UCL, Dept Appl Hlth Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Vallejo-Torres, L (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Appl Hlth Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",l.vallejo-torres@ucl.ac.uk; steve.morris@ucl.ac.uk,"Vallejo-Torres, Laura/AHE-1828-2022","Vallejo-Torres, Laura/0000-0001-5833-6066; Morris, Stephen/0000-0002-5828-3563",,,,,49,13,13,3,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Using difference-in-difference models, we test whether achieving greater autonomy (FT status) improved hospital performance, as proxied by measures of financial management, quality of care, and staff satisfaction. Results provide little evidence that the FT policy per se has made any difference to the performance of hospitals in most of these domains.

Taking advantage of a rich household survey dataset, this paper estimates the wage premium for each industry in the first stage conditional on individual worker and firm characteristics. Alternative measures of globalization are considered in the second stage: trade openness and capital openness. A disaggregation of trade into trade in final and intermediate goods shows that increases in import (export) shares of final goods reduce (increase) the wage premia significantly, whereas imports or exports of intermediate goods do not explain differences in industry wage premia. This finding is supported by stronger effects for final goods trade in coastal than noncoastal regions. Our results also show a positive relationship between capital openness and industrial wage premia, though this finding is less robust when potential endogeneity issues are allowed for.","[Wang, Feicheng] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Milner, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Scheffel, Juliane] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Gottingen; University of Nottingham; University of Leeds,"Wang, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Feicheng.Wang@uni-goettingen.de,,"Scheffel, Juliane/0000-0001-9932-5881",,,,,63,6,6,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In order to provide more realistic traffic data for estimations of environmental impacts, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models have been adopted in transportation planning and traffic management models concerning environmental sustainability. This review summarizes and examines the recent methodological advances of DTA models in environmentally sustainable road transportation applications including traffic signal control concerning vehicular emissions and emission pricing. A classification of emission estimation models and their integration with DTA models are accordingly reviewed as supplementary to the existing reviews. Finally, a variety of future research prospects of DTA for environmentally sustainable road transportation research are discussed. In particular, this review also points out that at present the research about DTA models in conjunction with noise predictive models is relatively deficient. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Renewal can be regarded an impetus for realising integrated waterway networks that internalise externalities, which entails broad stakeholder involvement. This can be coordinated through different inter-organisational structures. Applying a transaction-cost perspective, we contribute to the assessment of effective governance arrangements for renewing waterway networks in such an integrated fashion. Our aim is to examine efficient inter-organisational structures for waterway renewal, as perceived by actors involved in a case study of the Dutch waterways. Our findings show that waterway renewal incorporates additional functionalities in terms of capacity (expansion or reduction), but not so much in terms of quality (combining transportation aims with spatial objectives such as ecology or regional development). Inter organisational structures that address geographical interrelatedness and, hence, broader stakeholder involvement were associated with uncertain and time-consuming transactions, because of extensive negotiations regarding the alignment of conflicting interests and the crossing of geographical and administrative boundaries. Also, a change in interdependency from hierarchical towards contractual relationships was required, putting dominant actors (the national government) in an unfamiliar position in which they loosen their grip on infrastructure investments. Perceptions on transactions centre on sectoral aims and individual assets, whereas the actual transaction may be different if a perspective is taken that includes the greater waterway system, the wider spatial surroundings and a longer-term horizon. We conclude that short-term, transportation objectives overrule longer-term, integrative objectives, which withholds strategic considerations required for aligning waterway interests.","[Willems, Jannes J.; Busscher, Tim; Arts, Jos] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands; [Woltjer, Johan] Univ Westminster, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Planning & Transport, London, England",University of Groningen; University of Westminster,"Willems, JJ (通讯作者)，POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",j.j.willems@rug.nl,,"Arts, Jos/0000-0002-6896-3992; Woltjer, Johan/0000-0003-3179-6294; Willems, Jannes/0000-0002-3318-9706; Busscher, Tim/0000-0002-7763-7320",Dutch public waterway authority Rijkswaterstaat; larger research on institutional transformation in the light of waterway renewal,Dutch public waterway authority Rijkswaterstaat; larger research on institutional transformation in the light of waterway renewal,"The authors would like to thank professor Ernest Alexander and professor George de Kam, as well as three anonymous reviewers, for their feedback on earlier versions of the paper.

Here, we quantitatively measure the impact of energy data revisions on China's ability to achieve its mitigation targets. Our results indicate the following effects of data revisions: 1. Mitigation challenges have increased by 5%, and the achievement of national mitigation targets (as well as international pledges) might be postponed by two years. 2. Greater than expected carbon space or emission quota (from 22.94 to 31.31 Gt) will be obtained from 2015 to 2035. 3. CO2 peak levels may become highly uncertain, with the uncertainty varying from 12% to 29%. In addition to national mitigation targets, data revision has profound implications for key industrial sectors. For example, raw coal consumption by the cement and iron and steel industries has long been underestimated, bringing uncertainty to the achievement of industrial mitigation targets. Our results reveal considerable uncertainty in China's energy data, and this uncertainty suggests that previous mitigation achievements have been overestimated and that the mitigation targets, carbon space values, and peak level estimates proposed by future mitigation schemes may not be reached.","[Zheng, Heran; Shan, Yuli; Ou, Jiamin; Schroeder, Heike; Guan, Dabo] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mi, Zhifu] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London WC1H 0QB, England; [Meng, Jing] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England",University of East Anglia; University of London; University College London; University of Cambridge,"Shan, YL; Guan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Yuli.Shan@uea.ac.uk; Dabo.guan@uea.ac.uk,"Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019; Meng, Jing/J-9740-2013; Zheng, Heran/GSE-6466-2022; Mi, Zhifu/P-1027-2019; Shan, Yuli/N-7747-2015; Guan, Dexin/I-4184-2018","Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Meng, Jing/0000-0001-8708-0485; Zheng, Heran/0000-0003-0818-7933; Mi, Zhifu/0000-0001-8106-0694; Shan, Yuli/0000-0002-5215-8657; Schroeder, Heike/0000-0003-2342-2030","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602604]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71533005, 41629501]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1]; British Academy Grant [AF150310]; China Scholarship Council [201606510016]; Leverhulme Trust; Social Sciences Faculty Postgraduate Studentships at the University of East Anglia; ESRC [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); British Academy Grant; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Social Sciences Faculty Postgraduate Studentships at the University of East Anglia; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"All the data and results can be download freely from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs) at http://www.ceads.net.

The active monetary and passive fiscal (AM/PF) policy may induce the raising of both interest rates and inflation rates. We find that there is a positive relationship between shopping time and inflation because higher inflation causes agents to reduce their money holdings so as to take more time for shopping. In addition, shopping time and output move in opposite ways due to the fact that higher shopping time results in lower working hours, so as to decrease production. Finally, this model fails to capture liquidity effect, but rather identify price puzzle through an expansion of monetary policy shock.","[Chang, Ming-Jen] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Chang, Ming-Jen] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Hualien, Taiwan; [Liu, Meng-Chao] Sunny Bank, Int Banking Dept, Taipei, Taiwan",University of Liverpool; National Dong Hwa University,"Chang, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Chang, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Hualien, Taiwan.",ming-jen.chang@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,2,2,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Shipping firms hold more cash than similar firms in other asset-heavy industries. Higher cash holdings in the shipping industry are not attributable to firm- or country-level characteristics, but rather to the higher marginal value of cash. Shipping firms value an additional dollar of cash higher than matched manufacturing firms, regardless of their financial constraints status, but depending on their cultural background and the cyclicality of their expansion opportunities. Less procyclical shipping firms have a higher marginal value of cash, and this valuation effect is most pronounced in bad times of the business cycle when external capital supply tends to become scarce. Overall, it appears that shipping companies are more conservative than their peers in managing their cash positions.","[Ahrends, Meike; Drobetz, Wolfgang] Hamburg Univ, Fac Business Adm, Moorweidenstr 18, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Nomikos, Nikos K.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",University of Hamburg; City University London,"Drobetz, W (通讯作者)，Hamburg Univ, Fac Business Adm, Moorweidenstr 18, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",wolfgang.drobetz@uni-hamburg.de,,"Nomikos, Nikos/0000-0003-1621-2991; Drobetz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-5247-0405",,,,,63,15,16,0,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

We find that having a father who is a liberal professional has a positive and significant effect on the probability of a graduate of becoming a liberal professional, To assess the processes at work in this intergenerational transmission, we evaluate the effect of having a liberal professional father on the probabilities to undertake each of the compulsory steps required to become a liberal professional, which are choosing a university degree providing access to a liberal profession, completing a period of practice, passing a licensing exam and starting a liberal profession. Having a liberal professional father has a positive and statistically significant effect on the probability to complete a compulsory period of practice and to start a liberal profession; whereas there does not seem to be an effect on the type of degree chosen and on passing the licensing examination, at least after controlling for child's and parental formal human capital.

However, this system is unlikely to be sustainable in the medium to long term. This study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of healthcare financing reform by examining households' willingness to pay (WTP) for a contributory national health insurance scheme. Using the contingent valuation method, a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1187 heads of household in Jeddah province over a 5-month period. Multi-stage sampling was employed to select the study sample. Using a double-bounded dichotomous choice with the follow-up elicitation method, respondents were asked to state their WTP for a hypothetical contributory national health insurance scheme. Tobit regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with WTP and assess the construct validity of elicited WTP. Over two-thirds (69.6%) indicated that they were willing to participate in and pay for a contributory national health insurance scheme. The mean WTP was 50 Saudi Riyal (US$13.33) per household member per month. Tobit regression analysis showed that household size, satisfaction with the quality of public healthcare services, perceptions about financing healthcare, education and income were the main determinants of WTP. This study demonstrates a theoretically valid WTP for a contributory national health insurance scheme by Saudi people. The research shows that willingness to participate in and pay for a contributory national health insurance scheme depends on participant characteristics. Identifying and understanding the main influencing factors associated with WTP are important to help facilitate establishing and implementing the national health insurance scheme. The results could assist policy-makers to develop and set insurance premiums, thus providing an additional source of healthcare financing.","[Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled; Alsharqi, Omar] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Hlth Serv & Hosp Adm Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled; Vaidya, Kirit] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Onwujekwe, Obinna] Univ Nigeria Enugu Campus, Dept Hlth Adm & Management, Coll Med, Enugu, Nigeria",King Abdulaziz University; Aston University; University of Nigeria,"Al-Hanawi, MK (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Hlth Serv & Hosp Adm Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.;Al-Hanawi, MK (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",mkalhanawi@kau.edu.sa,"Onwujekwe, Obinna/O-6232-2014; Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled/AAB-2455-2020","Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled/0000-0002-8419-2219","King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","This work is supported by King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the form of a PhD scholarship for MA.",,52,33,34,1,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We employ a class of non-parametric methods to explore the complex structure of the data and a set of correlated random effects models to identify key determinants of the quality of stroke care. The organisational quality of the process of stroke care appears as a fundamental driver of clinical quality of stroke care. There are rich complementarities amongst drivers of quality of stroke care.

Ordered probit regression analysis of well-being reveals large influence of gender, rural residency, and household income. After controlling for demographic attributes, health status, unemployment status, number of children, agricultural hukou (household registration identity) and educational attainment, household assets, the influence of past and future income, and province dummies, we find that women, urban residents, and people with higher income are happier in China. More schooling, better health, and being employed are positively and significantly correlated with well-being. Sub-sample analysis reveals that the rich only care about relative income whereas the effect of absolute income dominates in case of the poorer section. The influence of absolute income is larger among women compared to men and in turn explains why women, despite being poorer, are happier in China, conditional on socioeconomic differences. On the other hand, rural residents are poorer than urban residents so that conditional on having the same income, there is no rural-urban happiness gap. Our results suggest that while further decline in poverty will enhance well-being in China, policies that reduce rural-urban and gender inequalities are also likely to boost well-being.

This paper presents causal evidence on the impact of work search requirements on single parents' transitions into work and onto other benefits. We use rich administrative data on all single parent welfare recipients, and apply a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the staggered roll-out of a reform in the UK that gradually decreased the age of the youngest child at which single parents lose the right to an unconditional cash benefit. Consistent with the predictions of a simple search model, the work search requirements have heterogeneous impacts, leading some single parents to move into work, but leading some (especially those with weak previous labour market attachments) to move onto disability benefits (with no search conditionalities) or non-claimant unemployment.

This paper analyzes the corporate income tax policy for a large panel of LDCs. The analysis shows that although the corporate tax rate has been decreasing, corporate tax revenues have been increasing. Contrary to standard tax competition theory, there is also strong evidence that corporate income taxes are increasing with respect to the LDCs' openness, as measured by capital mobility. The analysis also shows that the corporate tax rate is increasing with respect to the personal tax rate, as income-shifting theory predicts.","[Baker, Paul L.] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Baker, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",p.l.baker@bath.ac.uk,,"Baker, Paul L./0000-0001-6923-7282",,,,,25,2,4,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

This question has been explored on a few different macroeconomic models, and both 'yes' and 'no' answers have been obtained. However, economies can become unstable whether or not there is ongoing underlying growth in productivity with which to sustain growth in output. Here we attempt, for the first time, to assess via a model the relative stability of growth versus no-growth scenarios. The model employed draws from Keen's model of the Minsky financial instability hypothesis. The analysis focuses on dynamics as opposed to equilibrium, and scenarios of growth and no-growth of output (GDP) are obtained by tweaking a productivity growth input parameter. We confirm that, with or without growth, there can be both stable and unstable scenarios. To maintain stability, firms must not change their debt levels or target debt levels too quickly. Further, according to the model, the wages share is higher for zero-growth scenarios, although there are more frequent substantial drops in employment.","[Barrett, Adam B.] Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England; [Barrett, Adam B.] Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Barrett, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.;Barrett, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.",adam.barrett@sussex.ac.uk,,,EPSRC [EP/L005131/1]; Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L005131/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L005131/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"ABB is funded by EPSRC grant EP/L005131/1.

A survey of the existing evidence nonetheless reveals that this price discount lies anywhere between - 75.5% to a + 61.0% price premium. In this paper we summarise and explore the wide variation in the results to obtain 'best' estimates with which to guide policy. Results from our meta-analysis comprising 37 published works and 364 point estimates indicate marked differences between studies according to when and where they were conducted. For coastal regions the results show that properties located in the floodplain command higher prices; this finding is however likely to be caused by a high correlation between omitted coastal amenities and flood risk. There is moreover, evidence that publication bias affects the coastal flooding literature. Results from meta-regression analyses intended to uncover sources of heterogeneity confirm that controlling for time elapsed since the most recent flood is especially important. For inland flooding the price discount associated with location in the 100-year floodplain is -4.6%. Although other estimates are defensible, we suggest this figure be used as a rule of thumb to determine the benefits of flood relief projects to households.","[Beltran, Allan] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Maddison, David; Elliott, Robert J.

We address that issue using an equilibrium sorting model (ESM) calibrated, by way of example, to the circumstances of a road infrastructure project in the English town of Polegate. Previous ESM research has tended to assume that all households rent property from a fixed property stock. The narrative that arises from those models concerns environmental gentrification, wherein access to environmentally improved locations is appropriated by the relatively wealthy through their ability to out-compete the less wealthy in the rental property market. Our research shows that to be only part of a much more complex story. We develop a model that extends the sophistication with which ESMs replicate property market dynamics, allowing for households to choose whether to rent or purchase their home and introducing greater realism into housing supply responses to changing market conditions. Our research shows that property markets redistribute welfare gains across the population in complex ways in which tenure choice and housing supply constraints play central roles.","[Binner, Amy; Day, Brett] Univ Exeter, Sch Social Sci & Int Studies, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Binner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Social Sci & Int Studies, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",a.r.binner@exeter.ac.uk; brett.day@exeter.ac.uk,,"Day, Brett/0000-0001-7519-5672; Binner, Amy/0000-0003-3235-0585",ESRC [ES/G018618/1]; Department of Transport [ES/G018618/1]; ESRC through the Social and Environmental Economic Research (SEER) project [RES-060-25-0063],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department of Transport; ESRC through the Social and Environmental Economic Research (SEER) project(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This paper has been produced as part of a studentship jointly funded by the ESRC and Department of Transport (Ref ES/G018618/1).

The basin's economy and expanding agricultural sector are highly vulnerable to the impacts of rainfall shocks.

A framework of exogenous growth permits modeling countries in transition to a country-specific steady state and to discern steady-state and transitory effects of shocks on economic outcomes. The chosen framework is amenable to structural estimation and, in view of the parsimony of the model, fits data on 79 countries over the period 1996-2011 well. The counterfactual analysis based on the estimated model suggests that capital-tax reductions induce positive effects on output and the capital stock (per unit of effective labor) that are economically significant and are accommodated within time windows of 5 years without much further economic response after that. The responses of economic aggregates are found to be relatively strongest to changes in corporate-profit-tax rates and weaker for dividend and capital-gains taxes.","[Bosenberg, Simon] Swiss Natl Bank, Boersenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter; Zoller-Rydzek, Benedikt] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] OUCBT, NoCeT, CEPR, CESifo, Oxford, England",Swiss National Bank (SNB); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Oxford,"Zoller-Rydzek, B (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",simon.boesenberg@snb.ch; egger@kof.ethz.ch; rydzek@kof.ethz.ch,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors thank RonDavies, Michael Devereux, Clemens Fuest, Kimberley Scharf, and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

The main findings of the study are: (1) international knowledge spillover is an important driver of industry output per worker, and the magnitude of this spillover effect varies with alternative assumptions about the information content embodied in imports, while high technology industries benefit significantly more from import-related knowledge spillovers; and (2) the gains from FDI spillovers are primarily horizontal, but when institutional factors are considered, countries with stronger protection of intellectual property rights and a high ease of doing business tend to experience a substantial increase in the effectiveness of both horizontal and vertical FDI-related spillovers.

The five methodologies considered are Superlative Index Numbers, System-GMM, 011ey and Pakes (1996), Levisohn and Petrin (2003) and Ackerberg et al. (2015). Each of these estimators assumes different underlying properties for some inputs, which potentially affect the TFP measurements. We analyze the role of corporate taxation within a TFP catch-up model, providing new insights on the unexplored fiscal aspect of the UK productivity puzzle. Our findings are summarized as: (i) the Ackerberg et al. (2015) algorithm is the cutting-edge estimation technique with most plausible results, while GMM system (GMM-SYS) is the second best estimator; (ii) the global financial crisis in 2009 impacted negatively on TFP; (iii) corporate tax adversely affects IFF growth as it induces distortive effects on productivity enhancing investment; (iv) the adverse effect is found to be severe in the groups of R&D and exporting firms, suggesting that the distortive nature of corporate tax affects disproportionately the firms that are more financially constrained and more exposed to risk.","[Bournakis, Ioannis] Middlesex Univ, Dept Econ, London NW4 4BT, England; [Mallick, Sushanta] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",Middlesex University; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Bournakis, I (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Dept Econ, London NW4 4BT, England.",I.Bournakis@mdx.ac.uk; s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk,"Bournakis, Ioannis/AAG-3244-2020","Bournakis, Ioannis/0000-0002-7065-9316",,,,,60,72,74,7,64,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

When the less salient provincial elections are held concurrently with the highly salient municipal elections, we observe three main effects: (1) turnout increases significantly by almost ten percentage points; (2) issues that are specific to the more salient (mayoral) contest affect the less salient (provincial) contest, with mayors' fiscal decisions impacting on the vote share of provincial incumbents; (3) issues that are specific to the less salient (provincial) contest stop affecting provincial elections outcomes.

However, in developing economies this is more challenging due to substantial revisions in GDP data and the limited availability of predictor variables. Taking India as a leading case, we use a dynamic factor model nowcasting method to analyse these two issues. Firstly, we propose to compare nowcasts of the first release of GDP to those of the final release to assess differences in their predictability. Secondly, we expand a standard set of predictors typically used for nowcasting GDP with nominal and international series, in order to proxy the variation in missing employment and service sector variables in India. We find that the factor model improves over several benchmarks, including bridge equations, but only for the final GDP release and not for the first release. Also, the nominal and international series improve predictions over and above real series. This suggests that future studies of nowcasting in developing economies which have similar issues of data revisions and availability as India should be careful in analysing first- vs. final-release GDP data, and may find that predictions are improved when additional variables from more timely international data sources are included.","[Bragoli, Daniela] Univ Cattolica, Dept Math Financial Math & Econometr, Via Necchi 9, I-29100 Milan, Italy; [Fosten, Jack] Univ East Anglia, Dept Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of East Anglia,"Bragoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica, Dept Math Financial Math & Econometr, Via Necchi 9, I-29100 Milan, Italy.",daniela.bragoli@unicatt.it; j.fosten@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,18,18,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

An initiative of the European Commission under Jean-Claude Juncker's leadership, Capital Markets Union seeks to realize a long-standing goal of European policy makers: a financial system in which capital markets will absorb more of citizens' savings and play a greater role in corporate finance. Market-based banking, too, is set to benefit from Capital Markets Union, which includes measures to revive the European securitization market. Given that market-based finance - or shadow banking - shouldered much of the blame for the financial crisis of 2007-2008, its resurgence as a policy priority of the European Union constitutes a puzzle. The present article lays the theoretical groundwork for a special issue that tackles this puzzle. It argues that rather than an end in itself, Capital Markets Union represents an exercise in governing through financial markets'. Pioneered in the United States, governing through financial markets is a political strategy adopted by state actors in pursuit of policy goals that exceed their institutional capacity.","[Braun, Benjamin; Huebner, Marina] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, D-50676 Cologne, Germany; [Gabor, Daniela] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England",Max Planck Society; University of West England,"Braun, B (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, D-50676 Cologne, Germany.",bb@mpifg.de,,"Braun, Benjamin/0000-0002-5186-5923",,,,,116,58,60,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

More specifically, we examine to what extent Kuwaiti real output in the long run is shaped by oil revenue through its impact on capital accumulation, and technological transfers through foreign output. Using the same modelling strategy we also explore the role of oil income in terms of long-run private and public sector output growth (separately). The estimates suggest that real domestic output in the long run is influenced by oil revenues and foreign output (a proxy for technological progress), and technological growth in Kuwait is on a par with the rest of the world. Furthermore, while we show that both oil revenues and foreign output drive growth in the public sector, it seems that technological progress is the main (and only) driver for private sector real growth. Finally, our results show that oil revenue and global equity market shocks have a large and significant long-run impact on Kuwait's real output and public sector GDP.

Statistical tests confirm the presence of overreactions and also suggest that there is an inertia anomaly, i.e. after an overreaction day prices tend to move in the same direction for some time. A trading robot approach is then used to test two trading strategies aimed at exploiting the detected anomalies to make abnormal profits. The results suggest that a strategy based on counter-movements after overreactions does not generate profits in the FOREX and the commodity markets, but in some cases it can be profitable in the US stock market. By contrast, a strategy exploiting the inertia anomaly produces profits in the case of the FOREX and the commodity markets, but not in the case of the US stock market.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Plastun, Alex] Sumy State Univ, Sumy, Ukraine",Brunel University; Ifo Institut; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Navarra; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.;Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,"Plastun, Alex/L-7631-2014","Plastun, Alex/0000-0001-8208-7135",,,,,32,17,18,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

First, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the familiar augmented Dickey-Fuller [ADF] statistics in the case where the shocks follow a linear process driven by infinite variance innovations. We show that these distributions are free of serial correlation nuisance parameters but depend on the tail index of the infinite variance process. These distributions are shown to coincide with the corresponding results for the case where the shocks follow a finite autoregression, provided the lag length in the ADF regression satisfies the same o(T-1/3) rate condition as is required in the finite variance case. In addition, we establish the rates of consistency and (where they exist) the asymptotic distributions of the ordinary least squares sieve estimates from the ADF regression. Given the dependence of their null distributions on the unknown tail index, our second contribution is to explore sieve wild bootstrap implementations of the ADF tests. Under the assumption of symmetry, we demonstrate the asymptotic validity (bootstrap consistency) of the wild bootstrap ADF tests. This is done by establishing that (conditional on the data) the wild bootstrap ADF statistics attain the same limiting distribution as that of the original ADF statistics taken conditional on the magnitude of the innovations.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe; Georgiev, Iliyan] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Taylor, A.

We allow for both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity of a very general form. We establish the conditions required on the penalty functions such that standard information criterion-based methods, such as the Bayesian information criterion [BIC], when employed either sequentially or jointly, can be used to consistently estimate both the cointegration rank and the autoregressive lag order. In doing so we also correct errors which appear in the proofs provided for the consistency of information-based estimators in the homoskedastic case by Aznar and Salvador (2002, Econometric Theory 18, 926-947). We also extend the corpus of available large sample theory for the conventional sequential approach of Johansen (1995, Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models. Oxford University Press) and the associated wild bootstrap implementation thereof of Cavaliere, Rahbek, and Taylor (2014, Econometric Reviews 33, 606-650) to the case where the lag order is unknown. In particular, we show that these methods remain valid under heteroskedasticity and an unknown lag length provided the lag length is first chosen by a consistent method, again such as the BIC. The relative finite sample properties of the different methods discussed are investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation study. The two best performing methods in this study are a wild bootstrap implementation of the Johansen (1995, Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models. Oxford University Press) procedure implemented with BIC selection of the lag length and joint IC approach (cf. Phillips, 1996, Econometrica 64, 763-812) which uses the BIC to jointly select the lag order and the cointegration rank.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe; De Angelis, Luca] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Taylor, A.

Although the Between-subjects Random Incentivized System (BRIS) is increasingly utilized in experimental economics, its use could be contested from a purely theoretical point of view. In the BRIS, all subjects play the Dictator game, but only a percentage of subjects (e.g., 1 out of 10) are paid. The aim of this article is to test whether the results obtained using this system are consistent with those obtained using a conventional full payment system in which every subject receives payment. An additional, hypothetical treatment is also run. Results show a very similar pattern between the BRIS and the full payment treatment, whereas the hypothetical payment mechanism leads to far fewer egoistic players and far more egalitarians.

However, little consensus exists on the extent to which environmental regulation might generate profitability enhancing innovation offsets. This paper reports on a meta-analysis of 103 publications that estimate the relationship between environmental regulation and firm- or country-level productivity or competitiveness. We find considerable heterogeneity in both the sign and significance level of over 2,000 estimated effect sizes in these studies. A positive effect of environmental regulation is more likely at the state, region, or country level, compared to facility, firm, or industry levelalthough in both cases the most likely scenario is statistical insignificance. These findings are consistent with the strong version of the Porter hypothesis whereby strict but flexible environmental regulations induce innovation and over time increase country-level competitiveness.","[Cohen, Mark A.] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cohen, Mark A.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tubb, Adeline] UCL, London, England",Vanderbilt University; Resources for the Future; University of London; University College London,"Cohen, MA (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;Cohen, MA (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Mark.Cohen@owen.vanderbilt.edu,"Cohen, Mark A/H-6449-2011","Cohen, Mark A/0000-0002-1548-2773",Centre for International Governance Innovation and Institute for New Economic Thinking (CIGI-INET Partnership); Owen Graduate School of Management,Centre for International Governance Innovation and Institute for New Economic Thinking (CIGI-INET Partnership); Owen Graduate School of Management,"Mark A.

We postulate that given this new low cost of maintaining lives, there is a moral duty to rescue those who are infected. This obligation creates a financial quasi-liability which for some African countries is comparable to their debt-to-GDP ratios. We construct a model to show that expenditure on prevention can pre-empt some of these liabilities. However, even with optimal prevention the quasi-liability is likely to remain too high to be affordable for a significant number of African countries. Extending the model to two players, we show that if the international community accepts part of the quasi-liability, as it does, it should finance a broadly equal share of prevention and treatment of future infections to mitigate moral hazard and avoid sub-optimal investment in prevention.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Collier, Paul] LSE, Int Growth Ctr, London, England; [Sterck, Olivier] Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.;Collier, P (通讯作者)，LSE, Int Growth Ctr, London, England.",paul.collier@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Sterck, Olivier/0000-0003-3835-9388",Rush Foundation,Rush Foundation,"This work was supported by the Rush Foundation.

Using Hospital Episode Statistics maternity records for the period 2001-2013, a panel data analysis was performed to determine whether the implementation of the programme reduced caesarean sections rates in participating hospitals. The results obtained using either the unadjusted sample of hospitals or a trimmed sample determined by a propensity score matching approach indicate that the impact of the programme was small. More specifically there were 2.3 to 3.4 fewer caesarean deliveries in participating hospitals, on average, during the postprogramme period offering a limited scope for cost reduction. This result mainly comes from the reduction in the number of emergency caesareans as no significant effect was uncovered for planned caesarean deliveries.","[Cookson, Graham; Laliotis, Ioannis] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Laliotis, I (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford, Surrey, England.",i.laliotis@surrey.ac.uk,"Laliotis, Ioannis/AGY-9031-2022; Cookson, Graham/I-2048-2018","Laliotis, Ioannis/0000-0002-8206-044X; Cookson, Graham/0000-0002-2547-7978",Leverhulme Trust [RL-2012-681],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"Leverhulme Trust, Grant/Award Number: RL-2012-681",,45,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,APR,2018,27,4,,,,,675,689,,10.1002/hec.3624,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3624,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7OR,29114977,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428526300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use a novel approach based on a model of occupational choice that delivers a gravity equation linking worker flows to occupation characteristics and transition costs. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles we find that task-specific costs account for no more than 15% of the total transition cost across most occupation pairs. Transition costs vary widely across occupations and, while increasing with the dissimilarity in the mix of tasks performed, are mostly accounted for by task-independent occupation-specific factors. The fraction of transition costs that can be attributed to task-related variables appears fairly stable over the 1994-2013 period.","[Cortes, Guido Matias] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Gallipoli, Giovanni] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Manchester; University of British Columbia,"Cortes, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",matias.cortes@manchester.ac.uk; gallipol@mail.ubc.ca,,"Gallipoli, Giovanni/0000-0002-4441-4964",Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network (CLSRN); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC),Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network (CLSRN); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Financial support from the Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network (CLSRN) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) is gratefully acknowledged.

The WTO Appellate Body's Ruling on Market Distortions and Production Costs in EU-Biodiesel (Argentina),WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,JAPAN,"This paper presents a legal-economic analysis of the Appellate Body's decision in EU-Biodiesel (Argentina) that the WTO's Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) does not permit countries to take into account government-created price distortions of major inputs when calculating anti-dumping duties. In this case, the EU made adjustments to the price of biodiesel's principal input - soybeans - in determining the cost of production of biodiesel in Argentina. The adjustment was made based on the uncontested finding that the price of soybeans in Argentina was distorted by the existence of an export tax scheme that resulted in artificially low soybean prices. The Appellate Body found that the EU was not permitted to take tax policy-induced price distortions into account in calculating dumping margins. We analyze the economic rationale for Argentina's export tax system, distortions in biodiesel markets in Argentina and the EU, and the remaining trade policy options for addressing distorted international prices. We also assess whether existing subsidies disciplines would be more effective in addressing this problem and conclude that they would not.","[Crowley, Meredith A.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England; [Crowley, Meredith A.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Hillman, Jennifer A.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC USA",University of Cambridge; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Georgetown University,"Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.;Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",meredith.crowley@econ.cam.ac.uk; jennifer.hillman@law.georgetown.edu,,"Crowley, Meredith A./0000-0003-2864-4580",,,,,11,11,11,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17,2,,,,,195,213,,10.1017/S1474745617000581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1474745617000581,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430704500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper adds to the literature by investigating the existence of an international bank lending channel activated by QE, focusing on the behaviour of US global banks. In particular, the empirical analysis explores the impact of the Federal Reserves' QE policy on lending by foreign branches of US banks. The findings reveal significant policy-induced liquidity spillovers via foreign lending during the QE policy implementation in the US, suggesting the existence of an international bank lending channel. The channel worked its way through different segments of the credit markets, having asymmetric effects on foreign host countries. Overall, our findings highlight the role of global banks in channelling QE created liquidity across borders, adding pressure to increasing debt levels in foreign countries.","[D'Avino, Carmela] Univ East London, Royal Docks Sch Business & Law, Water Lane, London E15 4LZ, England",University of East London,"D'Avino, C (通讯作者)，Univ East London, Royal Docks Sch Business & Law, Water Lane, London E15 4LZ, England.",C.Davino@uel.ac.uk,,"D'Avino, Carmela/0000-0002-8979-4593",,,,,45,8,10,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In this article, we posit that voters may systematically err when assessing potential changes in policy by underappreciating how new policies lead to new equilibrium behaviour. This biases voters towards policy changes that create direct benefits-welfare would rise if behaviour were held constant-even if those reforms ultimately reduce welfare because people adjust behaviour. Conversely, voters are biased against policies that impose direct costs even if they induce larger indirect benefits. Using a lab experiment, we find that a majority of subjects vote against policies that, while inflicting direct costs, would help them to overcome social dilemmas and thereby increase welfare. Subjects also support policies that, while producing direct benefits, create social dilemmas and ultimately hurt welfare. Both mistakes arise because subjects fail to fully anticipate the equilibrium effects of new policies. More precisely, we establish that subjects systematically underappreciate the extent to which policy changes will affect the behaviour of other people, and that these mistaken beliefs exert a causal effect on the demand for bad policy.","[Dal Bo, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dal Bo, Pedro] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Eyster, Erik] LSE, London, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,ERC,ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Alexander Kiam, Jeongbin Kim, Daniel Prinz, Santiago Truffa and Stephen Yen for excellent research assistance as well as Berkeley's XLab and Brown's BUSSELfor support.

Forecasts may be either unaided or made with the help of statistical forecasts. In practice, the latter are often crude forecasts that do not take sporadic perturbations into account. Most research considers forecasts based on series that have been cleansed of perturbation effects. This paper considers an experiment in which people made forecasts from time series that were disturbed by promotions. In all conditions, under-forecasting occurred during promotional periods and over-forecasting during normal ones. The relative sizes of these effects depended on the proportions of periods in the data series that contained promotions. The statistical forecasts improved the forecasting accuracy, not because they reduced these biases, but because they decreased the random error (scatter). The performance improvement did not depend on whether the forecasts were based on cleansed series. Thus, the effort invested in producing cleansed time series from which to forecast may not be warranted: companies may benefit from giving their forecasters even crude statistical forecasts. In a second experiment, forecasters received optimal statistical forecasts that took the effects of promotions into account fully. This increased the accuracy because the biases were almost eliminated and the random error was reduced by 20%. Thus, the additional effort required to produce forecasts that take promotional effects into account is worthwhile. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We included cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility studies that reported primary costing data, conducted worldwide and published between 1990 and August 2016. We retrieved articles in PubMed, Embase, EconLit, CINAHL plus, and LILACS databases. The quality assessment was performed using two guidelines the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and the Tool to Estimate Patient's Costs. TB diagnosis was reported as cost per positive result or per suspect case. TB treatment was reported as cost of TB drugs, TB/ HIV hospitalization, and treatment. We analyzed the data per level of TB/HIV endemicity and perspective of analysis. Results: We included 34 articles, with 24 addressing TB/HIV treatment and 10 addressing TB diagnosis. Most of the studies were carried out in high TB/HIV burden countries (82%). The cost of TB diagnosis per suspect case varied from $0.5 for sputum smear microscopy to $175 for intensified case finding. The cost of TB/HIV hospitalization was higher in low/medium TB/HIV burden countries than in high TB/HIV burden countries ($75,406 vs. $2,474). TB/HIV co-infection presented higher costs than TB from the provider perspective ($814 vs. $604 vs. $454). Items such as choice of discount rate, patient interview procedures, and methods used for valuing indirect costs did not achieve a good score in the quality assessment. Conclusions: Our findings point to the need of generation of more standardized methods for cost data collection to generate more robust estimates and thus, support decision-making process.","[de Siqueira-Filha, Noemia Teixeira; Legood, Rosa; Santos, Andreia Costa] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Cavalcanti, Aracele] Univ Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE),"de Siqueira-Filha, NT (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",noemia.teixeira-filha@lshtm.ac.uk,"Siqueira, Noemia/AGJ-3205-2022; Legood, Rosa/GQZ-9121-2022","Legood, Rosa/0000-0003-2761-5227",Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Brazilian Institute for Health Technology Assessment,Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian Institute for Health Technology Assessment,N.T.S.-F. was partially supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and the Brazilian Institute for Health Technology Assessment.,,51,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,APR,2018,21,4,,,,,482,490,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.003,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GD3ZR,29680106,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430442800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Does it matter if the Member uses standards developed by an international body as the criterion for deciding whether to impose measures? In Argentina-Financial Services, the WTO Appellate Body held that services from jurisdictions that share financial tax information may be different from services provided by jurisdictions that do not cooperate in supplying such information. It overruled a Panel finding that measures to increase taxes on financial transactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions were discriminatory. We argue that the AB reached the right conclusion on the basis of the wrong arguments; that it missed an important opportunity to clarify what WTO Members are permitted to do to enforce their domestic regulatory regimes; and increased the scope for confusion and future litigation by considering that the likeness of services and service suppliers may be a function of prevailing domestic regulatory regimes.","[Delimatsis, Panagiotis] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Hoekman, Bernard] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, FI, Italy; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, London, England",Tilburg University; European University Institute; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Delimatsis, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands.",p.delimatsis@uvt.nl; bernard.hoekman@eui.eu,"Delimatsis, Panagiotis/JNS-9156-2023","Delimatsis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-4121-1555; Hoekman, Bernard/0000-0002-6839-7142",,,,,30,6,6,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17,2,,,,,265,290,,10.1017/S1474745617000635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1474745617000635,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430704500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

An information shock is defined in this paper as a random variable that contains the set of information made available between two consecutive forecasting exercises and that has been incorporated into a revised forecast for a fixed point event. Studying the moments of these information shocks can be useful in understanding how the Bank has changed its assessment of risks surrounding inflation in the light of new information, and how it has modified its forecasts accordingly. The variance of the information shock is interpreted in this paper as a new measure of ex ante inflation uncertainty that measures the uncertainty that the Bank anticipates information perceived in a particular quarter will pose on inflation. A measure of information absorption that indicates the approximate proportion of the information content in a revised forecast that is attributable to information made available since the last forecast release is also proposed.","[Diaz, Carlos] Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Díaz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",cdv7@leicester.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Analogous to the previous literature we find that firms' emission intensities can be U-shaped in the strictness of policy, but we show that this applies only under low profitability conditions. Under high profitability conditions, output levels are U-shaped in the strictness of the policy. The latter result is new in the literature.

Using a sample of 39 African former European colonies for 2006-11, this paper investigates the extent to which the historical institutional determinants identified by legal origins, disease endowment, religion-based and ethnic fractionalisation theories explain current differences in financial system development across Africa. While most existing research focuses only on one financial system development dimension, namely financial system depth, this article considers also financial system access. The results do not support any of the above theories when depth measures are used, while three of them (legal origins, disease endowment and ethnic fractionalisation theories) are validated when using access measures. This suggests that in Africa financial system depth and access do not have common historical institutional determinants, pointing to the need for greater fine tuning of prevalent theories and empirical measures.","[Emenalo, Chukwunonye O.] Pan Atlantic Univ, Lagos Business Sch, Lagos, Nigeria; [Gagliardi, Francesca; Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Emenalo, CO (通讯作者)，Pan Atlantic Univ, Lagos Business Sch, Lagos, Nigeria.",cemenalo@lbs.edu.ng; f.gagliardi@herts.ac.uk; g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021; Gagliardi, Francesca/KCK-6190-2024","Gagliardi, Francesca/0000-0003-3240-2760",,,,,68,16,16,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Boston Scientific (manufacturer) submitted a case for the adoption of the technology, claiming that it has a longer battery life resulting in a longer time to CRT-D replacement. Other claimed benefits were fewer complications associated with replacement procedures, fewer hospital admissions, less time spent in hospital and reduced demand on cardiology device implantation rooms. The submission was critiqued by Cedar, an external assessment centre. The submitted clinical evidence showed that ENDURALIFE-powered devices implanted during the period 2008-2010 were superior, in terms of longevity, to other devices at that time. Submitted economic evidence indicated that, because of a reduction in the need for replacement procedures, ENDURALIFE-powered devices were cost saving when compared to comparator devices. Cedar highlighted uncertainty of the applicability of the clinical evidence to devices marketed today. The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee noted that this was unavoidable due to the follow-up time required to study battery life. Clinical experts noted that increased battery life is an important patient benefit. However, centres use devices from multiple manufacturers to negate pressure on clinical services in the event of a major device recall. The clinical and economic evidence showed benefits to the patient, and further analysis requested by the committee suggested that ENDURALIFE-powered CRT-Ds may save between A 2120 pound and A 5627 pound per patient over 15 years through a reduction in the need for replacement procedures. ENDURALIFE-powered CRT-D devices received a positive recommendation in Medical Technologies Guidance 33.","[Evans, James Michael; Morgan, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Cleves, Andrew; Carolan-Rees, Grace] Cedar Healthcare Technol Res Ctr, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Millar, Liesl] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England",Cardiff University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Evans, JM (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",james.evans2@wales.nhs.uk,,"Gildea, Liesl/0000-0001-7249-102X; Morgan, Helen E/0000-0003-2470-9746",,,,,31,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

In 2010, 8 London Trusts were converted into Hyper Acute Stroke Units. The intention was to discontinue acute stroke services in 22 London hospitals. However, in reality, provision of services declined only gradually, and 2years later, 15% of all patients were still treated in Trusts without a Hyper Acute Stroke Unit. This study evaluates the impact of centralising London's stroke care on 7 process and outcome indicators using a difference-in-difference analysis with two treatment groups, Hyper Acute and discontinued London Trusts, and data on all stroke patients recorded in the hospital episode statistics database from April 2006 to April 2014. The policy resulted in improved thrombolysis treatment and lower rates of pneumonia in acute units.

In a one-step ML estimation approach, we estimate a class membership model and a behavioral model of the classes jointly. Adopting this approach enables us to simultaneously assess how socio-demographic characteristics affect class membership probabilities and estimate class-specific regression coefficients, to test whether psychological characteristics predict savings behavior differently across latent classes. We apply this approach to a representative sample of UK households (n =3382) and identify two different latent classes: striving versus established households. We find that the relationship between psychological characteristics and savings behavior differs across these two classes, demonstrating the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity when studying the drivers of savings behavior. Our results have implications for policymakers attempting to improve household savings behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent technological developments have led to an increased interest in the discourse on human-robot interactions, as robots equipped with artificial intelligence are expected to take a more prominent role in society. This article links insights from psychology and consumer behavior with recent developments in human-robot interactions. In doing so, the article first argues that humanoid robots will have a vast impact on society, specifically on the healthcare, educational and relationship sectors. The article also presents specific implications for retailers and marketers. Moreover, the article outlines examples on how human-robot interactions in the aforementioned sectors may be shaped once humanoid robots with artificial intelligence develop human like self-awareness. Finally, the article offers a viewpoint on how self-aware humanoid robots may even become active members of society that use brands as a means of self-expression; thus, suggesting that the notion of the consumer should be extended from humans to include self aware humanoid robots.","[Gonzalez-Jimenez, Hector] Univ York, York Management Sch, Freboys Lane, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Gonzalez-Jimenez, H (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Management Sch, Freboys Lane, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England.",hgj503@york.ac.uk,"Gonzalez-Jimenez, Hector/ABG-9816-2020","Gonzalez-Jimenez, Hector/0000-0002-3805-8262",,,,,80,22,23,8,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,APR,2018,98,,,,,,49,56,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.004,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GD8TL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430784900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, public involvement in designing and conducting health economics research is seldom reported. Here we describe the development, delivery and assessment of an approach for involving people in a clearly defined piece of health economics research: selecting health states for valuation in estimating quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). This involvement formed part of a study to develop a conditionspecific preference-based measure of health-related quality of life, the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-8D), and the work reported here relates to the identification of plausible, or realistic, health states for valuation. An Expert Panel of three people with multiple sclerosis (MS) was recruited from a local involvement network, and two health economists designed an interactive task that enabled the Panel to identify health states that were implausible, or unlikely to be experienced. Following some initial confusion over terminology, which was resolved by discussion with the Panel, the task worked well and can be adapted to select health states for valuation in the development of any preference-based measure. As part of the involvement process, five themes were identified by the Panel members and the researchers which summarised our experiences of public involvement in this health economics research example: proportionality, task design, prior involvement, protectiveness and partnerships. These are described in the paper, along with their practical implications for involving members of the public in health economics research. Our experience demonstrates how members of the public and health economists can work together to improve the validity of health economics research. Plain Language Summary It has become commonplace to involve members of the public in health service research. However, published reports of involving people in designing health economics research are rare. We describe how we designed a way of involving people in a particular piece of health economics research. The aim of the work was to produce descriptions of different states of health experienced by people with multiple sclerosis (MS). These descriptions have since been rated in terms of how good or bad they are in a way that can be used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to make decisions about what services to fund on the NHS. We formed a panel of three people with MS, and designed a task to help the group produce health descriptions likely to be experienced by people with MS. After discussion about jargon, and working together to find more layman's terms, the task worked well, and can be adapted to produce health descriptions for any condition. We identified some key themes about working together that give insights into how members of the public can be involved in health economics research, and show the importance of their involvement in improving the relevance of this research.","[Goodwin, Elizabeth; Hawton, Annie] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Hlth Econ Grp, St Lukes Campus,Magdalen Rd, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England; [Boddy, Kate; Hawton, Annie] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula PenCLAHRC, Exeter, Devon, England; [Tatnell, Lynn] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Patient & Publ Involvement Grp PenPIG, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Hawton, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Hlth Econ Grp, St Lukes Campus,Magdalen Rd, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England.;Hawton, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Med, NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula PenCLAHRC, Exeter, Devon, England.",a.hawton@exeter.ac.uk,,"Hawton, Annemarie/0000-0002-1336-5899; Goodwin, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1351-9170; Boddy, Kate/0000-0001-9135-5488",MS Society; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula,MS Society; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula,"This research was funded by the MS Society and supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula.

VFI fails to accurately identify both the location and size of jump discontinuities, while the endogenous grid method (EGM) and the finite element method (FEM) are much better at approximating this class of models. We further show that combining VFI with a local interpolation step (VFI-INT) is sufficient to obtain accurate approximations. The combination of computational speed, relatively easy implementation and adaptability make VFI-INT especially suitable for approximating models with jump discontinuities in policy functions: while EGM is the fastest method, it is relatively complex to implement; implementation of VFI-INT is relatively straightforward and it is much faster than FEM.","[Gortz, Christoph; Mirza, Afrasiab] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Görtz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",c.g.gortz@bham.ac.uk; a.mirza@bham.ac.uk,,,British Academy,British Academy,"We thank Francesco Zanetti and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments, which significantly improved the paper.

Using the central idea of Akerlors 'social distance' theory, individual distance is calculated from their own group mean consumption and then we examine whether individuals from different social groups - caste and religion-are alienated across the distance distribution. Using India's household-level micro data on consumption expenditure covering three major survey rounds since the inception of the reform period, we find a non-unique pattern where the marginalised and minority group households tend to be alienated across the distance distribution. However, among them, the households with higher educational attainment become more integrated as reflected in the interaction effect of education. These results are robust even after controlling for the endogeneity of education. Given this significant group difference in consumption, we undertake a group-level comparison by creating a counterfactual group through exchanging the characteristics of the privileged group to the marginalised group (or Hindus to non Hindus), and find that the privileged group still consumes more than the counterfactual marginalised group, explaining around 77% of the estimated average consumption gap at the median quantile in 2011-12 (or 59% for Hindus versus Non-Hindus). This suggests other inherent identity-specific social factors as possible contributors to within-group alienation (relative to a better-off category) that can only be minimised through promoting education for the marginalised (or minority religion) group.

Does the uneven distribution mean that not everyone benefits from new technologies to the same extent, or do some people experience an absolute disadvantage during this process? I explore this question through the case study of curative healthcare access in the context of rapid mobile phone uptake in rural India, contributing thus to an important yet surprisingly under -researched aspect of the social implications of (mobile) technology diffusion. Inspired by a previous analysis of cross-sectional data from rural India, I hypothesise that health systems increasingly adapt to mobile phone users where phones have diffused widely. This adaptation will leave poor non-adopters worse off than before and increases healthcare inequities. I use a panel of 12,003 rural households with an illness in 2005 and 2012 from the Indian Human Development Survey to test this hypothesis. Based on village-cluster, robust fixed-effects linear probability models, I find that (a) mobile phone diffusion is significantly and negatively linked to various forms of rural healthcare access, suggesting that health systems increasingly adapt to phone use and discriminate against non-users; that (b) poor rural households without mobile phones experience more adverse effects compared to more affluent households, which indicates a struggle and competition for healthcare access among marginalised groups; and that (c) no effects emerge for access to public doctors, which implies that some healthcare providers are less responsive to mobile phone use than others. Overall, my findings indicate that the rural Indian healthcare system gradually adapts to increasing mobile phone use at the expense of non-users. I conclude that rapid mobile phone diffusion creates an opportunity to improve people's access to healthcare in rural India, but it also creates new forms of marginalisation among poor rural households.

During the early years of the emerging combinatorial chemistry industry, the industry on which our empirical analysis focuses, spin-offs engaged in alliances with large and established partners, partners of similar type and size, and with public research organizations, often for different reasons. We seek to understand to what extent alliances of spin-offs with other firms (either large- or small- and medium-sized firms) affected their innovation performance and also how this performance may have been affected by their corporate or public research background. We find evidence that in general alliances of spin-offs with other firms, in particular alliances with large firms, increased their innovation performance. Corporate spin-offs that formed alliances with other firms outperformed public research spin-offs with such alliances. This suggests that, in terms of their innovation performance, corporate spin-offs that engaged in alliances with other firms seemed to have benefitted from their prior corporate background. Interestingly, it turns out that the negative impact of alliances on the innovation performance of public research spin-offs was largely affected by their alliances with small- and medium-sized firms.","[Hagedoorn, John] Royal Holloway Univ London, Egham, Surrey, England; [Hagedoorn, John] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Lokshin, Boris] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Malo, Stephane] Amer Univ Paris, Paris, France; [Malo, Stephane] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; The American University of Paris,"Hagedoorn, J (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Egham, Surrey, England.",John.Hagedoorn@rhul.ac.uk; b.lokshin@maastrichtuniversity.nl; smalo@aup.edu,"Hagedoorn, John/HNR-3048-2023","Lokshin, Boris/0000-0002-6524-6621; Hagedoorn, John/0000-0002-0751-5344",,,,,120,16,18,4,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This hierarchy of institutions has been observed in macroeconomic policy, where it has long been understood that there are political incentives for economic mismanagement, namely the creation of inflation. But are there longer-term effects of currency manipulation on the rule of law in a country? That is, does the hierarchy not always hold? This paper answers this question by focusing on a specific case of monetary instability, the newly-independent Second Polish Republic of 1918 to 1939. Using appropriate econometric techniques on a new database of historical data, I find that monetary profligacy correlates strongly with significantly lower levels of the rule of law. This result is robust to several tests and most specifications, including the use of a new variable for measuring access to the political system. The results suggest that monetary instability is a threat to political institutions in its own right, eroding the rule of law in addition to creating macroeconomic difficulties. (C) 2018 The Author.

It also looks at what individual and household characteristics may have moved these children into or out of situations of nutritional deprivation and how their stunting profile in later childhood correlates with psychosocial outcomes at age 19 and how it may have intergenerational consequences. The paper uses 4 rounds of longitudinal data collected in 2002, 2006, 2009 and 2013 from Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, India when the children were aged 8, 12, 15 and 19. The paper finds that there are significant gender based biases in growth faltering later in childhood disfavouring girls and that becoming newly stunted as an adolescent is strongly correlated with a child reporting to have poorer relationships with peers compared to the group that were never stunted. We also find that a girl experiencing stunting in middle childhood or adolescence (even if they were not stunted at age 8 or eventually moved out of being stunted by age 19) correlates significantly with offspring being shorter and thinner than the offspring of girls never stunted. This is one of few, if any, studies that look at growth patterns in middle childhood and adolescence and outcomes as a young adult and the results are important for their implications for further research and policy.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and Centre for Health Economics (CHE) Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the Company's submission, the ERG's critical review of submitted evidence, and the resulting NICE guidance. The main supporting clinical evidence was derived from four well conducted, randomised controlled trials, comparing ustekinumab with placebo in two sub-populations (conventional care failure and anti-TNF alpha failure patients) of adults with moderate-to-severe CD. Three trials assessed treatment induction over 8 weeks, while the fourth recruited successfully induced patients into a maintenance trial for 1 year. These trials showed ustekinumab to be more effective than placebo in terms of its ability to induce and maintain clinical response and remission. In the absence of any direct head-to-head data, the Company conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA), which synthesised induction trial data on ustekinumab and relevant comparators (vedolizumab, adalimumab and infliximab) using placebo data as a common comparator. This analysis found ustekinumab to be of comparable efficacy to previously approved biologics in treatment induction. A 'treatment sequence analysis' compared long-term treatment efficacy, finding ustekinumab to be comparable in maintaining treatment response and remission to the three other biologic therapies. However, the ERG had identified many limitations and potential bias in this analysis, and urged caution when interpreting the results. The Company's economic model estimated ustekinumab to be dominant in both sub-populations compared with conventional care; however, the ERG's preferred base-case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 109,279 pound in the conventional care failure sub-population, and A 110,967 pound in the anti-TNF alpha failure sub-population when compared with conventional care. However, the ERG identified significant failings in both the model structure and data inputs, which could not be addressed without complete restructuring. The ERG considered that the economic analysis presented by the Company failed to adequately address the decision problem specified in NICE's scope. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended ustekinumab within its market authorisation, on the grounds of sufficiently similar efficacy and costs to previously recommended biologic therapies. However, the ERG's analyses demonstrated that all currently recommended biologics are unlikely to be cost effective relative to conventional care, raising broader questions regarding the appropriateness of cost-comparison exercises for decision making.","[Hodgson, Robert; Walton, Matthew; Biswas, Mousumi; Mebrahtu, Teumzghi; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Walton, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",matthew.walton@york.ac.uk,"Biswas, Dr. Mousumi/IUM-9021-2023; Walton, Matthew/AAB-4192-2019","Walton, Matthew/0000-0003-1932-3689; Mebrahtu, Teumzghi Fisseha/0000-0003-4821-2304; Biswas, Mousumi/0000-0001-6781-7400; Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/10/12],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 16/10/12).

To understand these differences, I present a stylized model of how a dictator responds to mass protests for democratization in a polarized country with two ethnic or religious groups. In this model, the dictator's response crucially depends on oil revenues and his affiliation to either the majority or the minority group. I document that the model's predictions are consistent with the observed differences in the Arab dictators' responses. Hence, ethnic politics and religious divides may play an important role in political transitions and regime changes.

Lessons from the UK to support improved policy outcomes,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy; Environment; Scenarios; Policy; UK,TRANSITION PATHWAYS; PERSPECTIVE; NEXUS; INSIGHTS; FUTURES,"Scenario development is widely used to support the formation of energy policy, but many energy scenarios consider environmental interactions only in terms of climate change. We suggest that efforts to develop more holistic energy pathways, going beyond post hoc analysis of environmental and social implications, can usefully draw on environmental scenarios. A detailed content analysis of UK energy and environmental scenarios was therefore undertaken, with energy scenarios selected on the basis that they were recent, had a direct link to energy policy, and covered a range of scenario types. The energy scenarios rarely considered societal drivers beyond decarbonisation and focused on quantifiable parameters such as GDP, while the environmental scenarios provided a richer narrative on human behaviour and social change. As socio-economic issues remain fundamental to the success of energy policies, this is a key area which should be better addressed within energy scenarios. The environmental impacts of energy scenarios were rarely considered, but could have a significant bearing on the likelihood of pathway outcomes being realised. Fuller evaluation of the environmental interactions of energy systems is therefore required. Although the analysis focuses on the UK, some international scenarios show similar limitations, suggesting that the conclusions are more widely applicable.","[Hooper, Tara; Austen, Melanie C.; Beaumont, Nicola] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Hooper, Tara; Austen, Melanie C.; Beaumont, Nicola; Heptonstall, Philip; Holland, Robert A.; Ketsopoulou, Ioanna; Taylor, Gail; Watson, Jim; Winskel, Mark] UK Energy Res Ctr, 58 Princes Gate, London SW7 2PG, England; [Heptonstall, Philip] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Holland, Robert A.; Taylor, Gail] Univ Southampton, Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg B85,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Winskel, Mark] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH1 1LZ, Midlothian, Scotland",Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Imperial College London; University of Southampton; University of Edinburgh,"Hooper, T (通讯作者)，Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.;Hooper, T (通讯作者)，UK Energy Res Ctr, 58 Princes Gate, London SW7 2PG, England.",tarh@pml.ac.uk,"Austen, Melanie C/GLU-1418-2022; Beaumont, Nicola/AAS-2780-2020; Holland, Robert/C-1928-2012; Taylor, Gail/C-6030-2013","Austen, Melanie C/0000-0001-8133-0498; Holland, Robert/0000-0002-3038-9227; TAYLOR, GAIL/0000-0001-8470-6390; Watson, Jim/0000-0001-8464-1718; Heptonstall, Philip/0000-0001-8411-6673; Beaumont, Nicola/0000-0002-5976-9661","Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1]; NERC [NE/M019640/1]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1, EP/M013200/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/M019640/1, NE/M019764/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1, EP/M013200/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M019764/1, NE/M019640/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research formed part of the programme of the UK Energy Research Centre and was supported by the Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award EP/L024756/1, with additional support from the NERC-funded ADdressing Valuation of Energy and Nature Together (ADVENT, NE/M019640/1).",,73,16,17,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115,,,,,,397,408,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.028,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428099800039,View Full Record in Web of Science

Demand Side Management in Nigeria,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Demand Side Management; Electricity; Industrialisation; Nigeria,ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ENERGY; CAUSALITY; BENEFITS; SYSTEMS; SECTOR; COSTS; PANEL,Electricity is essential for economic development and industrialisation processes. Balancing demand and supply is a recurrent problem in the Nigerian electricity market. The aim of this work is to assess the technical and economic potential of Demand Side Management (DSM) in Nigeria given different future levels of industrialisation. The paper places industrialisation at the centrefold of the appraisal of DSM potential in Nigeria. It does so by designing industrialisation scenarios and consequently deriving different DSM penetration levels using a cost-optimisation model. Findings show that under the high industrialisation scenario by the year 2050 DSM could bring about 7 billion USD in cumulative savings thanks to deferred investment in new generation and full deployment of standby assets along with interruptible programmes for larger industrial users. The paper concludes by providing policy recommendations regarding financial mechanisms to increase DSM deployment in Nigeria. The focus on DSM serves to shift the policy debate on electricity in Nigeria from a static state versus market narrative on supply to an engagement with the agency and influence on industrial end-users.,"[Ikpe, Eka] Kings Coll London, African Leadership Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Torriti, Jacopo] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AY, Berks, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Reading,"Torriti, J (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AY, Berks, England.",j.torriti@reading.ac.uk,,"Torriti, Jacopo/0000-0003-0569-039X; Ikpe, Eka/0000-0002-4859-3592",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/P000630/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/P000630/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/P000630/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant number EP/P000630/1).,,58,18,18,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115,,,,,,207,215,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.011,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428099800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, I apply a very simple model of global energy use to specify the dynamic characteristics of global-scale Energy Returns On Investment (EROIG). This suggests that the observed long-run relative growth rate of similar to 2.5% yr(-1) in global primary energy use is associated with an equilibrium return from infrastructure investments of 2:1, with returns accruing with a time constant of 40 years. The analysis also attempts to show how growth leads to reductions in the supply efficiency of energy, and how this decline is offset by increases in the efficiency with which industrial society can extract useful work from primary energy flows. This observed preservation of the overall energy efficiency of the global energy system implicates variations in the decay/decommissioning rate of infrastructure in observed 'long-wave' like variations in the relative growth rate of global primary energy use, and hence EROIG.","[Jarvis, Andrew] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Jarvis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England.",a.jarvis@lancs.ac.uk,,"Jarvis, Andrew James/0000-0002-0700-0295",,,,,36,7,10,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Thus, agricultural interventions may fail to improve nutritional outcomes if they do not take account of time constraints, particularly of rural women who spend a considerable portion of their time in agriculture. Given the potential trade-offs pertaining to time in productive vs. reproductive activities and its implications for maternal and child nutrition, the goal of this review is to systematically map and assess the available evidence, both qualitative and quantitative studies, agriculture-time use-nutrition pathway. Through an analysis of 89 studies, identified through a systematic search, on rural areas of low and middle income countries, we observe three findings. First, women play a key role in agriculture, as reflected in their time commitments. Second, evidence from a very limited set of studies suggests that agricultural interventions tend to increase time commitments in agriculture of the household members for whom impact is measured. Third, while changing time use tends to change nutritional outcomes, it does so in a range of complex ways and there is no agreement on the impact. Nutritional impacts are varied because households and household members respond to increased time burden and workload in different ways.","[Johnston, Deborah; Hull, Elizabeth] SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Stevano, Sara] Univ West England UWE Bristol, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Malapit, Hazel J.] IFPRI, WEAI, CGIAR Res Program Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Kadiyala, Suneetha] LSHTM, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of West England; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Johnston, D (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",Dj3@soas.ac.uk; Sara.Stevano@uwe.ac.uk; H.Malapit@cgiar.org; e.hull@soas.ac.uk; Suneetha.Kadiyala@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Hull, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1981-3533; Kadiyala, Suneetha/0000-0002-9101-1471; Johnston, Deborah/0000-0003-0065-1105",Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH),Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH),"Funding for this research came from Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and from the UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH).

Whether a classical or a Bayesian approach is adopted, most VAR models are linear with Gaussian innovations. This can limit the model's ability to explain the relationships in macroeconomic series. We propose a nonparametric VAR model that allows for nonlinearity in the conditional mean, heteroscedasticity in the conditional variance, and non-Gaussian innovations. Our approach differs from that of previous studies by modelling the stationary and transition densities using Bayesian nonparametric methods. Our Bayesian nonparametric VAR (BayesNP-VAR) model is applied to US and UK macroeconomic time series, and compared to other Bayesian VAR models. We show that BayesNP-VAR is a flexible model that is able to account for nonlinear relationships as well as heteroscedasticity in the data. In terms of short-run out-of-sample forecasts, we show that BayesNP-VAR predictively outperforms competing models. (C) 2018 The Authors.

We derive sufficient-statistics formulae capturing the marginal insurance value and incentive costs of unemployment-benefits paid at different times during a spell. Our approach allows us to revisit separate arguments for inclining or declining profiles put forward in the theoretical literature and to identify welfare-improving-changes in the benefit profile that account for all relevant arguments jointly: For the empirical implementation, we use administrative data on unemployment, linked to data on consumption, income, and wealth in Sweden. First, we exploit duration-dependent kinks in the replacement rate and find that, if anything, the moral hazard cost of benefits is larger when paid earlier the spell. Second, we find that the drop in consumption affecting the insurance value of benefits is large from the start of the spell, hut further increases throughout tie spell. In trading off insurance and incentives, our analysis suggests that the flat benefit profile in Sweden has been too generous overall. However, both from the insurance and the incentives side, we find no evidence to support the introduction of a declining tilt in the profile.","[Kolsrud, Jonas] Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, SE-10362 Stockholm, Sweden; [Landais, Camille; Spinnewijn, Johannes] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC21 2AE, England; [Nilsson, Peter] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Stockholm University,"Kolsrud, J (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, SE-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",jonas@kolsrud.se; c.landais@lse.ac.uk; peter.nilsson@ites.su.se; j.spinnewijn@lse.ac.uk,"Spinnewijn, Johannes/AAR-7532-2020",,ERC [716485]; FORTE [2015-00663]; Sloan foundation (NBER grant) [22-2382-15-1-33-003]; STICERD; CEP; Forte [2015-00663] Funding Source: Forte; Formas [2015-00663] Funding Source: Formas; European Research Council (ERC) [716485] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); FORTE(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Sloan foundation (NBER grant); STICERD; CEP; Forte(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Tony Atkinson, Richard Blundell, Raj Chetty, Liran Einav, Hugo Hopenhayn, Philipp Kircher, Henrik Kleven, Alan Manning, Arash Nekoei, Nicola Pavoni, Torsten Persson, Jean-Marc Robin, Emmanuel Saez, Florian Scheuer, Robert Shimer, Frans Spinnewyn, Ivan Werning, Gabriel Zucman, and seminar participants at the NBER PF Spring Meeting, SED Warsaw, EEA Mannheim, DIW Berlin, Kiel, Zurich, Helsinki, Stanford, Leuven, Uppsala, IIES, Yale, IFS, Wharton, Sciences Po, UCLA, Sussex, Berkeley, MIT, Columbia, LMU, and LSE for helpful discussions and suggestions.

The Child Health Utility Index-9 Dimension (CHU-9D), however, is a preference-based instrument that has been primarily developed to support cost-utility analysis. Objective This paper presents a method for estimating CHU-9D index scores from responses to the PedsQL (TM) using data from a randomised controlled trial of prednisolone therapy for treatment of childhood corticosteroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Methods HRQoL data were collected from children at randomisation, week 16, and months 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48. Observations on children aged 5 years and older were pooled across all data collection timepoints and were then randomised into an estimation (n = 279) and validation (n = 284) sample. A number of models were developed using the estimation data before internal validation. The best model was chosen using multi-stage selection criteria. Results Most of the models developed accurately predicted the CHU-9D mean index score. The best performing model was a generalised linear model (mean absolute error = 0.0408; mean square error = 0.0035). The proportion of index scores deviating from the observed scores by < 0.03 was 53%. Conclusions The mapping algorithm provides an empirical tool for estimating CHU-9D index scores and for conducting cost-utility analyses within clinical studies that have only collected PedsQL (TM) data. It is valid for children aged 5 years or older. Caution should be exercised when using this with children younger than 5 years, older adolescents (> 13 years) or patient groups with particularly poor quality of life.","[Lambe, Tosin; Frew, Emma] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Webb, Nicholas J.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is effective for the reversal of heroin overdose in emergency situations and can be used by nonmedical responders. Objective: Our aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to adults at risk of heroin overdose for use by nonmedical responders compared with no naloxone distribution in a European healthcare setting (United Kingdom). Methods: A Markov model with an integrated decision tree was developed based on an existing model, using UK data where available. We evaluated an intramuscular naloxone distribution reaching 30% of heroin users. Costs and effects were evaluated over a lifetime and discounted at 3.5%. The results were assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The model estimated that distribution of intramuscular naloxone, would decrease overdose deaths by around 6.6%. In a population of 200,000 heroin users this equates to the prevention of 2,500 premature deaths at an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of 899. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusions: Our evaluation suggests that the distribution of take-home naloxone decreased overdose deaths by around 6.6% and was cost-effective with an incremental cost per QALY gained well below a 20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold set by UK decision-makers. The model code has been made available to aid future research. Further study is warranted on the impact of different formulations of naloxone on cost-effectiveness and the impact takehome naloxone has on the wider society.","[Langham, Sue; Wright, Antony] Maverex Ltd, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kenworthy, James; Dunlop, William C.

Economics has in general emphasised prices. This theoretical bias results from the axiomatic-deductive methodology centring on equilibrium. Without equilibrium, quantity constraints are more important than prices in determining market outcomes. In disequilibrium, interest rates should be far less useful as policy variable, and economics should be more concerned with quantities (including resource constraints). To investigate, we test the received belief that lower interest rates result in higher growth and higher rates result in lower growth. Examining the relationship between 3-month and 10-year benchmark rates and nominal GDP growth over half a century in four of the five largest economies we find that interest rates follow GDP growth and are consistently positively correlated with growth. If policy-makers really aimed at setting rates consistent with a recovery, they would need to raise them. We conclude that conventional monetary policy as operated by central banks for the past half-century is fundamentally flawed. Policy-makers had better focus on the quantity variables that cause growth.","[Lee, Kang-Soek; Werner, Richard A.] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Southampton, Hants, England; [Werner, Richard A.] Univ Oxford, Linacre Coll, Oxford, England; [Lee, Kang-Soek] Chamber Commerce & Ind Paris IDF, Novancia Business Sch, Paris, France",Solent University; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Werner, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Southampton, Hants, England.;Werner, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Linacre Coll, Oxford, England.",richard.werner@linacre.ox.ac.uk,,"LEE, Kang-Soek/0000-0001-9753-8883",,,,,80,28,34,4,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We use a unique German survey and consider direct measures of social networks in order to explore their role in election forecasting.

Yet the democratic promise of political decentralization should be evaluated in light of its potential undermining effects upon the essential mechanism to make accountability work: citizens' capacity to assign responsibility for policy outcomes. People may get it wrong when assigning responsibility because they are not sure who is responsible for policy outcomes when powers are vertically fragmented between different levels of government and/or simply because their responsibility judgements are biased by political beliefs, which act as lenses through which attribution is filtered. How can we then make electoral accountability work in decentralized systems? This paper will explore this question by delving into the most important theoretical and empirical challenges in the study of attribution of responsibility and electoral accountability in decentralized contexts. At the theoretical level, there is still need of a better understanding of the relationship between federal institutional conditions and individuals' use of cognitive bias to cope with institutional complexity when assigning responsibility. The empirical challenge is to overcome the lack of comparable individual-level data on responsibility attribution for a broad range of country cases.

Interestingly, China's aid shows a positive effect on its total volume of trade and imports from Africa, while the aid from the US exhibits little impact on the US-Africa total trade and its imports from Africa.

Objectives: To analyze data from the Comparison of Acute Treatments in Cancer Hemostasis (CATCH) trial to describe the impact of rVTE and bleeding events on health-related quality of life. Methods: The three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) data were collected monthly for up to 7 months in patients starting anticoagulation for newly diagnosed VTE. Analyses were designed to describe the impact of rVTE and bleeding on EQ-5D scores while controlling for effects of covariates such as background and clinical variables and longitudinal changes. A repeated-measures model with specification of the variance-covariance matrix to characterize the intrapatient correlation was used to estimate the utility values. The impact of an rVTE or a bleeding event was assumed to be reflected in the utility value when it occurred within 2 weeks from a planned data collection point. Results: Data were available from 883 patients. A total of 76 rVTE and 159 bleeding events occurred during follow-up. rVTE had a significant impact on EQ-5D scores, with a decrement of 0.075 on the basis of our reference case (male, no metastasis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score = 1, Western European), but different patients might have different decrements. Bleeding events had a smaller (nonstatistically significant) impact on EQ-5D scores. Conclusions: This data set study has quantified the decline in EQ-5D scores associated with experiencing rVTE or bleeding events in cancer patients. These results indicate the net gain in quality of life and impact on costeffectiveness of secondary VTE prevention.","[Lloyd, Andrew J.] Acaster Lloyd Consulting Ltd, 3 Kings Meadow, Oxford OX2 0DP, England; [Dewilde, Sarah] Serv Hlth Econ, Brussels, Belgium; [Noble, Simon] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Reimer, Elisabeth] Leo Pharma AS, Ballerup, Denmark; [Lee, Agnes Y.

Results indicate that promotions to management are accompanied by an increase in job satisfaction for men but not for women, and that the differing effect lasts beyond the promotion year. Moreover, following promotion, the job satisfaction of women promoted to higher-level management even starts declining. The type of promotion (internal or lateral) does not modify this effect. By clarifying the relationship between gender, promotion to managerial position and job satisfaction, the study contributes to the literature on the gender gap in managerial representation.","[Lup, Daniela] Middlesex Univ, Sociol, London, England",Middlesex University,"Lup, D (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England.",d.lup@mdx.ac.uk,"Lup, Daniela/IAP-6312-2023",,,,,,62,14,21,2,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To explain this behavior, we develop a novel model featuring direct competition between heterogeneous firms to hire workers. This simultaneously endogenizes both average match productivity and the division of output between workers and firms. In existing matches, wages partly reflect labor market conditions at the time of hiring. A positive TFP shock therefore reduces the aggregate labor share, making it counter-cyclical. However, greater competition and lower unemployment increase labor's share among new firms. As more firms enter, the aggregate labor share rises and eventually overshoots its initial level, as in the data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the empirical impact of trade openness on the short-run underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) using city-level data. Particularly, we argue that urban economic openness (UEO) has a significant impact on the productivity and on prices of both direct and indirect real estate due to productivity gains of companies in more open areas. This in turn positively affects the firm's profitability, enhancing the confidence in local real estate markets and future company performance, hence decreasing the uncertainty of the IPO valuation. As a result, issuers have less incentive to underprice IPO shares. We use a sample of Chinese real estate IPOs, which offer a suitable laboratory thanks to their strong geographic investment patterns focused locally and a country with a highly heterogeneous openness across regions. Controlling for traditional firm- and issuing-specific characteristics of IPOs that are used for developed markets and Chinese-related features (i.e. listing location and state ownership), we find the evidence that companies investing in economically more open areas experience less IPO underpricing. Our results show great explanatory power and are robust to different specifications.","[Marcato, Gianluca; Milcheva, Stanimira; Zheng, Chen] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Zheng, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading, Berks, England.",g.marcato@henley.reading.ac.uk; s.milcheva@henley.reading.ac.uk; c.zheng@pgr.reading.ac.uk,"Zheng, Chen/JNS-6116-2023","Zheng, Chen/0000-0002-3480-0167; Milcheva, Stanimira/0000-0002-7051-773X; Marcato, Gianluca/0000-0002-6266-4676",,,,,47,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Three challenges are considered: the use of additive models, a lack of connection between criteria scales and weights, and the use of MCDA in economic evaluation.

However, it is the first to possess all three of these attributes simultaneously. For this reason, the Bristol Pound has been heralded by some as marking a new era for local currency-driven localisation. To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g. support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC. We therefore suggest that those pursuing localisation should engage in a more active agenda that aims to change government policy and institutions to support an equitable, sustainable economy.","[Marshall, Adam P.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [O'Neill, Daniel W.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Leeds,"Marshall, AP (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",a.marshall@mmu.ac.uk,"O'Neill, Daniel W./AGZ-3370-2022","O'Neill, Daniel W./0000-0002-0790-8295; Marshall, Adam P./0000-0002-8364-2281",,,,,42,24,25,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

It details a modeling framework that allows us to determine the optimal infrastructure needed to connect a geographically disaggregated set of emitting and storage clusters, along with the threshold CO2 values necessary to ensure that the considered emitters will make the necessary investment decisions. This framework is used to assess the relevance of various policy scenarios, including (i) the perimeter of the targeted emitters for a CCS uptake, and (ii) the relevance of constructing several regional networks instead of a single grid to account for the spatial characteristics of the Spanish peninsula. We find that three networks naturally emerge in the north, center and south of Spain. Moreover, the necessary CO2 break-even price critically depends on the presence of power stations in the capture perimeter.

The aims of this study were to estimate the CV for child disability and to explore how this varied for different levels of disability and reference levels of living standards. Using data on 54,641 families from the Family Resources Survey (2004-2012), we matched families with (cases) and without (controls) a disabled child on family and child characteristics plus living standards and calculated the income difference inclusive of disability benefits. Our findings suggest that across families with the most disabled children, a compensating variation equal to an extra A 56-A pound 79 pound a week was required to achieve the same living standards as matched families without a disabled child compared with the mean level of state disability benefit A 47-A pound 71 pound a week in this group.","[Melnychuk, Mariya; Morris, Stephen] UCL, Dept Appl Hlth Res, Room 112,1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England; [Solmi, Francesca] UCL, Fac Brain Sci, Div Psychiat, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Melnychuk, M (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Appl Hlth Res, Room 112,1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England.",m.melnychuk@ucl.ac.uk,"Solmi, Francesca/V-2084-2019","Solmi, Francesca/0000-0003-0219-9503; Morris, Stephen/0000-0002-5828-3563","Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families - Department of Health Policy Research Programme; Department of Health","Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families - Department of Health Policy Research Programme; Department of Health","This work was supported by the Policy Research Unit in the Health of Children, Young People and Families, which is funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme.

Low sanctions for errors encourages bold policing by officers but may still raise the equilibrium level of crime because it also discourages investments in competence.

As part of the Single Technology Appraisal (STA) ID944, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited AbbVie, the manufacturer, to submit evidence on the use of venetoclax, within its licensed indication. The Evidence Review Group (ERG), Warwick Evidence, was asked to provide an independent and critical review of the submitted evidence. Evidence came from three single-arm trials in CLL patients with or without 17p deletion [del(17p])/TP53 chromosomal abnormalities. The anticipated licensed indication specified that venetoclax-eligible del(17p)/TP53 patients should have not responded to, or be deemed unsuitable for, B-cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy, and that non-del(17p)/TP53 patients should have not responded to both chemoimmunotherapy and BCRi therapy. The three trials were heterogeneous in terms of both del(17p)/TP53 status and previous exposure to BCRi therapy. The M13-982 study investigated 158 R/R CLL patients with the 17p deletion, but only a small number had received previous BCRi therapy; the M12-175 study investigated 67 patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, some with the 17p deletion, but very few previously treated with BCRi therapy; and the M14-032 study included 105 patients previously treated with BCRi therapy (either idelalisib or ibrutinib), some of whom had unknown mutation status. The ERG concluded that the study populations did not directly conform to those specified in the licensed indication or in the NICE scope. Outcomes reported included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); adverse events were reported for the pooled population of all three studies, as well as separately for each study. The median PFS was 41.4 and 27.2 months among patients in the M12-175 and M13-982 trials, respectively, whereas the median PFS was not reached in the M14-032 trial. Some results were designated academic in confidence and cannot be reported here. The submission provided a de novo partitioned survival cost-effectiveness model with three health states: pre-progression, post-progression and dead. Transition probabilities between health states were estimated using Weibull models for PFS and OS. The ERG judged the model structure to be appropriate. Venetoclax was compared with best supportive care (BSC) in patients with or without del(17p)/TP53 mutation status, and with palliative care (PC). To populate the del(17p)/TP53 venetoclax arm, the submission pooled del(17p)/TP53 patients from all three studies and fitted Weibull models for PFS and OS. PFS and OS models for non-del(17p)/TP53 venetoclax patients were obtained by applying hazard ratios (HRs) to the del(17p)/TP53 OS and PFS models, derived using Cox's regression analysis comparing del(17p)/TP53 and non-del(17p)/TP53 patients pooled from the M14-032 and M12-175 studies. The ERG expressed reservations about the company's pooling procedure, but acknowledged its expedience given the small evidence base. For the BSC comparator arm, the submission used the rituximab + placebo arm from a randomised controlled trial comparing idelalisib + rituximab versus placebo + rituximab ('study 116'). Weibull regression data for OS and PFS were taken from the idelalisib STA (ID764) submitted by Gilead to NICE. The ERG considered the use of the study 116 rituximab arm to be inconsistent with the licensed indication for venetoclax because these patients had neither not responded to nor were inappropriate for BCRi therapy, being eligible to be randomised to idelalisib. Another difficulty was the requirement for a technical correction in survival analysis because of considerable switching from rituximab to idelalisib. The ERG considered that post-progression survival of patients from the idelalisib arm of study 116 provided a more appropriate representation of BSC since these patients had not responded to BCRi therapy, consistent with venetoclax's licensed indication. For PC, the company submission used data from the UK CLL Forum. The company's base-case analysis indicated that venetoclax was clinically effective, but the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for del(17p)/TP53 (A 39,940 pound/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) and non-del(17p)/TP53 (A 47,370 pound/QALY gained) patients were well above the NICE threshold of A 20,000-30,000 pound/QALY. The ERG identified two errors in the implementation of the company's parametric models-one related to the implementation of HRs, and the other to the derivation of the Weibull shape parameters obtained from the Gilead idelalisib submission. The ERG made plausible adjustments to the company's base-case and corrected errors, resulting in a reduced estimate of the cost effectiveness of venetoclax in non-del(17p)/TP53 and del(17p)/TP53 indications; in the ERG's preferred base case, using post-progression survival of patients in the idelalisib arm of study 116 as the BSC comparator, deterministic ICERs were higher than the company's base-case for both indications: A 57,476 pound/QALY gained for del(17p)/TP53 and A 77,779 pound/QALY gained for non-del(17p)/TP53. The NICE Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that venetoclax used within its licensed indication should not be recommended for use in the National Health Service (NHS). In response to the preliminary recommendation, the company submitted new analyses; however, at a subsequent appraisal committee meeting, the original recommendation was upheld and the committee concluded there were large uncertainties around the clinical effectiveness of venetoclax and BSC, and that under the committee's preferred assumptions, the ICERs were higher than those generally considered cost effective, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The company submitted further evidence, and the final guidance recommended venetoclax for use with the Cancer Drugs Fund for the two populations in this technology appraisal.","[Mistry, Hema; Nduka, Chidozie; Connock, Martin; Mantopoulos, Theodoros; Mason, James] Univ Warwick, Warwick Evidence, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Colquitt, Jill; Loveman, Emma] Effect Evidence LLP, 26 Curve, Waterlooville PO8 9SE, Hants, England; [Walewska, Renata] Royal Bournemouth Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Castle Lane East, Bournemouth BH7 7DW, Dorset, England",University of Warwick,"Mistry, H (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Evidence, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Hema.Mistry@warwick.ac.uk,"Mason, James M/D-9904-2011","Mistry, Hema/0000-0002-5023-1160; Mason, James/0000-0001-9210-4082; Colquitt, Jillian Leigh/0000-0001-5962-2689; Loveman, Emma/0000-0001-8226-2634",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA programme) [16/10/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA programme),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA programme [Project number 16/10/11].

To this end, we assembled a panel data set of hurricane strikes and national income accounting data for 21 Caribbean countries for the period 1970-2011. We used a panel Vector Autoregressive (VARX) model to take account of the direct impact of the storm shocks and any feedback mechanisms. Our results suggest that the responses on each GDP component differ widely, where we find some effects on export, import, public consumption, investment and private consumption.

These include (i) freight vehicle downsizing and (ii) the dieselisation of van fleets (formally referred to as light commercial vehicles or LCVs). More recently, a new possible trend has started to emerge, mainly related to alternative fuelled LCVs for reducing air pollution emissions in urban areas. Electric LCVs up to 3.5 tons are considered a suitable option for last mile operations, yet only a few last mile operators are replacing their diesel fleets with electric vans. In order to probe electric LCV acceptance in the freight transport sector, we conducted 15 experiment-oriented interviews with urban freight transport and service operators who tested and adopted electric vans, exploring technical and operational obstacles in daily operations in Paris and London. Additional interviews (8) have been conducted with policymakers, to update the initial survey. The results show that, in addition to range concerns issues, last mile operators' perception and acceptance of electric vans are affected by other concerns, such as queue, payload and grid anxieties. A number of financial and non-financial incentives to foster the adoption of electric vans are identified and compared by considering the cities of Paris and London.

J,"Mosley, P",,,,"Mosley, Paul",,,Why has export diversification been so hard to achieve in Africa?,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REFORM,"This paper addresses two research issues to which Chris Milner has contributed: the role of trade policy in economic development, and the particular development case of Mauritius. On the first issue, the focus is on understanding why so few low-income countries, especially in Africa, have achieved a sustained level of export diversification. The paper argues that the standard Washington Consensus advice on trade policy placed too much emphasis on liberalisation alone and neglected the important role of government policy, in particular the potential to use targeted input subsidies to support the development of export sectors. Mauritius is then discussed as an example of relatively successful subsidy policies that enabled diversification of exports: indeed the only African country to achieve this in a sustained manner. Subsidies are not advocated as a panacea, and it is recognised that they are not always feasible or effective, but they can be part of an export diversification strategy that supports economic growth.","[Mosley, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Mosley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41,4,,,SI,,1025,1044,,10.1111/twec.12620,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12620,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000430113300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We code the contents of the respondents' self-reported reasons for driving (i.e. the instrumental rationalities attributed to driving with respect to varying purposes) to identify keywords representing motivation to drive; we then analyse the keyword data using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Study 2 examines how the dimensions discovered through study 1 relate to propensity to carpool, using structural equation modelling (SEM). Data for Study 2 are the survey responses of commuters (N = 1028) based in the United States. The MDS reveals four key dimensions of motivation to drive. These capture instrumental rationalities for driving within four situational domains which we term: (1) Family; (2) Public transport impractical changes; (3) Rigid schedule; and (4) Non-urban areas. The SEM results show that the regression coefficients on propensity to carpool of Public transport impractical changes and Rigid schedule are significant and negative; the Family domain has a positive but non-significant regression coefficient. Regarding demographics, men's mean values on all four domain variables are significantly higher than those for women, except for the Family domain where the mean value for women is higher; meanwhile, age predicts decreasing propensity to carpool. Additionally, the situational domains of Public transport impractical changes, Rigid schedule and Non-urban areas significantly positively correlate. Consequently, overall, the results imply that addressing commuters' instrumental rationalities for driving, namely increasing schedule flexibility and providing more direct or quicker public transport, could indirectly encourage commuters to carpool. The study makes an original contribution by estimating the causal relationship between commuters' motivation to drive and propensity to carpool.","[Neoh, Jun Guan] PwC, Southampton, Hants, England; [Chipulu, Maxwell; Marshall, Alasdair; Tewkesbury, Adam] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Chipulu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Room 4044,Bldg 2,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",junguan.neoh@gmail.com; m.chipulu@soton.ac.uk; A.Marshall@soton.ac.uk; A.J.Tewkesbury@soton.ac.uk,"Chipulu, Maxwell/C-2308-2013","Chipulu, Maxwell/0000-0002-0139-6188; Marshall, Alasdair/0000-0002-9789-8042",,,,,124,29,32,4,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We estimate hedonic price regressions using data on tariff plans offered by the main mobile telecommunications operator in France between May 2011 and December 2014. In this time period, the obtained quality-adjusted price index decreased by about 42.8% as compared to a decline in weighted average prices without quality-adjustment of 8.7%. In a second step, we relate the quality-adjusted prices to a set of competition, investment, and regulation variables and find that the launch of 4G networks by mobile operators was the main driver of price reductions for classic tariffs with commitment. Low-cost tariffs without commitment which were introduced to pre-empt the entry of low-cost competitor declined at the time of entry. Moreover, we find that regulation, which is approximated by the level of mobile termination charges and international roaming price caps for voice and data, has a joint significant impact on quality-adjusted prices. In percentage terms, competition is responsible for about 23.4% of total price decline and investments in 4G for 56.1%. We conclude that the reduction in quality-adjusted prices in the last years was largely caused by competition between operators for a new 4G technology and by entry of a fourth low-cost operator.

As a consequence, conventional tests spuriously indicate nonlinearity. Next, we examine an alternative maximum likelihood approach. Our findings suggest that this approach has substantially better size properties than tests based on least-squares and heteroskedasticity-consistent matrix estimators, and performs comparably to a bootstrap technique.","[Pavlidis, Efthymios G.; Tsionas, Mike] Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Lancaster University,"Pavlidis, EG (通讯作者)，Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",e.pavlidis@lancaster.ac.uk,"Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Pavlidis, Efthymios/0000-0002-4892-1955",,,,,19,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The individual effects are allowed to be correlated with the regressors, and the comparison is carried out in terms of an exponent coefficient, , which measures the degree of pervasiveness of the FE in the panel. The use of allows us to distinguish between poolability of small N dimensional panels with large T from large N dimensional panels with small T. It is shown that the pooled estimator remains consistent so long as delta<1, and is asymptotically normally distributed if delta <1/2, for a fixed T and as N. It is further shown that when delta<1/2, the pooled estimator is more efficient than the FE estimator. We also propose a Hausman type diagnostic test of delta<1/2 as a simple test of poolability, and propose a pretest estimator that could be used in practice. Monte Carlo evidence supports the main theoretical findings and gives some indications of gains to be made from pooling when delta <1/2.","[Pesaran, M.

In the unit root case, Anderson-Hsiao lagged variable instruments satisfy orthogonality conditions but are well known to be irrelevant. For a fixed time series sample size (T) IV is inconsistent and approaches a shifted Cauchy-distributed random variate as the cross-section sample size n -> infinity. But when T -> infinity, either for fixed n or as n -> infinity, IV is root T consistent and its limit distribution is a ratio of random variables that converges to twice a standard Cauchy as n -> infinity. In this case, the usual instruments are uncorrelated with the regressor but irrelevance does not prevent consistent estimation. The same Cauchy limit theory holds sequentially and jointly as (n, T)-> infinity with no restriction on the divergence rates of n and T. When the common autoregressive root rho = 1 + c/root T the panel comprises a collection of mildly integrated time series. In this case, the IV estimator is root n consistent for fixed T and root nT consistent with limit distribution N ( 0,4) when n, T -> infinity sequentially or jointly. These results are robust for common roots of the form rho = 1 + c/T-gamma for all gamma is an element of(0,1) and joint convergence holds. Limit normality holds but the variance changes when gamma = 1. When gamma > 1 joint convergence fails and sequential limits differ with different rates of convergence. These findings reveal the fragility of conventional Gaussian IV asymptotics to persistence in dynamic panel regressions.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Primary schools have been able to opt-in to academy status since 2010 and academies now account for twenty-one percent of the primary sector. This paper investigates the causal effect of becoming a converter academy on primary school assessment outcomes, and on entry-year intake composition. Unlike existing evidence focused on earlier academies formed from failing secondary schools, no evidence is found of a converter academy effect on attainment for the average pupil. Although, there is evidence of a slight positive effect on age 11 attainment for pupils eligible for free school meals.

We propose a dynamical systems model that accounts for the state of the land, population and workers employed in swidden and intensive agriculture and monument building. Optimisation of model output to fit empirical data fixes biometric parameters to values consistent with the literature and requires that a shift from swidden to more intensive agriculture took place at around 550 CE. The latter prediction is consistent with the dating of the beginning of the Late Classical period. Thus, our model offers an explanation of the collapse of the society of the Maya and suggests that the role of droughts may have been overestimated. Consistent with previous work, the collapse can be modelled by a critical transition (supercritical Hopf bifurcation), where the critical parameter is the harvesting rate per capita of intensive agriculture. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity analysis indicates that the model and its predictions are robust.","[Roman, Sabin; Brede, Markus] Univ Southampton, Inst Complex Syst Simulat, Southampton, Hants, England; [Roman, Sabin; Brede, Markus] Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Agents Interact & Complex Grp, Southampton, Hants, England; [Palmer, Erika] Univ Bergen, Dept Comparat Polit, Challenges Adv Democracles CHAD Res Grp, Bergen, Norway",University of Southampton; University of Southampton; University of Bergen,"Roman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Inst Complex Syst Simulat, Southampton, Hants, England.;Roman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Agents Interact & Complex Grp, Southampton, Hants, England.",sr10g13@soton.ac.uk,,"Roman, Sabin/0000-0002-7513-3479",EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre Grant [EP/G03690X/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1371023] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre Grant (EP/G03690X/1).

Such institutional copying is likely to fail, if formal institutions alone are copied without the informal institutions on which they rest in the originating country. This paper investigates the role of human actors in copying informal institutions. At independence, all British African colonies imported the same institution intended to safeguard the political neutrality of their civil services. While the necessary formal provisions were copied into the constitutions of all African colonies, the extent to which they were put into practice varies. The paper investigates the connection between the variation in the legal practice and the presence of British colonial officers after independence. A natural experiment around compensation payments to British officers explains the variation in the number of officers who remained in service after independence. Interviews with retired officers suggest that the extended presence of British personnel promoted the acceptance of imported British institutions among local colleagues.","[Seidler, Valentin] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Seidler, V (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",valentin.seidler@univie.ac.at,"Seidler, Valentin/AAF-8885-2019","Seidler, Valentin/0000-0001-7076-7424",Austrian Science Found [J 3848-G28]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J 3848] Funding Source: researchfish; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J3848] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Found(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research was supported by the Austrian Science Found (Project J 3848-G28).

An indicator is introduced to compute the net inflation effect on output (NIEO) based on the difference between two concepts of core inflation, where both are computed using the decomposition of VAR residuals. We find that for all countries, when inflation is increasing the NIEO is significantly positive and is negative during periods of decreasing inflation. Typically, countries which follow anti-inflationary policies if the NIEO is of small magnitude suffer relatively minimal damage in output, whereas if the same policies are undertaken when the NIEO is large the damaging effects on output could be much greater. This suggests that the NIEO could be a useful indicator of the likely effects of policy, especially for countries which have frequent episodes of high inflation, and in those countries which employ inflation-targeting policy, as the timing of monetary policy actions could be optimized to take account of this real effect of inflation.","[Shah, Imran H.; Corrick, Ian] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Saboor, Abdul] Univ Arid Agr, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",University of Bath; Arid Agriculture University,"Shah, IH (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",i.h.Shah@bath.ac.uk; i.corrick@bath.ac.uk; drabdul.saboor@uaar.edu.pk,"Saboor, Abdul/AAI-7723-2020; Shah, Imran/W-6547-2019","Shah, Imran/0000-0002-3662-4128",,,,,68,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The operations of individual Metroplex airports are highly interdependent, rendering their efficient management rather difficult. This paper proposes a framework for the design of dynamic arrival and departure routes in MAS Terminal Maneuvering Areas, which fundamentally changes the operation in MAS airspaces for much improved efficiency when compared to the current situation. The framework consists of three components. The first presents a new procedure for characterizing dynamic arrival and departure routes based on the spatio-temporal distributions of flights. The second component is a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model for the prioritization of the dynamic routes, which takes into account a set of quantitative and qualitative attributes important for MAS operations. The third component is a priority based method for the positioning of terminal waypoints as well as the design of three-dimensional, conflict-free terminal routes. Such a method accounts for the AHP-derived priorities while satisfying the minimal separation and aircraft maneuverability constraints. The developed framework is applied to a case study of the New York Metroplex, using aircraft trajectories during a heavy traffic period on typical day of operation in the New York Terminal Control Area in November 2011. The proposed framework is quantitatively assessed using the AirTOp fast-time simulation model. The results suggest significant improvements of the new design over the existing one, as measured by several key performance indicators such as travel distance, travel time, fuel burn, and controller workload. The operational feasibility of the framework is further validated qualitatively by subject matter experts from the Port Authority of New York and New jersey, the operator of the New York Metroplex.

Both recurrent and vector forecasting algorithms of horizontal MSSA (HMSSA) are considered. The results from the proposed multivariate approach are compared with those obtained via the optimized univariate singular spectrum analysis (SSA) forecasting algorithm to determine the statistical significance of each outcome. The data are rigorously tested for normality, seasonal unit root hypothesis, and structural breaks. The results are presented such that users can not only identify the most appropriate model based on the aim of the analysis, but also easily identify the leading indicators for each IP variable in each country. Our findings show that, for all three countries, forecasts from the proposed MSSA algorithm outperform the optimized SSA algorithm in over 70% of cases. Accordingly, this new approach succeeds in identifying leading indicators and is a viable option for selecting the SSA choices L and r, which minimizes a loss function.","[Silva, Emmanuel Sirimal] Univ Arts London, London Coll Fash, Fash Business Sch, 272 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EY, England; [Hassani, Hossein] Univ Tehran, Res Inst Energy Management & Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Heravi, Saeed] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of Arts London; University of Tehran; Cardiff University,"Silva, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Arts London, London Coll Fash, Fash Business Sch, 272 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EY, England.",e.silva@fashion.arts.ac.uk,"Hassani, Hossein/A-1712-2012","Silva, Emmanuel Sirimal/0000-0003-3851-9230",,,,,34,19,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The pCODR review process considers four dimensions of value-clinical benefit, economic evaluation, patient-based values and adoption feasibility-but they do not define weights for individual decision criteria or an acceptable threshold for any of the criteria. Given this implicit review process, it is of interest to understand which factors appear to carry the most weight in pCODR recommendations using a revealed preferences approach. Methods Using publicly available decision summaries (n = 91) describing submissions and resulting recommendations 2011-2017, we extracted ten attributes that characterized each submission. Using logistic regression, we identified statistically significant attributes and estimated their relative impact in final recommendations. Results Clinical aspects appear to carry the greatest weight in the decision to reject or not reject, along with aspects of patient value (treatments with no alternatives were less likely to be rejected). Cost effectiveness does not appear to play a role in the initial decision to reject or not reject but is critical in full versus conditional approvals. There is evidence of a maximum acceptable threshold of around $Can140,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Conclusion A set of factors driving pCODR recommendations is identifiable, supporting the consistency of the review process. However, the implicit nature of the review process and the difficulty of extracting and interpreting some of the attribute levels used in the analysis suggests that the process may still lack full transparency.","[Skedgel, Chris] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Skedgel, Chris] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Pharm, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Wranik, Dominika] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Wranik, Dominika] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hu, Min] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada",University of East Anglia; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Skedgel, C (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Skedgel, C (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Sch Pharm, Halifax, NS, Canada.",c.skedgel@uea.ac.uk,"Skedgel, Chris/U-7173-2019","Skedgel, Chris/0000-0003-4989-8846; Wranik, Wieslawa Dominika/0000-0002-7318-3886; Hu, Min/0000-0002-7839-2812","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Health Services and Health Policy Research [PHE-129912]","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Health Services and Health Policy Research","This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Health Services and Health Policy Research (Grant PHE-129912).",,43,31,34,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36,4,,,,,467,475,,10.1007/s40273-018-0610-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0610-0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29353385,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000426901000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We answer this question by looking at how gay and lesbian employees make sense of their homosexuality in the highly normative context of audit firms. As a first step, we unveil the subtle pressures exerted on those who possess concealable stigmatized identities. Homosexual auditors engage in partial or full concealment of their sexuality. They live in the fear of being misjudged and cast out of a context in which male values are tantamount. However, the efforts required to conceal create a situation of unrest, which eventually interferes with their social integration at work. We draw on rich ethnographic material in French audit firms, benefitting from the exogenous shock of a gay marriage bill. The study's findings shed new light on audit as a gendered profession and the cost of concealing stigmatized invisible identities.","[Stenger, Sebastien] ISG, Accounting & Management Control, Paris, France; [Roulet, Thomas J.] Kings Coll London, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Roulet, TJ (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",Thomas.roulet@kcl.ac.uk,"Roulet, Thomas/AAE-1457-2019","Roulet, Thomas/0000-0002-9148-3743",,,,,48,43,48,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper takes a case study valley from Nepal's eastern hills, tracing over two centuries of agrarian change and evolving interactions between adivasi and semi-feudal economic formations with capitalism. In recent years, the expansion of markets, rising demand for cash, and climate stress have solidified migrant labour as a core component of livelihoods, and the primary mechanism of surplus appropriation from the hill peasantry. Through a focus on three altitudinal zones, however, it is demonstrated how the trajectory of this transformation, including the interactions with persisting pre-capitalist formations, is mediated by both political-economic processes and the local agro-ecological context.","[Sugden, Fraser] Univ Birmingham, Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Seddon, David] Crit Fac, 57 Paragon Pl, London SE3 0SP, England; [Raut, Manita] Int Water Management Inst, GPO Box 8975 EPC 416, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Seddon, David] Univ East Anglia, Dev Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of Birmingham; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); University of East Anglia,"Sugden, F (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",f.sugden@bham.ac.uk,"Sugden, Fraser/JPL-1806-2023","Sugden, Fraser/0000-0002-7559-4486",CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems (WLE),CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems (WLE),"This paper was funded through the CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems (WLE), led by the International Water Management Institute, as part of its Ganges basin Gender and Inclusion Profiles project.

Bidders with preemption fears are more likely to acquire target firms at an earlier development stage. However, if uncertainty is high, an acquirer may opt to wait and buy the target firm at a later stage as assets in place. The fear of preemption affects the efficient exercise of each offer differently. While the timing of a hostile takeover under threat of preemption converges to an efficient global optimiser threshold, negotiated mergers are exercised inefficiently too early. Premiums to the target firm are higher when the firm is acquired at an earlier stage, and when the bidder fears being preempted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many governments and donors promote contract farming as part of agricultural development policies. However, there is serious concern whether smaller farmers can benefit from these arrangements. This paper presents the results of a systematic review that analysed the evidence in the literature on income effects for smallholders. The review included all studies with an econometric design to reduce selection bias in effect estimates. The meta-analysis covered 26 empirical instances of contract farming in 13 developing countries. The contracts varied widely, with varying service packages provided by the firm to the farmers. Using truth table analysis, we explored combinations of services associated with relatively high or relatively low income effects. The meta-analysis resulted in an overall pooled average effect size of 38%. However, we show that there are publication and survivor biases. Non-significant effects are systematically underreported. Moreover, all studies assessed the effectiveness of the contractual arrangement when these had already survived the start-up problems. Both sources of bias lead to an overestimation of the average income effect. The findings point to the need for substantial income effects for contract farming arrangements to survive over time. Both firms and farmers face risks; for example, farmers may side-sell products after having received the services from the firm. The most effective contractual arrangements included a price premium, especially when there was no farmers' organisation to broker the contract between the farmer and the firm. We show that smallholders can benefit from the contractual arrangement. However, the poorest farmers are rarely included; we show that, in 61% of the cases, the contract farmers had significantly larger landholdings or more assets than the average farmers in the region.

The Human Rights Commission and later Council (UNHRCC) are internationally legitimized tools where member states shame repressive regimes for human rights violations in public resolutions. We argue that these resolutions can influence foreign investors in two main ways: (1) They signal that a state is an outcast, unable to secure alliances within the UN human rights bodies that protect it from being publicly shamed, with negative consequences for investment attractiveness ('outcast' effect). (2) They signal that a state is one of the most rogue, severe human rights violators because voting members of the UNHRCC may be aware of many human rights violations, but they pass resolutions only in the harshest cases ('bottleneck' effect). Any MNC associated with such a country risks severe reputational damage. Results from a panel data analysis of 165 countries (1977-2013) confirm that UNHRCC condemnations deter FDI. This effect is amplified by media reporting of human rights abuse, and stronger and more robust than a bad human rights record of a state itself. NGO shaming and milder UNHRCC sanctions (which do not reach resolution stage) have less strong effects, although the result on NGO shaming is to be seen with caution due to a reduced sample size.

Despite this, the long-standing consensus is that police response time has no meaningful effect on the likelihood of catching offenders. We revisit this question using a uniquely rich dataset from the Greater Manchester Police. To identify causal effects, we use a novel strategy that exploits discontinuities in distance to the response station across locations next to each other, but on different sides of division boundaries. Contrary to previous evidence, we find large and strongly significant effects: in our preferred estimate, a 10% increase in response time leads to a 4.7 percentage points decrease in the likelihood of clearing the crime. We find stronger effects for thefts than for violent offences, although the effects are large for every type of crime. We find suggestive evidence in support of two mechanisms: the likelihood of an immediate arrest and the likelihood that a suspect will be named by a victim or witness both increase as response time becomes faster. We argue that, under conservative assumptions, hiring an additional response officer would generate a benefit, in terms of future crime prevented, equivalent to 170% of her payroll cost.","[Vidal, Jordi Blanes I.; Kirchmaier, Tom] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Vidal, Jordi Blanes I.] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England; [Kirchmaier, Tom] London Sch Econ, Copenhagen Business Sch, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Vidal, JBI (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.;Vidal, JBI (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England.",,,"Kirchmaier, Thomas/0000-0002-8938-2206",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,76,37,41,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We test the robustness of this finding by measuring the risk preferences of 500 household heads in the highlands of Ethiopia.

Self-employment was found to be particularly associated with energised well-being in the form of job engagement. The presence in self-employment of greater challenge, such as an enhanced requirement for personal innovation, accounted statistically for self-employed professionals' greater job engagement, and self-employed professionals more strongly valued personal challenge than did professionals employed in an organisation. However, no between-role differences occurred in respect of supportive job features such as having a comfortable workplace. Differences in well-being, job content and work orientations were found primarily in comparison between self-employees and organisational non-managers. The study emphasises the need to distinguish conceptually and empirically between different forms of work orientation, job content and well-being, and points to the value of incorporating psychological thinking in some sociological research.","[Warr, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Inst Work Psychol, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Inceoglu, Ilke] Univ Surrey, Organisat Behav & Human Resource Management, Surrey Business Sch, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Sheffield; University of Surrey,"Warr, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Inst Work Psychol, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",p.warr@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Inceoglu, Ilke/0000-0002-9137-490X",,,,,63,25,28,0,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

After the collapse of many weakly performing monopolist organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, strengthened cooperatives have emerged since the 2000s. Scholarly knowledge about the state-cooperative relations in which this revival takes place remains poor. Based on new evidence from Uganda's coffee sector, this paper discusses the political economy of Africa's cooperative revival. The authors argue that donors' and African governments' renewed support is framed in largely apolitical terms, which obscures the contested political and economic nature of the revival. In the context of neoliberal restructuring processes, state and non-state institutional support to democratic economic organizations with substantial redistributional agendas remains insufficient. The political-economic context in Ugandaand potentially elsewhere in Africacontributes to poor terms of trade for agricultural cooperatives while maintaining significant state control over some cooperative activities to protect the status quo interests of big capital and state elites. These conditions are unlikely to produce a conflict-free, substantial, and sustained revival of cooperatives, which the new promoters of cooperatives suggest is under way.","[Wedig, Karin] Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA; [Wiegratz, Jorg] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Denver; University of Leeds,"Wedig, K (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Korbel Sch Int Studies, 2201 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80201 USA.",karin.wedig@du.edu,,"WEDIG, KARIN/0000-0001-5426-1001",,,,,127,16,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

As a result, various maritime safety measures have been developed, including Port State Control (PSC) inspections. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Bayesian Network (BN) based approach to analyse risk factors influencing PSC inspections, and predict the probability of vessel detention. To do so, inspection data of bulk carriers in seven major European countries from 2005 to 20081 in Paris MoU is collected to identify the relevant risk factors. Meanwhile, the network structure is constructed via TAN learning and subsequently validated by sensitivity analysis. The results reveal two conclusions: first, the key risk factors influencing PSC inspections include number of deficiencies, type of inspection, Recognised Organisation (RO) and vessel age. Second, the model exploits a novel way to predict the detention probabilities under different situations, which effectively help port authorities to rationalise their inspection regulations as well as allocation of the resources. Further effort will be made to conduct contrastive analysis between 'Pre-NIR' period and 'Post-NIR' period to test the impact of NIR started in 2008.","[Yang, Zhisen; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Yin, Jingbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Dept Int Shipping, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Liverpool John Moores University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Yang, ZL (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",Z.Yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; Yang, Zhisen/JRW-3214-2023; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013","Yang, Zhisen/0000-0002-6394-8099; yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X",EU Marie Curie grant [ENRICH - 612546]; Liverpool John Moores University UK,EU Marie Curie grant; Liverpool John Moores University UK,This research was supported by an EU Marie Curie grant (ENRICH - 612546) and PhD scholarship by Liverpool John Moores University UK.,,73,115,121,26,155,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The 1992-1995 conflict was harmful for ethnic diversity. Yet, two decades later, where it still exists, ethnic diversity gives rise to positive economic consequences. After controlling for other influences, the authors find lower probabilities of respondents in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods being in the lowest income categories but higher probabilities of being in medium and higher income categories. The largest effects are the reduced probabilities of respondents reporting no income, and are thus particularly relevant to poverty reduction. At the limit, their estimates imply an income gap of more than 20 per cent between a counter-factual completely heterogenous environment and a counter-factual completely homogenous environment. Policy makers in this post-conflict country, and in similar environments elsewhere, should take into consideration the economic costs of policies supporting ethnic homogeneity over diversity.","[Efendic, Adnan] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Pugh, Geoff] Staffordshire Univ, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England",University of Sarajevo; Staffordshire University,"Efendic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",adnan.efendic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Efendic, Adnan/AAE-4740-2019; Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019","Efendic, Adnan/0000-0003-0241-0938; Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757",,,,,58,7,8,1,5,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 28,2018,12,,,,,,,,201817,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-17,http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-17,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB0AI,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428704500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The promotion of business, facilitation of production, and rewards of economic returns are highly correlated stages for efficiency performance. The results suggest that Beijing's government should expend more effort developing the potential to generate outputs given current land and investment inputs. In addition, it provides a tool to strengthen the organisational capacity development of industrial parks by emphasising their multi-dimensions in inputs and outputs, selecting the right competitors at the right organisational stage, locating sources of efficiency and inefficiency, and understanding progression and balance of internal stages during operation.","[Yang, Zhenshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev & Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhenshan] Univ Cambridge, Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Hao, Gaojian] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Tourism & Environm Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zhe] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Cambridge; Shaanxi Normal University; Peking University","Cheng, Z (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cz1251@pku.edu.cn,"Cheng, Zhe/AHE-3742-2022","Cheng, Zhe/0000-0002-3777-3934; Yang, Zhenshan/0000-0002-3697-7396","Natural Sciences Foundation of China [41530751, 41371008]; Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS' [2014042]; Shaanxi Normal University",Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS'; Shaanxi Normal University,"The research is sponsored by a grant of the Natural Sciences Foundation of China [grant number 41530751], [grant number 41371008], the support from Early Career Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 'Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS' [grant number 2014042]; and the support of Shaanxi Normal University.",,54,11,11,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We make further use of the variation in bilateral transport costs between all counties in our study area induced by the HSR to identify the strength and spatial scope of agglomeration forces. Our most careful estimate points to an elasticity of output with respect to market potential of 12.5%.

Our results further imply an elasticity of per-worker output with respect to economic density of 3.8%, although the effects seem driven by worker and firm selection.","[Ahlfeldt, Gabriel M.] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ahlfeldt, Gabriel M.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Feddersen, Arne] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Sociol Environm & Business Econ, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Southern Denmark,"Ahlfeldt, GM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",g.ahlfeldt@lse.ac.uk,"Feddersen, Arne/T-8881-2019","Feddersen, Arne/0000-0001-8935-4021; Ahlfeldt, Gabriel/0000-0001-5664-3230",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,79,188,202,29,267,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We develop an extended version of Acemoglu and Robinson's [American Economic Review 91, 2001] model of political transitions to show how the anticipation of new loans from international financial institutions can trigger political transitions which would not otherwise have taken place. We test this unexplored implication of the theory empirically. We find that the anticipation of receiving new loan programs immediately after a political regime transition increases the probability of a transition from autocracy to democracy and reduces the probability of democratic survival.

However, the degree to which capability and functioning differ in practice is unclear. This paper investigates this issue, focusing on capability and functioning differences (CFD) across different aspects of life and different individuals. In the study, the ICECAP-A capability questionnaire was modified to measure both functionings and capabilities and was completed by U.K.-based convenience sample of 943 people. Around one third of people reported CFD in at least one area of their life, most commonly in terms of their achievement. People were more likely to report CFD when they had a degree-level education and when they had impaired health. An additional finding was that capability varied more with education whereas functioning varied more with health status. This finding needs further examination, but it suggests that the choice of evaluative space may influence how priorities are set for public spending.","[Al-Janabi, Hareth] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Al-Janabi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",h.aljanabi@bham.ac.uk,,"Al-Janabi, Hareth/0000-0002-3691-8310",MRC Early Career Fellowship in the Economics of Health [G1002334]; NIHR Career Development Fellowship [CDF-2015-08-025]; MRC [G1002334] Funding Source: UKRI; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [CDF-2015-08-025] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),MRC Early Career Fellowship in the Economics of Health; NIHR Career Development Fellowship; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"MRC Early Career Fellowship in the Economics of Health, Grant/Award Number: G1002334; NIHR Career Development Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: CDF-2015-08-025",,40,11,11,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27,3,,,,,465,479,,10.1002/hec.3586,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3586,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,28944529,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428324700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find that both the how'' and the when'' matter, but the heterogeneity related to the composition is more robust across different specifications. Adjustments based upon permanent spending cuts are consistently much less costly than those based upon permanent tax increases.

US firms significantly decreased their production costs relative to firms in other countries. They have also reduced debt, reduced dividend payout, and increased their cash holdings compared to firms in other countries. The differences are, in general, explained by differences in financial leverage. However, financial leverage does not explain differences between production decisions in German and U.S. firms and between Japanese and US firms. We argue that differences in firm governance between US firms and firms in Germany and Japan drive these responses.

Based on a new trade theory framework, we derive a sectoral gravity equation, including novel variables corresponding to the exporter's labor competitiveness levels, along with importer's price indices and sectoral incomes, and analyze industry-specific bilateral trade flows of 186 countries for the period 1996-2012. We address potential endogeneity and econometric drawbacks by means of the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimation methods. The results indicate that both the institutional conditions at destination and the institutional distance between exporting and importing countries are relevant factors for bilateral trade. Moreover, the effect associated with institutional conditions at destination moderately increases over time. This is a robust outcome across economic sectors, with higher values for agriculture and raw materials than for manufacturing and services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Through a comprehensive search and screening process, we identify a total of 19 cross-country econometric studies containing 169 estimates of this relationship. We find that the size and direction of the estimated relationship are affected by a range of factors, most notably the composition of the sample used for estimation, the control variables included in the regression model, and the type of government spending. Overall, we find no clear evidence that higher government spending has played a significant role in reducing income poverty in low- and middle-income countries. This is consistent with the view that fiscal policy plays a much more limited redistributive role in developing countries, in comparison with OECD countries. In addition, we find that the relationship between government spending and poverty is on average less negative for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and more negative for countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, compared to other regions. We also find that the relationship is less negative for government consumption spending, in comparison with other sectors.

We searched eight bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CSDR, DARE, HTA, EED and CPCI) for relevant economic evaluations published from each database's inception date until March 2017. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were carried out according to published guidelines. Twenty-four relevant economic analyses were identified. Seventeen of these studies focused on bone metastases resulting from a particular type of cancer, i.e. prostate (n = 8), breast (n = 7), lung (n = 1) or renal (n = 1), while seven report results for various primary tumours. Across types of cancer, evidence suggests that bisphosphonates result in lower morbidity and improved quality of life, for an additional cost, which is typically below conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. While denosumab leads to health gains compared with zoledronic acid, it also results in substantial additional costs and is unlikely to represent value for money. The limited literature on the radiopharmaceutical strontium-89 (Sr89) and external beam radiotherapy (EBR) suggest that these treatments are cost effective compared with no treatment. The reviewed evidence suggests that bisphosphonate treatments are cost-effective options for bone metastases, while denosumab is unlikely to represent value for money. Evidence on EBR and Sr89 is limited and less conclusive.","[Andronis, Lazaros; Goranitis, Ilias] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Andronis, Lazaros] Univ Warwick, Div Hlth Sci, Populat Evidence & Technol Grp, Off A 103, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Bayliss, Sue] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Duarte, Rui] Univ Liverpool, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Birmingham; University of Warwick; University of Birmingham; University of Liverpool,"Andronis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Andronis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Div Hlth Sci, Populat Evidence & Technol Grp, Off A 103, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",l.andronis@warwick.ac.uk,"Duarte, Rui/C-9635-2012","Duarte, Rui/0000-0001-6485-7415; Andronis, Lazaros/0000-0001-7998-7431",,,,,67,11,12,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36,3,,,,,301,322,,10.1007/s40273-017-0595-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0595-0,,,22,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29224174,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000426705800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This particularly holds for interactive designs. In this paper, we provide a methodological discussion of the similarities and differences between interactive experiments conducted in the laboratory and online. To this end, we conduct a repeated public goods experiment with and without punishment using samples from the laboratory and the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We chose to replicate this experiment because it is long and logistically complex. It therefore provides a good case study for discussing the methodological and practical challenges of online interactive experimentation. We find that basic behavioral patterns of cooperation and punishment in the laboratory are replicable online. The most important challenge of online interactive experiments is participant dropout. We discuss measures for reducing dropout and show that, for our case study, dropouts are exogenous to the experiment. We conclude that data quality for interactive experiments via the Internet is adequate and reliable, making online interactive experimentation a potentially valuable complement to laboratory studies.","[Arechar, Antonio A.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT USA; [Gaechter, Simon; Molleman, Lucas] Univ Nottingham, CeDEx, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Gaechter, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Gaechter, Simon] CESifo, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Gaechter, Simon] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Molleman, Lucas] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Yale University; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Max Planck Society,"Gächter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, CeDEx, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Gächter, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Gächter, S (通讯作者)，CESifo, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.;Gächter, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",antonio.alonso@yale.edu; simon.gaechter@nottingham.ac.uk; molleman@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,"Gachter, Simon/C-9787-2009","Gachter, Simon/0000-0002-7182-8505; Alonso Arechar, Antonio/0000-0002-2537-8830",ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioural Science (NIBS) [ES/K002201/1]; European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant [295707]; European Research Council (ERC) [295707] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioural Science (NIBS); European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Thorsten Chmura, David Cooper, Dennie van Dolder, Urs Fischbacher, Marcus Giamattei, Roberto Hernan Gonzalez, Oliver Hauser, Susie Jackson, Daniele Nosenzo, Charles Noussair, David G.

Second, we provide a detailed and extensive backtesting and evaluation methodology. Last, we propose a forecast combination approach for estimating VaR. Our findings suggest that our combination methods produce more accurate estimates for all the sectors under scrutiny, while in some cases they may be viewed as conservative since they tend to overestimate nominal VaR.","[Argyropoulos, Christos; Panopoulou, Ekaterini] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7FS, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Panopoulou, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7FS, Kent, England.",a.panopoulou@kent.ac.uk,,"Panopoulou, Ekaterini/0000-0001-5080-9965; Argyropoulos, Christos/0000-0002-8576-4100",Economic and Social Research Council [1494761] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,3,3,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

We examine several possible channels for this correlation, and test its sensitivity to observable characteristics of individuals, households, and regions in order to infer the scope for selection on unobservables to drive the polygamy-child mortality correlation. We find a statistically significant positive relationship between polygamy and child mortality in the modern period, and a statistically insignificant positive relationship in the historical data. Although there is a limited role for polygamist-specific intra-household dynamics and behavioral practices in shaping the mortality of children in such households, the sensitivity of the polygamy-child mortality correlation is consistent with an important role for selection into polygamy, particularly on unobservable characteristics.","[Arthi, Vellore] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Fenske, James] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Essex; University of Warwick,"Fenske, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.fenske@warwick.ac.uk,,"Fenske, James/0000-0001-6003-629X",Economic Growth Center at Yale University; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic Growth Center at Yale University; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for financial support from the Economic Growth Center at Yale University, and to Benuel Ganesan for data entry.",,122,29,32,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This, coupled with rapid economic and population growth, is believed to have contributed to the rapid growth in domestic energy demand and, recently, affected the government budget in the face of low international oil prices. In December 2015, Saudi Arabia announced increases in domestic energy prices. This paper therefore considers the impacts, focusing on gasoline, by estimating a demand function and using it to estimate the change in social welfare. Gasoline demand is found to be price inelastic suggesting that it may be difficult for the Saudi government to limit future growth in gasoline consumption using only increases in the administered price of gasoline. Thus, limiting future gasoline consumption in the KSA might require improved energy efficiency of passenger cars, increased energy awareness by drivers through education and marketing campaigns, and the provision of alternative transport modes within cities. Although the announced gasoline price increase is not expected to reduce demand considerably, it can deliver estimated welfare increases of up to 1.66 billion 2010 US$ (similar to 6.23 billion 2010 Saudi Arabian Riyals), which is around 0.26% of Saudi gross domestic product.","[Atalla, Tarek N.; Gasim, Anwar A.; Hunt, Lester C.] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hunt, Lester C.] Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance, Portsmouth, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Gasim, AA (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Anwar.Gasim@kapsarc.org,,"Gasim, Anwar/0000-0003-3642-7287",,,,,72,34,36,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114,,,,,,123,133,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.047,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000424962800013,View Full Record in Web of Science

By categorizing depositors into groups based on the amount of their deposited funds, we estimate the responses of these groups to interest rate changes. We take the findings of conventional banks as a comparative baseline and investigate the extent to which the changes in different Islamic depositor groups differ from conventional depositor groups. The findings show that depositors in both Islamic and conventional banks respond to interest rate changes. The analysis indicates that Islamic bank depositors are more responsive when their deposit sizes are larger. When Islamic bank depositors' opportunity costs rise due to a rise in the interest rate, they do not hesitate to withdraw deposits. The relation between interest rate changes and deposits is more robust in Islamic banks than in conventional banks.

We find that effects of Objective 1 status on growth are positive though not very long-lived: the effects of losing Objective 1 status on economic growth are negative, and the earlier positive effects on growth in the period(s) of Objective 1 treatment more or less undone.

Evidence from India's National Rural Employment Guarantee,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public works; Wages; NREGA; National Rural Employment Guarantee; Asia; India,PROGRAMS EVIDENCE; WELFARE,"We estimate the impact of the world's largest public works program, India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), on agricultural wages. NREGS was rolled out across India in three distinct phases, and this phased introduction is used to identify difference-in-difference estimates of the program effect. Using monthly data on wage rates from the period 2000-2011 in 209 districts across 18 Indian states, we include district-specific fixed effects and trends to control for differences in wage rates in the absence of the program. We find that, on average, the program boosted the growth rate of real daily agricultural wages by 4.3% per year. The effect of the scheme is more consistent with an increase in the growth rate of wages than with a discontinuous jump in wages. The effect was concentrated in some states and in the agricultural peak season, appears to have been gender-neutral and was biased towards unskilled labor. Since many of the world's poorest depend on casual agricultural labor for their livelihood, while at the same time minimum-wage legislation is unlikely to be effective in many developing countries, we argue that rural public employment programs constitute a potentially important anti-poverty policy tool.

We show how nonparametric methods can also be used to bound the welfare effects of changes in the provision of a non-market good. Our main context is one in which the non-market good affects the marginal utility of consuming a related market good. This can also be framed as a shift in the taste for, or quality of, the market good. A systematic approach for incorporating quality/taste variation into a revealed preference framework for heterogeneous consumers is developed. This enables the recovery of the minimal variation in quality required to rationalise observed choices of related market goods. The variation in quality appears as a adjustment to the price for related market goods which then allows a revealed preference approach to bounding compensation measures of welfare effects to be applied.","[Blow, Laura] Surrey Univ, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Blow, Laura; Blundell, Richard] IFS, London, England; [Blundell, Richard] UCL, London, England",University of Surrey; University of London; University College London,"Blow, L (通讯作者)，Surrey Univ, Guildford, Surrey, England.;Blow, L (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.",l.blow@surrey.ac.uk; r.blundell@ucl.ac.uk,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299",Economic and Social Research Council Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Kerry Smith, two anonymous commentators and participants at the conference for comments on an earlier draft.

The paper considers the two sharply contrasting cases of East and West German convergence following reunification and the enduring poverty of the Italian Mezzogiorno since Italian unification a century and a half ago. In both countries, political integration delivers much higher consumption in the lagging relative to the leading region than of per capita GDP. Consumption convergence can be supported by transfers but 'production' convergence ultimately requires catch-up in the production of tradeables. The paper demonstrates the radically different performance of the tradeable sector in the two cases, and suggests that this may be the result of differences in labour market flexibility, in investment performance and in the social norms required for the production of complex manufacturing.","[Boltho, Andrea] Univ Oxford, Magdalen Coll, Oxford, England; [Carlin, Wendy] UCL, London, England; [Carlin, Wendy] CEPR, London, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Scaramozzino, Pasquale] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Oxford; University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Carlin, W (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Carlin, W (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",w.carlin@ucl.uk,,"Scaramozzino, Pasquale/0000-0003-4917-6560",,,,,67,13,13,0,5,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

The data show that both singles and couples with high retirement income can end up on Medicaid at very advanced ages. We find that, conditioning on a large number of observable characteristics, including those that directly relate to Medicaid eligibility criteria, single women are more likely to end up on Medicaid - so are non-white people, but, surprisingly, their higher recipiency is concentrated in the higher income percentiles. We also find that people with low incomes who have a high-school diploma or higher degree are much less likely to end up receiving Medicaid than their less-educated counterparts.

Using data for the USA, Japan and Europe, our results show that material off-shoring promotes high-tech specialization through input reallocation between sectors, while service off-shoring favors technologically advanced production by increasing within-industry productivity, mainly via its positive impact on R&D. Conversely, we find that the increasing fragmentation of core production tasks, captured by narrow off-shoring, has adverse effects on technological specialisation, which suggests that this type of off-shoring is mainly pursued for cost-reduction motives.","[Bournakis, Ioannis; Vecchi, Michela] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, The Burroughs London NW4 4BT, England; [Vecchi, Michela; Venturini, Francesco] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London, England; [Venturini, Francesco] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Perugia, Italy",Middlesex University; University of Perugia,"Vecchi, M (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, The Burroughs London NW4 4BT, England.",m.vecchi@mdx.ac.uk,"Bournakis, Ioannis/AAG-3244-2020; Venturini, Francesco/AFC-0519-2022","Bournakis, Ioannis/0000-0002-7065-9316; Venturini, Francesco/0000-0002-7295-268X",,,,,67,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We provide several structural insights that improve our understanding of stable choice functions. In particular, (1) we show that every stable choice function is generated by a unique simple choice function, which never excludes more than one alternative, (2) we completely characterize which simple choice functions give rise to stable choice functions, and (3) we prove a strong relationship between stability and a new property of tournament solutions called local reversal symmetry. Based on these findings, we provide the first concrete tournament-consisting of 24 alternatives-in which the tournament equilibrium set fails to be stable. Furthermore, we prove that there is no more discriminating stable tournament solution than the bipartisan set and that the bipartisan set is the unique most discriminating tournament solution which satisfies standard properties proposed in the literature.","[Brandt, Felix; Seedig, Hans Georg] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Brill, Markus] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Suksompong, Warut] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Technical University of Munich; University of Oxford; Stanford University,"Brandt, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",brandtf@in.tum.de,"Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023","Brill, Markus/0000-0001-9509-7017","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2312/7-1, BR 2312/7-2]; Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; ERC Starting Grant [639945]; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; MIT-Germany program",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); ERC Starting Grant; Stanford Graduate Fellowship(Stanford University); MIT-Germany program,"This material is based onwork supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Grants BR 2312/7-1 and BR 2312/7-2, by a Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, by ERC Starting Grant 639945, by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship, and by the MIT-Germany program.

In all cases this process is undertaken by purchasing these liabilities from private sector intermediaries rather than directly from the government. This paper estimates the cost of this round-trip transaction - government issuance of liabilities and central bank purchases of those liabilities in the secondary market - for the UK. I estimate that this cost amounts to about 0.5% of the total value of QE (over E1.8 billion in my sample).

In this paper, we show how a life-cycle perspective alters our impression of how the UK tax and benefit system affects women's work incentives. Given that actual longitudinal data conflate age effects, cohort effects and policy effects, and, in the UK, are not available covering the full life cycle, we use simulated data produced by a rich, dynamic structural model of female labour supply and human capital that incorporates family formation and fertility. We find that individuals experience considerable variability in work incentives across life that outweighs the variability across individuals. Changes in the presence of children and a partner, as well as the level of any partner's earnings, are key to explaining these patterns: work incentives vary dramatically depending on family composition and the earnings of any partner, especially for the lower-skilled, and most women experience a number of different family types during the course of their lives.","[Brewer, Mike] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Brewer, Mike; Shaw, Jonathan] IFS, London, England; [Shaw, Jonathan] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of Essex,"Brewer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England.;Brewer, M (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.",mbrewer@essex.ac.uk; jonshaw@turing.ac.uk,,"Brewer, Mike/0000-0003-0759-0384","ESRC/HMRC [RES-194-23-0016]; SRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/M010147/1]; ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change at the University of Essex [ES/L009153/1]; NORFACE ERA-NET (New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Cooperation in Europe Network) [462-14-010]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC/HMRC; SRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change at the University of Essex; NORFACE ERA-NET (New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Cooperation in Europe Network); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are very grateful to Alex Beer, Jennifer Bradley, Juliet Clarke, Christoph Erben, Saranna Fordyce, Jonathan Gillham, Ivan Mathers, Kate Mieske, Stefania Porcu, Matthew Whittaker and Edward Zamboni for discussing this research and its policy implications.

Using administrative data on firm subsidies in economically lagging regions of Great Britain, we contrast two alternative hypotheses. Economic geography models imply that firms at an industry's core can sustain higher tax burdens or require lower subsidies than firms in more remote locations. Conversely, political economy models predict firms at the industry's core to be more successful at lobbying government, particularly at the subnational level, thus obtaining more favourable fiscal treatment. Our evidence suggests that local government agencies structure subsidy offers to favour pre-existing employment in locally agglomerated industries, behaviour more in line with theories of policy capture than with economic geography models. Grants administered by central government agencies, however, conform more strongly with the predictions of economic geography models.","[Brulhart, Marius] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm HEC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Simpson, Helen] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England",University of Lausanne; University of Bristol,"Simpson, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England.",helen.simpson@bristol.ac.uk,"Simpson, Helen D/B-7696-2008","Brulhart, Marius/0000-0001-5483-0219","Swiss National Science Foundation [166618, 130648, 147668]; ESRC [RES-060-25-0033]; Leverhulme Trust (Philip Leverhulme Prize); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme Trust (Philip Leverhulme Prize); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant 166618, Sinergia grants 130648 and 147668, NCCR 'Trade Regulation'), the ESRC (RES-060-25-0033) and the Leverhulme Trust (Philip Leverhulme Prize).",,47,3,3,3,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We then apply this model (called CLG) to three different economies: a flexible, finance-driven economy (the UK), an economy with wage moderation (Germany), and an economy with structural rigidities (Spain). In these three countries, goods and credit market frictions play a dominant role in entry costs and account for 75% to 85% of the total entry costs. In the goods market, adverse supply shocks are amplified through their propagation to the demand side, as they also imply income losses for consumers. This adds up to, at most, an additional 15% to 25% to the impact of the shocks. Finally, the speed of matching in the goods market and the credit market accounts for a small fraction of unemployment: most variation in unemployment comes from the speed of matching in the labor market.

While most of the social psychology literature emphasizes the role of autonomy, recent economic research has provided an alternative explanation based on reciprocity. To understand the behavioral mechanisms underlying such reactions, we conduct an experiment in which we compare two treatments: one in which control is exerted directly by the principal; and the other in which it is exerted by a third party enjoying no residual claimancy rights (third-party control). The results indicate that when either the principal or a third party decides to control the average level of effort that is selected by the agents is similar. What changes remarkably are the agents' reactions to the decision of the other participants not to control. When the principal decides not to control, then the agent exerts greater effort relative to the case when the third party decides not to control. Agents seem to reward principals who abstain from control for their trust, rather than punish controlling ones for their distrust. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we develop an oracle inequality for the conservative Lasso only assuming the existence of a certain number of moments. This is done by means of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality. We allow for heteroskedastic non-subgaussian error terms and covariates. Next, we desparsify the conservative Lasso estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of parameters. Our simulations reveal that the desparsified conservative Lasso estimates the parameters more precisely than the desparsified Lasso, has better size properties and produces confidence bands with superior coverage rates.

Firstly we construct cross-border ownership networks for banks located in European countries. We then exploit the 2010 European debt crisis as a natural experiment. The analysis shows that subsidiary banks located outside of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS) but with ownership linkages to these countries have a lower loan growth rate during the crisis period. This suggests that the liquidity shock experienced by GIIPS countries was indeed transmitted to those banks through ownership linkages. Larger subsidiary banks and those subsidiaries that were more profitable are found to be more resilient to the shock. We also find that the parent bank's characteristics affect the transmission of the shock, supporting the notion of an internal capital market operating within these banks. (C) 2017 The Authors.

A specific contemporary challenge is to account for the prolonged slow growth and stagnant productivity that has followed the post-financial crisis recession, along with low inflation despite low unemployment (notably in the UK). We set out a simple three-equation model, which extends the core model in our two recent books (Carlin and Soskice, 2006, 2015) to one with two equilibria and two associated macroeconomic policy regimes. One is the standard inflation-targeting policy regime with equilibrium associated with central bank inflation targeting through monetary policy. It is joined by a second, Keynesian policy regime and equilibrium, with a zero lower bound (ZLB) in the nominal interest rate and a ZLB in inflation in which only fiscal policy is effective (Ragot, 2015). Our approach is related to the Benigno and Fornaro (2016) Keynesian-Wicksellian model of growth with business cycles. It diverges from New Keynesian models because although we attribute model-consistent expectations to the policy-maker, we do not assume that these are the basis for inflation and growth expectations of workers and firms. We compare our approach to Ravn and Sterk's related multiple equilibrium New Keynesian model (Ravn and Sterk, 2016).","[Carlin, Wendy] UCL, CEPR, London, England; [Carlin, Wendy] Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Soskice, David] London Sch Econ, London, England",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Carlin, W (通讯作者)，UCL, CEPR, London, England.;Carlin, W (通讯作者)，Ctr Macroecon, London, England.",w.carlin@ucl.ac.uk; d.w.soskice@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,16,17,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We show that generic robustness follows if the class of games of interest is large relative to the class of games in which it has been embedded. This result is used to show why interim correlated rationalizable actions are generically robust to players' hierarchies of beliefs as established by Weinstein and Yildiz (2007) even without their richness condition. It is also used to provide a formal sense according to which, in the setting of Kajii and Morris (1997b), the set of representations of a complete information game is small in the space of incomplete information games in which it is embedded. This difference in relative sizes makes the robustness problems of Kajii and Morris (1997b) and Weinstein and Yildiz (2007) be incomparable and helps explaining why their conclusions differ so significantly.

The aim of the paper is to analyse the transitional dynamics of unemployment and vacancies when financial constraints are in place. We model the financial sector as a monopolistically competitive banking sector that intermediates financial capital between firms. This structure implies a per period financial resource constraint which has a closed form solution and describes the transition path of unemployment and vacancies to their steady state values. We show that the transition path crucially depends on the degree of wage flexibility. When wages do not depend on the unemployment rate the transition path is always downward sloping. This implies unemployment and vacancies adjust in opposite directions as observed in the data. When calibrating the model to the Great Recession and its aftermath we find that the lack of an improvement in the financial sector's effectiveness to intermediate resources played a crucial role in the slow recovery of the labour market.

Objectives: To explore outcomes relating to previously conducted single-technology appraisals (STAB) with base-case ICERs of less than 10,000 pound/QALY. Methods: All STAB with published guidance from 2009 to 2016 were included; those with company base-case ICERs of less than 10,000 pound/QALY were identified and analyzed. A secondary analysis was also conducted for those with a company base-case ICER of 10,000 to 15,000 pound/QALY. Relevant data were extracted and presented in a narrative and in tables. Results: In total, 15% (26 of 171) of STAB included a company submission with a base-case ICER of less than 10,000 pound/QALY. Of these, 73% (19 of 26) were given positive recommendations after the first Appraisal Committee (AC) meeting, whereas 27% (7 of 26) were initially given a Minded No before receiving a positive recommendation in the final appraisal determination, albeit with restricted recommendations for three technologies. Five STAB had company base-case ICERs of 10,000 to 15,000 pound/QALY and all received a positive recommendation after the first AC meeting. Conclusions: Most previous STAB with a company base case ICER of 10,000 or even 15,000 pound/QALY received a positive recommendation after the first AC meeting, but a number of them proved more complicated and required detailed appraisal, which influenced the final recommendation. This finding might have implications for the proposed fast-track process of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.","[Carroll, Christopher; Kaltenthaler, Eva] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Houten, Rachel; Boland, Angela; Dickson, Rumona] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Sheffield; University of Liverpool,"Carroll, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",c.carroll@shef.ac.uk,"Carroll, Chris/HHC-1512-2022",,,,,,15,1,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21,3,,,,,341,350,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.09.006,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566842,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428019200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

A dynamic panel data least squares dummy variable estimator estimator is employed over a sample of 15 European Union countries during the period 1990-2012. The empirical results show that real GDP growth decreases when fiscal austerity measures are implemented, especially if they are spending-driven. Cuts in public expenditure undermine economic growth, namely if they slash spending on public order, recreation, and education. Spending cuts on education, in particular, affect the investment in human capital, harming not only growth but also economic, social, and human development. The unemployment rate also proved to be significantly boosted when austerity measures restrict spending on education, whereas income inequality rises when social protection expenditures are cut.","[Castro, Vitor] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Castro, Vitor] Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Coimbra, Portugal",Loughborough University,"Castro, V (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England.",v.m.q.castro@lboro.ac.uk,"Castro, Vítor/P-4837-2019","Castro, Vítor/0000-0002-6426-6663",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015",,44,5,6,2,23,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

We use unique panel data which provide details of 1.3 million treatment claims by Scottish NHS dentists made between 1998 and 2007. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity of both patients and dentists we estimate a series of fixed-effects models that are informed by a theoretical model of X-ray delivery and identify the effects on dental X-raying of dentists moving from a fixed salary to fee-for-service and patients moving from co-payment to exemption.

The government instruments are a pension scheme and a age-independent nonlinear income tax schedule. At the second-best optimum, the pension system constrains the agents' labor supply behavior, forcing them to work to achieve a required lifetime performance. Income taxes affect labor supply directly, but also indirectly through pension incentives. The indirect effect of taxes counteracts the usual forces in the efficiency-redistribution tradeoff: through the interplay with the pension system, decreasing taxes induces redistribution and reduces productive efficiency.","[Chone, Philippe] Univ Parris Saclay, Ctr Rech Econ & Stat CREST, 5 Ave Henry Chatelier, F-91120 Palaiseau, France; [Laroque, Guy] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Laroque, Guy] Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France",University of London; University College London; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Laroque, G (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Laroque, G (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",philippe.chone@ensae.fr; g.laroque@ucl.ac.uk,,,European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSC WTBDS],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"Funding is acknowledged from the European Research Council (reference ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSC WTBDS).

These high returns often need to be balanced by the high liquidity costs of trading in illiquid emerging markets. Several studies have shown that central bank and government policies are significant determinants of market liquidity. We investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on the market and firm level liquidity of eight emerging stock markets of Asia. Using four different (il)liquidity measures and nine macroeconomic variables, we find that changes in the money supply, government expenditure and private borrowing significantly affect stock market liquidity. Illiquidity is also strongly affected by the bank rate, short-term interest rate and government borrowing. We demonstrate that 'crowding out' and 'cost of funds' effects exist in these markets. Other major findings are that some markets are more sensitive to local macroeconomic news than world factors, the impact on size based portfolios largely depends on the instruments used by the central banks and government, the liquidity of the manufacturing sector is affected by changes in any policy variables, financial institutions are only influenced by monetary policy variables, and the service sector is least affected.

Our findings show evidence of instability in standard cointegration models, suggesting the possibility of structural breaks and nonlinearity in the relationship between house prices and non-housing CPI. This motivates the use of a time-varying approach, namely, a quantile cointegration analysis, which allows the cointegrating coefficient to vary over the conditional distribution of house prices and simultaneously test for the existence of cointegration at each quantile. Our results suggest that the U.S non-housing CPI and house price index series are cointegrated at lower quantiles only, with house prices over-hedging inflation at these quantiles. In addition, we also show that this result holds for higher price levels only. Using these two sets of results, we conclude that house prices act as an inflation hedge when the latter is relatively higher and the former is lower.","[Christou, Christina] Open Univ Cyprus, Sch Econ & Management, CY-2220 Latsia, Cyprus; [Gupta, Rangan; Nyakabawo, Wendy] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, CoIlege Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Open University of Cyprus; University of Pretoria; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, CoIlege Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",christina.christou@ouc.ac.cy; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; wnyakabawo@gmail.com; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,65,18,18,0,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

On the other hand, however, these projects may generate larger negative externalities for certain parts of society. One example is the erection of a nuclear power-plant, a measure that is widely considered to render a country's energy provision less dependent on supply from outside. On the other hand, it possibly causes a feeling of insecurity among people who live in the vicinity of such a power station, and can furthermore have negative economic consequences in so far as the price of land and of houses may decline in this area. How should decisions on public projects with larger negative externalities be taken? Assuming that the benefits for all those who are directly or indirectly affected by such a project are roughly the same, a cost-sharing or burden-sharing method is proposed that focuses on a weighted difference between the economic performance of a particular region and the average performance of all regions concerned. The weight is to be determined by an impartial observer.","[Colombo, Camilla] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Gaertner, Wulf] Univ Osnabruck, Dept Econ, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; [Gaertner, Wulf] Ctr Philosophy Nat & Social Sci LSE, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University Osnabruck,"Gaertner, W (通讯作者)，Univ Osnabruck, Dept Econ, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.;Gaertner, W (通讯作者)，Ctr Philosophy Nat & Social Sci LSE, London, England.",wulf.gaertner@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

More specifically, we examine a reform that both introduced a new caregiving allowance and expanded the availability of publicly funded home care services, on both hospital admissions (both on the internal and external margin) and length of stay. We find robust evidence of a reduction in both hospital admissions and utilization among both those receiving a caregiving allowance and, albeit less intensely, among beneficiaries of publicly funded home care, which amounts to 11% of total healthcare costs. These effects were stronger when regions had an operative regional health and social care coordination plan in place. Consistently, a subsequent reduction in the subsidy, five years after its implementation, is found to significantly attenuate such effects.

The paper compares a number of alternative explanations put forward in the public debate after the referendum. The empirical analysis suggests that the outcome of the referendum can be linked to an increasing tension between the ever increasing internationalization of local firms and the localistic' attitude of their employees. Brexit can be seen as the result of a process of split Europeanization' whereby Euroscepticism is triggered by the increasing mismatch between internationalized economies (and corporate economic interests) and localistic societies (and workers' attitudes and cultural preferences).,"[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Di Cataldo, Marco] London Sch Econ, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Faggian, Alessandra] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Social Sci, Laquila, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI),"Crescenzi, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk,"Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; Di Cataldo, Marco/AAK-8373-2020; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933; Di Cataldo, Marco/0000-0002-2808-1776",European Research Council [639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG",,40,26,28,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

One focuses on the systemic level, whereas the other is concerned with the individual level. They therefore analyse relatively distinct causal mechanisms. Thus, an important question is whether these approaches can be reconciled. Another related question is how FAD- and FED-based explanations relate to classical Malthusian views about rapid food requirement increase (FRI). This paper analyses these questions and argues that these three approaches can indeed be reconciled within a single framework by outlining the causal sources of FAD, FED and FRI. This task requires, among other things, the separation of ontological categories and empirical measures. As a consequence of this argument, the paper suggests that there are only seven possible ontological combinations of how a famine situation can arise as a direct cause. Simultaneously, it maintains that there are virtually an infinite number of ways in which these combinations may act as indirect causes (rooted in economic, political and social conditions). The analysis is exemplified by the Bengal famine of 1943 because that famine is a well-known case. The wider research and policy applicability of this general account are discussed but have yet to be tested in relation to other scarcity cases (water, land, fish). This synthesis is made possible by the incorporation of critical realist interventions into economic theory.","[Daoud, Adel] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Daoud, Adel] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Cambridge; University of Gothenburg,"Daoud, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",ad836@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,107,9,9,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

For this analysis we created a two-wave panel spanning 10 years to study exit, growth and decline, by re-surveying 1000 firms randomly selected from the 2003 National Industrial Census. We find strong differences in exit patterns by region and firm size. Former owners and managers commonly cite personal circumstances as the reason for exit in the case of small firms and increasing costs in the case of large firms. We show that both growth and selection played only a small role in the evolution of the firm size distribution, contradicting earlier work on Ghana. Overall, the picture we paint of manufacturing in Ghana is not a positive one: total employment by firms operating before 2003 decreased from 134,863 in 2003 to 74,319 in 2013, although we cannot explore to what extent new employment in firms that entered after 2003-who were not surveyed-compensated for this decline.","[Davies, Elwyn] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Kerr, Andrew] Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Oxford; University of Cape Town,"Kerr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",andrew.kerr@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The amount of disclosure required for a fair process is a question of law, but I argue that the answer to the legal question depends heavily on the practical realities of applying economics and using econometrics in cases. Using examples from recent competition cases, I consider (i) what disclosure is required for a competition authority or court to operate a genuinely fair process, and (ii) the extent to which recent trends in the availability and use of data are changing the extent and nature of the disclosure (at least to advisers) required in competition investigations. The trend towards greater disclosure in UK competition investigations seems likely to play out in other jurisdictions, within both litigation and competition proceedings because economic analyses on cases are increasingly using empirical evidence developed using ever-bigger datasets. Judicial oversight of competition authorities should support this process.","[Davis, Peter] Cornerstone Res London Off, London, England",,"Davis, P (通讯作者)，Cornerstone Res London Off, London, England.",PDavis@cornerstone.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Specifically, this paper focuses on the eco-innovation (EI) pathway towards a CE, and tries to coordinate available but fragmented findings regarding how transformative innovation can foster this transition while removing obstacles to sustainability. Drawing upon a new corpus of both academic and non-academic literature, this work offers a framework for analysis, as well as an evidence-based survey of the challenges, for a green structural change of the economy. We argue that the combination of the innovation systems' view with the more recent transformation turn in innovation studies may provide an appropriate perspective for understanding the transition to a CE.

By contrast, the model-averaged forecasts based on both parametric (Autoregressive Integrated model) and nonparametric models (SSA-HW) are able to provide improved forecasts, particularly for the ten trading days ahead forecasting horizon. For robustness purposes, we build two trading strategies based on the aforementioned forecasts, which further confirm that the SSA-HW and the ARI-SSAHW are able to generate significantly higher net daily returns in the out-of-sample period.

The predator is the part of the financial sector that issues credit money for non-output transactions. It increases the indebtedness ratio and inflates bubbles that eventually have a negative impact on the real rate of growth (the prey). From this basis, we build a couple of models that may lead to self-contained or explosive cycles. Even in the first case, there is a risk of a financial collapse when certain variables move far away from their longterm equilibrium positions. In order to tame the cycle and avoid extreme positions, governments should ban the expansion of credit money for the purchase of assets and introduce permanent checks to risky credit.","[Dejuan, Oscar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain; [Dejuan-Bitria, Daniel] London Sch Econ, London, England",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dejuán, O (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain.",oscar.dejuan@uclm.es,"Dejuan, Oscar/E-9203-2017","Dejuan, Oscar/0000-0002-9319-6609",European Fund for Regional Development; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [PPII-2014-006-P],European Fund for Regional Development(European Union (EU)); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha(Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha),Richard Werner (Southampton Management School) made useful comments on a first draft of this paper.

Exploiting variation in companies' marginal tax rates, we find a positive and substantial long-run tax effect on leverage. Leverage responds more to decreases in the marginal tax rate, and it responds to changes in the marginal rather than the average tax rate. Most importantly, we find that the marginal tax rate based on tax returns has greater explanatory power for companies' leverage than the marginal tax rate based on financial statements.

One of the open issues in this literature is the identification of the determinants of resilience, that is, the factors that influence the evolutionary dynamic process of robustness and adaptability registered in particular places. The selected sample of papers in this special issue provides original contributions for answering the question about what determines regional economic resilience. The common findings of the contributions can be seen as quite robust by relying upon different measures of resilience, cases, methodologies and time periods. Three main conclusions arise from the special issue: most of the determinants of economic resilience show regularities across time and space. The factors that contribute to explain the economic performance of places in normal times are also useful for understanding the patterns observed during and after recessionary events. Policymakers can play an active role in sustaining resilient economies by addressing resources and efforts in the right policy areas without waiting for crises.","[Di Caro, Paolo] Italian Minist Econ & Finance, Dept Finance, Rome, Italy; [Di Caro, Paolo] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Portsmouth; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Di Caro, P (通讯作者)，Italian Minist Econ & Finance, Dept Finance, Rome, Italy.;Di Caro, P (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",pdicaro@unict.it; ugo.fratesi@polimi.it,"Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X",,,,,22,48,49,13,80,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Using the restructuring of the U.S. electricity market as our case study, we find support for our theoretical predictions. Our findings imply a greater emphasis on efficiency at coal mines contracting with restructured plants. The evidence suggests a 17% improvement in productivity at these mines, relative to those contracting with regulated plants. We find, on the other hand, that transaction costs may have increased.

Tax credits benefit taxpayers at all income levels by reducing their net tax liability and modify the price of out-of-pocket expenditure. To the extent that consumer demand is price elastic, they may influence the amount of eligible healthcare expenditure for which taxpayers may claim a credit. These effects influence, in turn, income distributions and taxpayers' health status and therefore income-related inequality in health. Redistributive consequences of tax credits have been widely investigated. However, little is known about the ability of tax credits to alleviate health inequality. In this paper, we study the potential effects that tax credits for health expenses may have on income-related inequality in health status with reference to the Italian institutional setting. The analysis is performed using a tax-benefit microsimulation model that reproduces the personal income tax and incorporates taxpayers' behavioral responses to changes in tax credit rate.

There was a fivefold increase in repo borrowing before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Why? Did banks' dependence on non-resaleable debt precipitate the crisis? In this paper, we develop a model of bank lending with credit frictions. The key feature of the model is that debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt. Such borrowing has a dark side: It causes credit chains to form, because, if a bank makes a loan via non resaleable debt and needs liquidity, it cannot sell the loan but must borrow via a new contract. These credit chains are a source of systemic risk, as one bank's default harms not only its creditors but also its creditors' creditors. Overall, our model suggests that reducing credit market frictions may have an adverse effect on the financial system and even lead to the failures of financial institutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The index combines monetary and non-monetary indicators, updates deprivation cut-offs for certain traditional unsatisfied basic needs indicators and includes some new indicators, aiming to maximize regional comparability within the data constraints. The index is estimated for 17 countries of the region at two points in timeone around 2005 and the other around 2012. Overall, we estimate about 28 percent of people are multidimensionally poor in 2012 in the region. We find statistically significant reductions of poverty in most countries, both in terms of incidence and intensity over the period under analysis. However, important disparities between rural and urban areas remain. Statistical scrutiny of the index suggests that it captures the state of poverty relatively well while maintaining a certain parsimony and being highly robust to changes in weights, indicators, and poverty cut-off.","[Emma Santos, Maria; Villatoro, Pablo] Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Sur IIES, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Emma Santos, Maria; Villatoro, Pablo] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Caribe CEPAL, Santiago, Chile",,"Santos, ME (通讯作者)，UNS, CONICET, Dept Econ, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Sur IIES, San Andres 800, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Santos, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Argentinal Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat, Oxford, England.",msantos@uns.edu.ar,"Santos, Maria Emma/ABA-1817-2021","Villatoro, Pablo/0009-0002-0491-2560","ANPCyT-PICT [2015-2079]; CONICET-PIP [11220150100659CO01]; ESRC [ES/N01457X/1, ES/I032827/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I032827/1, ES/N01457X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ANPCyT-PICT(ANPCyT); CONICET-PIP(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are deeply grateful to Xavier Mancero and Pascual Gerstenfeld for insightful comments and suggestions throughout this research.

DEA has immediately been recognized as a modern tool for performance measurement. Since then, a large and considerable amount of articles has been appeared, including significant breakthroughs in theory and a great portion of works on DEA applications, both public and private sectors, to assess the efficiency and productivity of their activities. Although there have been several bibliographic collections reported, a comprehensive analysis and listing of DEA-related articles covering its first four decades of history is still missing. This paper, thus, aims to report an extensive listing of DEA-related articles including theory and methodology developments and real applications in diversified scenarios from 1978 to end of 2016.

In this study, we robustly observe this behavior (called chaotic itinerancy) in a model of multi-regional business cycles, in which all regions of a national economy are homogeneous and connected through producers' behavior based on the average level announced by the government. Although a producer very slowly adjusts his/her output towards the average level, regional business cycles begin to synchronize because of the entrainment effect. Moreover, when a producer emphasizes the profit maximization more and when puts more weight on the average level in his/her decision-making, the economy is more likely to exhibit such intermittent transition. Further, it is clarified that behind intermittent transition exist cycles among periodic orbits with different number of unstable directions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The most salient feature of these schools is that, despite remaining part of the state sector, they operate with more autonomy than the predecessors they replaced. Two distinct periods of academy school introduction have taken place, under the auspices of different governments. The first batch was initiated in the 2002-03 school year by the Labour government of the time, and was a school improvement programme directly aimed at turning around badly performing schools. The second batch involved a mass academisation process following the change of government in May 2010 and the Academies Act of that year, which resulted in increased heterogeneity of new academies. This paper compares the two batches of introduction with the aim of getting a better understanding of their similarities and differences, and their importance for education policy. To do so, we study what types of schools were more likely to change to academy status in the two programmes, and the impact of this change on the quality of new pupil enrolments into the new types of school. Whilst we do point out some similarities, these are the exception rather than the norm. For the most part, our analysis reveals a number of marked dissimilarities between the two programmes, in terms of both the characteristics of schools that became academies and the changes in pupil intakes that occurred post-conversion.","[Eyles, Andrew] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Eyles, Andrew; Machin, Stephen; Silva, Olmo] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England; [Silva, Olmo] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Eyles, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Eyles, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.",A.Eyles@lse.ac.uk; S.J.Machin@lse.ac.uk; O.Silva@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,12,12,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We further investigate empirically the mechanisms underlying this trade liberalization effect, and find that input tariff reductions decrease marginal costs, and their effects on markup adjustments are more profound among firms with higher import dependence. Moreover, we exploit unique features of Chinese data by comparing results for two trade regimes: ordinary trade (wherein firms pay import tariffs to import) and processing trade (wherein firms are not subject to import tariffs). While the aforementioned trade liberalization effects and mechanisms only apply to ordinary trade, processing trade samples are used in a placebo test. The paper also shows that more productive firms charge higher markups for products. All these findings are robust to alternative markup measures including one estimate using physical-quantity output data, different production function specifications, a subsample consisting only of pure exporters, and estimations based on our theoretical derivations.

By 2020, experts expect developments to arise chiefly through engineering, manufacturing and incremental chemistry changes, and expect additional R&D funding to have little impact on cost. By 2030, experts indicate that more fundamental chemistry changes are possible, particularly under higher R&D funding scenarios, but are not inevitable. Experts suggest that significant improvements in cycle life (eg. doubling or greater) are more achievable than in cost, particularly by 2020, and that R&D could play a greater role in driving these. Experts expressed some concern, but had relatively little knowledge, of the environmental impact of LiBs.

These are repeated games in which each player may have quitting actions that terminate the game. We provide three simple geometric and strongly related conditions for the weak approachability of a convex target set. The first is sufficient: it guarantees that, for any fixed horizon, a player has a strategy ensuring that the expected time-average payoff vector converges to the target set as horizon goes to infinity. The third is necessary: if it is not satisfied, the opponent can weakly exclude the target set. We analyze in detail the special cases where only one of the players has quitting actions. Finally, we study uniform approachability where the strategy should not depend on the horizon and demonstrate that, in contrast with classical Blackwell approachability for convex sets, weak approachability does not imply uniform approachability.

Accordingly, the main aim was to explore the marginal effectiveness of care when measured in terms of people's overall care-related quality of life (CRQoL) and assess changes in marginal effect for increasing intensity. The associated aim was to refine and apply an observational method to estimate marginal effectiveness. A production function approach was used with survey data, including Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit-measured CRQoL, whereby we statistically modelled the expected relationship between service utilisation rates and CRQoL. This method seeks to limit endogeneity issues by controlling on observables and using instrumental variable. Using a survey of publicly funded long-term care service users in England, we found that community-based long-term care significantly improved people's CRQoL but with diminishing marginal effects and effects differentiated by baseline impairment levels. There are implications for how the care system should respond to changes in global public budgets. For example, where there is unmet need, a system aimed to maximise (unadjusted) CRQoL would put more emphasis on access (more recipients) than intensity of support compared to a system operating on a needs basis.","[Forder, Julien; Vadean, Florin; Rand, Stacey] Univ Kent, Qual & Outcomes Person Ctr Care Policy Res Unit Q, PSSRU, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Malley, Juliette] London Sch Econ, Qual & Outcomes Person Ctr Care Policy Res Unit Q, PSSRU, London, England",University of Kent; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Forder, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Personal Social Serv Res Unit, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",j.e.forder@kent.ac.uk,"; Vadean, Florin/J-4743-2016; Malley, Juliette/B-5537-2014","Forder, Julien/0000-0001-7793-4328; Rand, Stacey/0000-0001-9071-2842; Vadean, Florin/0000-0001-7882-3400; Malley, Juliette/0000-0001-5759-1647",Department of Health: Policy Research Programme [QORU (PRP 100/0001)],Department of Health: Policy Research Programme,"Department of Health: Policy Research Programme, Grant/Award Number: QORU (PRP 100/0001)",,30,12,13,7,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27,3,,,,,E43,E58,,10.1002/hec.3612,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3612,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29098741,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428324700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our approach employs sequential importance sampling and is based on deriving an unbiased estimate of the likelihood within a Metropolis chain. Under fairly weak regularity conditions unbiasedness guarantees that the stationary density of the chain is the exact posterior, not an approximation. Results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation using two examples. The first is a dynamic game of entry involving a small number of firms whose heterogeneity is based on their current costs due to feedback through capacity constraints arising from past entry. The second is an Ericson and Pakes (1995) style game with a large number of firms whose heterogeneity is based on the qualitiof their products with firms competing through investment in product quality that affects their market share and profitability. Our approach facilitates estimation of dynamic games with either small or large number of players whose heterogeneity is determined by latent state variables, discrete or continuous, that are subject to endogenous feedback from past actions.

The tests are based on the Swamy statistic. We establish the asymptotic null distribution of the tests under large panels. A prominent advantage of the proposed tests is that they are easy to implement in empirical applications. Monte Carlo experiments show evidence that the tests have good finite sample performance in terms of size and power. The tests are then applied to study the cross-section of firms' excess asset returns using financial data on U.S. firms. The tests allow us to assess, for a given quantile of the distribution of excess returns, whether the linear effect of the pricing factors in standard linear asset pricing models is the same across stocks. The results confirm the validity of those models for the mean and central quantiles. However, for tail quantiles, the slope homogeneity tests reject the null hypothesis providing empirical evidence of pricing anomalies. This suggests that the effect of firm characteristics on the distribution of excess returns is heterogeneous across stocks during booms and busts.","[Galvao, Antonio F.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Juhl, Ted] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] Univ San Andres, CONICET, Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Iowa; University of Kansas; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Southampton,"Galvao, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Tippie Coll Business, W284 PBB,21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",antonio-galvao@uiowa.edu,"Olmo, Jose/Y-7042-2019; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Olmo, Jose/0000-0002-0437-7812; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929","Equity and Poverty: Methods and Implications, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana [ECO2013-46516-C4-1-R]; Equity and Development Research Group, Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR2014-1279]","Equity and Poverty: Methods and Implications, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana; Equity and Development Research Group, Generalitat de Catalunya","The authors would like to express their appreciation to Valentina Corradi, Roger Koenker, Tom Parker, Hashem Pesaran, Jean-Yves Pitarakis, Kevin Sheppard, Suyong Song, and participants in seminars at UIUC, University of Iowa, and UWM, Central Bank of Brazil, and ES NASM for useful comments and discussions regarding this article.

Based on an extensive dataset with personality traits, combined with socio-economic data, our findings suggest that the regional clustering of these personality traits contribute to an understanding of the regional dispersion of the Brexit vote. We find evidence that psychological 'Openness' is the personality trait that matters most and that modest changes in this trait could actually have swung the vote across UK districts. Moreover, the relevance of psychological Openness solves the puzzle that UK districts that are relatively dependent on trade with the EU predominantly voted for Leave. By including psychological factors, our results show how we can arrive at a better understanding of the geography of the discontent with globalisation.","[Garretsen, Harry; Stoker, Janka I.; Soudis, Dimitrios] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Martin, Ron L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Rentfrow, Peter Jason] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, England",University of Groningen; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Garretsen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",j.h.garretsen@rug.nl; j.i.stoker@rug.nl; d.soudis@rug.nl; rlm1@cam.ac.uk; pjr39@cam.ac.uk,"Rentfrow, Peter Jason/ABB-9257-2021; Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","Rentfrow, Peter Jason/0000-0002-9068-2118; Stoker, Janka/0000-0001-5339-1891",,,,,37,34,35,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Linking administrative records from Hospital Episode Statistics (2003-2012) with immigration data drawn from the UK Labour Force Survey, we find that immigration reduced waiting times for outpatient referrals and did not have significant effects on waiting times in accident and emergency departments (A&E) and elective care. The reduction in outpatient waiting times can be explained by the fact that immigration increases natives' internal mobility and that immigrants tend to be healthier than natives who move to different areas. Finally, we find evidence that immigration increased waiting times for outpatient referrals in more deprived areas outside of London. The increase in average waiting times in more deprived areas is concentrated in the years immediately following the 2004 EU enlargement and disappears in the medium term (e.g., 3-4 years).

We study this issue quantitatively in a small New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which the risk of financial crises depends on excess credit.'' We compare monetary policy rules responding to the output gap to rules that respond to excess credit. We find that responding to credit can lead to a lower average probability of financial crisis, at the cost of higher cyclical volatility in inflation and output.

Tail distribution of returns of both stock market index and individual stocks is evaluated and compared with the theoretical distribution found by Gabaix et al. (2003, 2006). For stock market index, recursive and rolling estimation are used. In recursive estimation, we find that all the developed markets obey the Cubic Law of the Stock Returns, while most of the emerging countries exhibit heavier tail with a tail index lower than 3 at 95% significance level. In rolling estimation, the tail index in the developed markets does not stabilise around 3, and after 2008 financial crisis, all the developed markets and most emerging ones suffer a drop in the tail index.

For stationary random fields on a regular spatial lattice, we propose an autoregressive nonparametric spectral density estimate that is guaranteed positive even when suitable edge-effect correction is employed and is simple to compute using least squares. Our estimate is based on truncating a true half-plane infinite autoregressive representation, while also allowing the truncation length to diverge in all dimensions to avoid the potential bias due to truncation at a fixed lag-length. Uniform consistency of the proposed estimate is established, and new criteria for order selection are also suggested and studied in practical settings. The asymptotic distribution of the estimate is shown to be zero-mean normal and independent at fixed distinct frequencies, mirroring the behaviour for time series. A small Monte Carlo experiment examines finite sample performance. Technically the key to the results is the covariance structure of stationary random fields defined on regularly spaced lattices. We show the covariance matrix to satisfy a generalization of the Toeplitz property familiar from time series analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to answer whether the subsidies only ensure that green electricity plants are profitable or whether other market participant as, for example, landowners benefit from the subsidy in the form of windfall gains as well. To identify the causal effect of the subsidies, we investigate the impact of the introduction of a price guarantee in the form of a feed-in tariff for wind electricity in Germany on land prices. We employ two different approaches. Both approaches exploit quasi-experimental variation in wind strength across 260 non-urban counties in combination with the introduction of the subsidies. Based on a difference-in-differences design, we find that land prices increased by roughly 1100 euro in high-wind areas after the introduction of the subsidy. Further, using an instrumental variable estimator we document that around 18% of expected wind turbine profits are capitalized into land prices. Finally, we show that wind turbine subsidies account for 4% of overall agricultural income in 2007.","[Haan, Peter; Simmler, Martin] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Haan, Peter] Free Univ Berlin, Garystr 21, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Simmler, Martin] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; University of Oxford,"Simmler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",martin.simmler@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,DFG [HA 5526/3-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the Editor Chris Knittel, two anonymous referees, Gunnar Breustedt, Mike Devereux, Dominika Langenmayr, Beat Hintermann, and Joel Slemrod as well as seminar participants at DIW Berlin and Oxford University and participants at the IIPP conference 2015 in Dublin and the EEA conference 2015 in Mannheim for helpful comments.

Criticism has been levelled at the assumptions employed in the dominant models, particularly that economic agents are homogeneous and optimizing and that the economy is equilibrating. This paper seeks to explore an interdisciplinary approach to macroeconomic modelling, with techniques drawn from other (natural and social) sciences. Specifically, it discusses agent-based modelling, which is used across a wide range of disciplines, as an example of such a technique. Agent-based models are complementary to existing approaches and are suited to answering macroeconomic questions where complexity, heterogeneity, networks, and heuristics play an important role.","[Haldane, A.

We suggest a counter-argument to this perception in circumstances where modest levels of adverse selection lead to an increase in 'loss coverage', defined as expected losses compensated by insurance for the whole population. This happens if the shift in coverage towards higher risks under adverse selection more than offsets the fall in number of individuals insured. The possibility of this outcome depends on insurance demand elasticities for higher and lower risks. We state elasticity conditions which ensure that for any downward-sloping insurance demand functions, loss coverage when all risks are pooled at a common price is higher than under fully risk-differentiated prices. Empirical evidence suggests that these conditions may be realistic for some insurance markets. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We observe jobs separation and matching, and extend our model to an open economy with migration and delayed policy intervention meant to reduce unemployment. We analyse the stability behaviour of the resulting equilibrium for our dynamic system, including models with Dirac and weak kernels.

However, an important question that has not been addressed empirically is how far net subsidy programmes increase ownership above the level that would have prevailed in the absence of the subsidy (i.e., incremental ownership). This study addresses that gap by investigating the impact of a large-scale mosquito net voucher subsidy--the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS)--on short-term demand for unsubsidised commercial nets, estimating a household demand model with nationally representative household survey data. The results suggest that, despite the TNVS using a categorical targeting approach that did not discriminate by wealth, it still led to a large increase in incremental ownership of mosquito nets, with limited evidence of displacement of unsubsidised sales. Although no evidence is found of an additional TNVS voucher decreasing the number of unsubsidised sales in the same period, results indicate that an additional TNVS voucher reduced the probability of purchasing any unsubsidised net in the same period by 14%. The findings also highlight the critical role played by social learning or campaign messaging in increasing mosquito net ownership.","[Harman, Luke; Dorward, Andrew] Univ London, SOAS, London, England; [Harman, Luke; Goodman, Catherine] LSHTM, London, England; [Harman, Luke; Goodman, Catherine; Dorward, Andrew] LCIRAH, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Harman, L (通讯作者)，Care of Poulton C, CEDEP, LIDC, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England.",279300@alumni.soas.ac.uk,,"Goodman, Catherine/0000-0002-2241-3485",,,,,36,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27,3,,,,,480,492,,10.1002/hec.3587,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3587,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,28960578,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428324700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the Bank of England, the previous generation of policy models is seen in its 1999 medium-term macro model (MTMM). Instead of improving that model to correct its considerable flaws, many shared by other non-DSGE policy models such as the Federal Reserve's FRB/US, it was replaced in 2004 by the DSGE-based BEQM. Though this clearly failed during and after the global financial crisis, it was replaced in 2011 by the DSGE COMPASS, complemented by a 'suite of models'. We provide a general critique of DSGE models for explaining, forecasting and policy analyses at central banks, and suggest new directions for improving current empirical macroeconomic models based on empirical modelling broadly consistent with better theory, rather than seeking to impose simplistic and unrealistic theory.","[Hendry, David F.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Hendry, David F.; Muellbauer, John N.

In this paper, I use a three-party model (consumers, local monopolistic merchants, and a proprietary EPN) with endogenous transaction volumes, heterogeneous card use benefits for merchants and network externalities of card-accepting merchants on cardholders to assess the efficiency and welfare effects of the NSR. I show that the NSR: (i) promotes retail price efficiency for cardholders, and (ii) inefficiently reduces card acceptance among merchants. The NSR can enhance social welfare and improve payment efficiency by shifting output from cash payers to cardholders. However, if network externalities are sufficiently strong, the reduction of card payment acceptance affects cardholders negatively and, with the exception of the EPN, all agents will be worse off under the NSR. This paper also suggests that the NSR may be an instrument to decrease cash usage, but the social optimal policy on the NSR may depend on the competitive conditions in each market.","[Henriques, David] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Henriques, David] Off Commun, Competit Econ, London SE1 9HA, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Henriques, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Henriques, D (通讯作者)，Off Commun, Competit Econ, London SE1 9HA, England.",dthenriques@gmail.com,,,"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [BD/47421/2008, 10.13039/501100001871]",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100001871, Grant Number: BD/47421/2008.",,30,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

This is despite the increasing influence of rising powers in technology transfer, specifically in the area of energy generation. China is an important player in this field. This article has two aims: firstly, it adds to the small but emerging literature on South-South technology transfer by exploring the role of Chinese actors, using the Bui dam in Ghana as a case study. Secondly, the article develops an expanded notion of technology transfer by arguing that technology transfer is not only a technical process, but it is inherently political as it includes crucial issues on decision-making regarding the type of technology that is transferred, who is granted access to the decision-making process, and who benefits from the new technology. In examining technology transfer from this perspective, the article draws on the sociology of technologies approach and the sustainable transitions literature arguing that technology transfer is a contested process that takes place within complex political, economic, social and cultural settings and actor networks. This determines the technology that is transferred, who benefits most, and who is marginalized in the process.","[Hensengerth, Oliver] Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Ellison Pl, Newcastle NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Northumbria University,"Hensengerth, O (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci, Ellison Pl, Newcastle NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",oliver.hensengerth@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Hensengerth, Oliver/0000-0002-6565-692X",German Development Institute; German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ),German Development Institute; German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ),This research was supported by the German Development Institute and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ).

This paper reviews the basic properties with a view to explaining the historical pre-eminence of utility maximisation and addresses the question of what departures from the paradigm may be necessary or wise in order to accommodate richer behavioural patterns. We find that many, though not all, of the behavioural traits discussed in the literature can be approximated sufficiently closely by a random utility framework, allowing analysts to retain the many advantages that such an approach possesses.","[Hess, Stephane; Daly, Andrew; Batley, Richard] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hess, Stephane; Daly, Andrew; Batley, Richard] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@its.leeds.ac.uk,"Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518; Daly, Andrew/0000-0001-5319-2745",European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),Stephane Hess acknowledges the financial support by the European Research Council through the consolidator Grant 615596-DECISIONS.,,84,46,53,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2018,84,2,,,SI,,181,204,,10.1007/s11238-017-9651-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-017-9651-7,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FW8XW,31983783,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000425621300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Salience stimulates extra donations for the NGO, and thus firms have incentives to hide the damage they do in order to avoid public attention. We show that when public attention is scarce, a greater campaign orientation induces industry to invest in greater obfuscation, starving the NGO of funds. The NGO in turn strategically biases its mission away from campaigns and in favor of sector-wide versus firm-specific campaigns but not by as much as a welfare-motivated planner would want. When public attention is avoided by a mixture of substantive and symbolic action, we show that a greater weight on the former induces the NGO to become more campaign-oriented, with social damage lower. Highly competitive industries have greater incentives to commit to substantive actions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, a recent backlash against globalisation has emerged within the global North from the political right, while some support for globalisation has been expressed within the global South.

I present evidence that the lending cut affected firms independently of their banking relationships, through lower aggregate demand and agglomeration spillovers in counties exposed to the lending cut.

The study is based on recently developed approaches to robust inference on the degree of heavy-tailedness and their implications for the analysis of upper-tail inequality discussed in the paper. Among other results, the paper provides robust estimates of heavy-tailedness parameters and tail indices for Russian income distribution and their comparisons with the benchmark values in developed economies reported in the previous literature.

We combine data on geo-coded riots with data on state elections and on demographics and public goods provision to construct a unique panel data set for 16 large states in India from 1981 to 2001. A new instrument is used that draws upon the random variation in the day of the week that Hindu festivals fall on, as set by a lunar calendar. The probability of a riot increases if a Hindu festival falls on a Friday, the holy day for Muslims. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of riots on electoral results. The results are also corrected for under-reporting of riots and their effect on nearby districts.

These utilities are technically and economically inefficient and face large financial losses that prevent further development of the networks. The reforms are introduced to unbundle the vertically integrated utilities and introduce private investment and management, but these efforts often fail due to poorly designed market and incentive models. Focusing on the electricity distribution in developing countries, we propose a business model based on organizing the utilities into distinct activities and businesses. In many developing countries political economy and weak investment conditions do not favour full privatization of utilities. However, in some activities 'competition for the market' and 'management contracts' can provide a partial role for the private actors. The model is based on the concepts of enterprise innovation, emphasizing external collaboration and partnerships and can be operationalized via specialization, where some specific tasks are outsourced. The proposed model can also be applied to developed countries as the energy sectors of both developing and developed countries are undergoing transformation due to new technologies such as communications, distributed generation (DGs), and active demand response.","[Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Thakur, Tripta] NIT Bhopal, Bhopal, India; [Bag, Baidyanath] NIT Kurukshetra, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India",Durham University; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology Bhopal; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,24,26,2,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114,,,,,,22,29,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.068,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000424962800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a retrospective observational study, we use data from the German DRG statistic on patient characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of all isolated TAVI procedures in 2013 (N = 9147). The impact of post-procedural complications on reimbursement, length of stay and mechanical ventilation was analyzed using both unadjusted and risk-adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses. A total of 235 (2.57%) strokes, 583 (6.37%) bleeding events, 474 (5.18%) cases of acute kidney injury and 1428 (15.61%) pacemaker implantations were documented. The predicted reimbursement of an uncomplicated TAVI procedure was a,notsign33,272, and bleeding events were associated with highest additional reimbursement (a,notsign12,839, p < 0.001), extra length of stay (14.58 days, p < 0.001), and increased likelihood of mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h (OR 17.91, p < 0.001). A more moderate complication-related impact on resource use and reimbursement was found for acute kidney injury (additional reimbursement: a,notsign5963, p < 0.001; extra length of stay: 7.92 days, p < 0.001; ventilation > 48 h: OR 6.93, p < 0.001) as well as for stroke (additional reimbursement: a,notsign4125, p < 0.001; extra length of stay: 4.68 days, p < 0.001; ventilation > 48 h: OR 5.73, p < 0.001). Pacemaker implantations, in contrast, were associated with comparably small increases in reimbursement (a,notsign662, p = 0.006) and length of stay (3.54 days, p = 0.006) and no impaired likelihood of mechanical ventilation more than 48 h (OR 1.22, p = 0.156). Interestingly, these complication-related consequences remain mostly unchanged after baseline risk-adjustment. Post procedural complications such as bleeding events, acute kidney injuries and strokes are associated with increased resource use and substantial amounts of additional reimbursement in Germany, which has important implications for decision making outside of the usual clinical sphere.","[Kaier, Klaus; Vach, Werner; Hehn, Philip] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, Fac Med, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Kaier, Klaus; Bode, Martin; Zirlik, Andreas; Zehender, Manfred; Reinoehl, Jochen] Freiburg Univ, Dept Cardiol & Angiol 1, Ctr Heart, Freiburg, Germany; [Reinecke, Holger] Univ Hosp Muenster, Div Vasc Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Munster, Germany; [Naci, Huseyin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, LSE Hlth, London, England; [Frankenstein, Lutz] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Cardiol, Pulmonol, Angiol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Bode, Martin] Osnabruck Univ Appl Sci, Fac Business Management & Social Sci, Osnabruck, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Freiburg; University of Munster; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, Fac Med, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.;Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Freiburg Univ, Dept Cardiol & Angiol 1, Ctr Heart, Freiburg, Germany.",kaier@imbi.uni-freiburg.de,"Zirlik, Andreas/A-6400-2011; Kaier, Klaus/B-4227-2009; Vach, Werner/F-2512-2011","Zirlik, Andreas/0000-0001-6290-3297; Kaier, Klaus/0000-0003-0837-6945; Vach, Werner/0000-0003-1865-8399",,,,,22,8,9,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We model the underlying mutual fund dynamics by combining a Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model together with a Hull and White (1990) stochastic interest rate process. The model is able to capture the smile/skew often observed on equity option markets (Grzelak and Oosterlee 2011) as well as the influence of the interest rates on the early surrender decisions as noted from our analysis. The annuity provider charges management fees which are proportional to the level of the mutual fund as a way of funding the VA contract. To determine the optimal surrender decisions, we present the problem as a 4-dimensional free-boundary partial differential equation (PDE) which is then solved efficiently by the method of lines (MOL) approach. The MOL algorithm facilitates simultaneous computation of the prices, fair management fees, optimal surrender boundaries and hedge ratios of the variable annuity contract as part of the solution at no additional computational cost. A comprehensive analysis on the impact of various risk factors in influencing the policyholder's surrender behaviour is carried out, highlighting the significance of both stochastic volatility and interest rate parameters in influencing the policyholder's surrender behaviour. With the aid of the hedge ratios obtained from the MOL, we construct an effective dynamic hedging strategy to mitigate the provider's risk and compare different hedging performances when the policyholders' surrender behaviour is either optimal or sub-optimal.

Integrated energy service companies (IESCs) have a potentially important role in improving energy efficiency. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the energy efficiency barriers in the Finnish building sector based on data from interviews with twelve IESCs. Taking a novel supply side perspective, we place IESCs at the centre of the emerging energy services business ecosystem to identify the barriers and hindering factors (real world illustrations of barriers). From this perspective, we also examine cause-effect relationships between the hindering factors and the actors. Hindering factors, reported by IESCs, were categorised under a revised barrier taxonomy consisting of economic market failures and economic market, behavioural, organisational and institutional barriers. The most salient hindering factors lack of technical skills, disinterest in energy efficiency improvements and non-functional regulation were analysed with respect to ecosystem actors causing and affected by these factors. Public actors have a key role in overcoming these barriers, for instance, by creating new possibilities for entrants to take part in decision-making, increasing the functionality and practicality of policies and by providing up-to date energy efficiency information.","[Kangas, Hanna-Liisa; Lazarevic, David; Kivimaa, Paula] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Environm Policy Ctr, PL 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Lazarevic, David] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Tekn Ringen 23, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kivimaa, Paula] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sussex House, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",Finnish Environment Institute; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Sussex,"Lazarevic, D (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Environm Policy Ctr, PL 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland.;Lazarevic, D (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Tekn Ringen 23, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",hanna-liisa.kangas@ymparisto.fi; david.lazarevic@ymparisto.fi; P.Kivimaa@sussex.ac.uk,"Kivimaa, Paula/AAY-3418-2021","Kivimaa, Paula/0000-0003-2812-8017; Lazarevic, David/0000-0002-9869-9707",Academy of Finland [286230]; Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE); UK EPSRC through the Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand [EP/KO11790/1]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [286230] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE); UK EPSRC through the Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Academy of Finland (AKA); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was funded by the Academy of Finland (Decision Number 286230) as a part of New Energy Academy Programme and the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) and supported by the UK EPSRC through the Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand (grant number EP/KO11790/1).,,56,67,68,2,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114,,,,,,63,76,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.060,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000424962800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent development of the theory of team reasoning addresses this by suggesting that interacting players in games may sometimes reason as members of a team - a group of individuals who act together in the attainment of some common goal. A number of properties have been suggested for team-reasoning decision-makers' goals to satisfy, but a few formal representations have been discussed. In this paper we suggest a possible representation of these goals based on the notion of mutual advantage. We propose a method for measuring extents of individual and mutual advantage to the interacting decision-makers, and define team interests as the attainment of outcomes associated with maximum mutual advantage in the games they play.","[Karpus, Jurgis] Kings Coll London, Dept Philosophy, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Radzvilas, Mantas] London Sch Econ, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Karpus, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Philosophy, London WC2R 2LS, England.",jurgis.karpus@kcl.ac.uk; m.radzvilas@lse.ac.uk,"Karpus, Jurgis/IXD-5348-2023","Karpus, Jurgis/0000-0001-7408-9982",European Research Council under the European Union / ERC [283849]; European Research Council (ERC) [283849] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union / ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would particularly like to thank Yair Antler, Jason Alexander, Garth Baughman, Mike Coxhead, Ben Davies, Julien Dutant, Natalie Gold, Clayton Littlejohn, David Pappineau, Klemens Puppe, Andis Sofianos, Robert Sugden, Spyros Terovitis, James Thom, EdwardWebb, and Nicolas Wuthrich for their invaluable comments and suggestions on various earlier versions of this work.

Most of the empirical analyses delving into this debate have focused on world countries, whose geographical and institutional conditions differ widely. Subnational analyses considering groups of countries with, in principle, more similar institutional and geographical conditions have been limited and tended to highlight that geography is more important than institutions at subnational level. This paper aims to address whether this is the case by investigating how differences in institutional and first-nature' geographical conditions have affected economic growth in Europe's regions in the period 1995-2009. In the analysis we use a newly developed dataset including regional quality of government indicators and geographical characteristics and employ two-stage least squares (2SLS) and instrumental variables-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) estimation techniques with a number of regional historical variables as instruments. Our results indicate that at a regional level in Europe institutions rule. Regional institutional conditions - and, particularly, government effectiveness and the fight against corruption - play an important role in shaping regional economic growth prospects. This does not imply, however, that geography is irrelevant. There is evidence of geographical factors affecting regional growth, although their impact is dwarfed by the overriding influence of institutions.","[Ketterer, Tobias D.] European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, Rue Loi 170B, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ketterer, TD (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, Rue Loi 170B, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",Tobias.KETTERER@ec.europa.eu; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC [269868],European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"The authors are grateful to Roberta Capello, the editor in charge, and to the anonymous referees for their stimulating suggestions to the earlier versions of this paper.

Population-based observational data demonstrate statin treatment after diagnosis of EAC is associated with significant reductions in all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. A feasibility study of adjuvant statin therapy following potentially curative resection for EAC has been completed, with planned progression to a full phase III, randomized controlled trial. The aim was to estimate the cost-utility of statin therapy following surgical resection for EAC from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] for hypothetical cohorts of patients with EAC exposed or not exposed to statins following potentially curative surgical resection. Model parameters were based on estimates from published observational and trial data. Costs, utilities and transition probabilities were modeled to reflect clinical practice from a payer's perspective. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in key parameters. Overall, a cost saving of A 6781 pound per patient was realized with statin treatment compared to no statins. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99% of all iterations were cost saving and 99% of all iterations were less than A 20,000 pound per QALY gained. These results were robust to changes in the price and effectiveness of statins. The cohort exposed to statins had lower costs and better QALY outcomes than the no statin cohort. Assuming a causal improvement in disease outcomes following resection for EAC, statin therapy is very likely to be a cost-saving treatment.","[Khioe, Rebekah Fong Soe; Skedgel, Chris; Hart, Andrew; Alexandre, Leo] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Bob Champion Res & Educ Bldg,James Watson Rd, Norwich NR4 7UQ, Norfolk, England; [Hart, Andrew; Lewis, Michael Philip Nelson; Alexandre, Leo] Norfolk & Norwich Univ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UY, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital,"Khioe, RFS (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Bob Champion Res & Educ Bldg,James Watson Rd, Norwich NR4 7UQ, Norfolk, England.",R.Fong-Soe-Khioe@uea.ac.uk; C.Skedgel@uea.ac.uk; A.Hart@uea.ac.uk; michael.lewis@nnuh.nhs.uk; Leo.Alexandre@uea.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Michael Philip N/0000-0002-6913-6454",National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2013-06-115] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2013-06-115] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),,,49,4,4,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36,3,,,,,349,358,,10.1007/s40273-017-0594-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0594-1,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29210031,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000426705800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We study the properties and implementation of the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. The EWM approach is attractive in terms of both statistical performance and practical implementation in realistic settings of policy design. Common features of these settings include: (i) feasible treatment assignment rules are constrained exogenously for ethical, legislative, or political reasons, (ii) a policy maker wants a simple treatment assignment rule based on one or more eligibility scores in order to reduce the dimensionality of individual observable characteristics, and/or (iii) the proportion of individuals who can receive the treatment is a priori limited due to a budget or a capacity constraint. We show that when the propensity score is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at least at n(-1/2) rate to the maximum obtainable welfare uniformly over a minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform convergence rate is minimax optimal. We examine how the uniform convergence rate depends on the richness of the class of candidate decision rules, the distribution of conditional treatment effects, and the lack of knowledge of the propensity score. We offer easily implementable algorithms for computing the EWM rule and an application using experimental data from the National JTPA Study.","[Kitagawa, Toru] Cemmap, London, England; [Kitagawa, Toru] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Tetenov, Aleksey] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England",University of London; University College London; University of Bristol,"Kitagawa, T (通讯作者)，Cemmap, London, England.;Kitagawa, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.",t.kitagawa@ucl.ac.uk; a.tetenov@bristol.ac.uk,"Kitagawa, Toru/N-6589-2015","Kitagawa, Toru/0000-0001-5550-1281; Tetenov, Aleksey/0000-0003-2764-5952",ESRC through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (CeMMAP) [RES-589-28-0001]; European Research Council [715940]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (CeMMAP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Susan Athey, Kei Hirano, Guido Imbens, Shin Kanaya, Charles Manski, Joerg Stoye, and seminar participants at Academia Sinica, Bern, Brown, BC, BU, Cambridge, CEMFI, CORE, Duke, GRIPS, JHU, NYU, UPenn, UPF, UVA, and Warwick for beneficial comments.

This paper studies the crisis impact on Great Britain's Local Authority Districts (LADs) using the concept of economic resilience. This country is an interesting case study as the impact varied significantly among LADs. The focus is on employment, and a new method is proposed for comparing pre- and post-recession conditions in order to assess the recession impact. The influence of a number of determining factors is examined, and the study finds a significant effect for initial economic conditions, human capital, age structure, urbanisation and geography.

We provide the first joint experimental analysis of the role of these two obstacles. First, we observe that overbidding decreases significantly between a simple common-value auction and a transformed version of this auction that does not require conditional reasoning. Second, assistance in belief formation leads to comparable behavioral changes in both games. The two effects are of similar magnitude and amplify each other when jointly present. We conclude that the combination and the interaction of the two cognitive processes in auctions lead to relatively low strategic sophistication compared to other domains. The study's focus on games' objective cognitive challenges is potentially useful for improving predictions across games and complements the common focus on behavioral models and their explanatory power.

In this paper we analyze the problem of parametric inference from combined individual-level data when data combination is based on personal and demographic identifiers such as name, age, or address. Our main question is the identification of the econometric model based on the combined data when the data do not contain exact individual identifiers and no parametric assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of information that is common across the combined data set. We demonstrate the conditions on the observable marginal distributions of data in individual data sets that can and cannot guarantee identification of the parameters of interest. We also note that the data combination procedure is essential in a semiparametric setting such as ours. Provided that the (nonparametric) data combination procedure can only be defined in finite samples, we introduce a new notion of identification based on the concept of limits of statistical experiments. Our results apply to the setting where the individual data used for inferences are sensitive and their combination may lead to a substantial increase in the data sensitivity or lead to a de-anonymization of the previously anonymized information. We demonstrate that the point identification of an econometric model from combined data is incompatible with restrictions on the risk of individual disclosure. If the data combination procedure guarantees a bound on the risk of individual disclosure, then the information available from the combined data set allows one to identify the parameter of interest only partially, and the size of the identification region is inversely related to the upper bound guarantee for the disclosure risk. This result is new in the context of data combination as we notice that the quality of links that need to be used in the combined data to assure point identification may be much higher than the average link quality in the entire data set, and thus point inference requires the use of the most sensitive subset of the data. Our results provide important insights into the ongoing discourse on the empirical analysis of merged administrative records as well as discussions on the disclosive nature of policies implemented by the data-driven companies (such as internet services companies and medical companies using individual patient records for policy decisions).","[Komarova, Tatiana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London, England; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Yakovlev, Evgeny] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Virginia; New Economic School,"Komarova, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London, England.",t.komarova@lse.ac.uk; denis@virginia.edu; eyakovlev@nes.ru,"Yakovlev, Evgeny Y./Q-4931-2017; Kolisnyk, Mykyta/HTT-4095-2023","Komarova, Tatiana/0000-0002-6581-5097",NSF; STICERD,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); STICERD,"Support from the NSF and STICERD is gratefully acknowledged.

Network games offer new opportunities to identify learning rules, since on networks (compared to, e.g., random matching) more rules differ in terms of their information requirements. Our experimental design enables us to observe both which actions participants choose and which information they consult before making their choices. We use these data to estimate learning types using finite mixture models. Monitoring information requests turns out to be crucial, as estimates based on choices alone show substantial biases. We also find that learning depends on network position. Participants in more complex environments (with more network neighbors) tend to resort to simpler rules compared to those with only one network neighbor.","[Kovarik, Jaromir] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Vizcaya, Spain; [Kovarik, Jaromir] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mengel, Friederike] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester, Essex, England; [Gabriel Romero, Jose] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",University of Basque Country; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; University of Essex; Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Kovárík, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Vizcaya, Spain.;Kovárík, J (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",jaromir.kovarik@ehu.es; fr.mengel@gmail.com; gabriel.romero@usach.cl,"Kovarik, Jaromir/AAE-6921-2021; Kovarik, Jaromir/H-2938-2014; Romero, José Gabriel/AAE-1999-2020","Romero, José Gabriel/0000-0002-4142-4331; Mengel, Friederike/0000-0002-7858-9033; KOVARIK, JAROMIR/0000-0002-0436-929X","Dutch Science Foundation (NWO,VENI) [016.125.040]; Basque Government [IT-783-13]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; European Fund Regional Development [ECO 2015-64467-R, ECO 2015-66027-P]; GACR [14-220445]; Fondecyt Chile [11121155]","Dutch Science Foundation (NWO,VENI)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Basque Government(Basque Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); European Fund Regional Development; GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Fondecyt Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT)","We wish to thank Clayton Featherstone, Guillaume Frechette, Sanjeev Goyal, Nagore Iriberri, Matthew Jackson, Muriel Niederle, Alicia Perez-Alonso, Aljaz Ule, Marco van der Leij, Nathaniel Wilcox, three anonymous reviewers, and audiences in Cambridge, Chapman University, Navarra, Stanford, Universidad Catolica de Chile, Shanghai (ESWC 2010), Copenhagen (ESA 2010), Oslo (ESEM 2011), and Santiago (LAMES 2011) for valuable comments.

Using simulation experiments with heavy-tailed distributions and GARCH volatility models, we design a statistical procedure to show that at least four VaR levels are required to obtain tests for misspecified trading book models that are more powerful than single-level (or even two-level) binomial exception tests.

If market power is ignored and increases with size, it gets counted as additional cost efficiencies which leads to an over-prediction. I address this limitation by developing a model of the demand for consumer deposits at the geographic market level and cost efficiencies at the firm level. Incorporating the network structure of banks in the analysis increases dimensionality of the bank's choice set and also the possibility of multiple equilibria. To address these issues, I use moment inequality methods to estimate the cost parameters. Using a panel data from the U.S. banking industry, I find that the evidence of cost efficiencies is weak, at best, for all the banks. Using the estimated parameters, I simulate six mergers between banks of different sizes. In the short run, all the simulated mergers show dis-economies of scale on average. However, most of them show an increase in consumer welfare as the market power (or oligopoly) effect is dominated by an increase in the local branch density. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This understanding, combined with a focus on energy services (e.g. lighting, heating, telecommunications, mobility, etc.) helps to prioritize actions to achieve the goal of energy security. This paper conceptualizes energy security as low vulnerability of vital energy systems and sustained provision of modern energy services. Taking Tajikistan as a case, this paper highlights key vulnerabilities including neglect of environmental conditions, insufficient energy production capacity, unreliable and expensive energy imports, dwindling power infrastructure causing technical and economic losses, inadequate transparency in the power sector, lack of regional cooperation in energy and water resources sharing, and inadequate financial resources to address these challenges. Three major proposals presented by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Government of Tajikistan to achieve energy security in Tajikistan are evaluated. Specifically, they lack a focus on energy services and therefore overlook people's socio-cultural context and appropriate energy needs.

We develop a computationally tractable stochastic version of that model wherein workers accumulate skills on the job and face a risk of skill loss after job destruction. We find that skill heterogeneity dampens the fluctuations of labor market variables, and that introducing skill loss offsets this effect and generates additional amplification. The main forces driving this result are pro-cyclical increases in the probability of skill loss during unemployment: these provide incentives to post proportionally more vacancies during upturns by raising the surplus from employing high-skill workers. Compositional changes in the unemployment pool, on the other hand, play a negligible role for empirically plausible rates of skill depreciation, which imply a relatively slow process compared to the duration of unemployment spells.

It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-a-vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.","[Lane, Philip R.] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Lane, Philip R.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Lane, Philip R.; Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria] London Based Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Trinity College Dublin; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; International Monetary Fund,"Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，London Based Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.;Milesi-Ferretti, GM (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",governor@centralbank.ie; gmilesiferretti@imf.org,,,Irish Research Council,"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","We are very grateful to our discussants Linda Tesar, Anne-Laure Delatte, and Jana Riedel, and to Serkan Arslanalp, Thomas Elkjaer, Thornton Matheson, Victoria Perry, Neeltje Van Horen, two anonymous referees, participants to the IMF's 2016 Annual Research Conference, the Jean Monnet Workshop on Financial Globalization and Its Spillovers, and seminars at the Bank of England, the Banque de France, the Bank of Italy, and France Strategie for useful comments.

We use a two-sector Schumpeterian model of growth, in which a manufacturing sector produces the traditional consumption good and an agricultural sector produces food to sustain contemporaneous population. Agriculture demands land as an input, itself treated as a scarce form of capital. In our model both population and sectoral technological progress are endogenously determined, and key technological parameters of the model are structurally estimated using 1960-2010 data on world GDP, population, cropland and technological progress. Introducing random shocks to the evolution of total factor productivity in agriculture, we show that uncertainty optimally requires more land to be converted into agricultural use as a hedge against production shortages, and that it significantly affects both optimal consumption and population trajectories.","[Lanz, Bruno] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland; [Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ctr Int Environm Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@unine.ch,,,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 [290693 FOODSECURE],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2011 under Grant Agreement Number 290693 FOODSECURE.

We try to clear up this contentious issue by estimating the short-term effects of a policy change that occurred in 2006 in Zambia, when 54 of 72 districts removed fees. We use a pooled synthetic control method in order to estimate the causal impact of the policy on health care use, the provider chosen, and out-of-pocket medical expenses. We find no evidence that user fee removal increased health care utilisation, even among the poorest group. However, we find that the policy is likely to have led to a substitution away from the private sector for those using care and that it virtually eliminated medical expenditures, thereby providing financial protection to service users. We estimate that the policy was equivalent to a transfer of US$3.2 per health visit for the 50% richest but of only US$1.1 for the 50% poorest.","[Lepine, Aurelia; Lagarde, Mylene] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Le Nestour, Alexis] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Otago,"Lépine, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Global Hlth & Dev Dept, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",aurelia.lepine@lshtm.ac.uk,"Lagarde, Mylene/GVS-9289-2022","Lepine, Aurelia/0000-0002-9237-2914",Medical Research Council [MR/L012057/1]; Medical Research Council [MR/L012057/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/L012057/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Early career fellowship (MR/L012057/1)",,44,24,25,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27,3,,,,,493,508,,10.1002/hec.3589,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3589,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29034537,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428324700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The standard Shapley value is modified so that losing bidders do not make or receive any payments. The new rule, called the balanced winner contribution (BWC) rule, satisfies a variation of Myerson's balanced contribution property. The payment rule is fair in the sense that, with respect to reported values, the members of every pair of traders make equal contributions to each other's share of the gains from trade. BWC payments can be used in single-item auctions and more complex auctions and exchanges with multiple items and package bidding. A series of examples is presented to illustrate how the BWC rule works and how the payments compare to those based on competitive prices, the core, and the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.

To say that an investment is cost-effective but not affordable must mean that the (implicit or explicit) threshold used to judge cost-effectiveness does not reflect the scale and value of the opportunity costs. Existing empirical estimates of health opportunity costs are based on cross-sectional variation in expenditure and mortality outcomes by program budget categories (PBCs) and do not reflect the likely effect of nonmarginal budget impacts on health opportunity costs. The UK Department of Health regularly updates the needs-based target allocation of resources to local areas of the National Health Service (NHS), creating two subgroups of local areas (those under target allocation and those over). These data provide the opportunity to explore how the effects of changes in health care expenditure differ with available resources. We use 2008-2009 data to evaluate two econometric approaches to estimation and explore a range of criteria for accepting subgroup specific effects for differences in expenditure and outcome elasticities across the 23 PBCs. Our results indicate that health opportunity costs arising from an investment imposing net increases in expenditure are underestimated unless account is taken of likely nonmarginal effects. They also indicate the benefits (reduced health opportunity costs or increased value-based price of a technology) of being able to smooth these nonmarginal budget impacts by health care systems borrowing against future budgets or from manufacturers offering mortgage type arrangements.

A simple two-factor model containing the market and alternative indicators of economic activity as risk factors industrial production, capacity utilization rate, retail sales, and a broad economic index offers considerable explanatory power for the cross-section of price and industry momentum portfolios. Hence past winners enjoy higher average returns than past losers because they have larger macroeconomic risk. The model compares favorably with popular multifactor models used in the literature.

Real-world data (RWD) may provide complimentary evidence for relative effectiveness assessments (REAs) and cost-effectiveness assessments (CEAs). This study examines whether RWD is incorporated in health technology assessment (HTA) of melanoma drugs by European HTA agencies, as well as differences in RWD use between agencies and across time. HTA reports published between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016 were retrieved from websites of agencies representing five jurisdictions: England [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)], Scotland [Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC)], France [Haute Autorit, de sant, (HAS)], Germany [Institute for Quality and Efficacy in Healthcare (IQWiG)] and The Netherlands [Zorginstituut Nederland (ZIN)]. A standardized data extraction form was used to extract information on RWD inclusion for both REAs and CEAs. Overall, 52 reports were retrieved, all of which contained REAs; CEAs were present in 25 of the reports. RWD was included in 28 of the 52 REAs (54%), mainly to estimate melanoma prevalence, and in 22 of the 25 (88%) CEAs, mainly to extrapolate long-term effectiveness and/or identify drug-related costs. Differences emerged between agencies regarding RWD use in REAs; the ZIN and IQWiG cited RWD for evidence on prevalence, whereas the NICE, SMC and HAS additionally cited RWD use for drug effectiveness.

In general, RWD inclusion was higher in CEAs than REAs, and was mostly used to estimate melanoma prevalence in REAs or to predict long-term effectiveness in CEAs.

Building on a wealth of new data and advanced simulation methods, conventional research into urban systems seeks to embrace this complexity, measuring and modelling cities with increasingly greater detail and reliability. The practice of transportation modelling, despite recent developments, lags behind these advances. This paper addresses the implications resulting from variations in model design, with a focus on the behaviour and cognition of drivers, demonstrating how different models of choice and experience significantly influence the distribution of traffic. It is demonstrated how conventional models of urban traffic have not fully incorporated many of the important findings from the cognitive science domain, instead often describing actions in terms of individual optimisation. We introduce exploratory agent-based modelling that incorporates representations of behaviour from a more cognitively rich perspective. Specifically, through these simulations, we identify how spatial cognition in respect to route selection and the inclusion of heterogeneity in spatial knowledge significantly impact the spatial extent and volume of traffic flow within a real-world setting. These initial results indicate that individual-level models of spatial cognition can potentially play an important role in predicting urban traffic flow, and that greater heed should be paid to these approaches going forward. The findings from this work hold important lessons in the development of models of transport systems and hold potential implications for policy.","[Manley, Ed] UCL, Bartlett Ctr Adv Spatial Anal CASA, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Cheng, Tao] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Manley, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Ctr Adv Spatial Anal CASA, 90 Tottenham Court Rd, London W1T 4TJ, England.",Ed.Manley@ucl.ac.uk,,"Manley, Ed/0000-0002-8904-0513; Cheng, Tao/0000-0002-5503-9813","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G023212/1]; Transport for London; EPSRC [EP/J004197/1, EP/G023212/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G023212/1, EP/J004197/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Transport for London; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/G023212/1) and Transport for London.,,60,15,17,0,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Using the Open Method of Co-ordination (OMC) in the oft-neglected sector of cultural policy as a case study, it argues that rather than a neutral facilitator as it appears on paper, the Commission occupies both a political and administrative leadership role in the operation of the culture OMC. Through analysis of policy documentation, interviews and non-participant observation material, the article demonstrates how the Commission has operated as a key driver and agenda-setter in the field, exposing the inter-institutional dynamics in a competence in which the EU has a supporting role. The findings thus have broader implications for the study of agenda-setting and European integration in policy sectors where the EU holds a supporting competence.","[Mattocks, Kate] Liverpool Hope Univ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool Hope University,"Mattocks, K (通讯作者)，Liverpool Hope Univ, Dept Hist & Polit, Hope Pk, Liverpool L16 9JD, Merseyside, England.",mattock@hope.ac.uk,,,,,,,71,5,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Given this, the effect on the UK regions is analysed using the regional balance-of-payments constrained growth model.

Based on this powerful approach, we propose a relevant filter and show that the proposed trend specification is a global approximation to any arbitrary trend. Furthermore, we prove formally a famous claim by Kydland and Prescott (1981, 1997) that over long time periods, the average value of the cycles is zero. A simple procedure for the econometric estimation of the model is developed as a seven-step algorithm, which relies on standard techniques, where all relevant measures may be computed routinely. Next, using relevant DGPs, we compare and show by means of Monte Carlo simulations that our approach is superior to Hodrick-Prescott (HP) and Baxter and King (BK) regarding the generated distortionary effects and the ability to operate in various frequencies, including changes in volatility, amplitudes and phase. In fact, while keeping the structure of the model relatively simple, our approach is perfectly capable of addressing the case of stochastic trend, in the sense that the generated distortionary effects in the near unit root case are minimal and, by all means, considerably fewer than those generated by HP and BK. Application to EU15 business cycles clustering is presented and the empirical results are consistent with the rigorous theoretical framework developed in this work.","[Michaelides, Panayotis G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece; [Tsionas, Efthymios G.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England; [Vouldis, Angelos T.] European Cent Bank, Athens, Greece; [Vouldis, Angelos T.] Bank Greece, Athens, Greece; [Konstantakis, Konstantinos N.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Patrinos, Panagiotis] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn ESAT STADIUS, Optimizat Engn Ctr OPTEC, Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Tsionas, Efthymios G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; Lancaster University; European Central Bank; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; National Technical University of Athens; KU Leuven; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Michaelides, PG (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece.",pmichael@central.ntua.gr,"Konstantakis, Konstantinos/F-1726-2019; Konstantakis, Konstantinos N./AED-3089-2022; Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020; Patrinos, Panagiotis/E-7806-2017","Konstantakis, Konstantinos N./0000-0001-6837-332X; Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Patrinos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-4824-7697",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,122,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It has been argued that such donors should prioritise interventions based on their cost-effectiveness, that is to say, the ratio of costs to benefits. Against this, we argue that the donor should fund not the most cost-effective interventions, but rather interventions which are just cost-ineffective for the country, thus encouraging the country to contribute its own domestic resources to the fight against disease. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can be justified within the context of a model of the problem as a leader-follower game, in which a donor chooses to subsidise interventions which are implemented by a country. We argue that the decision rule we propose provides a basis for the allocation of aid money which is efficient, fair and sustainable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper demonstrates the importance of socioeconomic, contextual, and local policy conditions in shaping the spatially heterogeneous response to a national policy. Through an assessment of the geographical and temporal variation in domestic energy-efficiency assessments provided under the United Kingdom's Green Deal, the factors underpinning the spatial diffusion of this policy are identified. Spatial regression models show that the presence of young families, university educated residents, detached homes, and large households positively affects the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments whereas property market activity, personal incomes, the presence of self-employed residents, and the efficiency levels of the existing housing stock has a dampening effect. National incentives for policy implementation that are distributed through selected local authorities also work to promote the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments. Overall, the analysis clearly shows the importance of local factors in determining how national policies are implemented on the ground. This has important implications for policymakers in designing and administering national policy frameworks, in trading-off targeted implementation with fairness and uniformity, and in evaluating the local effectiveness of national policies.","[Morton, Craig] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Wilson, Charlie] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Anable, Jillian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Loughborough University; University of East Anglia; University of Leeds,"Morton, C (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",c.morton@live.co.uk; charlie.wilson@uea.ac.uk; j.l.anable@leeds.ac.uk,"Wilson, Charlie/D-4127-2011","Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641; Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566; Morton, Craig/0000-0003-0984-9580",ClimateXChange centre; Engineering and Phyriscal Research Council [EPSRC EP/L024756/1]; European Research Council [678799]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ClimateXChange centre; Engineering and Phyriscal Research Council; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The research reported in this paper was supported by the ClimateXChange centre, by the Engineering and Phyriscal Research Council Grant EPSRC EP/L024756/1 and by the European Research Council Starting Grant #678799.

We argue that as a consequence of the increase in state presence and visibility, municipalities with a higher level of formalization of their land property rights witnessed a greater reduction in the area allocated to illicit crops. We hypothesize that this is due to the possibility of obtaining more benefits in the newly installed institutional environment when land is formalized, and the increased cost of growing illicit crops on formal relative to informal land. We find that a one-standard deviation increase in the formality index for smallholders is related to a reduction in the share of municipal area allocated to coca crops of 0.101 percentage points. That is, the formalization of one additional hectare of land with respect to small landholders in an average municipality in the year 2000 is associated with a decrease of approximately 1.4 hectares of land allocated to coca within that particular municipality, ceteris paribus. These results remain robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Our findings contribute to empirical evidence on the positive effects of formal land property rights and effective policies in the war on drugs. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Reforming energy subsidies thus requires overcoming a policy commitment problem. In this paper we show that, even when commitment is feasible, it may fail to materialize in a political equilibrium due to politicians' re-election incentives.

On balance, our findings are consistent with the interpretation of risk-reducing adjustments to capital structure ahead of the crisis as a component of managerial skill and discipline with significant implications for firm value during the crisis.","[Pavlov, Andrey] Simon Fraser Univ, 500 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6C 1W6, Canada; [Steiner, Eva] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Wachter, Susan] Univ Penn, 430 Vance Hall,3733 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Simon Fraser University; University of Cambridge; University of Pennsylvania,"Pavlov, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, 500 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6C 1W6, Canada.",apavlov@sfu.ca; es434@cam.ac.uk; wachter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Steiner, Eva/GQP-3194-2022; Wachter, Susan/AAW-2226-2020; Pavlov, Andrey/HGB-3637-2022","Pavlov, Andrey/0000-0001-7891-269X",Zell Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2012-0929],Zell Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Susan Wachter acknowledges financial support from the Zell Lurie Real Estate Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Relying on financial statements and survey data I compare the performance of three different categories of foreign banks to the group of domestic banks in sub-Saharan Africa: global banks from developed countries, regional African banks and banks from non-African emerging economies. While emerging-market banks and global banks consistently outperform domestic banks, the difference is not significant for regional African banks. The higher performance of global banks and emerging-market banks is related to higher operational efficiency and lower cost of funding, while there is no strong evidence of segmentation by business segment in the loans market. Regional African banks, which started their foreign expansion more recently, are less able to generate interest income compared to domestic banks. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account foreign banks' heterogeneity when assessing the impact of financial FDI on the host economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling the course of cardiovascular disease is not without complications, and uncertainty surrounding the structure of a model will almost always arise once a choice of a model structure is defined. Objectives: To provide a practical illustration of the impact on the results of cost-effectiveness of changing or adapting model structures in a previously published cost-utility analysis of a primary care intervention for the management of hypertension Targets and Self-Management for the Control of Blood Pressure in Stroke and at Risk Groups (TASMIN-SR). Methods: The case study assessed the structural uncertainty arising from model structure and from the exclusion of secondary events. Four alternative model structures were implemented. Long-term cost-effectiveness was estimated and the results compared with those from the TASMIN-SR model. Results: The main cost-effectiveness results obtained in the TASMIN-SR study did not change with the implementation of alternative model structures. Choice of model type was limited to a cohort Markov model, and because of the lack of epidemiological data, only model 4 captured structural uncertainty arising from the exclusion of secondary events in the case study model. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the main conclusions drawn from the TASMIN-SR model of cost-effectiveness were robust to changes in model structure and the inclusion of secondary events. Even though one of the models produced results that were different to those of TASMIN-SR, the fact that the main conclusions were identical suggests that a more parsimonious model may have sufficed.","[Penaloza-Ramos, Maria Cristina; Jowett, Sue; Barton, Pelham] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Sutton, Andrew John] Univ Leeds, Hlth Econ Unit, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [McManus, Richard J.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Oxford, England",University of Birmingham; University of Leeds; University of Oxford,"Peñaloza-Ramos, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.c.penaloza@bham.ac.uk,"Jowett, Sue/AAO-4198-2021","Jowett, Sue/0000-0001-8936-3745; McManus, Richard/0000-0003-3638-028X",,,,,71,3,3,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21,3,,,,,351,363,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.03.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.03.003,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566843,"hybrid, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428019200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article applies a stochastic frontier inefficiency model to a panel of 77 wine grape farms in South Africa between 2005 and 2015 and allows the comparison of efficiency levels for the old established wine regions with those of newer entrants. Thus, we investigate whether experience plus first choice of location matters more than the follower's advantage of newer technology. In all regions, a greater share of permanent labor and increased supervision raised efficiency, while more inorganic fertilizer and less irrigation has the opposite effect. Innovations in trellising had insignificant effects (except in the old regions) but not replacing old vines reduced efficiency. However, a higher proportion of red varietals also lowered efficiency in the old regions due to a fall in the price of red wine as these farmers continued to concentrate on quality reds. The new regions compensated for falling prices by increasing crop size with irrigation and fertilizer and extending the area planted, but with less concern for quality. This appears to be more successful in efficiency terms, but as international demand for quality wine increases it may be a poor long-term strategy.","[Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8BE, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer; Thirtle, Colin; Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Thirtle, Colin] Imperial Coll London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University; University of Cape Town; Imperial College London,"Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8BE, Dorset, England.;Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020; Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300; Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,24,10,10,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Its aim is to move the EU less developed countries and regions on path of R&D-based growth. This transformation requires not only endogenous knowledge and technology accumulation building but also coupling with international knowledge and production networks. Yet, internationalisation does not seem to be a crucial component in the design and development of Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3), which are at odds with the strong dependence of the EU New Member States (EU-13) on FDI and global value chains. Our analysis is grounded in the key 'stylised facts' related to EU-13 R&D&I activities, and the complex link between innovation and internationalisation. Innovation systems in the EU-13 are fragmented and based on largely public R&D systems and on predominantly production-oriented foreign direct investment (FDI). This structural weakness calls for stronger support for innovation-oriented activities and for the integration of global value chains (GVCs) and FDI into local innovation systems. We explore the main obstacles to the internationalisation of smart specialisation and discuss ways to overcome them. We highlight the policy action areas related to providing support for technology upgrading in relation to the internationalisation of smart specialisation.","[Radosevic, Slavo] UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies United Kingdom, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Ciampi Stancova, Katerina] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain",University of London; University College London; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Stancova, KC (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain.",Katerina.CIAMPI-STANCOVA@ec.europa.eu,"Radosevic, Slavo/AAH-6516-2019","Radosevic, Slavo/0000-0001-7905-2281",,,,,66,43,44,4,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 44,032 pound per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of A 52,695 pound and A 49,392 pound per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively. Since the AC concluded that the most plausible ICER was A 49,392 pound per QALY gained, and that T/T meets end-of-life criteria, T/T was recommended as a cost effective use of NHS resources.","[Ramaekers, Bram L.

Objectives: To evaluate resource use and societal costs associated with AD in a French cohort of patients and their caregivers and the effect of patient cognitive decline on costs over an 18-month period. Methods: Community-dwelling patients with mild, moderate, or moderately severe/severe AD dementia (n = 419) were followed-up for 18 months. Total societal costs were estimated by applying 2010 unit costs to resource use, including outpatient visits, hospital days, institutionalization, and caregiver hours. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini Mental State Examination scores. Results: Mean cumulative total costs over the 18-month period were 24,140 for patients with mild AD dementia, 34,287 for those with moderate AD dementia, and 44,171 for those with moderately severe/severe AD dementia (P < 0.001; ANOVA comparison between severity groups). The biggest contributor to total societal costs was caregiver informal care ( >50% of total costs at all stages of AD dementia). Cognitive decline (>3-point decrease in Mini-Mental State Examination score or institutionalization) was associated with a 12.5% increase in total costs (P = 0.02). Significant differences were observed across severity groups for caregiver time (P < 0.001); mean monthly caregiver time increased at each time point over the 18 months in each severity group. Conclusions: Increasing severity of AD dementia in France is associated with increased use of resources as well as increased total societal and patient costs; informal care was the greatest cost contributor. Clinically meaningful cognitive decline is associated with significantly increased costs.","[Rapp, Thomas] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, LIRAES EA4470, 45 Rue St Peres, F-75006 Paris, France; [Andrieu, Sandrine] Toulouse Univ Hosp, INSERM, UMR1027, Toulouse, France; [Chartier, Florence] Eli Lilly & Co, Neuilly Sur Seine, France; [Deberdt, Walter] Eli Lilly Benelux NV, Brussels, Belgium; [Reed, Catherine; Belger, Mark] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Res Ctr, Windlesham, Surrey, England; [Vellas, Bruno] Toulouse Univ Hosp, Gerontopole, INSERM, UMR1027, Toulouse, France",Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Rapp, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, LIRAES EA4470, 45 Rue St Peres, F-75006 Paris, France.",thomas.rapp@parisdescartes.fr,"Deberdt, Walter/ABA-8106-2020; Rapp, Thomas/ABF-1576-2020; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; ANDRIEU, Sandrine/G-1343-2018","Rapp, Thomas/0000-0003-0837-9302; ANDRIEU, Sandrine/0000-0002-1142-770X",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"This study was supported by Eli Lilly and Company.

In this paper, four future UK grid mix scenarios with increased photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity are assessed and compared to a benchmark Low PV scenario, from 2016 to 2035. The complexity of the issue requires a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluate the availability of net energy, environmental aspects and technical performance. Hence, the comparison between scenarios includes short-term and long-term energy metrics as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) and technical metrics. Also, the paper considers the viewpoints offered by both an integrative and a dynamic approach to net energy analysis. Results for all five analysed scenarios indicate that increased PV deployment will not be detrimental to the UK grid performance from the points of view of a wide range of system-level technical (% renewable energy curtailment to ensure grid stability), energy (energy return on investment and non-renewable cumulative energy demand) and environmental (greenhouse gas emissions) metrics.","[Raugei, Marco] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford, England; [Leccisi, Enrica] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, Naples, Italy; [Azzopardi, Brian] MCAST, Inst Engn & Transport, MCAST Energy Res Grp, Rahal Gdid, Malta; [Azzopardi, Brian] Brian Azzopardi & Associates Consulting Firm, Birkirkara, Malta; [Jones, Christopher; Gilbert, Paul; Mander, Sarah] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Zhang, Lingxi; Zhou, Yutian; Mancarella, Pierluigi] Univ Manchester, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England",Oxford Brookes University; Parthenope University Naples; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Raugei, M (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford, England.",marco.raugei@brookes.ac.uk,"Azzopardi, Brian/X-4413-2019; Zhang, Lingxi/AAH-3897-2019; Leccisi, Enrica/AAD-4624-2019; Raugei, Marco/N-4737-2015; Gilbert, Paul/HKM-3610-2023; Jones, Christopher/T-6979-2018","Azzopardi, Brian/0000-0002-7776-9390; Zhang, Lingxi/0000-0003-1305-5222; Leccisi, Enrica/0000-0002-4166-8555; Raugei, Marco/0000-0001-5026-8556; Mancarella, Pierluigi/0000-0002-9247-1402; Jones, Christopher/0000-0002-5428-0015",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the WISE-PV project [EP/K022229/1]; Malta Council for Science and Technology [IPAS-2016-015]; EPSRC [EP/K022229/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K022229/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the WISE-PV project; Malta Council for Science and Technology; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This research was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the WISE-PV project (Grant EP/K022229/1).

Due to climate change, the number of people affected by natural disasters is increasing every year with a marked debilitating effect on developing countries as compared to developed countries. To tackle these challenges, the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-30 identified seven global targets, of which the first target is to substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030. This research contributes to this emerging domain of knowledge by bringing gender disaggregated mortality data from 1999 to 2013 from an Indian state called Odisha. In doing so, this research brings three questions to the fore: first, why do deaths occur in disasters? This is answered by going beyond the traditional perspectives on risk and vulnerability to include a complex perspective developed from the theories of organization, violence, and justice. Second, who is responsible to reduce deaths and third, how deaths get recorded and reported? Based on a review of annual death reports, census data, and seven expert interviews, findings suggest that the current disaster management system in Odisha is not accountable and the death reporting and recording system merits change in order to be consistent with the Sendai's Goal to reduce deaths. This study posits that complex perspective has the potential to improve disaster management system by shifting the attention from at risk community to the actors and organizations' and to the necessary resources and measures that will be required to reduce deaths in resource poor contexts.

Current macroeconomic research is not mindless DSGE modelling filled with ridiculous assumptions and oblivious of data. Rather, young macroeconomists are doing vibrant, varied, and exciting work, getting jobs, and being published. Macroeconomics informs economic policy only moderately, and not more than nor differently from other fields in economics. Monetary policy has benefitted significantly from this advice in keeping inflation under control and preventing a new Great Depression. Macroeconomic forecasts perform poorly in absolute terms and, given the size of the challenge, probably always will. But relative to the level of aggregation, the time horizon, and the amount of funding, macroeconomic forecasts are not so obviously worse than those in other fields. What is most wrong with macroeconomics today is perhaps that there is too little discussion of which models to teach and too little investment in graduate-level textbooks.","[Reis, Ricardo] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Reis, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",r.a.reis@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,36,38,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

For some parameters, we may be uncertain around the true mean values of the variables, but the ordering of the values is known. Typical sampling approaches lack either statistical or clinical validity. For example, sampling using a common number generator results in extreme dependence, and independent sampling can lead to realisations with incorrect ordering. We propose a new sampling approach for ordered parameters, the difference method (DM) approach, which samples the parameters of interest via a difference parameter. If the parameters of interest are bounded, it involves transforming the variables so that they are unbounded and then sampling via the difference parameter. We have provided a Microsoft Excel workbook to implement the method. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example sampling ordered parameters for utility and cost. The DM approach has a number of advantages when comparing with the typical approaches used in practice. It generates PSA samples that have similar summary statistics as the given values in our examples, while maintaining the constraint that one value was greater than another. The method also implies plausible positive correlation between the two ordered variables. Both clinical and statistical validity should be checked when producing PSA samples. The DM approach should be considered as a solution to potential problems in generating PSA samples for ordered parameters.","[Ren, Shijie; Whyte, Sophie; Latimer, Nicholas R.; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Minton, Jonathan] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow,"Ren, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.ren@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Latimer, Nicholas/0000-0001-5304-5585; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124",,,,,6,5,5,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36,3,,,,,341,347,,10.1007/s40273-017-0584-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40273-017-0584-3,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29081060,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000426705800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Chile, the law mandates that all distribution companies must hold long-term contracts - which are awarded on a competitive centralized auction - to cover 100% of the projected demand from three to fifteen years into the future. These contracts can be indexed to a series of financial parameters, including fossil fuel prices at reference locations. Drawing from portfolio theory, we use a simple example to illustrate the difficulties of selecting, through the current clearing mechanism that focuses on average costs and individual characteristics of the offers, a portfolio of long-term energy contracts that could simultaneously minimize the expected future cost of energy and limit the risk exposure of retail customers. In particular, we show that if the objective of the regulator is to limit the risk to regulated consumers, it could be optimal to include contracts that would not be selected based on individual characteristics of the offers and a least-cost auction objective, but that could significantly reduce the price variance of the overall portfolio due to diversification effects between indexing parameters.","[Reus, Lorenzo; Munoz, Francisco D.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile; [Moreno, Rodrigo] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Moreno, Rodrigo] Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad de Chile; Imperial College London,"Munoz, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",fdmunoz@uai.cl,"Muñoz, Francisco/AHD-1365-2022; Moreno Vieyra, Rodrigo Andres/AHD-6298-2022; Reus, Lorenzo/D-7112-2016","Moreno Vieyra, Rodrigo Andres/0000-0001-5538-445X; Reus, Lorenzo/0000-0001-9171-7688","FONDECYT [11150029, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019, 11170012]; CONICYT-Basal Project [FB0008]; Complex Engineering Systems Institute (CONICYTCONICYT) [FB0816, ICM P-05-004-F]; Energy Center of the University of Chile and Newton [Picarte/MR/N026721/1]; [Fondef/ID15I10592]",FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT-Basal Project; Complex Engineering Systems Institute (CONICYTCONICYT); Energy Center of the University of Chile and Newton;,"The research in this article was supported by FONDECYT #11150029, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019 (SERC-CHILE), CONICYT-Basal Project FB0008, the Complex Engineering Systems Institute (CONICYTCONICYT - PIA - FB0816; ICM P-05-004-F), Fondef/ID15I10592, FONDECYT #11170012, The Energy Center of the University of Chile and Newton-Picarte/MR/N026721/1.

This increase in volatility is supported by a decrease in efficiency for the short-term, while market integration rose during periods of crises, which represent higher volatility.

We show that inequality is lower, redistribution less extensive, and benefit receipt far more widespread from a longer-run perspective. The choice of accounting period can also lead to a very different assessment of the distributional impact of policy reforms. Our results show the importance of policymakers explicitly considering what it is they are trying to achieve through redistribution: the alleviation of short-run hardship or the reduction of lifetime inequality. While there may be good reasons to pursue both objectives, the group of people affected and the appropriate policy response will differ depending on which is prioritized.","[Roantree, Barra; Shaw, Jonathan] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Roantree, Barra] UCL, London, England; [Shaw, Jonathan] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Roantree, B (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Roantree, B (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",barra.roantree@ifs.org.uk,,"Roantree, Barra/0000-0002-8738-8225","Nuffield Foundation [OPD/40976]; European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSCWTBDS]; ESRC Center for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal [RES-544-28-5001, ES/M010147/1]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Nuffield Foundation; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC Center for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Nuffield Foundation (OPD/40976), the European Research Council (reference ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSCWTBDS) and the ESRC Center for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal (RES-544-28-5001, ES/M010147/1).

Poor development prospects and an increasing belief that these places have no future-as economic dynamism has been posited to be increasingly dependent on agglomeration economies-have led many of these so-called places that don't matter to revolt against the status quo. The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box, in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income support and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that don't matter.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",,,,,66,787,812,16,170,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

For this purpose, we develop a two-country monetary union new Keynesian general equilibrium model with housing and collateral constraints, to be calibrated for Lithuania and the rest of the euro area. We consider two different scenarios for macroprudential policies: one in which the ECB extends its goals to also include financial stability and a second one in which a national macroprudential authority uses the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) as an instrument. The results show that both rules are effective in making the financial system more stable in both countries, and especially in Lithuania. This is because the financial sector in this country is more sensitive to shocks. We find that an extended Taylor rule is indeed effective in reducing the volatility of credit, but comes with a cost in terms of higher inflation volatility. The simple LTV rule, on the other hand, does not compromise the objective of monetary policy. This reinforces the Tinbergen principle, which argues that there should be two different instruments when there are two different policy goals.","[Rubio, Margarita] Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Comunale, Mariarosaria] Bank Lithuania, Totoriu G 4, LT-01121 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Nottingham; Bank of Lithuania,"Rubio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Comunale, M (通讯作者)，Bank Lithuania, Totoriu G 4, LT-01121 Vilnius, Lithuania.",margarita.rubio@nottingham.ac.uk; mcomunale@lb.lt,,"Comunale, Mariarosaria/0000-0002-7994-5204",,,,,46,7,7,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

They greatly influence burden of disease estimations and economic evaluations involving stays in healthcare facilities. However, different estimation techniques employ assumptions that differ crucially in whether to consider the value of the second-best alternative use forgone, of any available alternative use, or the value of the actually chosen alternative. Informed by economic theory, this paper provides a taxonomic framework of methodologies for estimating the opportunity costs of resources. This taxonomy is then applied to bed-days by classifying existing approaches accordingly. We highlight differences in valuation between approaches and the perspective adopted, and we use our framework to appraise the assumptions and biases underlying the standard approaches that have been widely adopted mostly unquestioned in the past, such as the conventional use of reference costs and administrative accounting data. Drawing on these findings, we present a novel approach for estimating the opportunity costs of bed-days in terms of health forgone for the second-best patient, but expressed monetarily. This alternative approach effectively re-connects to the concept of choice and explicitly considers net benefits. It is broadly applicable across settings and for other resources besides bed-days.","[Sandmann, Frank G.; Edmunds, W.

These challenges are exacerbated when longer term effectiveness, and thus value for money, is uncertain, but they can arise even when treatments are proven to be highly cost-effective at the time of launch. This commentary reviews innovative payment solutions proposed in the literature to address the affordability issue, including the use of credit markets and of staged payments linked to patient outcomes, and draws on discussions with payers in the United States and Europe on the feasibility or desirability of operationalizing any of the alternative financing and payment strategies that appear in the literature. This included a small number of semistructured interviews. We conclude that there is a mismatch between the enthusiasm in the academic literature for developing new approaches and the scepticism of payers that they can work or are necessary. For the foreseeable future, affordability pressures will continue to be handled by aggressive price bargaining, high co-pays (in systems in which this is possible), and restricting access to subgroups of patients. Of the mechanisms we explored, outcomes-based payments were of most interest to payers, but the costs associated with operating such schemes, together with implementation challenges, did not make them an attractive option for managing affordability.","[Schaffer, Sarah Karlsberg; Mestre-Ferrandiz, Jorge; Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Messner, Donna; Tambor, Ellen] Ctr Med Technol Policy, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Towse, A (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 7th Floor,105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",atowse@ohe.org,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Schaffer, Sarah Karlsberg/H-2726-2015",,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),This work was part funded by a research grant from Pfizer.,,14,21,25,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21,3,,,,,276,279,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.013,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566833,hybrid,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428019200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a price on carbon also collects rents from underlying fossil resource stocks, giving rise to unexamined macroeconomic effects. This article shows that if these stocks are tradable, carbon pricing shifts aggregate investment towards alternative assets. If capital is underaccumulated, this implies lower costs of dimate policy and a welfare improvement. We prove this beneficial investment shift from fossil stocks towards capital for the case of an emission trading scheme: specifically, we show that the higher the share of auctioned permits, the larger the beneficial investment effect. The same holds for a 'stock instrument', under which the right to recurrently receive emission permits is a tradable asset, making the effect robust to trade restrictions on fossil stocks. Our main result contradicts the common perception of a trade-off between climate change mitigation policy and growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

For youth today, an important marker of adulthood is self-actualization in their professional career, and, consequently, also the achievement of stable financial conditions. Economic conditions of youth are greatly subject to fluctuations in the economy, and the subsequent governmental response. Using the Luxembourg Income Study, this work investigates the trends in income from work of young adults before and after the Great Recession of 2008 in five countries-US, UK, Norway, Germany, and Spain. The findings showed deterioration in economic conditions of young men, but with differences across countries. Young women suffered less from the crisis, and in some countries, their economic situation improved. The general negative trend was especially pronounced for those with high education, which is primarily because they stayed in education longer.","[Sironi, Maria] UCL, Dept Social Sci, 55-59 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0NU, England",University of London; University College London,"Sironi, M (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Social Sci, 55-59 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0NU, England.",m.sironi@ucl.ac.uk,,"Sironi, Maria/0000-0002-8005-7255",,,,,68,31,40,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

While previous work predominantly focused on developing alternative axiomatizations, in this article we propose a novel approach which centers around the coalition formation process and the underlying probability distribution from which a suitable axiomatization naturally follows. Specifically, we view coalition formation in games with externalities as a discrete-time stochastic process. We focus, in particular, on the Chinese Restaurant Process - a well-known stochastic process from probability theory. We show that reformulating Shapley's coalition formation process as the Chinese Restaurant Process yields in games with externalities a unique value with various desirable properties. We then generalize this result by proving that all values that satisfy the direct translation of Shapley's axioms to games with externalities can be obtained using our approach based on stochastic processes.

This article further reveals the nature of this link. We show that citizens follow party cues on international bailouts, rather than having merely ideologically congruent positions. By employing an original survey experiment that exposes respondents to elite cues, we additionally uncover underlying dynamics. First, party cues mobilize support for bailouts even in the face of salient elite dissent and, second, even a strong elite consensus does not affect citizens without PID and low levels of political sophistication. The findings of the experiment are cross-validated with data from the voter survey of European Election Study 2014. The results suggest that current debates about international bailout packages deepen a polarization between politicized and non-politicized Europeans.","[Stoeckel, Florian] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Kuhn, Theresa] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Exeter; University of Amsterdam,"Stoeckel, F (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",florian.stoeckel@gmail.com,"Stoeckel, Florian/ABI-7673-2020","Kuhn, Theresa/0000-0001-8784-1731",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VENI grant) [451-13-029]; Graduate School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VENI grant)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Graduate School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,"The authors would like to thank Liesbet Hooghe, Alison Johnston, Hanspeter Kriesi, Michael MacKuen, Gary Marks, Rune Slothuus, the participants of the Research Group on Governance at the European University Institute, the editors of JCMS, and the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions.

Divergence manifests itself in many ways, including per capita income, labor force participation, and the spatial distribution of skills and returns to education. At the same time, geographical polarization of political preferences and electoral choices has increased, with gains in populism and nationalism in some regions, and broadening of socially liberal, pro-trade and multicultural attitudes in other regions. The task of explaining these developments poses challenges to economic geography and regional and urban economics. These fields have already developed some of the building blocks of an account, but a number of important gaps persist. This article is devoted to identifying priorities for regional science and urban economics, the new economic geography and proper economic geography to tackle the key mechanisms behind divergence as well as to integrate them in a common overall framework.","[Storper, Michael] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Storper, Michael] Sci Po Paris, Ctr Sociol Organisat, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75007 Paris, France; [Storper, Michael] UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Storper, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Storper, M (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Ctr Sociol Organisat, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75007 Paris, France.;Storper, M (通讯作者)，UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",m.storper@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,116,104,110,2,123,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The need to change macroeconomic theory is similar to the situation in the 1930s, at the time of the Great Depression, and in the 1970s, when inflationary pressures were unsustainable. Four main changes to the core model are recommended: to emphasize financial frictions, to place a limit on the operation of rational expectations, to include heterogeneous agents, and to devise more appropriate microfoundations. Achieving these objectives requires changes to all of the behavioural equations in the model governing consumption, investment, and price setting, and also the insertion of a wedge between the interest rate set by policy-makers and that facing consumers and investors. In our view, the result will not be a paradigm shift, but an evolution towards a more pluralist discipline.","[Vines, David] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Balliol Coll, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking INET, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Sydney; University of Oxford; Australian National University,"Vines, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Balliol Coll, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Oxford, England.;Vines, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking INET, Oxford, England.;Vines, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk; samuel.wills@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,103,56,55,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Existing literature is conflicted: recommending both to invest them at home, and save them in sovereign wealth funds abroad. I reconcile these views by combining a stochastic model of precautionary savings with a deterministic model of a capital-scarce resource exporter. I show that both developed and developing countries should build an offshore Volatility Fund, but refrain from depleting it when oil prices fall because it cannot be known when, or if, they will rise again. Instead, consumption should adjust and only the interest on the fund should be consumed. To do this I develop a parsimonious framework that nests a variety of existing results as special cases, which I present in four principles: for capital-abundant countries, i) smooth consumption using a Future Generations Fund, and ii) build a Volatility Fund quickly, then leave it alone; and for capital scarce countries, iii) consume, invest and deleverage, and iv) invest part of the Volatility Fund domestically, then leave it alone.","[Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wills, Samuel] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Sydney; Australian National University,"Wills, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England.;Wills, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Wills, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",samuel.wills@sydney.edu.au,,,BP; ESRC [ES/K0093031/1],BP; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I would like to thank Martin Ellison, Wouter den Haan, John Muellbauer, Peter Neary, David Vines, Tony Venables, Rick van der Ploeg and seminar participants at the University of Oxford for helpful comments.

Household intertemporal deprivations in these dimensions are estimated using measures which are sensitive to the precise sequence in which poor and non-poor spells occur. A generalised recursive selection model is then proposed to investigate the determinants of intertemporal deprivation in each dimension, allowing for the possibility that correlated unobservables drive the dual deprivations. Improvement in agricultural production is crucial for reducing both dimensions of intertemporal deprivation. We find evidence suggestive of intertemporal income-nutrition poverty traps. Higher labour productivity, especially in agriculture rather than local off-farm activities or out-migration, holds much potential for breaking the vicious circle. Agricultural innovation and mechanisation, regarded by the government as indispensable, yield mixed outcomes for alleviating intertemporal multi-dimensional deprivations.","[You, Jing; Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [You, Jing; Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Roope, Laurence] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; University of Oxford,"Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",jing.you@ruc.edu.cn; wangsg@ruc.edu.cn; laurence.roope@dph.ox.ac.uk,,"Roope, Laurence/0000-0001-9098-9331; You, Jing/0000-0002-0152-0724","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403282, 71673283]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDC026]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The authors are extremely grateful to Stephan Klasen and Christophe Muller, for helpful comments on an earlier draft.

Three key results differ from those in regular models. First, both the threshold point and the threshold effect parameters are shown to be identified without the need for instrumentation. Second, in partially linear threshold models, both parametric and nonparametric components rely on the same data, which prima facie suggests identification failure. But, as shown here, the discontinuity structure of the threshold itself supplies identifying information for the parametric coefficients without the need for extra randomness in the regressors. Third, instrumentation plays different roles in the estimation of the system parameters, delivering identification for the structural coefficients in the usual way, but raising convergence rates for the threshold effect parameters and improving efficiency for the threshold point. Simulation studies corroborate the theory and the asymptotics. An empirical application is conducted to explore the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings, illustrating the relevance of threshold models in treatment effects evaluation in the presence of endogeneity.

Moreover, these appeals are first assigned at random to a chamber, with a judge then designated as the rapporteur who will be most closely involved with the case. Using handcollected original data on the background characteristics of EU judges and on competition judgments by the General Court between 1989 and 2015, we test the extent to which the legal origins of judges bear a statistically significant effect on case outcomes and that the rapporteur plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. In particular, if a rapporteur comes from a country whose administrative law has a strong French influence, the decision is more likely to favor the Commission than if he is from any other EU country.

The dealer offers the trading mechanism contingent on the aggregate history of his customers summarized by the asset allocation. The equilibrium distortion is type dependent: trade with small surplus breaks down; trade with intermediate surplus may be delayed; trade with large surplus is carried out with a large bid/ask spread but without delay. Because of dealers' limited commitment, the distortions become more severe when the valuation shock is frequent, the valuation dispersion is large or the matching friction to form new relationships is large. Calibrating the model and running a horse race between matching efficiency, trading speed and relationship stability, I found that the liquidity disruption in the market during the recent financial crisis is more consistent with declining matching efficiency of forming trading relationships. The optimal mechanism can be implemented by random quote posting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the model, continuing restaurants cannot change employment, and thus industry-level adjustment occurs gradually through exit of labor-intensive restaurants and entry of capital-intensive restaurants. Interestingly, the putty-clay model matches the small estimated short-run disemployment effect of the minimum wage found in other studies, but produces a larger long-run disemployment effect.","Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; UCL, IFS, London, England; CEPR, London, England; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Unaffiliated, Cambridge, MA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"French, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",eric.french.econ@gmail.com,,,"ESRC [ES/P001831/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,50,66,4,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

However, the long-term effects of openness have yet to be demonstrated, even if few researchers hypothesized that high openness could increase firms' dynamic capabilities and hence their resilience in the face of adversities, such economic downturns. Hence, this article attempts to investigate this dynamic relationship between openness and firm performance with particular considerations addressing the recent financial crisis in 2008. Based upon the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) panel data collected between 2006 and 2012, this study finds evidence that supports the positive influence of openness on long-term firm performance. The results show that (i) increasing a firm's openness is an effective way of enhancing its dynamic capability and hence its resilience, and (ii) of all the various configurations of openness, the collaboration with partners outside the firm's value chain and international partners has the highest impact on turnover recovery, as they will increase the chances of acquiring newer knowledge, which in turn will help firms to identify new opportunities to achieve sustainable growth.

Objectives This study examines how satisfied the Saudi people are with their public sector healthcare services and assesses their willingness to contribute to financing the system through a national health insurance scheme. The study also examines public preferences and expectations of a future national health insurance system. Methods A total of 36 heads of households participated in face-to-face audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. The participants were purposefully selected based on different socio-economic and socio-demographic factors from urban and rural areas to represent the geographical diversity that would presumably influence individual views, expectations, preferences and healthcare experiences. Results The evidence showed some dissatisfaction with the provision and quality of current public sector healthcare services, including the availability of appointments, waiting times and the availability of drugs. The households indicated a willingness to contribute to a national insurance scheme, conditional upon improvements in the quality of public sector healthcare services. The results also revealed a variety of preferences and expectations regarding the proposed national health insurance scheme. Conclusions Quality improvement is a key factor that could motivate the Saudi people to contribute to financing the healthcare system.

It can show, for example, that an improvement in parental outside options will reduce parental and school effort, which are partially compensated through school resources. In this way, by incorporating the behavioral responses of parents, teachers, and policymakers, the paper provides a rationale for the existing ambiguous empirical evidence on the effect of school resources.

Methods: A payer-perspective cost-effectiveness model simulated disease progression in patients with RA who had previously failed conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and were starting biologic therapy. Patients commenced treatment with abatacept or adalimumab plus methotrexate and were evaluated after 6 months. Therapy continuation was based on the European League Against Rheumatism treatment response; disease progression was based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score. These score changes were used to estimate health state utilities and direct medical costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained were calculated by baseline ACPA groups (Q1, 28-234 AU/ml; Q2, 235-609 AU/ml; Q3, 613-1045 AU/ml; and Q4, 1060-4894 AU/ml). Scenario analysis and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate robustness of model assumptions. Results: Abatacept resulted in QALY gain versus adalimumab in ACPA Q1, Q3, and Q4; between-treatment difference (difference: Q1, -0.115 Q2, -0.009 Q3, 0.045; and Q4, 0.279). Total lifetime discounted cost was higher for abatacept versus adalimumab in most quartiles (Q2, 77,612 pound vs. 77,546; pound Q3, 74,441 pound vs. 73,263; pound and Q4, 78,428 pound vs. 76,696) pound because of longer time on treatment. Incremental cost per QALY for abatacept (vs. adalimumab) was the lowest in the high ACPA titer group (Q4, 6200 pound/QALY), followed by the next lowest titer group (Q3, 26,272 pound/QALY). Conclusions: Abatacept is a cost effective alternative to adalimumab in patients with RA with high ACPA levels.","[Alemao, Evo] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Route 206 & Prov Line Rd, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Johal, Sukhvinder] PAREXEL Int, London, England; [Al, Maiwenn J.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Law, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Rutten-van Molken, Maureen] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Parexel International; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Alemao, E (通讯作者)，Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Route 206 & Prov Line Rd, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",evo.alemao@bms.com,"Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/X-8712-2019; Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/G-8481-2014","Molken, Maureen Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159; Molken, Maureen PMH Rutten-van/0000-0001-8706-3159","Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ); BMS","Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ); BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb)","This study was sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ).

A trade-off arises between the benefit of always having the right manager and the cost of incentive provision. The prospect of growth-induced turnover limits the firm's ability to rely on deferred pay, resulting in more front-loaded compensation. The optimal contract may insulate managers from the risk of growth-induced dismissal after periods of good performance.

To do so, we use the spillover index approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014, 2015) and the dynamic correlation coefficient model of Engle (2002) so as to identify the transmission mechanisms of volatility shocks and the contagion of volatility among oil prices and stock prices of oil and gas companies, respectively. Given that volatility transmission across oil and major oil and gas corporations is important for portfolio diversification and risk management, we also examine optimal weights and hedge ratios among the aforementioned series. Our results point to the existence of significant volatility spillover effects among oil and oil and gas companies' stock volatility. However, the spillover is usually unidirectional from oil and gas companies' stock volatility to oil volatility, with BP, CHEVRON, EXXON, SHELL and TOTAL being the major net transmitters of volatility to oil markets. Conditional correlations are positive and time-varying, with those between each of the aforementioned companies and oil being the highest.

The research needs are presented under six headings. Stages for undertaking the research activities under each of these headings have been identified. The agenda highlights that the challenge of retrofitting is holistic and includes not just engineering and construction actions but economic, social and governmental requirements.

When accounting for fixed effects, panel attrition, endogeneity, and reverse causality, the positive effect of voluntary work remains robust. For the first time in the literature, we calculate the monetary equivalent of mental wellbeing benefits of voluntary work with the compensating variation approach, and estimate them up to a maximum of around 9,500 euros per indicator.

We document that first-time borrowers assigned to officers of the opposite sex are less likely to return for a second loan. The effect is larger when officers have little prior exposure to borrowers of the other gender and when they have more discretion to act on their gender beliefs, as proxied by financial market competition and branch size. We also find that first-time borrowers matched with opposite-sex officers pay higher interest rates and receive smaller and shorter-maturity loans, but do not experience higher arrears.

It argues that the combination of poor employment opportunities, requirements, compulsions and sanctions has not merely reduced available choice for individuals with multiple barriers to re-/join the labour market but has also resulted in curtailed decision-making abilities when it comes to their pathways into employment. The outcomes can include protective resistance as a response to the extent of regulation, which may undermine engagement in job search and related activities. Despite attempts by benevolent staff in a charity to provide support and enhance capabilities that result in the overcoming of protective resistance, they operate within a broader institutional framework of choice as set by government policy.

The literature that provides micro-level support for the policy discourse about institutional quality does not, however, account for significant intra-country variation in reactions of firms to changes in business environments, even within the same industry, and it generally ignores the possibility that the impact of institutional quality on firm performance may not be neutral. In this paper, we analyze the impact of institutions on firm performance using an approach that enables us to overcome these problems with the stylized approach. Using cross-country firm-level data, we demonstrate that not only does the marginal impact of institutional quality vary significantly within countries, but also that the impact is economically significant only at the two extremes of the distribution. We view this as prima facie evidence that policies that tinker with institutional quality on the basis of the popular wisdom about the impact of these institutions on the average firm may not have the desired or expected impact, at least at the micro level.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] Inst Labor Econ, IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar; Dimova, Ralitza] GLO, Bonn, Germany; [Dimova, Ralitza] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY USA; [Sun, Kai] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",University of Sheffield; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Manchester; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Shanghai University,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Univ, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.k.bhaumik@sheffield.ac.uk,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439; Bhaumik, Sumon/0000-0002-4459-3659",,,,,44,13,13,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Integrated modelling of urban water and power systems would facilitate the investment and planning processes, but there is a crucial gap to be filled with regards to extending models to incorporate the food supply in developing contexts. In this paper, a holistic methodology and platform to support the resilient and sustainable planning at city region level for multiple sectors was developed for applications in urban energy systems (UES) and the energy-water-food nexus, combining agent-based modelling - to simulate and forecast resource demands on spatial and temporal scales - with resource network optimization, which incorporates capital expenditures, operational costs, environmental impacts and the opportunity cost of food production foregone (OPF). Via a scenario based approach, innovative water supply and energy deployment policies are presented, which address the provision of clean energy for every citizen and demonstrate the potential effects of climate change. The results highlighted the vulnerability of Ghanas power generation infrastructure and the need for diversification. Feed-in tariffs and investment into supporting infrastructure and agriculture intensification will effectively increase the share of renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions.","[Bieber, Niclas; Ker, Jen Ho; Wang, Xiaonan; van Dam, Koen H.; Shah, Nilay] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Wang, Xiaonan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Singapore 117585, Singapore; [Triantafyllidis, Charalampos] UCL, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Dept Chem Engn, London WC1E 7JE, England; [Koppelaar, Rembrandt H.

Evolution is always a matter of change and, although its driving force is innovation, the price mechanism is central to how innovations are resolved into economic development. That is Schumpeter's great theme, but he said relatively little about who sets prices or how and why prices are changed. We focus particularly on price determination in markets disrupted by innovations, where firms are necessarily heterogeneous. We contrast the evolutionary paths followed by prices and market structure when prices are determined by market clearing to the paths when prices are determined through the application by firms of administered rules and routines to achieve their strategic objectives. This links the analysis to theories of administered prices and post-Keynesian price theories more broadly. Interaction of innovators with their customers and with established competitors create the context for the evolution of pricing rules along with differential firm growth, which together generates structural change in the industry and the economy. We show that analyzing how the introduction and diffusion of innovations impact on the rules and routines provides the foundation for a broadly applicable evolutionary price theory.","[Bloch, Harry] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Metcalfe, Stan] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",Curtin University; University of Manchester,"Bloch, H (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",h.bloch@curtin.edu.au; stan.metcalfe@manchester.ac.uk,"Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925",,,,,25,13,16,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model developed in Microsoft((R)) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately 45,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of approximately 143,000 pound per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately 49,000 pound per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments including both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the discount agreed in the PAS.","[Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C.; de Groot, Saskia; de Almeida, Fernando Albuquerque; Al, Maiwenn J.] Erasmus Univ, IMTA, Inst Hlth Policy & Management IBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Fayter, Debra; Wolff, Robert; Armstrong, Nigel; Stirk, Lisa; Worthy, Gill; Kleijnen, Jos] Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Kleijnen, Jos] Maastricht Univ, Dept Family Med, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Maastricht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Kleijnen Systematic Reviews; Maastricht University,"Büyükkaramikli, NC (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, IMTA, Inst Hlth Policy & Management IBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",buyukkaramikli@imta.eur.nl,"; Wolff, Robert/E-2322-2016; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./V-3982-2018","de Groot, Saskia/0000-0003-2782-3114; Wolff, Robert/0000-0003-3270-7791; Albuquerque de Almeida, Fernando/0000-0001-8528-2702; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./0000-0002-2021-9574",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program [13/104/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program (project number 13/104/01 STA) (see the HTA program website for further information-http://www.hta.ac.uk).

In the model, it was assumed that the privately informed seller's type is distributed on a two-point support.

Origin and destination countries are characterized by substantial differences in incomes, political rights and cultures. Incentives as well as costs shape the decision to migrate. One powerful dynamic effect is that diasporas increase migration, mainly because they lower the cost of migration. Diasporas assist the next wave of migrants by overcoming the high cost of the emigration, in particular when the origin country is far away and poor. The interaction between the diaspora and cultural distance is also significant. Diasporas in culturally distant countries appear to be particularly useful in overcoming the cost of migration. We interpret this as evidence that culturally distant diasporas are less likely to integrate and maintain closer links with their country of origin, while diasporas from culturally similar countries are more likely to integrate and thus be less useful to potential new migrants.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England; [Collier, Paul] Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England; [Hoeffler, Anke] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hoeffler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",anke.hoeffler@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Hoeffler, Anke/0000-0002-0684-6096",European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [290752],European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"We would like to thank the anonymous referee, Michel Beine, Simone Bertoli, Stephen Fisher and Mariola Pytlikova for comments on an earlier draft and David Hendry and Jennifer Castle for help with Oxmetrics.

We approach our research question from the perspective of three sending countries in the Maghreb, namely Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. We investigate the remittance behavior using the migrants' conditions before migration as well as during the migration experience. Using a two-part model, we show that the decision to remit and the amount remitted depend on a combination of different migrant characteristics and reasons for migration as well as the form of migration. More importantly, we also consider if the remittance behavior is dependent on the type of return: decided or compelled.

However, that interpretation assumes no influence of health status in climbing the occupational ladder. This paper documents evidence of non-negligible returns to occupation status on health (which we refer as 'healthy worker effect'). We use a unique empirical strategy that addresses the issue of reverse causality. That is, an instrumental variable strategy using the variation in average health in the migrant's country of origin, a health measure plausibly not determined by the migrant's occupational status.

Large exemptions on commercial bank holdings at the Swiss National Bank result in the average rate being significantly less negative than the marginal rate. With this constellation the policy transmission to the real economy is asymmetric. It fully satisfies the needs of a small open economy in search of a negative interest differential, not those of an economy aiming at a classical monetary stimulus at the zero bound. While the Swiss design would make it possible to impose rates that are significantly more negative with modest complementary features, the unpopularity of negative rates makes it likely that the ambition to totally free monetary policy of the ZLB will, in the near future, be thwarted by democratic realities.","[Danthine, Jean-Pierre] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Danthine, Jean-Pierre] CEPR, London, England",Paris School of Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Danthine, JP (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",jean-pierre.danthine@psemail.eu,,,,,,,6,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We discuss the role of budgets, thresholds, opportunity costs, and affordability in making decisions. First, we discuss the use of budgets and thresholds in private and public health plans, their interdependence, and connection to opportunity cost. Essentially, each payer should adopt a decision rule about what is good value for money given their budget; consistent use of a cost-per-quality adjusted life-year threshold will ensure the maximum health gain for the budget. In the United States, different public and private insurance programs could use different thresholds, reflecting the differing generosity of their budgets and implying different levels of access to technologies. In addition, different insurance plans could consider different additional elements to the quality-adjusted life-year metric discussed elsewhere in our Special Task Force report. We then define affordability and discuss approaches to deal with it, including consideration of disinvestment and related adjustment costs, the impact of delaying new technologies, and comparative cost effectiveness of technologies. Over time, the availability of new technologies may increase the amount that populations want to spend on health care. We then discuss potential modifiers to thresholds, including uncertainty about the evidence used in the decision-making process. This article concludes by discussing the application of these concepts in the context of the pluralistic US health care system, as well as the excess burden of tax-financed public programs versus private programs.","[Danzon, Patricia M.; Pauly, Mark V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",University of Pennsylvania; University of York - UK,"Danzon, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",danzon@wharton.upenn.edu,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014",,,,,,14,42,42,4,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21,2,,,,,140,145,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.008,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477391,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000425894000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials comparing two or more basal insulin regimens were conducted. The following basal insulin regimens were included: Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (iNPH) (once [od], twice [bid], and four times daily [qid]), insulin detemir (iDet) (od and bid), insulin glargine 100 IU (iGlarg) (od), and insulin degludec (iDegl) (od). We searched the following databases: MEDLINE via OVID, Embase via OVID, and the Cochrane Library (Wiley). Study quality was appraised using Cochrane risk-of-bias checklist for randomized controlled trials. Two outcomes (change in hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] and rate of severe/major hypoglycemia [SH]) were analyzed. Network inconsistency was assessed using Bucher and chi-square tests. Results: Thirty studies met the eligibility criteria. Twenty-five were included in the HbA(1c) network and 16 in the SH network. All studies were of moderate quality. No network inconsistency was evident in the HbA(1c) network. Of the seven regimens of interest, iDet (bid) had the highest probability of being best (mean change in HbA(1c) -0.48; 95% credible interval -0.69 to -0.29). In contrast, the SH network demonstrated both considerable uncertainty and significant network inconsistency (chi(2) test, P = 0.003). Conclusions: Of the specified frequency regimens, iDet (bid) had the highest probability of being the best basal insulin regimen in terms of reduction in HbA(1c). Ranking of the regimens in terms of the SH rate was highly uncertain and no clear conclusion could be made.","[Dawoud, Dalia; Wonderling, David; Cobb, Jill; Higgins, Bernard] Royal Coll Physicians, Natl Guideline Ctr, London, England; [Dawoud, Dalia] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Clin Pharm Dept, Cairo, Egypt; [O'Mahony, Rachel] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, London, England; [Amiel, Stephanie A.] Kings Coll London, Weston Educ Ctr, Sch Med, Diabet Res Grp,Div Diabet & Nutr Sci, London, England",Royal College of Physicians; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of London; King's College London,"Dawoud, D (通讯作者)，Royal Coll Physicians, 11 St Andrews Pl,Regents Pk, London NW1 4LE, England.",dalia.dawoud@rcplondon.ac.uk,"MUI, HOI LING/I-3220-2018; Dawoud, Dalia M/N-9741-2019","Dawoud, Dalia M/0000-0002-2105-1937",National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); NICE,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); NICE,"This work was undertaken by the National Guideline Centre (NGC), Royal College of Physicians London (formerly National Clinical Guideline Centre [NCGC]), which received funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

J,"Di Pietro, G",,,,"Di Pietro, Giorgio",,,Revisiting the impact of macroeconomic conditions on health behaviours,ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health behaviours; Unemployment; Business cycle; Italy,BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNEMPLOYMENT; CONNECTION; RECESSIONS; TIMES,"This paper estimates the average population effect of macroeconomic conditions on health behaviours accounting for the heterogeneous impact of the business cycle on individuals. While previous studies use models relying on area-specific unemployment rates to estimate this average effect, this paper employs a model based on area-specific unemployment rates by gender and age group. The rationale for breaking down unemployment rates is that the severity of cyclical upturns and downturns does not only significantly vary across geographical areas, but also across gender and age. The empirical analysis uses microdata from the Italian Multipurpose Household Survey on Everyday Life Issues. The estimates suggest that models employing aggregated and disaggregated unemployment rate measures as a proxy for the business cycle produce similar findings for some health behaviours (such as smoking), whereas different results are obtained for others. While using unemployment rates by gender and age group, fruits and/or vegetables consumption turns out to be procyclical (a 1pp increase in this unemployment rate decreases the probability of consuming at least five daily fruit and/or vegetable servings by 0.0016pp), the opposite effect, though statistically insignificant, is observed once general unemployment rates are used. While both models conclude that physical activity declines during economic downturns, the size of the procyclical effect is much smaller when employing disaggregated rather than aggregated unemployment rates (a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate by gender and age group decreases the probability of doing any physical activity by 0.0017pp).

This study has developed a stochastic energy economy -environment integrated model, to assess China's energy and climate targets in 2030, with a particular focus on the carbon intensity reduction, carbon emission peaking, and non-fossil energy development. The probabilities of realizing the targets are obtained, and the nexus among different targets is explored. It's argued that carbon emission management and policy-making should be implemented from the perspective of risk management, and policy makers can take corresponding policy measures based on the degree of confidence required under multiple future uncertainties. It is found that the probabilities of realizing carbon emission-peaking target and non-fossil energy target are low, with the business-as-usual efforts, and additional policies may still be needed. More specific, carbon pricing plays a major role in curbing and peaking carbon emissions, while the policy mix of carbon pricing and non-fossil energy subsidies can peak the carbon emission with relatively low cost compared to the single carbon pricing policy. It is also found that the carbon intensity reduction target is most likely to be attained, followed by the carbon-peaking target, and then the non-fossil energy target, given the same policy efforts. This indicates that, China may not deliberately increase carbon emissions rapidly over the next decade to make the carbon emission peak as high as possible; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the non-fossil energy target.

In the English National Health Service, around 7% of patients who are referred by their general practice for a hospital outpatient appointment fail to attend. An electronic booking system (Choose and BookC&B) for general practices making hospital outpatient appointments was introduced in England in 2005 and by 2009 accounted for 50% of appointments. It was intended, inter alia, to reduce the rate of non-attendance. Using a 2004-2009 panel with 7,900 English general practices, allowing for the relaxation of constraints on patient of hospital, and for the potential endogeneity of use of C&B, we estimate that the introduction of C&B reduced non-attendance by referred patients in 2009 by 72,160 (8.7%).","[Dusheiko, Mark] Univ Lausanne, Inst Univ Med Prevent & Social, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gravelle, Hugh] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Lausanne; University of York - UK,"Gravelle, H (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",hugh.gravelle@york.ac.uk,,"Gravelle, Hugh/0000-0002-7753-4233",MRC [G0902067]; Medical Research Council [G0902067] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0902067] Funding Source: UKRI,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"MRC, Grant/Award Number: G0902067",,42,15,16,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,357,371,,10.1002/hec.3552,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3552,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28776868,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reforms are often cast as an iconic moment of neoliberal deregulation and a key episode in the globalization of financial markets. Such accounts stress that the state played an active role in constructing the reforms and upholding the global market relations they produced, yet they remain unclear about the state's direct interest in pursuing financial market liberalization. The article contends that domestic concerns over sovereign debt management were central to the state's pursuit of regulatory change. The Big Bang reforms greatly expanded the size and liquidity of the market for British sovereign debt. This empowered the state, improving its capacity to conduct monetary policy and to raise finance on better terms. In doing so, the article demonstrates the necessity of examining sovereign debt management in order to specify the state's role in the construction of financial globalization.","[Dutta, Sahil Jai] Univ Warwick, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Dutta, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",s.dutta.1@warwick.ac.uk,,"Dutta, Sahil/0000-0002-6465-4279",University of Sussex Doctoral Studentship Scheme,University of Sussex Doctoral Studentship Scheme,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Part of this research was supported by the University of Sussex Doctoral Studentship Scheme.",,70,16,17,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Psychopathy and professional success are multidimensional constructs, and thus certain elements of psychopathy may be related more strongly to certain elements of professional success. Also, psychopathic traits, comprising self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness, may not predict professional success above and beyond the Big Five. We investigated whether self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness predicted professional satisfaction (satisfaction with salary, with promotion, and with career) as well as material success (annual salary, number of promotions, and professional standing) in an occupational sample (N = 439). Self-centered impulsivity was inversely related to professional satisfaction, whereas fearless dominance was positively related to professional satisfaction and material success. Coldheartedness was related to neither of them. Adding the Big Five, as well as participant gender and time in job, as predictors revealed that extraversion and self-centered impulsivity predicted professional satisfaction, whereas only extraversion predicted material success; fearless dominance was no longer a significant predictor of material success. Taken together, self-centered impulsivity was negatively linked, whereas fearless dominance was positively linked, to professional success. The findings highlight the differential contribution of impulsiveness-versus fearlessness-related elements of psychopathic traits to professional satisfaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This article provides ameta-analysis of prior experimental research and reports the results of a new experiment to elucidate how cooperation varies with the environment in this canonical game. We describe forces that affect initial play (formation of cooperation) and unraveling (breakdown of cooperation). First, contrary to the backward induction prediction, the parameters of the repeated game have a significant effect on initial cooperation. We identify how these parameters impact the value of cooperation-as captured by the size of the basin of attraction of always defect-to account for an important part of this effect. Second, despite these initial differences, the evolution of behavior is consistent with the unraveling logic of backward induction for all parameter combinations. Importantly, despite the seemingly contradictory results across studies, this article establishes a systematic pattern of behavior: subjects converge to use threshold strategies that conditionally cooperate until a threshold round; conditional on establishing cooperation, the first defection round moves earlier with experience. Simulation results generated from a learning model estimated at the subject level provide insights into the long-term dynamics and the forces that slow down the unraveling of cooperation.","[Embrey, Matthew] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Sussex; New York University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Embrey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,"Embrey, Matthew/0000-0002-3423-4142",National Science Foundation [SES-1225779]; Center for Experimental Social Science,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Experimental Social Science,"We thank the editor, anonymous referees, James Andreoni, Yoella Bereby-Meyer, Russell Cooper, Pedro Dal Bo, Douglas DeJong, Robert Forsythe, Drew Fudenberg, Daniel Friedman, P.J.

Overall, the literature now reflects a more cautious and nuanced evaluation of privatization. Thus, private ownership alone is no longer argued to automatically generate economic gains in developing economies; pre-conditions (especially the regulatory infrastructure) and an appropriate process of privatization are important for attaining a positive impact. These comprise a list which is often challenging in developing countries: well-designed and sequenced reforms; the implementation of complementary policies; the creation of regulatory capacity; attention to poverty and social impacts; and strong public communication. Even so, the studies do identify the scope for efficiency-enhancing privatization that also promotes equity in developing countries.","[Estrin, Saul] London Sch Econ, Management, London, England; [Pelletier, Adeline] Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Inst Management Studies, Strategy, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Estrin, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Management, London, England.",s.estrin@lse.ac.uk,"estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020","estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593",U.K. Department for International Development; Overseas Development Institute,U.K. Department for International Development; Overseas Development Institute,"Saul Estrin is a professor of management at the London School of Economics; correspondence to be sent to s.estrin@lse.ac.uk.

However, little is known about the influence of supply-side factors. This paper addresses that research gap by analysing the role of hospital-specialty characteristics in explaining variations in patients' evaluation of responsiveness from a sample of about 38,700 in-patients treated in public hospitals within the Italian Region of Emilia-Romagna. The analysis is carried out by adopting a 2-step procedure. First, we use patients' self-reported data to derive 5 measures of responsiveness at the hospital-specialty level. By estimating a generalised ordered probit model, we are able to correct for variations in individual reporting behaviour due to the health status of patients and their experience of being in pain. Second, we run cross-sectional regressions to investigate the association between patients' responsiveness and potential supply-side drivers, including waiting times, staff workload, the level of spending on non-clinical facilities, the level of spending on staff education and training, and the proportion of staff expenditure between nursing and administrative staff. Results suggest that responsiveness is to some extent influenced by the supply-side drivers considered.","[Fiorentini, Gianluca; Verzulli, Rossella] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Robone, Silvana] Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Robone, Silvana] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Robone, Silvana] Univ York, Alcuin Coll, HEDG, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Bologna; University of Insubria; Bocconi University; University of York - UK,"Robone, S (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",silvana.robone@uninsubria.it,,"Fiorentini, Gianluca/0000-0003-4197-9924",Agency for Health Care and Social Services of Emilia-Romagna,Agency for Health Care and Social Services of Emilia-Romagna,Agency for Health Care and Social Services of Emilia-Romagna,,59,8,8,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,266,281,,10.1002/hec.3540,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3540,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28660624,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In homogeneous industries, firms internalize intra-firm spillovers and invest more in process innovation.

By adopting the concept of symbiosis as a starting point, the paper highlights the importance of uncertainty, policy makers' preferences and targets. Then, the role of commitment to policy rules and coordination is addressed. The analysis also focuses on the importance of the data considered for the generation of the policy mix. As a final step, the paper discusses the main results in the literature on public debt management in a monetary union. All the reported theoretical results are then adopted to retrieve policy and institutional implications for the European Monetary Union.","[Foresti, Pasquale] London Sch Econ, European Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Foresti, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, London, England.",p.foresti@lse.ac.uk,,"Foresti, Pasquale/0000-0001-8817-5099",,,,,92,23,23,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The empirical evidence suggests that undertaking ODI leads to an increase in the innovation performance of these Chinese firms. The impact of ODI on innovation is contingent on firm characteristics such as in-house R&D, strategic orientation, and international experiences as well as contextual factors associated with investment destinations and industry contexts. We also find that learning through ODI is a complex process. There is a substitution between ODI and in-house R&D in Chinese MNEs. Our findings suggest that conducting ODI in developed countries serves as an effective channel for latecomer firms to overcome internal resource constraints and leapfrog toward the technology frontier.

The Special Task Force chose to take a health economics approach to the question of whether a health plan should cover and reimburse a specific technology, beginning with the view that the conventional cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year metric has both strengths as a starting point and recognized limitations. This report calls for the development of a more comprehensive economic evaluation that could include novel elements of value (e.g., insurance value and equity) as part of either an augmented cost-effectiveness analysis or a multicriteria decision analysis. Given an aggregation of elements to a measure of value, consistent use of a cost-effectiveness threshold can help ensure the maximization of health gain and well-being for a given budget. These decisions can benefit from the use of deliberative processes. The six recommendations are to: 1) be explicit about decision context and perspective in value assessment frameworks; 2) base health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions on an evaluation of the incremental costs and benefits of health care technologies as is provided by cost-effectiveness analysis; 3) develop value thresholds to serve as one important input to help guide coverage and reimbursement decisions; 4) manage budget constraints and affordability on the basis of cost-effectiveness principles; 5) test and consider using structured deliberative processes for health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions; and 6) explore and test novel elements of benefit to improve value measures that reflect the perspectives of both plan members and patients.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.; Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE Inst, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Willke, Richard J.] Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Danzon, Patricia M.; Pauly, Mark V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doshi, Jalpa A.] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, Polit Sci, Gualala, CA USA; [Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Dept Gen Internal Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard Univ, Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Tufts Medical Center; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of York - UK; University of Southern California; University of Rochester; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harvard University,"Garrison, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, POB 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lgarrisn@uw.edu,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,6,105,110,1,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21,2,,,,,161,165,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.009,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477394,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000425894000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such deductive models provide important tools for generating hypotheses. However, the application of such models in a predictive capacity has been criticised. Simultaneously, empirical studies aimed at quantitative exploration of farmer behaviour have relied heavily on social cognitive models, such as the theory of planned behaviour, without exploration of the epidemiological consequences of variability in behaviour within populations. Advances in other social sciences have revealed systematic biases in human reasoning which cast doubt on the validity of the rational economic model as a generalisation of human decision making. We review the characteristics of infectious disease and disease-control interventions and the potential for bias in implementation decision making at primary producer level. Specific focus is given to the generation of externalities, both positive and negative; the perception of risk, relating to disease incidence, technology adoption and time preference; and finally uncertainty, and its potential to be moderated by trust in information sources. This information is then used to summarise supplemental psychological constructs which taken holistically may strengthen our ability to quantitatively explore human behaviour in this complex decision-making environment.","[Gilbert, William; Rushton, Jonathan] Royal Vet Coll, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of London; University of London Royal Veterinary College,"Gilbert, W (通讯作者)，Royal Vet Coll, Hatfield, Herts, England.",wgilbert@rvc.ac.uk,,"Gilbert, William/0000-0002-7450-7643",Royal Veterinary College,Royal Veterinary College,This work was funded by the Royal Veterinary College as part of a Research Studentship.,,125,20,21,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Finally, the paper examines how to interpret the legality of central bank mandates, and whether or not central banks have exceeded their powers.

To do this, I exploit an exogenous reform in UK R&D tax policy, which changed the definition of an SME from firms with fewer than 250 employees to those with fewer than 500 employees. I use the UK Business Enterprise Research and Development Survey (BERD), for which companies do not have an incentive to relabel their ordinary employees or spending as R&D. I find that R&D tax incentives help to increase R&D spending at the company level; this translates to a user cost elasticity between -0.88 and -1.18. Further, the additional R&D generated through the tax relief can be attributed entirely to an increase in the number of R&D employees in the companies' workforce.

Using a contingent valuation method, we elicit children's and parents' WTP to reduce children's risk of an asthma attack. Our results suggest that children are able to understand and value their own health risk reductions, and their ability to do so improves with age. Child age was found to be inversely related to parents' and children's WTP. The results also suggest that non-paternalistic altruism is predictive of children's WTP. For parents, care for their own health was found to be inversely related with their WTP for children's risk reductions. Comparison of parents' and children's WTP suggests that parents are willing to sacrifice for their child's health risk reduction an amount that is approximately twice that of their children. The analysis of matched pairs of parents and children suggest that there are within-household similarities as the child's WTP is positively related to parents' WTP.","[Guerriero, Carla] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Econ, CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Guerriero, Carla; Cairns, John] London Sch Hyg & Troical Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, London, England; [Bianchi, Fabrizio; Cori, Liliana] CNR, Environm Epidemiol Unit, Inst Clin Physiol, Pisa, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR),"Guerriero, C (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Econ, CSEF, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",carla.guerriero@unina.it,"Cori, Liliana/K-6027-2014; Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020; Bianchi, Fabrizio/F-7900-2015","Cori, Liliana/0000-0002-3070-2535; Bianchi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3459-9301; Cairns, John/0000-0001-6442-0440",Colt Foundation,Colt Foundation,Colt Foundation,,42,12,12,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,E55,E68,,10.1002/hec.3562,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3562,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28901604,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

But stakeholders are rarely explicit about the valuations they attach to different objectives, nor are these valuations likely to be identical. This complicates the assessment of their performance because no single set of weights can be chosen legitimately to aggregate outputs into unidimensional composite scores. We propose the use of dominance criteria in a multidimensional performance assessment framework to identify best practice and poor performance under relatively weak assumptions about stakeholders' preferences. We use as an example providers of hip replacement surgery in the English National Health Service and estimate multivariate multilevel models to study their performance in terms of length of stay, readmission rates, post-operative patient-reported health status and waiting time. We find substantial correlation between objectives and demonstrate that ignoring the correlation can lead to incorrect assessments of performance.","[Gutacker, Nils; Street, Andrew] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Gutacker, N (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England.",nils.gutacker@york.ac.uk,,"Gutacker, Nils/0000-0002-2833-0621; Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364",English Department of Health [103/0001],English Department of Health,"English Department of Health, Grant/Award Number: 103/0001",,78,9,10,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,E13,E27,,10.1002/hec.3554,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3554,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28833902,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, we show that the KSS test (Kapetanios, G., Y. Shin, and A. Snell. 2003. Testing for a Unit Root in the Nonlinear STAR Framework. Journal of Econometrics 112: 359-379) for nonlinear stationarity has local asymptotic power gains over standard Dickey-Fuller [DF] tests for certain degrees of nonlinearity in the ESTAR model, but that for other degrees of nonlinearity, the linear DF test has superior power. Second, we derive limiting distributions of demeaned, and demeaned and detrended KSS and DF tests under a local ESTAR alternative when a local trend is present in the DGP. We show that the power of the demeaned tests outperforms that of the detrended tests when no trend is present in the DGP, but deteriorates as the magnitude of the trend increases. We propose a union of rejections testing procedure that combines all four individual tests and show that this captures most of the power available from the individual tests across different degrees of nonlinearity and trend magnitudes. We also show that incorporating a trend detection procedure into this union testing strategy can result in higher power when a large trend is present in the DGP.","[Harvey, David I.; Leybourne, Stephen J.; Whitehouse, Emily J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Whitehouse, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",emily.whitehouse@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Whitehouse, Emily/0000-0002-8565-8420",,,,,25,0,0,1,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Previous studies of the trade-off between the quantity of children and some measure of their quality have been much concerned with the endogeneity of fertility choices. Here we use the IFLS for 1993,1997 and 2000 to exploit some unique institutional features that have influenced fertility. We find evidence that family size is influenced both from the supply side, as represented by components of the Indonesian family planning programme, and on the demand side, as represented by exposure to modern media. We use these variables as instruments for family size in regressions for the height z-scores. We find evidence for a significant negative effect of family size on height in the presence of a range of other influences. An increase of one sibling is associated with a decrease of one third of a standard deviation in the z-score of height. This effect is stronger among families with low-educated mothers and is present in both urban and rural settings.

The model sheds light on leverage cycles. During periods absent disasters: equity premia decrease; credit spreads decrease; expected loss-given-default increases; and leverage ratios increase. Time-since-prior-disaster is the key model conditioning variable. In response to a disaster, risk premia increase while firms sharply reduce labor, capital and leverage, with response size increasing in time-since-prior-disasters. Firms with high bankruptcy costs are most responsive to the time-since-disaster variable. Disaster responses are more pronounced than in an otherwise equivalent economy featuring observed disaster risk. Empirical tests of novel corporate finance predictions are conducted. Consistent with the model, we find empirically that leverage and investment are increasing in time-since-prior-recessions, with the effect more pronounced for firms with low recovery ratios.","[Hennessy, Christopher A.] London Business Sch, London, England; [Hennessy, Christopher A.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Hennessy, Christopher A.] ECGI, London, England; [Radnaev, Boris] Cornerstone Res, London, England",University of London; London Business School; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of London; London Business School; Cornerstone Research,"Hennessy, CA (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.;Hennessy, CA (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.;Hennessy, CA (通讯作者)，ECGI, London, England.",,,,European Research Council,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Franklin Allen (the editor) and an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

Implications of detailed versus general approaches are unclear. Objectives: To compare costing approaches in a trial-based economic evaluation. Methods: We applied four costing approaches to prescribed medication data from the Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors Against Combination Intensive Therapy randomized controlled trial. A detailed micro-costing approach was used as a base case, against which other approaches were compared: costing medications used by at least 1.5% of patients; costing medications on the basis of only chemical name; applying a generic prescription charge rather than a medication-specific cost. We quantitatively examined resulting estimates of prescribed medication and total care costs, and qualitatively examined trial conclusions. Results: Medication costs made up 6% of the total health and social care costs. There was good agreement in prescribed medication costs (concordance correlation coefficient [CCC] 0.815, 0.819, and 0.989) and excellent agreement in total costs (CCC 0.990, 0.995, and 0.995) between approaches 1 and 2. Approaches 3 and 4 had poor agreement with approach 1 on prescribed medication costs (CCC 0.246-0.700 and 0.033-0.333, respectively), but agreement on total care costs remained good (CCC 0.778-0.993 and 0.729-0.986, respectively). Conclusions: Because medication costs comprised only a small proportion of total costs, the less resource-intensive approaches had substantial impacts on medication cost estimates, but had little impact on total care costs and did not significantly impact the trial's cost-effectiveness conclusions. There is room for research efficiencies without detriment to an evaluation in which medication costs are likely to form a small proportion of total costs.","[Heslin, Margaret; Babalola, Oluwagbemisola] Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, London, England; [Ibrahim, Fowzia; Scott, David] Kings Coll London, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Stringer, Dominic] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Biostat Dept, London, England; [Patel, Anita] Queen Mary Univ London, Blizard Inst, Ctr Primary Care & Publ Hlth, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Heslin, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Kings Hlth Econ, David Goldberg Ctr, 16 De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill,Box 024, London SE5 8AF, England.",margaret.heslin@kcl.ac.uk,"Patel, Anita/F-9832-2010; Stringer, Dominic/L-5066-2016; Heslin, Margaret/C-4307-2014","Patel, Anita/0000-0003-0769-1732; Ibrahim, Fowzia/0000-0002-7069-8024; Heslin, Margaret/0000-0002-3094-9255; Stringer, Dominic/0000-0001-5624-1733",National Institute for Health Research [06/303/84]; King's College London,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); King's College London,This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment program (Project No. 06/303/84).

This setting is particularly relevant in public transport, as earlier findings on multi-period road supply cannot be applied when the user cost function, defined as the sum of waiting time and crowding costs, is nonhomogeneous. The presence of temporal, spatial and directional demand imbalances is unavoidable in a public transport network. It is not obvious, however, how the magnitude of demand imbalances may affect its economic and financial performance. We show in a simple back-haul setting with elastic demand, controlling for total willingness to pay in the network, that asymmetries in market size reduce the attainable social surplus of a service, while variety in maximum willingness to pay leads to higher aggregate social surplus and lower subsidy under efficient pricing. The analysis of multi-period supply sheds light on the relationship between urban structure, daily activity patterns, and public transport performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) adaptive preferences, in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations---concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews---through which people mediate their perceptions of themselves and the world around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institution may have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by law may remain excluded through custom and habits of the mind. Recognizing new forces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them. Some interventions have had very consequential impacts.","[Hoff, Karla; Walsh, James] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Walsh, James] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",The World Bank; University of Oxford,"Hoff, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,120,7,9,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Variable markups arise from oligopolistic competition, and cost-reducing innovation is the engine of long-run growth. Trade liberalisation stiffens competition by reducing markups, generating tougher firm selection and increasing the aggregate productivity level. Selection increases firms' incentives to innovate, thereby leading to a higher aggregate productivity growth rate. Endogenous productivity growth boosts the selection gains from trade, leading to substantial welfare improvements. A calibrated version of the model shows that growth doubles the welfare gains obtainable in models with static firm-level productivity.","Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; CES Ifo Munich, Munich, Germany; IAE Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",University of Nottingham; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Impullitti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk,Granger Bldg Room 33, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",giammario.impullitti@nottingham.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,59,34,41,5,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The framework characterises the appraisal processes as a diagnostic test aimed at identifying cost-effective (true positive) and non-cost-effective (true negative) technologies. Using the framework, factors that influence the value of operating an appraisal process, in terms of net gain to population health, are identified. The framework is used to gain insight into current policy questions including (a) how rigorous the process should be, (b) who should have the burden of proof, and (c) how optimal design changes when allowing for appeals, price reductions, resubmissions, and re-evaluations. The paper demonstrates that there is no one optimal appraisal process and the process should be adapted over time and to the specific technology under assessment. Optimal design depends on country-specific features of (future) technologies, for example, effect, price, and size of the patient population, which might explain the difference in appraisal processes across countries. It is shown that burden of proof should be placed on the producers and that the impact of price reductions and patient access schemes on the producer's price setting should be considered when designing the appraisal process.","[Johannesen, Kasper M.] Linkoping Univ, Div Hlth Care Anal, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Claxton, Karl; Sculpher, Mark J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Wailoo, Allan J.] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Linkoping University; University of York - UK; University of Sheffield,"Johannesen, KM (通讯作者)，Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Div Hlth Care Anal, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",kasper.munk.johannesen@liu.se,,"Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",,,,,46,5,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,E41,E54,,10.1002/hec.3561,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3561,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28833844,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article examines cross-national differences in well-being and mental health between unemployed people who engage in voluntary work and those who do not, using multilevel data from the European Quality of Life Survey on unemployed individuals in 29 European countries and other external sources. This article finds that, regardless of their voluntary activity, unemployed people have higher levels of well-being and mental health in countries with more generous unemployment benefits. Unexpectedly, the results also suggest that regular volunteering can actually be detrimental for mental health in countries with less generous unemployment benefits. This article concludes that individual agency exercised through voluntary work can partially improve well-being but the generosity of unemployment benefits is vital for alleviating the negative mental health effects of unemployment.","[Kamerade, Daiga] Univ Salford, Quantitat Res Methods, Salford, Lancs, England; [Bennett, Matthew R.] Univ Birmingham, Social Policy, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Salford; University of Birmingham,"Kamerade, D (通讯作者)，Univ Salford, Sch Nursing Midwifery Social Work & Social Sci, Allerton Bldg, Salford M6 6UP, Lancs, England.",d.kamerade-hanta@salford.ac.uk,"Kamerade, Daiga/A-2068-2008","Bennett, Matthew/0000-0002-9523-6053; Kamerade, Daiga/0000-0003-2019-3391",European Union [613034]; ESRC [ES/G028877/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G028877/1] Funding Source: researchfish,European Union(European Union (EU)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article was produced as a part of the 'Third Sector Impact' research project which received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 613034.",,69,23,26,0,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by twenty to fifty cents. Adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance. These findings suggest that conditioning of grants is not required for the central government to retain a moderate degree of control over the decentralized provision of care.","[Kattenberg, Mark; Vermeulen, Wouter] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Wouter] SERC, London, England",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kattenberg, M (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",m.a.c.kattenberg@cpb.nl,,"Kattenberg, Mark/0000-0001-8387-2944",,,,,49,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The QLU-C10D contains ten dimensions (Physical, Role, Social and Emotional Functioning; Pain, Fatigue, Sleep, Appetite, Nausea, Bowel Problems), each with four levels. To be used in cost-utility analysis, country-specific valuation sets are required. Objective The aim of this study was to provide Australian utility weights for the QLU-C10D. Methods An Australian online panel was quota-sampled to ensure population representativeness by sex and age (>= 18 years). Participants completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) consisting of 16 choice-pairs. Each pair comprised two QLU-C10D health states plus life expectancy. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression, parameterised to fit the quality-adjusted life-year framework. Utility weights were calculated as the ratio of each QOL dimension-level coefficient to the coefficient on life expectancy. Results A total of 1979 panel members opted in, 1904 (96%) completed at least one choice-pair, and 1846 (93%) completed all 16 choice-pairs. Dimension weights were generally monotonic: poorer levels within each dimension were generally associated with greater utility decrements. The dimensions that impacted most on choice were, in order, Physical Functioning, Pain, Role Functioning and Emotional Functioning. Oncology-relevant dimensions with moderate impact were Nausea and Bowel Problems. Fatigue, Trouble Sleeping and Appetite had relatively small impact. The value of the worst health state was - 0.096, somewhat worse than death. Conclusions This study provides the first country-specific value set for the QLU-C10D, which can facilitate cost-utility analyses when applied to data collected with the EORTC QLQ-C30, prospectively and retrospectively.","[King, Madeleine T.; Costa, Daniel S.

Chinese dam developers allegedly dominate the global hydropower industry. Studies have been carried out on technology transfer in their undertakings in Africa and Asia. However, such work is lacking for Europe and Latin America. The aim of this paper is to identify the extent, drivers and inhibitors of technology transfer of Chinese dam developers' undertakings in Europe and Latin America. We find relatively few Chinese undertakings and thus limited evidence for technology transfer both in Europe and Latin America. Transfers identified are frequently mutual with the Chinese player transferring technology to the host country and vice versa. This transfer is driven by business considerations in Europe (costs, capacities) and Latin America (costs, lacking access to finance), but also geopolitical ones (Europe: creation of a trading area; Latin America: access to (natural) resources). It is impeded by Chinese dam developers' poor reputation regarding safeguards as well as (only in Latin America) protectionist policies and significant capacities of host country players. Our research provides transparency regarding the European and Latin American hydropower industry, while also highlighting that attempts to influence what kind of technology is transferred by Chinese dam developers may be worthwhile.","[Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Matthews, Nathanial] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England",Utrecht University; University of Oxford; University of London; King's College London,"Kirchherr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019",,"Department of Geography, King's College London","Department of Geography, King's College London","We would like to thank Mats-Philip Ahrenshop and Ralf van Santen for their contributions to this work as research assistants.

A security's expected return is decomposed into its carry, an ex-ante and model-free characteristic, and its expected price appreciation. Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of returns from these asset classes, and it captures many of these predictors, providing a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models with varying risk premia, in which carry strategies are commonly exposed to global recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explains carry's premium.

In line with the notion that signals are more valuable to receivers in environments of elevated information asymmetries and under the premise that long-distance transactions present such an environment, we empirically reveal that patent activity and founding team entrepreneurial experience are more effective in increasing venture capital investments when the distance between investors and investees is elevated. Our results, therefore, corroborate the rationale that because tacit knowledge circulates mostly within local circles, it diminishes the value of signals for local transactions, as a priori knowledge about potential target firms is more easily assessed by investors. Our study contributes to the literature on the factors that drive the value of signals, on the literature that studies the function of patents and other forms of intellectual property as a means to boost firm performance, and on the literature on the geography of venture capital investments.","[Kolympiris, Christos] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Hoenen, Sebastian] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Bath; Wageningen University & Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kolympiris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",c.kolympiris@bath.ac.uk; Sebastian.hoenen@wur.nl; kalaitzandonakesn@missouri.edu,,"Kolympiris, Christos/0000-0003-1933-6332",Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant [20050176],Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant,Research funding provided by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant #20050176 is gratefully acknowledged.

This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A local leader makes policies primarily to secure his political survival, which is contingent on the support from either his higher-level patrons or his local grassroots constituents. Using a simple model, we show that a local politician with close factional ties to high-level patrons will invest more in sending loyalty signals to the latter to receive their protections, while a poorly-connected politician will make more effort to spur a broad-based economic growth that economically benefits his local constituents. Using a unique county level data on the factional politics of Zhejiang Province, China, we find that counties with weaker (closer) factional ties have lower (higher) tax burdens per capita, while spending more (less) on local public goods provision. The results are stable after various robustness tests.","[Li, Daniel Z.] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Zhang, Qi] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Durham University; Fudan University,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",daniel.li@durham.ac.uk; zhangqifd@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Daniel Z./W-1994-2018",,Natural Science Foundation of China [71773019],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank the Editor and two anonymous reviewers for providing numerous insightful suggestions for improvements along the road to publication.

We derive time-varying national and global systematic risks for the portfolios compiled on the basis of residual state ownership and examine how these risks are priced while controlling for structural changes exogenously and endogenously. Through anchoring our analysis to the portfolios capturing this institutional factor, we observe mostly positive pricing of the systematic risks, instead of the negative pricing often found in the literature on emerging markets. Within this well-controlled framework, some interesting points emerge. While full privatisation does not eliminate exposure to the national systematic risk, more heavily privatised firms (i.e., those with the least residual state ownership) tend to price only the global risk more often than less privatised ones. Hence, among partly-privatised firms, integration with the global market strengthens as state ownership decreases. These results suggest that emerging economies pursue rigorous privatisation and yet governments keep small stakes in privatised firms in order to ensure integration with the global market.

In the application of the GAM, the link function involved is usually assumed to be a commonly used one without justification. Motivated by a real data example with binary response where the commonly used link function does not work, we propose a generalised additive models with unknown link function (GAMUL) for various types of data, including binary, continuous and ordinal. The proposed estimators are proved to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Semiparametric efficiency of the estimators is demonstrated in terms of their linear functionals. In addition, an iterative algorithm, where all estimators can be expressed explicitly as a linear function of Y, is proposed to overcome the computational hurdle for the GAM type model. Extensive simulation studies conducted in this paper show the proposed estimation procedure works very well. The proposed GAMUL are finally used to analyze a real dataset about loan repayment in China, which leads to some interesting findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A comprehensive set of discrete choice modelling approaches were used. The empirical results show that (1) sociodemographic variables have significant effects on residents' first-stage choice of a water heater (to buy or not to buy) but few effects on the second-stage decision to choose electric, LPG, or solar water heaters (which type to buy); (2) information spillover is important to facilitate the usage of water heaters, particularly of solar products; (3) the electricity price, which is regulated at a very low rate, has no apparent effect on the choice of solar water heaters; (4) government subsidy has a significant effect in the first stage but no differentiated effect on the decision choice in the second stage.

One key question facing policymakers is the role of natural gas both during the transition towards, and in the achievement of, a future low-carbon energy system. Here we assess a range of possible futures for the UK, and find that gas is unlikely to act as a cost-effective 'bridge' to a decarbonised UK energy system. There is also limited scope for gas in power generation after 2030 if the UK is to meet its emission reduction targets, in the absence of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Without CCS, a 'second dash for gas' while providing short-term gains in reducing emissions, is unlikely to be the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, and could result in stranded assets and compromise the UK's decarbonisation ambitions. In such a case, gas use in 2050 is estimated at only 10% of its 2010 level. However, with significant CCS deployment by 2050, natural gas could remain at 50-60% of the 2010 level, primarily in the industrial (including hydrogen production) and power generation sectors.","[McGlade, Christophe; Pye, Steve; Ekins, Paul] UCL, Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Bradshaw, Michael] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [McGlade, Christophe; Pye, Steve; Ekins, Paul; Bradshaw, Michael; Watson, Jim] UK Energy Res Ctr, 11 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Watson, Jim] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Pye, Steve] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland",University of London; University College London; University of Warwick; University of Sussex; University College Cork,"McGlade, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",christophe.mcglade@ucl.ac.uk,"Bradshaw, Michael/AAL-3664-2021","Watson, Jim/0000-0001-8464-1718; Bradshaw, Michael/0000-0001-8842-3953",UK Research Councils under EPSRC [EP/L024756/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research Councils under EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This paper was produced as part of the research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre, supported by the UK Research Councils under EPSRC award EP/L024756/1.",,51,52,55,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113,,,,,,454,465,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.022,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000423009500044,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examine the effects on town locations of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which temporarily ended urbanisation in Britain, but not in France. As urbanisation recovered, medieval towns were more often found in Roman-era town locations in France than in Britain. The resetting of Britain's urban network gave it better access to natural navigable waterways, which mattered for town growth from 1200 to 1800.

However, high investment costs and risk hinder the diffusion of CCS. To avoid stranded assets or high future costs for retrofitting, new plants can be made carbon capture ready (CCR) to enable them to accommodate future CCS retrofitting at low additional costs. Current CCR investment decisions are closely related to future CCS retrofitting and CCS operation decisions in subsequent stages, all of which would be affected by uncertainties. We develop a three-stage CCR investment decision model under multiple uncertainties which allows for investment and especially operating flexibilities. Applying this model to China shows that CCS operating flexibility under the carbon-pricing scheme may actually lower the probability of investing in a CCR plant, and neglecting it may overestimate the propensity for investing in CCR. Moreover, learning effects, which reduce the costs of future CCS retrofitting, may be detrimental to CCR investment, indicating that the policy support for research on, development of, and deployment of CCS to reduce CCS costs should be coordinated with CCR investments. Although higher electricity prices can increase the value of an investment opportunity, it may restrain CCR investment. Finally, CCR investment does not appear to be economically viable under current conditions in China because of low carbon prices, high carbon price risks, high CCR investment costs and the high opportunity costs of CCS operation.

Using comprehensive farm-level data from the eastern Brazilian Amazon, we found that market proximity had a significant positive correlation with fertilizer adoption, even after controlling for liquidity, land tenure, education, experience and access to rural extension services. Nevertheless, few smallholders completely replaced nutrients from vegetation with fertilizers. Instead, we found that a hybrid system that combines nutrients from vegetation and fertilizers was approximately twice as common as exclusive fertilizer use. We suggest that the option for this diversified nutrient portfolio may result not only from a lack of capital or knowledge regarding return on fertilizer use, but also from the need to adapt to the economic constraints facing smallholders and minimize risk. Results indicate that a rural extension program aimed at supporting a rapid and complete replacement of ashes from vegetation by fertilizers could prove unsuccessful for Amazonian smallholders.","[Morello, Thiago Fonseca] Alameda Univ S-N, BR-09606045 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil; [Piketty, Marie-Gabrielle] TA C-47-F,Campus Int Balllarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Gardner, Toby] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Parry, Luke; Barlow, Jos] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Ferreira, Joice] Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, BR-66017970 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Tancredi, Nicola S.] Coordenacao Reg ICMBio 4, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Tancredi, Nicola S.] Ave Julio Cesar 7060, BR-66617420 Bairro Val De Cans, Brazil; [Piketty, Marie-Gabrielle] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Tancredi, Nicola S.] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade ICMB, Itaituba, Para, Brazil",Stockholm Environment Institute; Lancaster University; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); CIRAD,"Morello, TF (通讯作者)，Fed Univ ABC, Ctr Modelling Engn & Appl Social Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",fonseca.morello@ufabc.edu.br; marie-gabrielle.piketty@cirad.fr; toby.gardner@sei-international.org,"Barlow, Jos/HGE-9486-2022; Parry, Luke/ABD-4194-2021; Silva, Thiago/GON-8711-2022","Barlow, Jos/0000-0003-4992-2594; Parry, Luke/0000-0003-0330-9516;",,,,,81,15,16,1,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.","[Moreno-Monroy, Ana I.] OECD, Reg Dev Policy Div, Paris, France; [Lovelace, Robin] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Ramos, Frederico R.] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, CEPESP, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Leeds; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Moreno-Monroy, AI (通讯作者)，OECD, Reg Dev Policy Div, Paris, France.",ana.morenomonroy@oecd.org,"Roman Ramos, Frederico/AAZ-1243-2020","Roman Ramos, Frederico/0000-0002-6314-6563; Moreno Monroy, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-8282-4067; Lovelace, Robin/0000-0001-5679-6536",ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,23,61,66,9,60,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

By exploiting a unique data set of disadvantaged Australians, we provide longitudinal evidence that a drop in life satisfaction tends to precede the use of illegal/street drugs. We also find that the abuse of alcohol, the daily use of cannabis and the weekly use of illegal/street drugs in the past 6 months relate to lower current levels of life satisfaction. This provides empirical support for the utility misprediction model. Further, we find that the decrease in life satisfaction following the consumption of illegal/street drugs persists 6 months to a year after use. In contrast, the consumption of cigarettes is unrelated to life satisfaction in the close past or the near future. Our results, though only illustrative, suggest that measures of individual's subjective wellbeing should be examined together with data on revealed preferences when testing models of rational decision-making.

Globalization has also, though not unanimously, been found to affect growth outcomes. Bridging the gap between the two strands of the literature, this paper investigates the existence and strength of the interaction between institutional quality and globalization on real economic growth using a panel dataset covering 82 countries and spanning 25 years (1986-2010). Dimensionality reduction techniques are employed to identify key components of 'institutional quality': the rule of law, civil liberties and political rights. The empirical results reveal that while 'institutional quality' robustly and positively affects growth, the direct effect of economic globalization is not significant and the interaction effects, perhaps as a consequence, are muted over the review period. Direct and interaction effects of institutional quality and economic globalization on growth are, however, observed for the sub-sample of developing countries.","[Mullings, Robert] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England",Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Mullings, R (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England.",robert.mullings@ntu.ac.uk,"Mullings, Robert/GYV-1181-2022","Mullings, Robert/0000-0002-5569-9117",,,,,45,14,15,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper presents both cross-country and panel-data evidence on the causal factors driving the recent turnaround in Africa's growth and takes the unique approach of disaggregating the separate growth impacts of Africa's bilateral trade with: China, Europe, and America. The empirical analysis presented in this paper suggests that the primary and most robust causal factors driving Africa's recent growth turnaround are private sector and foreign direct investment. Although empirical evidence of the role of bilateral trade openness in Africa's recent growth emerges within a fixed effect estimation setting, these results are not as robust when endogeneity and other issues are fully accounted for. Among the three major bilateral partners, Africa's bilateral trade with China has been a relatively important factor spurring growth on the continent and especially so in resource-rich, oil-producing, and non-landlocked countries. The econometric results are not as supportive of growth inducing effects of foreign aid. These findings emerge after applying a variety of panel data specifications to the data, including the recent fixed effects filtered (FEF) estimator introduced by Pesaran and Zhou (2014) and the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, which allows for endogeneity between trade and growth.

The by-production approach models these technologies as intersections of two independent sub-technologies reflecting (1) the relations between goods in intended-output production designed by human engineers and (2) the emission-generating mechanism of nature governed by material-balance considerations. The axiomatic approach proposes a set of axioms that a pollution-generating technology should satisfy. We show that the by-production technology satisfies these axioms and that, conversely, any technology satisfying the axioms can be decomposed into two sub-technologies satisfying the by-production properties. In either approach, the technology can be functionally represented by two radial distance functions with well-defined properties. These distance functions can also serve as measures of technological and environmental efficiency. We exploit the link between the by-production and axiomatic approaches to offer preliminary suggestions about suitable functional forms for the empirical estimation of the two distance functions.","[Murty, Sushama] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Murty, Sushama] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi, India; [Russell, R.

Trade openness induces an increase in process innovation in both industries. The increase is stronger in the comparative advantage industry. Trade openness boosts prospective entrants' profits in that industry, which leads to further increases in product innovation. Trade liberalization generates a different relative impact on innovation across industries, depending on trade costs. When they are high (low), it increases process innovation relatively more in the comparative advantage (disadvantage) industry, leading to TFP divergence (convergence) across industries.","[Navas, Antonio] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Navas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",a.navas@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Navas, Antonio/0000-0003-4164-7292",,,,,33,0,0,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Knowing about bias does not automatically result in changes in behaviour by managers and employees. Even if unconscious bias training' has the theoretical potential to change behaviour, it will depend on the type of racism: symbolic/modern/colour-blind, aversive or blatant. In addition, even if those deemed racist are motivated to change behaviour, structural constraints can militate against pro-diversity actions. Agency is overstated by psychology-inspired unconscious bias training' proponents, leading them to assume the desirability and effectiveness of this type of diversity training intervention, but from a critical diversity perspective (sociologically influenced) the training looks pointless.","[Noon, Mike] Queen Mary Univ London, Human Resource Management, Sch Business & Management, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Noon, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",m.a.noon@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,123,174,8,97,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We contribute to the early warning literature by constructing a dynamic competing risks hazard model that explores the joint determination of the probability of a distressed bank to face a licence withdrawal or to be bailed out. The underlying patterns of distress are analysed based on a broad range of bank-level and environmental factors. We find that institutions with inadequate capital, illiquid and risky assets, poor management, low levels of earnings and high sensitivity to market conditions have a higher probability to go bankrupt. Bailed out banks, on the other hand, face both capital and liquidity shortages, experience low earnings, and are highly exposed to market products; however, neither the managerial expertise, nor the quality of assets is relevant to the odds of bailout. We further document that large and complex banks are less likely to fail and more likely to be bailed out and also that authorities are more prone to provide support to a distressed bank, which is well-connected with politicians and political parties and less prone to let it go bankrupt. Importantly, our model outperforms the commonly used logit model in terms of forecasting power in all the in-and out-of-sample tests we conduct. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated. Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon. Results Radium-223 resulted in (sic)6092 and (sic)4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal (sic)80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and (sic)7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration and adverse events. Conclusion Radium-223 may be a less costly treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective.","[Peters, Michel L.; Baka, Agni] Mapi Grp, Real World Strategy & Analyt, Houten, Netherlands; [de Meijer, Claudine] Bayer BV, Mijdrecht, Netherlands; [Wyndaele, Dirk] Catharina Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Noordzij, Walter] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Nucl Med & Mol Imaging, Groningen, Netherlands; [Leliveld-Kors, Annemarie M.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Urol, Groningen, Netherlands; [van den Bosch, Joan] Albert Schweitzer Ziekenhuis, Dept Internal Med, Dordrecht, Netherlands; [van den Berg, Pieter H.] Tergooi Ziekenhuizen, Dept Internal Med, Hilversum, Netherlands; [Gaultney, Jennifer G.] Mapi Grp, Real World Strategy & Analyt, Translat & Innovat Hub Bldg,5th Floor, London W12 OBZ, England",Bayer AG; Catharina Hospital; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Gaultney, JG (通讯作者)，Mapi Grp, Real World Strategy & Analyt, Translat & Innovat Hub Bldg,5th Floor, London W12 OBZ, England.",jgaultney@mapigroup.com,,"Baka, A./0000-0001-6863-5561; Leliveld, Annemarie/0000-0002-7028-0824",Bayer B.

First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted life years. For example, we describe a recently developed extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing hedonic value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.","[Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Polit Sci, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, 30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA; [Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Danzon, Patricia M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Rochester; University of Southern California; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of York - UK; University of Pennsylvania,"Phelps, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Polit Sci, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, 30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA.",charles.phelps@rochester.edu,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,40,53,56,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21,2,,,,,146,154,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477392,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000425894000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A recent Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that intramuscular interferon beta 1a (IFN-beta-1a-IM) was inferior to the other beta interferons (IFN-beta s) for multiple sclerosis (MS). As a result, CONITEC commissioned an analysis to review possible disinvestment within SUS. The objective of this paper is to describe the disinvestment process for IFN-beta-1a-IM in Brazil. The first assessment comprised a literature review and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. The outcome of interest was the proportion of relapse-free patients in 2 years. This analysis confirmed the inferiority of IFN-beta-1a-IM. Following this, CONITEC recommended disinvestment, with the decision sent for public consultation. More than 3000 contributions were made on CONITEC's webpage, most of them against the preliminary decision. As a result, CONITEC commissioned a study to assess the effectiveness of IFN-beta-1a-IM among Brazilian patients in routine clinical care. The second assessment involved an 11-year follow-up of a non-concurrent cohort of 12,154 MS patients developed by deterministic-probabilistic linkage of SUS administrative databases. The real-world assessment further demonstrated that IFN-beta-1a-IM users had a statistically higher risk of treatment failure, defined as treatment switching or relapse treatment or death, with the assessment showing that IFN-beta-1a-IM was inferior to the other IFN-beta s and to glatiramer acetate in both direct and indirect analysis. In the drug ranking with 40,000 simulations, IFN-beta-1a-IM was the worst option, with a success rate of only 152/40,000. Following this, CONITEC decided to exclude the intramuscular presentation of IFN-beta from the current MS treatment guidelines, giving patients who are currently on this treatment the option of continuing until treatment failure. In conclusion, we believe this is the first example of this new disinvestment process in action, providing an exemplar for other treatments in Brazil as well as other countries.","[Pires de Lemos, Livia Lovato; Guerra Junior, Augusto Afonso; Diniz, Isabela; Pereira, Ramon Goncalves; Alvares, Juliana; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Farm, SUS Collaborating Ctr Technol Assessment & Excell, Sala 1042,Ave Presidente Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Pires de Lemos, Livia Lovato; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Programa Posgrad Saude Publ, Sala 533,Ave Porf Alfredo Balena 190,Campus Saude, BR-30130100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Guerra Junior, Augusto Afonso; Diniz, Isabela; Alvares, Juliana; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Farm, Programa Posgrad Medicamentos & Assistencia Farma, Sala 1023,Ave Presidente Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Santos, Marisa; Magliano, Carlos] Inst Nacl Cardiol, Nucleo Avaliacao Tecnol Saude, R Laranjeiras 374, BR-22240006 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Souza, Kathiaja; Zimmermann, Ivan Ricardo; Canuto dos Santos, Vania Crisitna; Pretramale, Clarice Alegre] Minist Saude, Dept Gestao & Inc Tecnol Saude, Secretaria Ciencia Tecnol & Insumos Estrateg, Esplanada Minist Bloco G, BR-70058900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Souza, Kathiaja] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Programa Posgrad Saude Baseada Evidencias, Rua Botucatu 740,3 Andar, BR-04023900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Inst, Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Div Clin Pharmacol, S-14186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian; Bennie, Marion] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland; [Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Ctr Hlth Econ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; University of Strathclyde; University of Liverpool,"Godman, B (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Div Clin Pharmacol, S-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.;Godman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland.;Godman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Ctr Hlth Econ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",lilolemos@gmail.com; augustoguerramg@gmail.com; marisaccih@gmail.com; carlosincnats@gmail.com; beladiz@gmail.com; kathiajamsouza@gmail.com; ramonbhb@gmail.com; jualvares@gmail.com; Brian.Godman@ki.se; marion.bennie@strath.ac.uk; ivanzricardo@gmail.com; vania.canuto@saude.gov.br; clarice.petramale@saude.gov.br; fracurcio@gmail.com,"da Silva Santos, Marisa/ABA-3418-2020; Pereira, Ramon/ISS-5980-2023; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana/AAY-8801-2020; Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019; Guerra, Augusto Afonso/AAS-6584-2020; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis/G-2583-2012","da Silva Santos, Marisa/0000-0002-2174-6800; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana/0000-0002-0210-0721; Guerra, Augusto Afonso/0000-0001-5256-0577; magliano, carlos/0000-0003-0210-4877; Souza, Kathiaja/0000-0002-9054-4794; Bennie, Marion/0000-0002-4046-629X; Pereira, Ramon/0000-0001-7874-3398; Lemos, Livia/0000-0002-8921-515X; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis/0000-0002-5880-5261","Ministry of Health of Brazil [TED 78/2015, BR/LOA 1500033.001]; MRC [MR/K007017/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) [AMS-NAF1-GuerraJunior] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [HDR-5001, MR/K007017/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Ministry of Health of Brazil; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)(Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),CCATES-UFMG received support from the Ministry of Health of Brazil through resource transfer from the National Health Fund (TED 78/2015).

Methods: An observational prospective cohort study of adults (>= 18 years) with influenza-like illness in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and South America was conducted. Participants completed the 37-item draft FLU-PRO (c) daily for up to 14 days. Item-level and factor analyses were used to remove items and determine factor structure. Reliability of the final tool was estimated using Cronbach alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients (2-day reliability). Convergent and known groups validity and responsiveness were assessed using global assessments of influenza severity and return to usual health. Results: Of the 536 patients enrolled, 221 influenza-positive subjects comprised the analytical sample. The mean age of the patients was 40.7 years, 60.2% were women, and 59.7% were white. The final 32-item measure has six factors/domains (nose, throat, eyes, chest/respiratory, gastrointestinal, and body/systemic), with a higher order factor representing symptom severity overall (comparative fit index = 0.92; root mean square error of approximation = 0.06). Cronbach alpha was high (total = 0.92; domain range = 0.71-0.87); test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, day 1 day 2) was 0.83 for total scores and 0.57 to 0.79 for domains. Day 1 FLU-PRO (c) domain and total scores were moderately to highly correlated (>= 0.30) with Patient Global Rating of Flu Severity (except nose and throat). Consistent with known-groups validity, scores differentiated severity groups on the basis of global rating (total: F = 57.2, P < 0.001; domains: F = 8.9-67.5, P < 0.001). Subjects reporting return to usual health showed significantly greater (P < 0.05) FLU-PRO score improvement by day 7 than did those who did not, suggesting score responsiveness. Conclusions: Results suggest that FLU-PRO scores are reliable, valid, and responsive to change in influenza-positive adults.","[Powers, John H., III] Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Clin Res Directorate, Clin Monitoring Res Program, NCI Campus Frederick, Frederick, MD USA; [Bacci, Elizabeth D.] Evidera, Seattle, WA USA; [Lourdes Guerrero, M.; Ortega-Gallegos, Hilda; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo M.] Inst Nacl Ciencias Med & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Memoli, Matthew J.; Han, Alison] NIAID, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Fairchok, Mary P.] Madigan Army Med Ctr, Ft Lewis, WA USA; [Fairchok, Mary P.; Chen, Wei-Ju; Burgess, Timothy H.; Millar, Eugene V.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, F Edward Hebert Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, Infect Dis Clin Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Fairchok, Mary P.; Chen, Wei-Ju; Lalani, Tahaniyat; Millar, Eugene V.] Henry M Jackson Fdn Adv Mil Med, Bethesda, MD USA; [Arnold, John C.] Naval Med Ctr, San Diego, CA USA; [Danaher, Patrick J.] Def Inst Med Operat, San Antonio, TX USA; [Lalani, Tahaniyat] Naval Med Ctr, Portsmouth, VA USA; [Ridore, Michelande] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA; [Burgess, Timothy H.] Walter Reed Natl Mil Med Ctr, Bethesda, MD USA; [Hernandez, Andres] Inst Nacl Enfermedades Resp Ismael Cosio Villegas, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Zulueta, Patricia] Hosp Gen Dr Manuel Gea Gonzalez, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Pett, Sarah] UCL, London, England; [Pett, Sarah] Univ New South Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fischer, William] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Moreno Macias, Laura] Hosp Gen Agudos JM Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [DuVal, Anna; Rothman, Richard; Dugas, Andrea] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research; Evidera; Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran - Mexico; Evidera; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); Madigan Army Medical Center; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA; Henry M.

First, we argued for the increase in government expenditure on education and health to examine the possibility of achieving inclusive growth. Second, financing gap model was employed to estimate the potential growth in GDP per capita that is accruable to the economy if government use natural resource rent to finance increase in expenditure of education and health. Relying on dataset for 18 SSA countries, among the results obtained showed that both government expenditures are found to be significant for explaining growth in SSA. However, augmenting health expenditure with natural resource appears to be more significant for making growth process inclusive. Also, the results of the simulation exercise indicate that increasing government expenditure on health would increase GDP per capita growth by over 3.1 %. The policy implication of this is drawn based upon the results obtained.","[Raheem, Ibrahim D.] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Isah, Kazeem O.] Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Adedeji, Abdulfatai A.] Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Kent; University of Ibadan; University of Ibadan,"Raheem, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",idr5@kent.ac.uk,"Adedeji, Abdulfatai A/ABK-6391-2022","Adedeji, Abdulfatai A/0000-0001-9061-9197; Isah, Kazeem/0000-0003-1652-8582",,,,,38,52,53,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

The business model of low-cost carriers is now evolving to capture the long-haul travel segment and consequentially could replace the all-inclusive package holidays provided by the Charter airlines in this market. The research deduces that this will not transpire. The study extrapolates the opinions from experts who resonate that three pivotal cornerstones the differentiate Charter airlines from low-cost long-haul carriers which comprise of its destination expertise, Air Travel Organiser Licence affiliation and its horizontally integrated multifaceted enterprise. A passenger survey directed exclusively at passengers travelling on Charter airlines to long-haul destinations in Latin America found that vacationers aged 56 years and older together with families would not opt to vacation on low-cost long-haul airlines.","[Rodriguez, Andrea Martin; O'Connell, John F.] Cranfield Univ, Bedford, England",Cranfield University,"O'Connell, JF (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport, Bedford MK43 0AL, England.",frankie.oconnell@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,17,18,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

That few such schemes exist is evidence of a classic market failure resulting from incentives to free-ride on the payments of other purchasers. In the context of an experimental investigation, this paper explores the role of negotiation and binding pre-commitments to payments in solving that collective action problem. Our novel experimental setup involves two purchasers seeking a level of payment acceptable to a single provider while also agreeing their own individual contributions to that payment. Contrasting treatments are used to explore complexities of the conditions under which negotiations might take place including asymmetries between the purchasers, treatments with incomplete information and treatments with uncertainty over the levels of benefit. We find that those complexities change the ease with which a negotiated agreement is achieved as well as the relative size of the payoffs enjoyed by the different parties to the negotiations Our findings are generally positive, showing that under many circumstances parties to a multiple-purchaser PES can successfully negotiate a mutually agreeable schedule of payments and contributions.

A model is developed, based on the division of labour and comparative advantage, to explain this relationship. Labour is used to produce traded intermediate inputs which are used in the production of traded final goods. Large countries gain relatively more from comparative advantage than from the division of labour, while the opposite is true for small countries. As in the data, large countries export a smaller share of final goods and a larger share of intermediate goods than small countries.

J,"Sovacool, BK",,,,"Sovacool, Benjamin K.",,,"Bamboo Beating Bandits: Conflict, Inequality, and Vulnerability in the Political Ecology of Climate Change Adaptation in Bangladesh",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,political economy; disempowerment; dispossession; displacement; resilience; elite capture,INTEGRATING MITIGATION; CHAR; LIVELIHOODS; POLICY; PERSPECTIVES; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; DRIVERS; DROUGHT; HAZARDS,"Bangladesh contributes little to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on bio-diversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country's National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated.

We build a theoretical framework that decomposes domestic and international financing for HIV into nonlinear functions of national income, HIV prevalence, and government effectiveness. We test this model, paying particular attention to nonlinearities and to problems of bad controls, multicollinearity, and reverse causality. Finally, we use the fitted values of quartile regressions to study how much countries could reasonably pay domestically and how much they should receive from donors. Worryingly, countries with higher financial means receive on average more aid per PLHIV than very poor ones, and countries with higher HIV prevalence receive on average less aid per people living with HIV. The normative analysis concludes that US$3.08billion of fiscal space could be created in LIC and MIC. We identify the countries that could be allocated more aid.","[Sterck, Olivier C.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Sterck, OC (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",olivier.sterck@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Sterck, Olivier/0000-0003-3835-9388",Rush Foundation,Rush Foundation,"Rush Foundation, Grant/Award Number: RethinkHIV",,37,6,6,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,320,332,,10.1002/hec.3550,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3550,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28685925,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, contemporary economic valuation is constrained to the appraisal of simple goods that generate benefits that accrue to individuals, neglecting complex goods that generate benefits that accrue to society more broadly. Methodological barriers to the valuation of complex social goods have led to their frequent omission from natural resource management deliberations. The prevailing valuation paradigm that focuses on simple individual goods may erode conservation efforts by crowding out the institutions and behaviours that support socially constructed ecosystem service values. Erosion of these values ultimately harms the environment and society as a whole. The institutionalisation of appropriate methods for estimating the value of complex social goods alongside existing methods for valuing simple individual goods within international conservation, development and policy making discourses, is therefore an important evolution for sustainable natural resource management (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For girls, particularly older ones, maximin-preferences are the most frequent primary motivation, while for boys efficiency concerns are most relevant.

We also consider the sample selection issues related to differences in survival between the bereaved and non-bereaved using a simple Cox Proportional-Hazard model. Before conducting these estimations, propensity score approaches are used to re-weight the non-bereaved to generate a more random-like comparison sample for the bereaved. We find that those bereaved who survive are both more likely to be admitted and to stay longer in hospital than a comparable non-bereaved cohort. Bereavement is estimated to induce on average an extra 0.24 (95% CI [0.15, 0.33]) hospital inpatient days per year. Similar to previous studies, we estimate the bereaved have a 19.2% (95% CI [12.5%, 26.3%]) higher mortality rate than the comparable non-bereaved cohort.","[Tseng, Fu-Min] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Petrie, Dennis] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Shaolin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, Ctr Hlth Policy, London, England; [Macduff, Colin; Stephen, Audrey I.] Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Aberdeen, Scotland",National Chung Cheng University; Monash University; Imperial College London; Robert Gordon University,"Tseng, FM (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",ftseng@ccu.edu.tw,"Petrie, Dennis/AAK-5153-2020; Petrie, Dennis/L-7689-2018","Petrie, Dennis/0000-0002-3882-2531; Petrie, Dennis/0000-0002-3882-2531; Tseng, Fu-Min/0000-0002-7015-924X; Stephen, Audrey/0000-0003-3665-528X; Wang, Shaolin/0000-0002-4220-5640",ESRC/JISC; Scottish Funding Council; Chief Scientist's Office; Scottish Government; Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Awards [DE150100309],ESRC/JISC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Scottish Funding Council; Chief Scientist's Office; Scottish Government; Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Awards(Australian Research Council),"ESRC/JISC; Scottish Funding Council; Chief Scientist's Office; Scottish Government; Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Awards, Grant/Award Number: DE150100309",,47,18,18,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27,2,,,,,E120,E138,,10.1002/hec.3573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3573,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28833799,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000428523400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

A common shortcoming of most of the previous studies has been a proper accounting of Lithium-ion battery degradation in the development of business models. Very recently, papers on the viability of V2G were published for which the detailed account of battery degradation resulted in what appeared to be two ostensibly contradictory conclusions. In this paper, the authors of these two major studies jointly reconcile their previous conclusions by providing clarity on how methodologies to manage battery degradation can reliably extend battery life.

Our findings indicate that: (i) hierarchical meta-regression models are sufficiently versatile for addressing both selection bias and data dependence in observational data; (ii) innovation's effect on employment is positive but small and highly heterogeneous; (iii) only a small part of residual heterogeneity is explained by moderating factors; (iv) selection bias tends to reflect preference for upholding prevalent hypotheses on the employment effects of process and product innovations; (v) country-specific effect-size estimates are related to labour market and product market regulation in six OECD countries in a U-shaped fashion; and (vi) OLS estimates reflect upward bias whereas those based on time-differenced or within estimators reflect a downward bias.

Yet, the rise of China and other emerging economies means a shift away from a reliance on technology transfer and production capabilities to strengthening indigenous innovation capabilities. Drawing on evidence from the hydropower, solar and wind energy industry in China, the paper introduces the concept of 'geographies of technology transfer and cooperation' and challenges the North-South technology transfer and cooperation paradigm for low carbon innovation and climate change mitigation. The empirical evidence shows that for low carbon innovation, the conception that China is lacking behind in innovation capabilities is partly outdated. Instead, there is an increase in indigenous innovation capabilities, resulting in South-South technology transfer and cooperation as well as elements of 'reverse' South-North technology cooperation.","[Urban, Frauke] Univ London, Ctr Dev Environm & Policy CeDEP, SOAS, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Urban, F (通讯作者)，Univ London, Ctr Dev Environm & Policy CeDEP, SOAS, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England.",f.urban@soas.ac.uk,,"Urban, Frauke/0000-0003-3021-0220",Economics and Social Research Council ESRC [ES/J01320X/1]; ESRC; Volkswagen Foundation; Svenska Riksbanken Jubileumsfond; Compania di Sao Paolo; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J01320X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J01320X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economics and Social Research Council ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); Svenska Riksbanken Jubileumsfond; Compania di Sao Paolo; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research has been funded by the Economics and Social Research Council ESRC as part of the research project China goes global: a comparative study of Chinese hydropower dams in low and middle income countries (ES/J01320X/1), the ESRC as part of the project Low Carbon Innovation in China: Prospects, Politics and Practice as well as the Volkswagen Foundation, the Svenska Riksbanken Jubileumsfond and the Compania di Sao Paolo as part of the project Technological trajectories for climate change mitigation in China, India and the EU.

In this paper, we analyze if there is evidence of this type of upgrading in China's export processing regime by investigating dynamics in the relative prevalence of Import & Assembly (IA) versus Pure Assembly (PA) processing trade over the period 2000-2013. Firms in both regimes provide similar manufacturing services to foreign companies, but IA firms also conduct the sophisticated tasks of quality control, searching, financing and storing imported materials. Consistent with a trend of functional upgrading, we show that the share of IA trade in total processing trade has increased rapidly during the period 2000-2006, both overall and within product categories. Furthermore, we find that this trend has gone hand in hand with improvements in a sector's labor productivity and unit values. Against expectations, we find that this process has slowed down notably during the period 2006-2013.","[Van Assche, An] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Van Assche, An] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] CEPR, London, England",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; KU Leuven; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Van Assche, A (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ari.van-assche@hec.ca,"Van Assche, Ari/Z-1988-2019; Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/GLV-0353-2022","Van Assche, Ari/0000-0003-2895-6736; Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/0000-0003-4144-5578",World Bank project China's industrial upgrading in the context of global value chains,World Bank project China's industrial upgrading in the context of global value chains,"This research was supported by the World Bank project China's industrial upgrading in the context of global value chains.

This article focuses specifically on Anglo-American trade, which was the largest bilateral flow of trade during the first era of globalization, and finds that tariffs were the sole intertemporal determinant of Anglo-American trade costs. However, the determinacy of tariffs for Anglo-American trade costs only becomes apparent when the tariff variable incorporates a measure of the bilateral American tariff toward Britain, which this article reconstructs. The article concludes by claiming that Anglo-American trade represents a major qualification to any emerging consensus that foreign tariffs were of minor significance to the trade of late nineteenth-century Britain.","[Varian, Brian D.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Varian, BD (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",b.varian@lse.ac.uk,,"Varian, Brian/0000-0001-6369-591X",,,,,33,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Objectives: To quantify and investigate heterogeneity in women's preferences for the benefits and risks of a national breast screening program (NBSP) and to understand the effect of risk communication format on these preferences. Methods: An online discrete choice experiment survey was designed to elicit preferences from female members of the public for an NBSP described by three attributes (probability of detecting a cancer, risk of unnecessary follow-up, and out-of-pocket screening costs). Survey respondents were randomized to one of two surveys, presenting risk either as percentages only or as icon arrays and percentages. Respondents were required to choose between two hypothetical NBSPs or no screening in 11 choice sets generated using a Bayesian D-efficient design. The trade-offs women made were analyzed using heteroskedastic conditional logit and scale-adjusted latent class models. Results: A total of 1018 women completed the discrete choice experiment (percentages-only version = 507; icon arrays and percentages version = 511). The results of the heteroskedastic conditional logit model suggested that, on average, women were willing-to-accept 1.72 (confidence interval 1.47-1.97) pound additional unnecessary follow-ups and willing to-pay 79.17 pound (confidence interval 66.98- 91.35) for an additional cancer detected per 100 women screened. Latent class analysis indicated substantial heterogeneity in preferences with six latent classes and three scale classes providing the best fit. The risk communication format received was not a predictor of scale class or preference class membership. Conclusions: Most women were willing to trade-off the benefits and risks of screening, but decision makers seeking to improve uptake should consider the disparate needs of women when configuring services.","[Vass, Caroline M.; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Payne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009; Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740; Vass, Caroline/0000-0002-6385-2812",National Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care; Mind the Risk - Riksbanken Jubileumsfond,National Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care; Mind the Risk - Riksbanken Jubileumsfond,"C.M.

We analyse the way urban social movements (USMs), which play a crucial role in shaping the right to the city, frame their struggles in relation to mobility. We argue that their use of the concept of the 'right to mobility' has two meanings. First, the concept gives USMs a framing discourse to advocate and shape transport policy changes. Second, it enables USMs to bring together different actors with different urban agendas. We base this argument on a study of Rio de Janeiro, a paradigmatic case of mobility-based claims of the right to the city. Looking at the practice of a protest-oriented and a knowledge-oriented USMs that contest the Rio de Janeiro's mobility crisis, we outline an agenda for academics and practitioners willing to work towards the construction of sustainable and just mobilities.","[Verlinghieri, Ersilia] Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England; [Venturini, Federico] Via Viotta 17, I-33100 Udine, Italy",University of Oxford,"Verlinghieri, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England.",ersilia.verlinghieri@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Venturini, Federico/ABG-6708-2021","Venturini, Federico/0000-0002-7625-2218; Verlinghieri, Ersilia/0000-0003-1388-2623",Contested Cities network,Contested Cities network,"We would like to thank the Contested Cities network for financial support during this study.

By bringing cities and regions closer together it is argued that economies can benefit from lower generalised costs of transport leading to enhanced growth and productivity. A counter argument is that such effects are largely redistributive with some regions benefiting and others suffering depending on their ability to take advantage of new opportunities. However, some argue further than this and claim that such step changes in transport provision can lead to major changes in economic structure that can transform regions' absolute as well as relative position and thus redress the existence of regional disparities. In this paper, we address the question as to whether there is a clear and robust economic theory of the transformational impact of high-speed rail and if there is any consistent evidence to support it? The paper uses evidence from the North-west European High-Speed Rail network and a more detailed study of the UK's first highspeed line, HS1. This is followed by a discussion of the various claims and counter-claims for the impact of the proposed HS2 that will link London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. On the basis of this some of the implications for the appraisal of such projects are considered. The main conclusion from the paper is that transport infrastructure by itself is not likely to be transformative, but coupled with other policy interventions it can contribute to such an effect.","[Vickerman, Roger] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Vickerman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",r.w.vickerman@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,119,126,21,219,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Based on a survey for statistical offices, ministries and independent experts worldwide, we provide some preliminary evidence that there is very little use of natural capital accounts for public policy decisions and, more so, in developing countries. The most relevant obstacles are the lack of political support by key people and institutional leadership unable to promote policy use by other ministries. Concerning developing countries, the factor which is considered as the most relevant in preventing the use of natural capital accounts for policy making is the stage of development of the country. In addition, respondents from statistical institutes and developing countries are firstly, concerned about institutional obstacles and secondly, about data availability and cooperation. Respondents from ministries and independent experts are particularly concerned about design obstacles. Not many accounts may be available to be used in the policy-making process due to data gaps, design challenges and the required investment, the problem being more acute in developing countries. A key result of the survey is the need to evaluate the added value of natural capital accounts with respect to statistics.","[Virto, Laura Recuero] Sci Po Paris, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France; [Virto, Laura Recuero] French Minist Foreign Affairs & Int Dev, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France; [Weber, Jean-Louis] Univ Nottingham, European Environm Agcy Sci Comm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jeantil, Mathilde] Ecole Normale Super, 61 Ave President Wilson, F-94230 Cachan, France",University of Nottingham; Universite Paris Saclay,"Virto, LR (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France.;Virto, LR (通讯作者)，French Minist Foreign Affairs & Int Dev, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France.",laura.recuero-virto@diplomatie.gouv.fr; mathilde.jeantil@ens-cachan.fr,,"Recuero Virto, Laura/0000-0002-6428-0916",,,,,54,26,27,1,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Following the decomposition-reconstruction-prediction concept, a combined Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-Least Square Support Vector Machine-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA) model is proposed for quantitatively analyzing and forecasting coal overcapacity in China. The results show that the main causes of coal overcapacity in China include insufficient demand, market failure, and institutional distortion. Institutional distortion, with an influence degree of 73.75%, is the most fundamental and influential factor. From 2017 to 2019, the scale of coal overcapacity in China will reach between 1.721 and 1.819 billion tons, suggesting that coal overcapacity will remain a serious problem. The rate of coal overcapacity caused by insufficient demand will fluctuate slightly, while coal overcapacity caused by market failure will trend downward, but the impact of institutional distortion on coal overcapacity will be exacerbated. A statistical analysis demonstrates that the EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA model significantly outperformed other widely developed baselines (e.g. ARIMA, LSSVM, EEMD-ARIMA, and EEMD-LSSVM). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This review analyzed the methods of cost-of-illness (COI) studies and summarized the economic outcomes of multimorbidity. Methods A systematic review (2000-2016) was performed, which was registered with Prospero, reported according to PRISMA, and used a quality checklist adapted for COI studies. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed COI studies on multimorbidity, whereas the exclusion criterion was studies focusing on an index disease. Extracted data included the definition, measure, and prevalence of multimorbidity; the number of included health conditions; the age of study population; the variables used in the COI methodology; the percentage of multimorbidity vs. total costs; and the average costs per capita. Results Among the 26 included articles, 14 defined multimorbidity as a simple count of 2 or more conditions. Methodologies used to derive the costs were markedly different. Given different healthcare systems, OOP payments of multimorbidity varied across countries. In the 17 and 12 studies with cut-offs of >= 2 and >= 3 conditions, respectively, the ratios of multimorbidity to non-multi-morbidity costs ranged from 2-16 to 2-10. Among the ten studies that provided cost breakdowns, studies with and without a societal perspective attributed the largest percentage of multimorbidity costs to social care and inpatient care/medicine, respectively. Conclusion Multimorbidity was associated with considerable economic burden. Synthesising the cost of multimorbidity was challenging due to multiple definitions of multimorbidity and heterogeneity in COI methods. Count method was most popular to define multimorbidity. There is consistent evidence that multimorbidity was associated with higher costs.","[Sanderson, Kristy] Univ East Anglia, Sch Hlth Sci, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Wang, Lili; Si, Lei; Cocker, Fiona; Palmer, Andrew J.; Sanderson, Kristy] Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wang, Lili; Si, Lei; Cocker, Fiona; Palmer, Andrew J.; Sanderson, Kristy] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Cocker, Fiona] Sch Med, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of East Anglia; University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Tasmania,"Sanderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Hlth Sci, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England.;Sanderson, K (通讯作者)，Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Sanderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Kristy.Sanderson@uea.ac.uk,"Si, Lei/AAM-3218-2020; Sanderson, Kristy/KBD-4634-2024; Wang, Lily/HJY-9269-2023; Sanderson, Kristy/J-2796-2013; Palmer, Andrew/J-7289-2014","Si, Lei/0000-0002-3044-170X; Sanderson, Kristy/0000-0002-3132-2745; Palmer, Andrew/0000-0002-9703-7891",University of Tasmania/Anhui Medical University Ph.D. Scholarship,University of Tasmania/Anhui Medical University Ph.D. Scholarship,Lili Wang was funded by a University of Tasmania/Anhui Medical University Ph.D. Scholarship.

Current displays of death where the past is exhibited and consumed as fun, scary and as entertainment productions are widespread. The movie industry provides horror to all ages, children can be exposed to the goulash past in various forms, such as the popular book series 'Horrible Histories'. Theme parks, rides and roller-coaster often take a dark and scary approach to enticing consumers. Another popular and well established product (especially in western societies) are fun factories' (Stone, 2009), such as the dungeon attractions owned by the Merlin Entertainment Group. The market for death and horror based attractions and entertainment is growing. Since the dawn of time death has been a guarantee that awaits us all. Society is well connected to death, however and significantly, the consumption of death and its social transformation historically to present, both in practice and meaning have changed, evolved and continue to do so. The meaning, practice and consumption of death and its evolution into the future will be a significant representation of future societies. This paper, considers how society is moving into a new period, the 'spectacle of death'. By researching and understanding past and present social realities, it is possible to generate knowledge, ideas and predictions of the future, in this study, the future role of death as tourism entertainment. This paper presents original and challenging potential future scenarios in which tourists engage with death as a form of entertainment, around the year 2100. Uniquely, the paper considers the use of horrific and tragic events that have overwhelmed the world in the early 21 Century (including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York).

J,"Zhang, AH",,,,"Zhang, Aihua",,,New Findings on Key Factors Influencing the UK's Referendum on Leaving the EU,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,EU referendum; turnout; higher education; multivariate regression; Logit Model; odds ratio,,"The UK's EU in/out referendum raised significant debate and speculation of the intention of the electorate and its motivations in voting; much of this debate was informed by simple data analysis examining individual factors, in isolation, and using opinion polling data. This, in the case of the EU referendum where multiple factors influence the decision simultaneously, failed to predict the eventual outcome. On June 23, 2016, Britain's vote to leave the EU came as a surprise to most observers, with a bigger voter turnout than that of any UK general election in the past decade. In this research, we apply multivariate regression analysis and a Logit Model to real voting data to identify statistically significant factors influencing the EU referendum voting preference simultaneously as well as the odd ratio in favor of Leave. Visualizations of the key findings are also provided with heat maps and graphs. We find that higher education is the predominant factor dividing the nation, with a marginal effect on the referendum decision being stronger than any other factors particularly in England and Wales, where most Leave voters reside. An increase of about 3% in the proportion of British adults accessing to higher education in England and Wales could have reversed the referendum result in the UK. We also find that areas in England and Wales with a lower unemployment rate tend to have a higher turnout to support Leave while areas in Scotland and Northern Ireland with a higher proportion of university-educated British adults have a higher turnout to support Remain. Further we find that areas with high proportions of British male adults show a higher percentage of Leave votes. A higher proportion of elderly British contributes to a higher percentage of Leave votes, but does not lead to Leave outcomes on their own. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The EMD algorithm is used to decompose the carbon price into simple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue, which are identified as the components of high frequency, low frequency and trend by using the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is used to forecast the high frequency IMFs with ARCH effects. The LSSVM model with kernel function prototype is employed to forecast the high frequency IMFs without ARCH effects, the low frequency and trend components. The forecasting values of all the components are aggregated into the ones of original carbon price by the LSSVM with kernel function prototype-based nonlinear ensemble approach. Furthermore, particle swarm optimization is used for model selections of the LSSVM with kernel function prototype. Taking the popular prediction methods as benchmarks, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can achieve higher level and directional predictions and higher robustness. The findings show that the proposed model seems an advanced approach for predicting the high nonstationary, nonlinear and irregular carbon price. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Its production often drives forest degradation and deforestation which have impacts on the local people that remain poorly understood. We present a novel methodology for analysing the contribution of woodland ecosystem services (ES) to rural wellbeing and poverty alleviation, which takes into account access mechanisms to ES, trade-offs between ES, and human response options. Using a participatory approach, a set of land use change scenarios were translated into a probabilistic model that integrates biophysical and social data. Our findings suggest that in highly forested areas woodland degradation does not have a critical impact on the local use of the three ES studied: charcoal, firewood and grass. Social factors show the largest impact on the quantity of charcoal produced, e.g. female headed households experience the greatest barriers to access charcoal production. Participating in forest associations and diversifying income activities lead to greater charcoal production. Results show that charcoal production increases some aspects of well-being (e.g. household assets), but does not decrease acute multidimensional poverty. Great efforts are required to reach a charcoal production system that alleviates poverty, improves environmental sustainability, and provides a reliable charcoal supply.","[Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro; Metzger, Marc J.; Vollmer, Frank; Woollen, Emily; Patenaude, Genevieve; Ryan, Casey M.; Paterson, James] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Drummond St,Geog Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mahamane, Mansour; Baumert, Sophia; Sitoe, Almeida A.; Ribeiro, Natasha Sofia] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Fac Agron & Forest Engn, Maputo, Mozambique; [Nhantumbo, Isilda; Matediane, Maria Julieta] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London, England; [Luz, Ana Catarina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes CE3c, Lisbon, Portugal; [Grundy, Isla M.] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Biol Sci, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Edinburgh; Eduardo Mondlane University; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Zimbabwe,"Zorrilla-Miras, P (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Drummond St,Geog Bldg, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",pedro.zorrilla-miras@ed.ac.uk,"Metzger, Marc/S-3976-2019; Ryan, Casey/B-7967-2008; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro/AAA-1477-2019; Sitoe, Almeida/AAL-8650-2020; Patenaude, Genevieve/F-3115-2010","Metzger, Marc/0000-0002-5119-5894; Ryan, Casey/0000-0002-1802-0128; Zorrilla-Miras, Pedro/0000-0002-5019-1015; Sitoe, Almeida/0000-0001-7583-2387; Paterson, James/0000-0003-3264-8242; Vollmer, Frank/0000-0002-7135-5525; Woollen, Emily/0000-0002-6504-4835; Ribeiro, Natasha/0000-0002-5369-5905; Luz, Ana Catarina/0000-0003-3466-2929; Patenaude, Genevieve/0000-0001-7552-7470","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE/K010395/1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I002952/1, NE/K010395/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/K010395/1, NE/I002952/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work (ACES project, NE/K010395/1) was funded with support from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme (funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)).",,79,34,35,1,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The authors estimate the impact of this threshold on employment by means of a regression discontinuity analysis. Because this threshold is known in advance, they investigate the presence of discontinuities in both the level and the slope of employment probabilities at different ages around the threshold. Their results indicate that turning 22 does not significantly change the employment probability. However, they find a significant change in the slope of the probability of being employed around one year before, suggesting a smooth deterioration of employment probability before turning 22 rather than a sudden change at a particular age. This finding is confirmed by a differencein-difference analysis. However, no such effect can be found during the period preceding the introduction of the NMW.","[Fidrmuc, Jan] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, IES, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fidrmuc, Jan] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Tena, J.

To address these challenges, Chhattisgarh state in India has established a MDR-TB financial protection policy by creating MDR-TB benefit packages as part of the universal health insurance scheme that the state has rolled out in their effort towards attaining Universal Health Coverage for all its residents. In these schemes the state purchases health insurance against set packages of services from third party health insurance agencies on behalf of all its residents. Provider payment reform by strategic purchasing through output based payments (lump sum fee is reimbursed as per the MDR-TB benefit package rates) to the providers - both public and private health facilities empanelled under the insurance scheme was the key intervention. Aim: To understand the implementation gap between policy and practice of the benefit packages with respect to equity in utilization of package claims by the poor patients in public and private sector. Methods: Data from primary health insurance claims from January 2013 to December 2015, were analysed using an extension of 'Kingdon's multiple streams for policy implementation framework' to explain the implementation gap between policy and practice of the MDR-TB benefit packages. Results: The total number of claims for MDR-TB benefit packages increased over the study period mainly from poor patients treated in public facilities, particularly for the pre-treatment evaluation and hospital stay packages. Variations and inequities in utilizing the packages were observed between poor and non-poor beneficiaries in public and private sector. Private providers participation in the new MDR-TB financial protection mechanism through the universal health insurance scheme was observed to be much lower than might be expected given their share of healthcare provision overall in India. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there may be an implementation gap due to weak coupling between the problem and the policy streams, reflecting weak coordination between state nodal agency and the state TB department. There is a pressing need to build strong institutional capacity of the public and private sector for improving service delivery to MDR-TB patients through this new health insurance mechanism.","[Kundu, Debashish; Chadha, Sarabjit] South East Asia Off, Qutub Inst Area, Int Union TB & Lung Dis Union, C-6, New Delhi 110016, India; [Sharma, Nandini] Maulana Azad Med Coll, Dept Community Med, New Delhi, India; [Laokri, Samia] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Awungafac, George] Minist Hlth, African Soc Lab Med, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Jiang, Lai] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Instruct Psychol & Technol, Leuven, Belgium; [Asaria, Miqdad] Imperial Coll London, Global Hlth & Dev, London, England; [Asaria, Miqdad] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",Maulana Azad Medical College; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; KU Leuven; Imperial College London; University of York - UK,"Kundu, D (通讯作者)，South East Asia Off, Qutub Inst Area, Int Union TB & Lung Dis Union, C-6, New Delhi 110016, India.",debashishkundu@yahoo.com,"Awungafac, George/AAV-8385-2020; Awungafac, George/Y-4075-2019; Asaria, Miqdad/T-9980-2019; Kundu, Debashish/J-3018-2014","Awungafac, George/0000-0002-5859-0336; Awungafac, George/0000-0002-5859-0336; Asaria, Miqdad/0000-0002-3538-4417; Kundu, Debashish/0000-0002-3756-8623; Jiang, Lai/0000-0003-3721-7249",,,,,49,10,11,1,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

A systematic review of the literature associated with the long-term consequences of four key outcomes from the Building Blocks trial, specifically, low birth weight, smoking during pregnancy, interval to subsequent pregnancy and A&E attendance or inpatient admission was conducted. These factors were guided by the funders, the Department of Health, as being of particular interest in the UK context. Relevant studies were identified from a number of sources including large databases, reference checking and citation searching. The search yielded 3665 papers, 43 of which were considered appropriate for inclusion. Of these, 29 were relating to smoking during pregnancy, 13 to low birth weight, 0 to A&E attendances during early childhood and 1 to short (< 2 years) interval to subsequent pregnancy. Consistent associations were found between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the effects this has on children's health, educational attainment and likelihood of engaging in problem behaviour and criminal activity in later life. Low birth weight was also found to impact on children's long-term health and cognitive development. Subsequent pregnancies within two years of the previous birth were linked with increased likelihood of pre-term birth and neonatal death. Only minimal evidence was identified regarding the consequences of a short interval to second pregnancy and of child A&E and outpatient attendances. Given that these outcomes have been identified by the UK Department of Health as of particular interest for UK benefit, investment of research in these areas is recommended to establish a clearer picture of both short and long-term consequences.","[Bell, Kerry; Corbacho, Belen; Ronaldson, Sarah; Torgerson, David] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York Trials Unit, ARRC Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Richardson, Gerry] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Robling, Michael] Cardiff Univ, Ctr Trials Res, Cardiff CF14 4YS, S Glam, Wales",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Cardiff University,"Bell, K (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York Trials Unit, ARRC Bldg, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Kerry.Bell@york.ac.uk; Belen.Corbacho@york.ac.uk; Sarah.Ronaldson@york.ac.uk; Gerry.Richardson@york.ac.uk; David.Torgerson@york.ac.uk; roblingmr@cardiff.ac.uk,"Torgerson, David/L-4566-2019","Torgerson, David/0000-0002-1667-4275; Bell, Kerry Jane/0000-0001-5124-138X; Ronaldson, Sarah Jane/0000-0001-8321-786X",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health [006/0060],Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health,This in an independent research commissioned and funded by the Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health (reference 006/0060).

While factor replacement therapy constitutes the majority of costs in haemophilia, the relationship between target joints and non drug-related direct costs (NDDCs) has not been studied. Methods: Data on haemophilia patients without inhibitors was drawn from the 'Cost of Haemophilia across Europe - a Socioeconomic Survey' (CHESS) study, a cost assessment in severe haemophilia A and B across five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) in which 139 haemophilia specialists provided demographic and clinical information for 1285 adult patients. NDDCs were calculated using publicly available cost data, including 12-month ambulatory and secondary care activity: haematologist and other specialist consultant consultations, medical tests and examinations, bleed-related hospital admissions, and payments to professional care providers. A generalized linear model was developed to investigate the relationship between NDDCs and target joints (areas of chronic synovitis), adjusted for patient covariates. Results: Five hundred and thirteen patients (42% of the sample) had no diagnosed target joints; a total of 1376 target joints (range 1-10) were recorded in the remaining 714 patients. Mean adjusted NDDCs for persons with no target joints were EUR 3134 (standard error (SE) EUR 158); for persons with one or more target joints, mean adjusted NDDCs were EUR 3913 (SE EUR 157; average mean effect EUR 779; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that the presence of one or more target joints has a significant impact on NDDCs for patients with severe haemophilia, ceteris paribus. Prevention and management of target joints should be an important consideration of managing haemophilia patients.","[O'Hara, Jamie] Univ Chester, Fac Hlth & Social Care, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Walsh, Shaun; Camp, Charlotte] HCD Econ, Daresbury WA4 4FS, England; [Mazza, Giuseppe] UCL, UCL Inst Liver & Digest Hlth, Royal Free Hosp, London, England; [Carroll, Liz] Haemophilia Soc, London, England; [Hoxer, Christina; Wilkinson, Lars] Novo Nordisk AS, Vandtamsvej 114, DK-2860 Soborg, Denmark",University of Chester; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School; Novo Nordisk,"Camp, C (通讯作者)，HCD Econ, Daresbury WA4 4FS, England.",j.ohara@chester.ac.uk; shaun.walsh@hcdeconomics.com; charlotte.camp@hcdeconomics.com; giuseppe.mazza.12@ucl.ac.uk; liz@haemophilia.org.uk; cish@novonordisk.com; laws@novonordisk.com,,,Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk.

The framework can be used to validate cost-effectiveness endpoints generated from routine data sources when comparable data is available directly from trial case report forms or from another source. We illustrate application of the framework using data from a recent trial-based economic evaluation of the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve strain BBG administered to babies less than 31 weeks of gestation. Cost-effectiveness endpoints are compared using two sources of information; trial case report forms and data extracted from the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD), a clinical database created through collaborative efforts of UK neonatal services. Focusing on mean incremental net benefits at A 30,000 pound per episode of sepsis averted, the study revealed no evidence of discrepancy between the data sources (two-sided p values > 0.4), low probability estimates of miscoverage (ranging from 0.039 to 0.060) and concordance correlation coefficients greater than 0.86. We conclude that the NNRD could potentially serve as a reliable source of data for future trial-based economic evaluations of neonatal interventions. We also discuss the potential implications of increasing opportunity to utilize routinely available data for the conduct of trial-based economic evaluations.","[Achana, Felix; Petrou, Stavros; Khan, Kamran] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Gaye, Amadou] NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Modi, Neena] Imperial Coll, Dept Med, Sect Neonatal Med, Chelsea & Westminister Hosp Campus, London SW10 9NH, England",University of Warwick; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); Imperial College London,"Achana, F (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",f.achana@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Khan, Kamran/JFJ-9362-2023","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Gaye, Amadou/0000-0002-1180-2792; Khan, Kamran/0000-0002-4322-9695; Majeed, Azeem/0000-0002-2357-9858","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme [RP-PG-0707-10010]; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0616-10103, RP-PG-0707-10010] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This paper presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme (RP-PG-0707-10010).

The continent has experienced growth in domestic, intra- and inter-continental air traffic services over the past two decades that we project will continue over the medium term. Applying a gravity model in which corruption, conflict, common language and land-locked indices contribute to the demand estimation, we forecast annual intra-African growth of 8.1% up to 2030. As witnessed in established markets, deregulation will likely result in hub-spoke network designs in order to accommodate demand efficiently if mobility and access is to be encouraged. In this research, we modify the p-hub median problem in order to identify multiple, economically viable, hub-spoke networks that would adequately serve the intra- and inter-continental demand for air transport. Aside from current hubs, namely Cairo (Egypt), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Johannesburg (South Africa), future hubs could include airports in the North that serve European-African flows, such as Algiers, and Nigeria in the West due to its relatively large population and wealth. By 2030, we also find that demand is sufficient to justify an additional hub in central Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Lusaka (Zambia). However, this would be dependent on the implementation of liberalisation policies as set out in the Yamoussoukro Decision.","[Adler, Nicole] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Njoya, Eric Tchouamou] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Dept Logist Operat Hospitality & Mkt, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Volta, Nicola] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Huddersfield; Cranfield University,"Volta, N (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.",msnic@huji.ac.il; E.Njoya@hud.ac.uk; n.volta@cranfield.ac.uk,"Adler, Nicole/AAL-5010-2021; Adler, Nicole/GYV-1956-2022","Adler, Nicole/0000-0002-5242-2542; Adler, Nicole/0000-0002-5242-2542; Volta, Nicola/0000-0002-4436-4469; Tchouamou Njoya, Eric/0000-0002-1799-9469",Recanati Foundation,Recanati Foundation,"We would like to thank the participants of the ATARD Cost Action (2015), the University of Bergamo workshop (2016), the GARS Africa workshop (2016) and DLR/Airbus forecasting workshop (2016) for valuable comments.

Our robust findings show that overvalued stock-paying acquirers that are subject to limited investor attention do not experience significant announcement period wealth losses. However, the overvaluation of these acquirers is corrected in the post-announcement period. By contrast, the overvalued acquirers that receive high investor attention and use stock as the payment method in their listed target acquisitions experience negative announcement period abnormal returns. The widely documented evidence that stock-financed acquisitions are associated with significant announcement period wealth losses is primarily driven by deals in which the acquirers are subject to high investor attention.

Youngsters observe the behavioral trait of a role model and form beliefs about the desirability of that trait. Adults have better information about each trait and have a paternalistic attitude toward their children. This makes them reluctant to adopt myopic behavior to avoid setting a negative example to their children. This signaling distortion increases in the influence parents have over their offspring. We extend the model to allow parental influence to depend on the population frequency of each trait and show that cultural complementarity does not imply convergence to a homogeneous population. We find empirical support for a positive relationship between parental influence and propensity to exert self-restraint by looking at alcohol and tobacco consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results of the statistical techniques used to quantify long-term business sustainability indicate that the age of firms has a weak relationship with sustainability and environmental practices (-0.075) and offshore outsourcing issues (0.074). Our study simulations suggest that government support amounting to 5% of export earnings would ensure offshore investment sustainability in the long term, compared to existing situations.

Syria's experience is a useful one to explore given its historically important role in the region and its distinctive characteristics. The Syrian economic transition, from the early 1990s to 2011, was in two phases: an incremental liberalisation phase and a transition to a social market economy phase. During both phases, Syrian policymakers showed a preference for a gradualist approach to economic transition, rather than a big-bang approach. This was facilitated by oil revenues and subsidies from the Gulf States. The Syrian experience therefore has its own distinct characteristics, as well as elements in common with the transitions in other post-socialist economies.","[Alajaty, Mahmoud; Anchor, John R.] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,"Alajaty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.",m.alajaty@hud.ac.uk,"Anchor, John/AFM-0328-2022","Anchor, John/0000-0003-2885-9450; Alajaty, Mahmoud/0000-0002-0576-9615",,,,,53,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30,3,,,,,382,394,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14631377.2018.1442052,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432216800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

After critically reviewing the existing literatures - the international political economy (IPE) of policy space' and the IPE of financial statecraft' - the paper deploys a scalar-relational' critical IPE approach and interprets these policy initiatives in terms of a crisis-driven production of new state spaces' across the Global South, in the context of the current period of credit-led capital accumulation. The paper argues that this process has been characterised by the contradictory extension, intensification and growing complexity of the tasks taken on by the capitalist state at various scale levels, resulting in the increasing entanglement of state power in the nested hierarchy of monetary relations, from the global scale to bodies and subjectivities.","[Alami, Ilias] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Polit, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Alami, I (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Polit, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",ilias.alami@manchester.ac.uk,,,University of Manchester,University of Manchester,"Thanks are due to Adrienne Roberts, Stuart Shields, Greig Charnock, Ian Bruff, Jamie Doucette, Adam Fishwick, Susanne Soederberg, Geoff Mann, Tom Marois, and two anonymous reviewers for reading earlier versions of this essay and making extensive comments.

METHODS: We used two data sets that included the 3L and 5L versions from the same respondents. The EuroQol Group data set (n = 3551) included patients with different diseases and a healthy cohort. The National Data Bank data set included patients with rheumatoid disease (n = 5205). We estimated a system of ordinal regressions in each data set using copula models to link responses of the 3L instrument to those of the 5L instrument and its UK tariff, and vice versa. Results were applied to nine cost-effectiveness studies. RESULTS: Best-fitting models differed between the EuroQol Group and the National Data Bank data sets in terms of the explanatory variables, copulas, and coefficients. In both cases, the coefficients of the covariates and latent factors between the 3L and the 5L instruments were significantly different, indicating that moving between instruments is not simply a uniform re-alignment of the response levels for most dimensions. In the case studies, moving from the 3L to the 5L caused a decrease of up to 87% in incremental quality-adjusted life-years gained from effective technologies in almost all cases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios increased, often substantially. Conversely, one technology with a significant mortality gain saw increased incremental quality-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSIONS: The 5L shifts mean utility scores up the utility scale toward full health and compresses them into a smaller range, compared with the 3L. Improvements in quality of life are valued less using the 5L than using the 3L. The 3L and the 5L can produce substantially different estimates of cost effectiveness. There is no simple proportional adjustment that can be made to reconcile these differences. Copyright (c) 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

The change in trader price focus around the euro introduction addresses an open debate in the clustering literature on whether the presence of clustering is a bias related to the current prices or anchoring to past prices. Our findings of a decline in drachma clustering, but lack of switch to euro effects supports the case for clustering being a trading feature that is slow to transfer to new pricing regimes.

However, the evolution of these debates has been underpinned by a persistent firm-centrism, with insufficient attention paid to states, public authority and politics. Building on a renewed interest in these themes in recent literature, we contribute to growing demand for a more robust political economy of governance in GVC/GPN debates, wherein the key governance functions of the state can be classified as facilitative, regulatory and distributive in nature. In this context, we explore how the politics of state governance play out in the South African fruit sector, and particularly focus on the labour crisis that occurred in 2012/2013. Our analysis underscores the centrality of the state in governing GVCs/GPNs, and highlights important tensions within and across the three arenas of state governance, and between public and private governance, with significant developmental implications for local actors operating at the base of GVCs/GPNs. Our findings to the importance of a 'relational' understanding of state governance, which reveals how the dynamics of state governance are shaped both by continual political contestation and the competitive commercial context of GVCs/GPNs.","[Alford, Matthew] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, People Management & Org PMO Div, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Phillips, Nicola] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of London; King's College London,"Alford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, People Management & Org PMO Div, Manchester, Lancs, England.",matthew.alford@manchester.ac.uk,,"Phillips, Nicola/0000-0001-9588-976X; Alford, Matthew/0000-0002-1614-7862",,,,,113,57,62,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Using a wide variety of financial development measures, as well as specific indicators capturing the level of state intervention in the financial system and the degree of market-driven financing in the economy, we examine whether limited access to finance acts as a barrier to reducing energy intensity. Our estimations control for variables such as state investment, stock market capitalization and the composition effect. Further, a GMM estimator is used to control for endogeneity in our models. Our results provide evidence that a poorly functioning financial system constrains the reduction of energy intensity across regions. However, the strength of these effects has been gradually declining over time, especially following the implementation of the Green Credit Policy. Limitations in domestic access to finance as well as the misallocation of funds and the efficient use of capital have policy implications, as they can reduce the incentives for investment in the energy sector. These findings are a source of considerable interest in light of the new policy based on green credit, and they highlight new opportunities as well as challenges to sustainable economic growth.","[Aller, Carlos] Univ CEU Cardenal Herrera, Dept Econ & Business, Alfara Del Patriarca, Spain; [Herrerias, Maria Jesus] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, England; [Ordonez, Javier] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Econ Int, Castellon De La Plana, Spain",Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera; University of Birmingham; Universitat Jaume I,"Herrerias, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, England.",m.j.herrerias@bham.ac.uk,"Ordonez, Javier/K-3665-2014; ARRANZ, Carlos ALLER/AAE-3184-2020","Ordonez, Javier/0000-0002-1453-2441;","Spanish Ministry of Economics, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2017-83255-C3-3-P]; PROMETEO's project [PROMETEO II/2014/053]; University Jaume I research project [UJI-B2017-33]; Generalitat Valenciana [Prometeo/2017/158]","Spanish Ministry of Economics, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); PROMETEO's project; University Jaume I research project; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","The authors are grateful for helpful comments from participants at the 5th Meeting on International Economics in Villarreal (Spain) and University of Balearic Islands Business Department seminar, and to professors Lorenzo Ductor and Abel Lucena Pimentel.

Our variant of MDA is also strategyproof, as efficient as MDA but improves on it by achieving a balanced budget via always having a uniform price.","[Anbarci, Nejat] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Burwood, Vic 3128, Australia; [Roy, Jaideep] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Deakin University; University of Bath,"Roy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",nejat.anbarci@deakin.edu.au; jaideeproy1234@gmail.com,"Roy, Jaideep/HZJ-7846-2023","Roy, Jaideep/0000-0001-9607-0465; Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086",,,,,10,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2018,84,1,,,,,1,9,,10.1007/s11238-017-9627-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-017-9627-7,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FS3UK,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000419708700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To study the practices, processes and policies of value-assessment for new medicines across eight European countries and the role of HTA beyond economic evaluation and clinical benefit assessment. A systematic (peer review and grey) literature review was conducted using an analytical framework examining: (1) 'Responsibilities and structure of HTA agencies'; (2) 'Evidence and evaluation criteria considered in HTAs'; (3) 'Methods and techniques applied in HTAs'; and (4) 'Outcomes and implementation of HTAs'. Study countries were France, Germany, England, Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Evidence from the literature was validated and updated through two rounds of feedback involving primary data collection from national experts. All countries assess similar types of evidence; however, the specific criteria/endpoints used, their level of provision and requirement, and the way they are incorporated (e.g. explicitly vs. implicitly) varies across countries, with their relative importance remaining generally unknown. Incorporation of additional 'social value judgements' (beyond clinical benefit assessment) and economic evaluation could help explain heterogeneity in coverage recommendations and decision-making. More comprehensive and systematic assessment procedures characterised by increased transparency, in terms of selection of evaluation criteria, their importance and intensity of use, could lead to more rational evidence-based decision-making, possibly improving efficiency in resource allocation, while also raising public confidence and fairness.","[Angelis, Aris; Lange, Ansgar; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Angelis, Aris; Lange, Ansgar; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Med Technol Res Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Med Technol Res Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk,"Angelis, Aris/AAH-1532-2021","Angelis, Aris/0000-0002-0261-4634","Advance-HTA from the European Commission, DG Research [305983]","Advance-HTA from the European Commission, DG Research","This study has been prepared under the auspices of Advance-HTA, a research project that has received funding from the European Commission, DG Research (Grant Agreement No: 305983).

Typically this matrix is fixed a priori by the investigator, which is seldom satisfactory. Recent proposals advocate a more data-driven approach in which W may be estimated. Where panel data are available it may be possible not only to estimate W but also to test its constancy through time. When the time dimension of the panel is large there is a non-negligible risk of breaks in model parameters, including possibly the weights. Ignoring such breaks when they are present will produce at best inefficient parameter estimates, and in most cases, biases. The paper focuses on the stability of W by adapting to the spatial panel context tests for the constancy of covariance matrices developed in the multivariate statistics literature. Information provided by these tests is a prerequisite for a satisfactory analysis of models in which W appears.

The fate after 15 years of a quarter of a million UK firms born in 1998,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Firm growth; Firm age; Firm size; Firm survival; Birth cohort,BUSINESS GROWTH; JOB-CREATION; SIZE; SURVIVAL; FACTS,"The theory of firm growth is in a rather unsatisfactory state. However, the analysis of large firm-level datasets which have become available in recent years allows us to begin building an evidence base which can, in turn, be used to underpin the development of more satisfactory theory. Here we study the 239 thousand UK private sector firms born in 1998 over their first 15 years of life. A first, and quite striking, finding is the extraordinary force of mortality. By age 15, 90% of the UK firms born in 1998 are dead, and, for those surviving to age 15, the hazard of death is still about 10% a year. The chance of death is related to the size and growth of firms in an interesting way. Whilst the hazard rate after 15 years is largely independent of size at birth, it is strongly affected by the current (age 14) size. In particular, firms with more than five employees are half as likely to die in the next year as firms with less than five employees. A second important finding is that most firms, even those which survive to age 15, do not grow very much. By age 15 more than half the 26,000 survivors still have less than five jobs. In other words, the growth paths - what we call the 'growth trajectories' - of most of the 26,000 survivors are pretty flat. However, of the firms that do grow, firms born smaller grow faster than those born larger. Another striking finding is that growth is heavily concentrated in the first five years. Whilst growth does continue, even up to age 15, each year after age five it involves only a relatively small proportion of firms. Finally, there are two groups of survivors which contribute importantly to job creation. Some are those born relatively large (with more than 20 jobs) although their growth rate is quite modest. More striking though, is a very small group of firms born very small with less than five jobs (about 5% of all survivors) which contribute a substantial proportion (more than one third) of the jobs added to the cohort total by age 15.","[Anyadike-Danes, Michael; Hart, Mark] Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Anyadike-Danes, M (通讯作者)，Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",m.anyadike-danes@aston.ac.uk,,"Hart, Mark/0000-0002-0402-4128","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1, ES/K00400X/1, ES/R010129/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/R010129/1, ES/K00400X/1, ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,55,18,19,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Given these propositions, this contribution has two objectives. The first is to develop a Keynesian type of macroeconomic policy able to stimulate investment and effective demand, and, as a result, mitigate unemployment. The idea is to offer alternative macroeconomic policy prescriptions in relation to the New Consensus Macroeconomics one.

Methods: This study used a Markov model that employed a life-time time horizon, modeling patients from symptom onset of stroke until end of life. Clinical efficacy and safety data were taken from an individual patient level data (IPD) meta-analysis of clinical studies. The treatment effect of MT compared to usual care was measured by changes in modified Rankin Score (mRS). Post-treatment mRS scores were used to determine short- and long-term stroke care costs. Treatment costs were modeled, with health state utility values determined by literature review. All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel. Results: In comparison to usual care, MT is associated with higher costs ($10,666 per patient) and additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.8281 per patient), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY of $12,880. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the reliability of the base case results across a range of assumptions. The higher cost associated with MT is, to an extent, offset by the cost savings resulting from lower stroke care costs due to improved patient outcomes. The life-time cost savings in terms of stroke care costs are estimated to be more than $8,000 per patient for patients who had received MT in combination with usual care. Limitations: Stroke care costs based on patient disability/functional level were not available and were derived. As a consequence, long-term care costs for patients with poorer outcomes may be under-estimated. Patient outcomes at 90 days were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, but this approach was supported by long-term evidence on stroke survival. Conclusions: Mechanical thrombectomy is a cost-effective treatment option for AIS, with clinical benefits translating to short- and long-term cost benefits. This analysis supports rapid update of stroke care pathways to incorporate this therapy as a treatment option.","[Arora, Nimita; Makino, Koji; Tilden, Dominic] THEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Pyrmont, NSW, Australia; [Lobotesis, Kyriakos] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Mitchell, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gillespie, John] Medtron Australasia Pty Ltd, 2 Alma Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2113, Australia",Imperial College London; University of Melbourne; Melbourne Bioinformatics,"Gillespie, J (通讯作者)，Medtron Australasia Pty Ltd, 2 Alma Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2113, Australia.",john.gillespie@medtronic.com,,,Medtronic,Medtronic(Medtronic),"This work was funded by Medtronic, the manufacturer of Solitaire stent retrievers.",,43,39,40,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Yet, serious weaknesses in these statistics persist. The extent of bias in smallholder labor data is examined by conducting a randomized survey experiment among farming households in rural Tanzania. Agricultural labor estimates obtained through weekly surveys are compared with the results of reporting in a single end-of-season recall survey. The findings show strong evidence of recall bias: people in traditional recall-style modules reported working up to four times as many hours per person-plot as those reporting labor on a weekly basis. Recall bias manifests both in the intensive and extensive margins of labor reporting: while hours are over-reported in recall, the number of people and plots active in agricultural work are under-reported. The evidence suggests that this recall bias is driven not only by failures in memory, but also by the mental burdens of reporting on highly variable agricultural work patterns to provide a typical estimate.

Results show that temperature shocks severely affect household welfare, reducing consumption, food consumption and daily caloric intake. The negative welfare effects are more severe for households where land is solely managed by women, a finding that sheds light on the gender-unequal impact of temperature shocks. Our evidence also suggests that women's vulnerability to temperature shocks is linked to women's land tenure security, as temperature shocks significantly impact women's welfare only in patrilineal districts, where statistics show that investment in agricultural technologies is lower.","[Asfaw, Solomon] Food & Agr Org FAO United Nat, Agr Dev Econ Div, Rome, Italy; [Maggio, Giuseppe] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",solomon.asfaw@fao.org,"Maggio, Giuseppe/HGB-8937-2022","Maggio, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8768-1317",,,,,58,48,54,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We propose a two-way taxonomy based on (a) whether the social group is horizontal (peers at the same level of the hierarchy) or vertical (individuals at different levels within or outside of the organization) and (b) whether the agent's effort creates externalities for the other members of their social group. We show settings in which social incentives improve productivity and settings in which they reduce it. In most cases, the size of the effect is approximately 10%, which is half of the typical effect of performance pay. We also show that social incentives can interfere with financial incentives, making them ineffective or even detrimental. We conclude that social incentives are a powerful motivator that must be taken into account in the design of organizational policies and that more research is needed to understand how policies can shape the preferences that underpin these incentives.","[Ashraf, Nava; Bandiera, Oriana] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ashraf, Nava; Bandiera, Oriana] Suntory & Toyota Int Ctr Econ & Related Disciplin, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ashraf, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Ashraf, N (通讯作者)，Suntory & Toyota Int Ctr Econ & Related Disciplin, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.ashraf1@lse.ac.uk; o.bandiera@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,46,48,0,36,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In Kenya, most patients currently pay out of pocket for treatment, and those who are insured are generally not covered for the full costs of treatment. This places a considerable burden on households if family members develop cancer. However, the actual cost of cancer treatment in Kenya is unknown. Such an analysis is essential to better allocate resources as Kenya strives towards universal healthcare. Objectives: To evaluate the economic burden of treating cancer patients. Method: Descriptive cross-sectional cost of illness study in the leading teaching and referral hospital in Kenya, with data collected from the hospital files of sampled adult patients for treatment during 2016. Results: In total, 412 patient files were reviewed, of which 63.4% (n=261) were female and 36.6% (n=151) male. The cost of cancer care is highly dependent on the modality. Most reviewed patients had surgery, chemotherapy and palliative care. The cost of cancer therapy varied with the type of cancer. Patients on chemotherapy alone cost an average of KES 138,207 (USD 1364.3); while those treated with surgery cost an average of KES 128,207 (1265.6), and those on radiotherapy KES 119,036 (1175.1). Some patients had a combination of all three, costing, on average, KES 333,462 (3291.8) per patient during the year. Conclusion: The cost of cancer treatment in Kenya depends on the type of cancer, the modality, cost of medicines and the type of inpatient admission. The greatest contributors are currently the cost of medicines and inpatient admissions. This pilot study can inform future initiatives among the government as well as private and public insurance companies to increase available resources, and better allocate available resources, to more effectively treat patients with cancer in Kenya. The authors will be monitoring developments and conducting further research.","[Atieno, Omondi Michelle; Opanga, Sylvia] Univ Nairobi, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharm Practice, Nairobi, Kenya; [Martin, Antony; Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Hlth Econ Ctr, Management Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Martin, Antony] Innovat Ctr, HCD Econ, Daresbury, England; [Kurdi, Amanj; Godman, Brian] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland; [Kurdi, Amanj] Hawler Med Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Coll Pharm, Erbil, Iraq; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Karolinska, Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, George Town, Malaysia",University of Nairobi; University of Liverpool; University of Strathclyde; Hawler Medical University; Karolinska Institutet; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Godman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland.",brian.godman@strath.ac.uk,"Kurdi, Amanj/P-1217-2017; Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019","Kurdi, Amanj/0000-0001-5036-1988; Martin, Antony/0000-0003-4383-6038",,,,,43,33,33,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Such games are central in formal verification since they model the interaction between a non-terminating system and its environment. We study bidding games in which the players bid for the right to move the token. Two bidding rules have been defined. In Richman bidding, in each round, the players simultaneously submit bids, and the higher bidder moves the token and pays the other player. Poorman bidding is similar except that the winner of the bidding pays the bank rather than the other player. While poorman reachability games have been studied before, we present, for the first time, results on infinite-duration poorman games. A central quantity in these games is the ratio between the two players' initial budgets. The questions we study concern a necessary and sufficient ratio with which a player can achieve a goal. For reachability objectives, such threshold ratios are known to exist for both bidding rules. We show that the properties of poorman reachability games extend to complex qualitative objectives such as parity, similarly to the Richman case. Our most interesting results concern quantitative poorman games, namely poorman mean-payoff games, where we construct optimal strategies depending on the initial ratio, by showing a connection with random-turn based games. The connection in itself is interesting, because it does not hold for reachability poorman games. We also solve the complexity problems that arise in poorman bidding games.","[Avni, Guy; Henzinger, Thomas A.] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Ibsen-Jensen, Rasmus] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Institute of Science & Technology - Austria; University of Liverpool,"Avni, G (通讯作者)，IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.",guy.avni@ist.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [S11402-N23, Z211-N23, M 2369-N33]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [M2369] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This research was supported in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under grants S11402-N23 (RiSE/SHiNE), Z211-N23 (Wittgenstein Award), and M 2369-N33 (Meitner fellowship).",,36,4,4,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316,,,,,,21,36,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_2,,,16,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000865933000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regional Studies. This paper adopts a transaction costs' perspective to explain why the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may vary across regions of an emerging economy. Furthermore, it is argued that young and small firms gain more from the improvement of local governance than do old and large firms. In addition, depending on the institutional history, SMEs will respond differently to the incentives provided by local governance. Analysing more than 300,000 SMEs in Vietnam during 2006-12, it is shown that higher-quality local governance positively influences local SME revenue growth; this effect is stronger for young and small firms, and matters more where institutional history suggests there is less support for entrepreneurship.","[Bach Nguyen; Mickiewicz, Tomasz; Du, Jun] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Dept, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Mickiewicz, T (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Dept, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",nguyenb@aston.ac.uk; t.mickiewicz@aston.ac.uk; j.du@aston.ac.uk,"Mickiewicz, Tomasz/AAC-8016-2019","Mickiewicz, Tomasz/0000-0001-5261-5662; Du, Jun/0000-0002-0449-4437; NGUYEN, BACH/0000-0003-1527-7443",Leverhulme Trust [RF-2016-661],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),Jun Du gratefully acknowledges the support of The Leverhulme Trust [grant number RF-2016-661].,,59,40,42,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A missing ingredient in the political economy of post-crisis financial reform is the neglect of questions of social purpose in both policy debate and IPE scholarship. Social purpose is defined as a vision of the desirable or good economic system, derived from combinations of economic analysis and ethical reasoning. It is of particular relevance and importance to macroprudential regime building, because the foundational macroprudential conceptual frameworks developed by the Bank for International Settlements and the Geneva Group from 2000 onwards display the features of a macrosocial ontology that draw on a Minsky-Keynes tradition. By focusing on systemic outcomes and collective social expectations, such an ontology creates the basis for so-called macro-moralities that provide ethical justifications for public forms of systemic stabilisation. However, a variety of epistemological, professional, institutional and political barriers have impeded relevant expert groups and political actors' willingness and ability to actively translate macroprudential ontology into a systemic vision, or sense of social purpose that could be communicated to the public at large.","[Baker, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Baker, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Polit Econ Res Inst, Fac Social Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Baker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Polit Econ Res Inst, Fac Social Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,"Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-6677-930X",,,,,110,43,48,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Asymmetric quantile causality patterns are particularly pronounced in the case of Japan.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Nguyen, Duc Khuong] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France; [Nguyen, Duc Khuong] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria; IPAG Business School; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",mwohar@mail.unomaha.edu,"Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020; BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787; BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,73,35,35,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It does so through an innovative engagement with recent literatures on forced labour, unfreedom and hyper-precarity, particularly amongst irregular migrants. We advance two key arguments in this paper. First, that the available data on labour within immigration detention indicate that detainees should legally be considered employees and granted access to labour protections, including the national minimum wage. Second, that work in immigration detention is an example of state-sanctioned exploitative, coercive and unfree labour amongst a hyper-precarious group of the population. This case has implications for other country contexts where immigration detention is used.","[Bales, Katie] Univ Bristol, Law Dept, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Mayblin, Lucy] Univ Warwick, Sociol Dept, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Bristol; University of Warwick,"Bales, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Law Dept, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",bales@bristol.ac.uk; l.mayblin@warwick.ac.uk,"Mayblin, Lucy/AAR-5591-2021",,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011468/1]; ESRC [ES/L011468/2, ES/L011468/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011468/1].,,69,23,26,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Grounded in the Capability Approach and in the gender economics literature this conceptualisation accounts for three key elements: resources, values/traditions, and decision-outcomes. These elements interact into a system of structural equations where a latent variable is specified to measure empowerment; decision-outcomes enter as partial metrics of empowerment; and resources, and values/traditions are modelled as exogenous factors.

A two-step approach is employed to derive the conditional type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II) posterior distribution of the coefficients and individual effects. The ML-II posterior means are weighted averages of the Bayes estimator under a base prior and the data-dependent empirical Bayes estimator. Two-stage and three stage hierarchy estimators are developed and their finite sample performance is investigated through a series of Monte Carlo experiments. These include standard random effects as well as Mundlak-type, Chamberlain-type and Hausman Taylor-type models. The simulation results underscore the relatively good performance of the three-stage hierarchy estimator. Within a single theoretical framework, our Bayesian approach encompasses a variety of specifications while conventional methods require separate estimators for each case. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to examine the FDI inflows determinants for 24 OECD countries. To this end we employ annual data from 1980 to 2012 for a series of potential FDI determinants that have been identified as the most important by the relevant literature. Our empirical strategy employs both the standard fixed effects panel as well as a dynamic panel approach. The empirical findings highlight the importance of market size, trade openness, unit labor cost, schooling, taxation, gross capital formation, institutional variables, and ROA/ROE as significant FDI determinants. In the case of the dynamic panel model those FDI inflows determinants are not uniform for all country groups. Additionally, the results indicate that corporate tax rates clearly affect FDI attractiveness. This finding is robust when testing different countries subgroups. The present study has important policy implications indicating the factors that host economies should place emphasis on in order to attract FDI inflows. Policy makers should not only pay attention to the corporate tax rate level but they should also design a simple, stable and transparent taxation system that minimizes the relevant business risk.","[Baltas, Nicholas; Tsionas, Mike G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England; [Baltas, Konstantinos] Univ Essex, Finance Grp, Essex Business Sch, Colchester, Essex, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; Lancaster University; University of Essex,"Baltas, N (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",baltas@aueb.gr,"Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106",,,,,34,6,8,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Though it is generally agreed that this has been driven by economic factors, climatic factors might also have had a part to play. The challenge is to evaluate the impact of climatic factors on migration in the simultaneous presence of changing socio-economic influences. We resolve this challenge by carrying out a statistical multivariate regression analysis on bilateral migration rates between Chinese provinces. The analysis simultaneously includes climate change in the form of climate anomalies (temperature, precipitation, sunshine) and various socio-economic factors including energy consumption. To this end we have constructed a unique three-dimensional panel dataset (time, sending province, receiving province) with bilateral migration rates between 30 provinces for the period 1987-2015. Due to the distributional properties of the data and underlying theory we use a Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator but include OLS estimates for comparison. The results suggest that increases in temperature and precipitation are significant migration push factors while increased sunshine discourages push migration. Provincial differentials in per capita energy consumption and Gross Regional Product (GRP) are also significant drivers of migration.","[Barassi, M. R.; Ercolani, M. G.; Herrerias, M.

In this paper we produce improved short-term forecasts of the demand for energy produced from five different sources in the UK averaging from a set of 6 univariate and multivariate models. The forecasts are averaged using six different weighting functions including Simple Model Averaging (SMA), Granger-Ramanathan Model Averaging (GRMA), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Smoothing Akaike (SAIC), Mallows Weights (MMA) and Jackknife (JMA). Our results show that model averaging gives always a lower Mean Square Forecast Error (MSFE) than the best/optimal models within each class however selected. For example, for Coal, Wind and Hydro generated Electricity forecasts generated with model averaging, we report a MSFE about 12% lower than that obtained using the best selected individual models. Among these, the best individual forecasting models are the Non-Linear Artificial Neural Networks and the Vector Autoregression and that models selected by the Jackknife have often superior performance. However, MMA averaged forecasts almost always beat the predictions obtained from any of the individual models however selected, and those generated by other model averaging techniques.","[Barassi, Marco] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Zhao, Yuqian] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Birmingham; University of Waterloo,"Barassi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.r.barassi@bham.ac.uk; yuqian.zhao@uwaterloo.ca,,"Barassi, Marco/0000-0001-8945-2457",,,,,49,6,6,3,30,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39,,,,1,,209,239,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.mbar,http://dx.doi.org/10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.mbar,,,31,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4BL,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000457118600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper studies whether intraday technical trading rules have any significant predictive power in the precious metals market through three popular moving average rules. We find that using the standard parameters previously used in the literature, technical trading rules offer no predictive power whatsoever. However after utilising a universe of parameters, we find a number of parameter combinations offer significant predictability in the gold market, but there remains no significant predictability in the silver market. Our results show that the longer parameters of the technical trading rules are more successful than the traditional parameters chosen in the literature. Therefore intraday technical trading rules have some predictive power in the gold market but offer no significant predictability in the silver market.

First, the paper demonstrates that there has been a revival of support for private sector participation in infrastructure. Second, the paper argues that this revival differs from earlier attempts to increase the involvement of the private sector in public service provision in a number of respects. In particular, the current support for PPPs is related to an increased availability of global financial capital.

Yet despite an extensive literature exploring the effects of conservation on human livelihoods, there is a lack of robust evidence about which type of conservation intervention works, for whom, and how. This is partly because the social impacts of conservation interventions often affect multiple aspects of human well-being, with changes taking place over long periods during which unintended feedbacks can occur. This paper assesses the medium-term impacts of Protected Areas (PAs) and of three Payment for Environmental Services (PES) projects on three socio-economic indicators across 16 villages in Northern Cambodia. We present a multi-period evaluation including three panel surveys over six years from villages inside and outside PAs to clarify the mechanisms through which social effects of conservation take place and how this translates into the development pathways adopted by households. While livelihood improvements were recorded across all villages, we found that PAs slightly reduce households' socio-economic status, though does not impede their development. PAs also protect traditional livelihoods. Participants in one of the three PES projects recorded higher economic status and agricultural productivity than non-participants, suggesting that there can be important social co-benefits to conservation interventions when programs are well-designed to respond to local contexts.

More precisely we test the effect of three factors: two different frames and an ex-post redistribution mechanism that transfers resources from purely self-interested consumers to responsible ones.

We then use the geographic coordinates of these banks' branches and of 14,100 businesses to analyze how the lending techniques of banks near firms are related to credit constraints at two contrasting points of the credit cycle. We find that while relationship lending is not associated with credit constraints during a credit boom, it alleviates such constraints during a downturn. This positive role of relationship lending is stronger for small and opaque firms and in regions with a more severe economic downturn. Moreover, relationship lending mitigates the impact of a downturn on firm growth and does not constitute evergreening of loans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this confusion, African countries pursue emulative strategies for different purposes - whether they may be for economic transformation (in line with developmental state strategies), market-led reforms or simply to signal the implementation of best practices' to please donors. Rwanda has been lauded for the country's economic recovery since the 1994 genocide, with international financial institutions and heterodox scholars both praising different facets of its development strategy. This paper argues that Rwanda is an example of a country that has simultaneously pursued emulative strategies for different purposes - often even within the same sector. Two studies of emulation are explored: the emulation of Singapore's Economic Development Board through the establishment of Rwanda's own Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and the evolution of Rwanda's financial sector with reference to the use of contending market-led and developmental state models. The paper argues that in Rwanda, incoherent emulation for different purposes has resulted in contradictory tensions within its development strategy and the construction of a neoliberal developmental state.","[Behuria, Pritish] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, London, England",,"Behuria, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, London, England.",p.behuria@lse.ac.uk,,"Behuria, Pritish/0000-0003-3743-2045",,,,,97,14,16,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The method is often applied in a decision analytic model without appropriately accounting for additional uncertainty when determining the allocation of health care resources. The aim of the study is to describe novel approaches to adequately account for uncertainty when using a Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time model in a decision analytic model. METHODS: Using two examples, we tested and compared the performance of the novel Test-based method with the resampling bootstrap method and with the conventional approach of no adjustment. In the first example, we simulated life expectancy using a simple decision analytic model based on a hypothetical oncology trial with treatment switching. In the second example, we applied the adjustment method on published data when no individual patient data were available. RESULTS: Mean estimates of overall and incremental life expectancy were similar across methods. However, the bootstrapped and test-based estimates consistently produced greater estimates of uncertainty compared with the estimate without any adjustment applied. Similar results were observed when using the test based approach on a published data showing that failing to adjust for uncertainty led to smaller confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Both the bootstrapping and test-based approaches provide a solution to appropriately incorporate uncertainty, with the benefit that the latter can implemented by researchers in the absence of individual patient data.

The strategic interaction is particularly favoured by the fact that prices are easily observable online by all competitors. The analysis focuses on selected Italian city-pair markets that differ from one another with respect to the degree of inter-and intra-modal competition and to the characteristics of the transport services provided. We exploit this heterogeneity to study transport operators' strategic interactions in different competitive environments. We find evidence of the existence of price leadership, even though results differ across city-pair markets. In particular, it emerges that the incumbent operator, in either the air or the rail sector, always holds the role of leader.","[Bergantino, Angela S.] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Econ Management & Business Law, Bari, Italy; [Capozza, Claudia] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Ionian Dept Law Econ & Environm, Bari, Italy; [Capurso, Mauro] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Leeds,"Bergantino, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Econ Management & Business Law, Bari, Italy.",as.bergantino@gmail.com,,"BERGANTINO, Angela Stefania/0000-0001-9490-9917; Capurso, Mauro/0000-0001-7599-4431",,,,,59,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We assume that policy makers have incomplete information about banks' true health, and banking sector turmoil can generate cross-border spill-over effects. We show that, in such an environment, the decentralisation of policy responsibilities for the regulation of banks can achieve the first-best allocation and ensure financial stability. While national governments design banking regulations, the federal policy maker authorises inter-regional income redistribution payments throughout the federation. Our results suggest that strengthening national responsibilities in banking regulation and supervision in the course of the further development of the European banking union may be advisable.","[Berger, Wolfram] Univ Cottbus, Dept Macroecon, Cottbus, Germany; [Nagase, Yoko] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford, England",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Oxford Brookes University,"Berger, W (通讯作者)，Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Dept Macroecon, Postbox 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany.",bergerw@tu-cottbus.de; ynagase@brookes.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

It does so through separating a narrow view of austerity as fiscal consolidation from actually existing austerity as a broader political economic process ongoing in different ways in different countries. Through a case study of crisis, austerity and contestation as it relates to housing in Spain, the paper argues that to contest actually existing austerity it is necessary to contest both the wealth and power of the actors that have gained from austerity, not least finance capital. Through bank bailouts and the creation of a bad bank, the reforms demanded by the troika have opened up Spanish housing to direct wealth extraction by global finance capital whilst half a million households have been evicted and hundreds of thousands live with insurmountable debt. The Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH, Platform for the Mortgage-Affected) has contested austerity in Spanish housing by contesting finance capital through civil disobedience whilst campaigning for anti-austerity reforms to housing and mortgage legislation, aiming to limit how housing can be a sphere of wealth extraction for finance capital.","[Berglund, Oscar] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Berglund, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",oscar.berglund@bristol.ac.uk,"Berglund, Oscar/AAZ-2966-2020","Berglund, Oscar/0000-0003-0068-8194",Economic and Social Research Council [SPAI SC3203],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [grant number SPAI SC3203].,,85,9,10,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In order to answer this question we characterize constrained-efficient allocations in an infinite horizon, two-good economy with limited commitment for two market structures, random pairwise meetings and centralized meetings. If agents meet bilaterally, then constrained-efficient allocations specify the highest stationary output level that is incentive feasible, and it is implemented with take-it-or-leave-it offers and not-too-tight solvency constraints. If agents meet in a centralized location, constrained-efficient allocations can be non-stationary, in which case they feature a credit boom followed by stagnation due to too-tight solvency constraints. We also characterize constrained-efficient allocations under partial commitment by the planner. If commitment is low, the economy experiences rare but pronounced credit crunches. If commitment is high, the economy experiences infrequent but large credit booms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate determinants of food security as measured by a well-known food security scale - the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - and as measured by value of household food consumption composed of own-production, market purchases and gifts received. We find that several dimensions of household vulnerability correlate more strongly with the food security measure than with food consumption. Labor constraints, which is a key vulnerability criterion used by the HSCT to target households, is an important predictor of the food security score but not food consumption, and its effect on food security is even larger during the lean season. Impact analysis shows that the program has had statistically significant impacts on Food Security and Diet Diversity scores but null to low impacts on food consumption. However aggregate food consumption hides dynamic activity taking place within the household where the cash is used to obtain more food from the market and rely less on food received as gifts. The cash in turn gives beneficiaries greater choice in their food basket, which improves diet diversity.","[Bhalla, Garima] Oxford Policy Management Ltd, Level 3,52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, England; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Seidenfeld, David] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW 200, Washington, DC 20007 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; American Institutes for Research,"Bhalla, G (通讯作者)，Oxford Policy Management Ltd, Level 3,52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, England.",garims@gmail.com,,,UNICEF [431-23421],UNICEF,This work was supported by UNICEF [431-23421].,,32,41,44,4,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74,,,,,,82,99,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.007,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,31692975,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000426412400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

An expert's preference is parameterized by his ideal action, or agenda. Common intuition suggests that more information is revealed if the panel includes experts with opposed agendas, because such experts will undo each other's attempts to conceal unfavorable information. In contrast, we show that recruiting experts with diverse agendas is optimal only if the correlation between the experts' types-i.e., whether they are informed or not is above a threshold. Moreover, if the experts' types are independent, under mild assumptions it is optimal to recruit experts who have extreme but identical agendas. These findings suggest that the diversity of preferences must be considered in conjunction with the diversity of information sources, and it is generally sub-optimal to seek diversity in both dimensions.

Donald Trump proposed cutting taxes to provide tax relief for middle-class Americans, and lowering corporation taxes to boost economic growth, while Hillary Clinton proposed modest increases in taxes on high-income Americans, with a view to increasing the fairness of the tax code. We have simulated the effects of these two proposals, using a two-tier modeling design, with a large dynamic computable general equilibrium model to address the macroeconomic magnitudes, linked to a micro-simulation tax calculator model to measure the distributional effects. The Trump proposals would boost economic growth, but sharpening the incentives to work and to save/invest would be regressive, with 70% of the benefits accruing to those in the top income decile. The budget deficit could only be maintained if spending were to be cut sharply; and if spending were reduced more modestly, the deficit would rise greatly. The Clinton proposals would have little net effect on 90% of households, which is at odds with her promise of tax relief for working people, but would reduce net income in the top decile by almost 2%. They would slow economic growth slightly. Although he was elected president, Donald Trump's proposals are likely to be altered, mainly so that the budgetary effects are much smaller, before being presented to Congress. But the rationale, shape, and tone of the proposals will likely remain the same.","[Bhattarai, Keshab] Univ Hull, Business Sch, FBLP, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7SH, N Humberside, England; [Bachman, Paul; Haughton, Jonathan; Tuerck, David G.] Suffolk Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Bachman, Paul; Conte, Frank; Haughton, Jonathan; Tuerck, David G.] Suffolk Univ, Beacon Hill Inst, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA; [Head, Michael] IBM Watson Hlth, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Hull; Suffolk University; Suffolk University,"Bhattarai, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Business Sch, FBLP, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7SH, N Humberside, England.",K.R.Bhattarai@hull.ac.uk; pbachman@beaconhill.org; fconte@eastboston.com; jhaughton@suffolk.edu; dtuerck@beaconhill.org,"Bhattarai, Keshab/AAM-8733-2020; Bhattarai, Keshab/AFH-7332-2022","Bhattarai, Keshab/0000-0002-5398-984X",NCPA [NCPA-DCGE-2015/16],NCPA,Authors appreciate the NCPA (NCPA-DCGE-2015/16) grant for a project on the dynamic CGE model for tax policy analysis of the US.

Firms located in country 1 can decide to offshore their manufacturing activities to country 2. The profitability of production in a country depends on several factors: unitary costs of production, the number of firms that are located in each country, within-country spillovers, and cross-border spillovers. Furthermore, profits in country 2 are influenced by congestion costs. Country 1 is assumed to be technologically advanced and has an advantage in terms of internal spillovers. In contrast, country 2 offers lower production unit cost which, however, may be offset by congestion costs. The firms' (re)location choices are based on a simple comparison of current production costs obtained in the two countries and the dynamics of switching is modeled by a simple replicator dynamics. The global analysis of the resulting one-dimensional dynamical system reveals that a large advantage in terms of unitary production costs encourages the firms to off-shore manufacturing activities to country 2. This off-shoring process stops when congestion costs offset this advantage of country 2, even though congestion costs do not cause all manufacturing activities to be re-shored to country 1. The re-shoring process can be accelerated by an increase of within-country spillovers in country 1, while cross-border spillovers tend to favor a geographic dispersion of manufacturing activities and make location patterns that lead to suboptimal long run outcomes less likely.","[Bischi, Gian Italo] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, DESP, 42 Via Saffi, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy; [Kopel, Michael] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Org & Econ Inst, Graz, Austria; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, 3C Via P Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Manchester, Econ Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Radi, Davide] LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Econ & Management, 22 Cso Matteotti, I-21053 Castellanza, VA, Italy",University of Urbino; University of Graz; University of Calabria; University of Manchester; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc,"Radi, D (通讯作者)，LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Econ & Management, 22 Cso Matteotti, I-21053 Castellanza, VA, Italy.",gian.bischi@uniurb.it; michael.kopel@uni-graz.at; fabio.lamantia@unical.it; dradi@liuc.it,"Radi, Davide/M-6403-2013; Kopel, Michael/AAF-1301-2020; Radi, Davide/HHR-9023-2022","Radi, Davide/0000-0001-7809-1166; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979","COST Action The EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools and policy evaluation; DESP-University of Urbino","COST Action The EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools and policy evaluation; DESP-University of Urbino","The authors thank the participants at the GeComplexity Conference in Crete 2016 for valuable comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.

Using a novel collection of historical mortgage-market data, we identify four different ideal type' systems, which developed in mature economies when organised housing finance institutions began to emerge with the advance of industrialism and urbanism throughout the long nineteenth century: informal person-to-person lending, and state lending as solutions outside specialised banking circuits; and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's economic backwardness thesis in order to explain the temporal and spatial emergence of these distinct types, arguing that these systems created path-dependent logics, which made their influence felt over a century later.","[Blackwell, Timothy; Kohl, Sebastian] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, Uppsala, Sweden; [Blackwell, Timothy] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Uppsala University; University of Sussex,"Kohl, S (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, Uppsala, Sweden.",sebastian.kohl@soc.uu.se,"Kohl, Sebastian/AAB-8908-2019","Kohl, Sebastian/0000-0002-8358-6021; Blackwell, Timothy/0000-0002-3086-8113",Economic and Social Research Council [1363771] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,71,34,35,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

If these patients are more costly to treat, the prospective payment system based on Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) may need refinement because these centres will be financially disadvantaged. To assess the funding implications of this concentration policy, we estimate the cost differentials associated with caring for patients that receive complex care and examine the extent to which complex care services are concentrated across hospitals and HRGs. We estimate random effects models using patient-level activity and cost data for all patients admitted to English hospitals during the 2013/14 financial year and construct measures of the concentration of complex services. Payments for complex care services need to be adjusted if they have large cost differentials and if provision is concentrated within a few hospitals. Payments can be adjusted either by refining HRGs or making top-up payments to HRG prices. HRG refinement is preferred to top-payments the greater the concentration of services among HRGs.","[Bojke, Chris; Grasic, Katja; Street, Andrew] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Street, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",andrew.street@york.ac.uk,,"Bojke, Chris/0000-0003-2601-0314; Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364",Monitor,Monitor,"This project was funded by Monitor (since renamed NHS Improvement).

The strong market competition has boosted the demand for a competitive premium. In actuarial science, scant literature still exists on how competition actually affects the calculation and the cycles of company's premiums. In this paper, we model premium dynamics via differential games, and study the insurers' equilibrium premium dynamics in a competitive market. We apply an optimal control theory methodology to determine the open-loop Nash equilibrium premium strategies. The market power of each insurance company is characterized by a price sensitive parameter, and the business volume is affected by the solvency ratio. We study two models. Considering the average market premiums, the first model studies an exponential relation between premium strategies and volume of business. The second model initially characterizes the competition between any selected pair of insurers, and then aggregates all the paired competitions in the market. Numerical examples illustrate the premium dynamics, and show that premium cycles may exist in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show how the credit and collateral extended valuation framework presented in Pallavicini et al. [Funding valuation adjustment: FVA consistent with CVA, DVA, WWR, collateral, netting and re-hyphotecation, 2011], and the related collateralized valuation measure, can be helpful in defining the key market rates underlying the multiple interest rate curves that characterize current interest rate markets. A key point is that spot Libor rates are to be treated as market primitives rather than being defined by no-arbitrage relationships. We formulate a consistent realistic dynamics for the different rates emerging from our analysis and compare the resulting model performances to simpler models used in the industry.

Spells of involuntary part-time work are different from unemployment spells: a full-time worker who takes on a part-time job suffers an earnings loss while remaining employed, and is unlikely to receive income compensation from publicly provided insurance programmes. We analyse these differences through the lens of an incomplete-market, job-search model featuring unemployment risk alongside an additional risk of involuntary part-time employment. A calibration of the model consistent with US institutions and labour market dynamics shows that involuntary part-time work generates lower welfare losses relative to unemployment. This finding relies critically on the much higher probability to return to full-time employment from part-time work. We interpret it as a premium in access to full-time work faced by involuntary part-time workers, and use our model to tabulate its value in consumption-equivalent units.","[Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel; Lale, Etienne] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lale, Etienne] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex,Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",Copenhagen Business School; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bristol,"Borowczyk-Martins, D (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Borowczyk-Martins, D (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",danielbm@gmail.com; etienne.lale@bristol.ac.uk,"Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel/N-5218-2019","Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel/0000-0001-7030-5801",,,,,23,5,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this article, the authors develop a more general and comprehensive critique, both from a theoretical and from an empirical perspective. They first present a short-run model that formally describes the theoretical background of specific policy measures advocated by expansionary austerity supporters. They show how these measures might only have expansionary outcomes under extreme and unrealistic conditions. The authors then move to the data and provide an econometric analysis of the key variables that leave the results of our theoretical model undetermined; their findings reinforce the validity of our theoretical critique. Since 2007, when an important opportunity to test expansionary austerity presented itself with the recession, the core mechanisms of expansionary austerity theory seem to not have been working, to say the least. In fact, austerity measures delivered perverse results precisely in the countries where they were expected to be most effective.","[Botta, Alberto] Univ Greenwich London, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England; [Tori, Daniele] Open Univ Milton Keynes, Dept Accounting & Finance, London, England",,"Botta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich London, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England.",,"Tori, Daniele/H-9013-2019; Botta, Alberto/ABT-2795-2022","Tori, Daniele/0000-0003-2947-8481; BOTTA, Alberto/0000-0001-9464-8251",,,,,33,8,9,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This prediction confirms the results of an empirical study conducted on data compiled from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) database for 12 sub-Sahara African countries for children aged between 7 and 22-years-old. Using regional HIV prevalence as a measure of health risk, we find that the 'sign of the slope' between health risk and the enrolment of children is not constant.

This result, which, although undoubtedly correct, has been regarded by many as surprising, stems from the implicit assumption that the long-term discount function has an exponential tail. We revisit the problem in the setting of modern interest rate theory, and show that if the long simple interest rate (or Libor rate) is finite, then this rate (unlike the zero-coupon rate) acts viably as a state variable, the value of which can fluctuate randomly in line with other economic indicators. New interest rate models are constructed, under this hypothesis and certain generalizations thereof, that illustrate explicitly the good asymptotic behavior of the resulting discount bond systems. The conditions necessary for the existence of such hyperbolic and generalized hyperbolic long rates are those of so-called social discounting, which allow for long-term cash flows to be treated as broadly just as important as those of the short or medium term. As a consequence, we are able to provide a consistent arbitrage-free valuation framework for the cost-benefit analysis and risk management of long-term social projects, such as those associated with sustainable energy, resource conservation, and climate change.","Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge, Middx, England; St Petersburg Natl Res Univ Informat Technol Mech, St Petersburg, Russia",Brunel University; ITMO University,"Brody, DC (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",dorje.brody@brunel.ac.uk,"Hughston, Lane P/N-8590-2013; Brody, Dorje/F-1591-2010","Brody, Dorje/0000-0002-9242-9554; Hughston, Lane/0000-0003-1185-934X",,,,,64,9,10,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

For this task, a fast and accurate pricing algorithm is indispensable. The literature mainly discusses pricing methods for American options that are based on Monte Carlo, tree and partial differential equation methods. We present an alternative approach that has become popular under the name de-Americanization in the financial industry. The method is easy to implement and enjoys fast run-times (compared to a direct calibration to American options). Since it is based on ad hoc simplifications, however, theoretical results guaranteeing reliability are not available. To quantify the resulting methodological risk, we empirically test the performance of the de-Americanization method for calibration. We classify the scenarios in which de-Americanization performs very well. However, we also identify the cases where de-Americanization oversimplifies and can result in large errors.","[Burkovska, O.; Wohlmuth, B.] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Numer Math, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Gass, M.; Glau, K.; Mahlstedt, M.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Math Finance, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schoutens, W.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200B,Box 2400, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Glau, K.] Queen Mary Univ London, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; KU Leuven; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Mahlstedt, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Chair Math Finance, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",mirco.mahlstedt@tum.de,,"Burkovska, Olena/0000-0001-6310-1130",DFG [WO671/11-1]; International Research Training Group - German Research Foundation (DFG) [IGDK1754]; Austrian research fund (FWF); KPMG Center of Excellence in Risk Management; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W1244] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); International Research Training Group - German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Austrian research fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); KPMG Center of Excellence in Risk Management; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This work was partly supported by: DFG [grant number WO671/11-1]; International Research Training Group [IGDK1754], funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Austrian research fund (FWF); KPMG Center of Excellence in Risk Management.",,34,2,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Household-level data are used to derive a measure of expected and unexpected changes in house prices; these are then incorporated into a recursive bivariate probit model of the decision to withdraw housing equity and save. The results suggest that households respond to changes in their housing wealth primarily by increasing their mortgage borrowing, rather than by decreasing their savings, although this is mainly for younger households. However, while changes in housing wealth do not have a direct impact on household saving, they do have an important indirect impact, since they increase the likelihood that the household will withdraw equity, which in turn has a negative impact on household saving.","[Burrows, Vivien] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Burrows, V (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England.",,,"Burrows, Vivien/0000-0003-1361-5568",Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The data used in this publication were made available through the ESRC Data Archive.

It significantly falls only if narrowly defined as the ratio between new-house and nondurables prices. These findings are rationalized via the estimation of two-sector New-Keynesian (NK) models. Durables prices are estimated to be as sticky as those of nondurables, leading to a flat relative price response to a monetary policy shock. Conversely, house prices are estimated to be almost flexible. Such results survive several robustness checks and a three-sector extension of the NK model.

In contrast to the previous literature, this paper adopts a multivariate, nonlinear framework to analyse Gibson's paradox in the Netherlands over the period 1800-2012. Specifically, SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis) and MSSA (Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis) techniques are used. It is shown that changes in monetary policy regimes or volatility in the price of gold by themselves cannot account for the behaviour of government bond yields and prices over the last 200 years. However, the inclusion of changes in the real rate of return on capital, M1, primary credit rate, expected inflation, and money purchasing power enables a nonlinear model to account for a sizeable percentage of the total variance of Dutch bond yields. This is a novel study of the Gibson's paradox using a non-linear approach unravelling the multidimensional nature of the paradox. The results should assist policy makers in setting monetary policy and help to better understand the behaviour of financial institutions on the markets. Central banks, should however evaluate the implication of this study in setting inflation targeting goals. Results of this study are also expected to stimulate further research on the bank credit policies by managing interest rates.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Skare, Marinko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia",Brunel University; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk; mskare@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,58,0,0,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

FCMs have been shown to be particularly useful for handling complex decision problems characterized by lack of information or unavailable data. They constitute a methodological framework that allows for a reduction of omitted determinants - in this case, with regard to sustainable banking - and are typically able to provide a greater understanding of the cause-and-effect relationships between such determinants.

However, budget impact analyses remain less frequently conducted and less well researched than cost-effectiveness analyses. The objective of this study was to fill the gap in research on budget impact analyses by assessing (1) the quality of stand-alone budget impact analyses, and (2) the feasibility of extending cost-effectiveness analyses to capture budget impact. We developed a budget impact analysis checklist and scoring system for budget impact analyses, which we then adapted for cost-effectiveness analyses, based on current International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force recommendations. We applied both budget impact analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis checklists and scoring systems to examine the extent to which existing economic evaluations provide sufficient evidence about budget impact to enable decision making. We used rotavirus vaccination as an illustrative case in which low- and middle-income countries uptake has been limited despite demonstrated cost effectiveness. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccine in low- and middle-income countries published between January 2000 and February 2017. We critically appraised the quality of budget impact analyses, and assessed the extension of cost-effectiveness analyses to provide useful budget impact information. Six budget impact analyses and 60 cost-effectiveness analyses were identified. Budget impact analyses adhered to most International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research recommendations, with key exceptions being provision of undiscounted financial streams for each budget period and model validation. Most cost-effectiveness analyses could not be extended to provide useful budget impact information; cost-effectiveness analyses also rarely presented undiscounted annual costs, or estimated financial streams during the first years of programme scale-up. Cost-effectiveness analyses vastly outnumber budget impact analyses of rotavirus vaccination, despite both being critical for policy decision making. Straightforward changes to the presentation of cost-effectiveness analyses results could facilitate their adaptation into budget impact analyses.","[Carvalho, Natalie] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Dis Grp, Ctr Hlth Policy & Global Burden, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Jit, Mark] Publ Hlth England, Modelling & Econ Unit, London, England; [Cox, Sarah] WHO, Program Appl Vaccine Experiences Scholar, Initiat Vaccine Res, Geneva, Switzerland; [Yoong, Joanne] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Hosp Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Hutubessy, Raymond C.

The electoral cycles have proved to be stronger in non-OECD countries, in countries with less frequent elections, with lower levels of income and human development, in presidential and non-plurality systems and in proportional representation regimes.","[Castro, Vitor] Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Castro, Vitor] Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Braga, Portugal; [Martins, Rodrigo] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal; [Martins, Rodrigo] Univ Coimbra, Grp Monetary & Fiscal Studies GEMF, Coimbra, Portugal",Loughborough University; Universidade do Minho; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Castro, V (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",V.M.Q.Castro@lboro.ac.uk,"Martins, Rodrigo/AIC-5971-2022; Castro, Vitor/D-3812-2018","Martins, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0340-5495;",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal) [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal) [SFRH/BSAB/113588/2015].,,63,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This country represents a critical case for such research because it is one of the most open economies in the world; by several measures it is the most open economy in the EU, with the most Eurocentric trade, and has maintained one of the best growth performances within the EU over a sustained period of time. In contrast to most contributions to the trade-growth literature, we analyse all six possible causal relationships between Slovakia's exports, imports and growth, using the technique developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), on quarterly data from 1997Q1 to 2014Q4. We find evidence supporting both the export-led-growth hypothesis and the import-led-growth hypothesis.

The main insight is that in general it is optimal to diversify the composition of the teams, ruling out positive assortative matching. This diversification leads to negative assortative matching when teams consist of pairs of experts. And when experts' signals are conditionally independent, all teams have similar precision. We also show that if we allow experts to join multiple teams, then it is optimal to allocate them equally across all teams.

Algorithms, 2001, 26, 77-92; The Gibbs Phenomenon in Various Representations and Applications, 2011], to price European-type options in Levy and affine processes. The motivation behind this application is to reduce the inefficiency of current Fourier techniques when they are used to approximate piecewise continuous (non-smooth) probability density functions. When techniques such as fast Fourier transforms and Fourier series are applied to price and hedge options with non-smooth probability density functions, they cause the Gibbs phenomenon; accordingly, the techniques converge slowly for density functions with jumps in value or derivatives. This seriously adversely affects the efficiency and accuracy of these techniques. In this paper, we derive pricing formulae and their option Greeks using the SFP method to resolve the Gibbs phenomenon and restore the global spectral convergence rate. Moreover, we show that our method requires a small number of terms to yield fast error convergence, and it is able to accurately price any European-type option deep in/out of the money and with very long/short maturities. Furthermore, we conduct an error-bound analysis of the SFP method in option pricing. This new method performs favourably in numerical experiments compared with existing techniques.","[Chan, Tat Lung (Ron)] Univ East London, Dept Business, Water Lane, Stratford E15 4LZ, England",,"Chan, TL (通讯作者)，Univ East London, Dept Business, Water Lane, Stratford E15 4LZ, England.",t.l.chan@uel.ac.uk,,"Chan, Tat Lung/0000-0002-4048-6370",,,,,38,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We document differences in the distribution of female autonomy in India (using the National Family Health Survey 2005-2006) addressing two methodological challenges: the multidimensional nature of the concept and its frequent measurement with ordinal variables (which are not amenable to direct comparisons of social averages). We tackle these challenges with three methods based on stochastic dominance techniques suited for ordinal and dichotomous variables. Whenever these dominance conditions hold for a pairwise comparison, we can conclude that the multidimensional autonomy distribution in one state is more desirable than in another one across a broad range of criteria for the individual and social welfare evaluation of autonomy. Consistently across the three methods, we find that most of the states with better autonomy distributions (in pairwise comparisons) come from the north east and the south, whereas most of the states with worse autonomy distributions come from the north.","[Chaudhuri, Kausik; Yalonetzky, Gaston] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Yalonetzky, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England.",G.Yalonetzky@leeds.ac.uk,,"Yalonetzky, Gaston/0000-0003-2438-0223; Chaudhuri, Kausik/0000-0002-7492-1369",,,,,27,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Since we work with simulated data, we are able to measure the performance of model selection by the success rate of the IC in selecting the model that was used to generate the data. In particular, we are interested in the relation between correct model selection and underlying sample size. The analysis includes realistic sample sizes and parameter sets from recent literature where parameters were estimated using empirical financial intra-day data.

In this modeling framework, the coefficients of the HAR are allowed to be time-varying with unspecified functional forms. The local linear method with the cross-validation (CV) bandwidth selection is applied to estimate the time-varying coefficient HAR (TVC-HAR) model, and a bootstrap method is used to construct the point-wise confidence bands for the coefficient functions. Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of the proposed local linear estimators of the TVC-HAR model is established under some mild conditions. The results of the simulation study show that the local linear estimator with CV bandwidth selection has favorable finite sample properties. The outcomes of the conditional predictive ability test indicate that the proposed nonparametric TVC-HAR model outperforms the parametric HAR and its extension to HAR with jumps and/or GARCH in terms of multi-step out-of-sample forecasting, in particular in the post-2003 crisis and 2007 global financial crisis (GFC) periods, during which financial market volatilities were unduly high.","[Chen, Xiangjin B.; Gao, Jiti; Silvapulle, Param] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Li, Degui] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Monash University; University of York - UK,"Chen, XJB (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",bruce.chen@buseco.monash.edu.au; jiti.Gao@monash.edu; degui.li@york.ac.uk; param.silvapulle@monash.edu,,"Li, Degui/0000-0001-6802-308X; Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021","Australian Research Council Discovery Grants Program [DP1314229, DP150101012]",Australian Research Council Discovery Grants Program(Australian Research Council),"The authors are grateful to the co-editor-professor Rong Chen, an associate editor, and two referees for their helpful comments that greatly improved the original version of the article.

In 2 experiments using national online panels, they test whether revising stock market expectation questions to reduce their difficulty affects respondents' (1) survey experience, as measured by percent of missing answers and ratings of question clarity and difficulty, and (2) response validity, as assessed by respondents' confidence in their answer and comparisons between expectations and stock market outcomes. In both studies, the authors' revisions improved survey experience. Unfortunately, revisions also decreased the perceived (Study 1) and actual (Study 2) validity of responses. The authors discuss implications of question revisions for the design of economic surveys.","[Chin, Alycia] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC USA; [de Bruin, Wandi Bruine] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Chin, A (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",alycia.chin@cfpb.gov,"Chin, Alycia/I-9898-2019; BRUINE DE BRUIN, Wandi/N-8588-2018","Chin, Alycia/0000-0002-9570-0549; BRUINE DE BRUIN, Wandi/0000-0002-1601-789X","National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health [P01 AG026571, R01 AG020717, R01 AG020638]",National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health [P01 AG026571; R01 AG020717; R01 AG020638].,,40,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

B.",,,Sequentially testing polynomial model hypotheses using power transforms of regressors,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NUISANCE PARAMETER,"We provide a methodology for testing a polynomial model hypothesis by generalizing the approach and results of Baek, Cho, and Phillips (Journal of Econometrics, 2015, 187, 376-384; BCP), which test for neglected nonlinearity using power transforms of regressors against arbitrary nonlinearity. We use the BCP quasi-likelihood ratio test and deal with the new multifold identification problem that arises under the null of the polynomial model. The approach leads to convenient asymptotic theory for inference, has omnibus power against general nonlinear alternatives, and allows estimation of an unknown polynomial degree in a model by way of sequential testing, a technique that is useful in the application of sieve approximations. Simulations show good performance in the sequential test procedure in both identifying and estimating unknown polynomial order. The approach, which can be used empirically to test for misspecification, is applied to a Mincer (Journal of Political Economy, 1958, 66, 281-302; Schooling, Experience and Earnings, Columbia University Press, 1974) equation using data from Card (in Christofides, Grant, and Swidinsky (Eds.), Aspects of Labour Market Behaviour: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp, University of Toronto Press, 1995, 201-222) and Bierens and Ginther (Empirical Economics, 2001, 26, 307-324). The results confirm that the standard Mincer log earnings equation is readily shown to be misspecified. The applications consider different datasets and examine the impact of nonlinear effects of experience and schooling on earnings, allowing for flexibility in the respective polynomial representations.","[Cho, Jin Seo] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonse Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Cho, Jin Seo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Phillips, Peter C.

Following the work of Pollard (1980), our approach uses a Cramer-von Mises minimum distance estimator for parameter estimation. The asymptotic null distribution of the resulting test statistic is represented by invariance principle arguments as a functional of a Brownian bridge in a simple regression format for which asymptotic critical values are readily delivered by simulations. Asymptotic power is examined under fixed and local alternatives and finite sample performance of the test is evaluated in simulations. The test is applied to measure top income shares using Korean income tax return data over 2007-2012. When the data relate to estimating the upper 0.1% or higher income shares, the conventional assumption of a Pareto tail distribution cannot be rejected. But the Pareto tail hypothesis is rejected for estimating the top 1.0% or 0.5% income shares at the 5% significance level.

The test relies on a new characterization of equality between two k dimensional symmetric positive-definite matrices A and B: the traces of AB-1 and BA-1 are equal to k if and only if A = B. Using this simple criterion, we introduce a class of omnibus test statistics for equality and examine their null and local alternative approximations under some mild regularity conditions. A preferred test in the class with good omni-directional power is recommended for practical work. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to explore performance characteristics under the null and local as well as fixed alternatives. The test is applicable in many settings, including GMM estimation, SVAR models and high dimensional variance matrix settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recent empirical findings show that binding term limits invalidate this result: democratic dyads in which at least one country imposes term limits on the executive are as conflict prone as autocratic and mixed dyads. Moreover, in democracies with two-term limits conflicts are more likely during the executive's second term. To rationalize these findings, we model international relations as a repeated prisoners' dilemma. We show that the fear of losing office makes democratic leaders less willing to start costly conflicts. Crucially, this discipline effect can only be at work if incumbent leaders can run for re-election. Term limits thus make it harder to sustain peaceful relations.","[Conconi, Paola] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP 114,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Conconi, Paola; Sahuguet, Nicolas] CEPR, London, England; [Conconi, Paola] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Sahuguet, Nicolas] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zanardi, Maurizio] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Lancaster, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Lancaster University,"Conconi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP 114,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",,,"Zanardi, Maurizio/0000-0003-1713-1034",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,0,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

This study investigated the broader fiscal costs and benefits of curative interventions for chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) that allow individuals to avoid long-term HCV attributed health conditions. Methods: A prospective cohort model, assessing the long-term fiscal consequences of policy decisions, was developed for HCV infected individuals, following the generational accounting analytic framework that combines age-specific lifetime gross taxes paid and governmental transfers received (i.e. healthcare and social support costs). The analysis assessed the burden of a theoretical cohort of untreated HCV infected patients with the alternative of treating these patients with a highly efficacious curative intervention (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir [LDV/SOF]). It also compared treating patients at all fibrosis stages (Stages F0-F4) compared to late treatment (Stage F4). Results: Based on projected lifetime work activity and taxes paid, the treated cohort paid an additional 5,900 pound per patient compared to the untreated cohort. Lifetime government disability costs of 97,555 pound and 125,359 pound per patient for treated cohort vs no treatment cohort were estimated, respectively. Lifetime direct healthcare costs in the treated cohort were 32,235 pound, compared to non-treated cohort of 26,424 pound, with an incremental healthcare costs increase of 5,901 pound per patient. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) of total government benefits and savings relative to government treatment costs (including LDV/SOF) ranged from 1.8-5.6. Treating patients early resulted in 77% less disability costs, 43% lower healthcare costs, and 33% higher tax revenue. Conclusion: The ability to cure Hepatitis C offers considerable fiscal benefits beyond direct medical costs and savings attributed to reduced disability costs, public allowances, and improved tax revenue. Changes in parameters, such as productivity, wage growth, and tax rates, can influence the conclusions described here.","[Connolly, Mark P.; Kotsopoulos, Nikos] Global Market Access Solut, St Prex, Switzerland; [Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Ustianowski, Andrew] North Manchester Gen Hosp, Reg Infect Dis Unit, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Groningen,"Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.connolly@rug.nl,,"KOTSOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-8248-7697; Ustianowski, Andrew/0000-0002-6134-7855",Gilead Sciences,Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences),A research grant was provided by Gilead Sciences for conducting the work described here.,,32,9,9,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The goal of this paper is to disentangle the supply- and demand-driven sources of this home market advantage. While trade costs, foreign production costs, and taste heterogeneity all matter for market outcomes, we find that a preference for home brands is the single most important driver of home market advantage even after controlling for brand histories and dealer networks. Furthermore, we also find that consumers favor domestically producing brands even if these brands originated from a foreign country. Therefore, our results suggest a novel demand effect of FDI: Establishing local production increases demand for the brand even in the absence of any cost savings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

These initiatives worked with existing British policy, and structural biases, to exacerbate the already bifurcated structure of UK capitalism - between the high-paid technology and financial services sector on the one hand, and low-cost, low-wage sectors on the other hand. In particular, and central to the argument of this paper, immigration from Eastern and Central Europe after 2004 helped to sustain low-cost manufacturing and services industries by undermining firms' incentives to invest in training. This combined with endemic failures in the UK's skills system, which is heavily geared towards producing graduates with general skills but neglects the needs of mid and lower segments of the labour market. EU integration, therefore, exacerbated cleavages over skills between high- and low-productivity sectors and may have contributed to social divisions that led to Brexit.","[Coulter, Steve] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Coulter, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England.",S.Coulter1@lse.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023",,,,,,73,6,6,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The UK government has been an active supporter of loan guarantees since 1981, and has a long track record of modifying its scheme to reflect changing market conditions and the financing needs of its SME sector. Arguably the two most significant changes occurred in 2008 when the 5-Year Rule on eligibility was removed and in 2009 when the long-standing Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme was replaced by the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme. We treat the removal of the 5-Year Rule as a natural policy experiment and empirically question whether, on economic grounds, this was a sensible policy. Our findings suggest that the 5-Year Rule was a better policy choice with regard to employment but had no impact on sales growth.","[Cowling, Marc] Univ Brighton, Brighton Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Robson, Paul] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, London, England; [Stone, Ian] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England; [Allinson, Gordon] Univ Durham, St Chads Coll, Durham, England",University of Brighton; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Durham University; Durham University,"Robson, P (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, London, England.",Paul.Robson@rhul.ac.uk,"Robson, Paula J/Q-3351-2017","Cowling, Marc/0000-0001-5731-8712; Allinson, Gordon/0000-0003-4303-7965; Robson, Paul/0000-0001-9256-1646",,,,,48,14,14,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Interestingly, the well-established, and negative, firm age-growth relationship still holds, but entrepreneurial experience did not have any substantive effects on small business performance. Our findings suggest that the severity of the crisis meant that previous entrepreneur experiences had little value in this unique and uncertain environment.

Extending theories about searching for innovation, we examine the effectiveness of different combinations of knowledge sources for achieving innovative performance. We suggest that combinations involving integrative search strategies - combining internal and external knowledge - are the most likely to generate product and process innovation. In this context, we present the idea that cognitively distant knowledge sources are helpful for innovation only when used in conjunction with knowledge sources that are closer to the focal firm. We also find important differences between product and process innovation, with the former associated with broader searches than the latter. Using a large-scale pooled sample of UK firms, we find overall support for our conjectures, particularly in terms of product innovation.","[Criscuolo, Paola] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London, England; [Laursen, Keld] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Reichstein, Toke] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Strateg Management & Globalizat, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Salter, Ammon] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",Imperial College London; Copenhagen Business School; Copenhagen Business School; University of Bath,"Criscuolo, P (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London, England.",p.criscuolo@imperial.ac.uk,"Salter, Ammon/A-9217-2010; Laursen, Keld/A-3441-2009","Laursen, Keld/0000-0002-2763-3989; Criscuolo, Paola/0000-0002-0365-6975; Reichstein, Toke/0000-0002-1836-8802","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's IMRC at Imperial College London [EP/F036930/1]; UK Innovation Research Centre [RES-598-28-0001]; ESRC; NESTA; Innovate UK; Department of Business, Innovation and Skills","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's IMRC at Imperial College London; UK Innovation Research Centre; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NESTA; Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); Department of Business, Innovation and Skills","Paola Criscuolo, Ammon Salter, and Toke Reichstein are grateful to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's IMRC at Imperial College London for financial support (EP/F036930/1).

The model allows us to construct counterfactual scenarios which overcome problems of self-selection in the data. Some of the findings provide support for the traditional patterns previously found in the innovation literature, in which innovation efforts and investments in physical and human capital are found to be important for product and process innovations in manufacturing and service firms and across economy types.

We extend a model from Buffa, Vayanos and Woolley (2014) by allowing general contracts, and by allowing the portfolio manager to invest privately in individual risky assets or the index. To alleviate the effect of moral hazard, Agent is optimally compensated by benchmarking to the index, which, however, may incentivize him to be too much of a closet indexer. To counter those incentives, the optimal contract rewards Agent for taking specific risk of individual assets in excess of the systematic risk of the index, by rewarding the deviation between the portfolio return and the return of an index portfolio, and the deviation's quadratic variation.

While these programs typically work with a limited group of beneficiaries, little is known about the potential community impact beyond these beneficiaries. To investigate this, we empirically analyze how cooperative behavior develops in a lab-in-the-field experiment with mixed groups of CDR program beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, organized in 42 municipalities in Colombia with active CDR programs. In the experiment, we use two rounds of a binary public goods game with a communication stage between both rounds. The experimental data are complemented with information on pre-existing social proximity among the participants and whether they have participated in a CDR program. We find that cooperation increases after communication, and that it correlates positively with the proportion of cooperators before communication. This peer effect is mainly driven by the cooperative behavior of CDR program beneficiaries while the influence of non-beneficiaries is limited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The mission of marketers is increasingly difficult because they have to develop a marketing mix able to target efficiently all customers, invoking satisfaction and loyal behavior. Communication strategy therefore has a special role to play. While Millennials are easier to target, persuade even influence through social media, Gen Xers are more conservative, preferring to look for additional information about products and companies themselves, which makes the marketer's job even more difficult. Nowadays, social media plays an increasingly important part in influencing consumers and their consumption behavior. Being able to expand beyond geographical borders, social media creates strong links between consumers in different states and social environments. Research conducted among Gen Xers and Millennials shows that whenever they choose food products and tourist services based on recommendations and the information available on social media, their purchasing behavior depends on their own personal desire to become informed, and the characteristics they expect from a piece of information and from the Internet as a general source of information. Given this, companies changed and adapted their communication strategies in order to be more present online. In addition, for those interested, companies create official pages that can represent a strong support for those interested in acquiring information. Quite often, consumers have the possibility to compare goods and services before buying, minimizing the risks attached to these acquisitions. The results reveal that Millennials have stronger affinity with, and place greater reliance upon online information than Gen Xers. From a managerial perspective, this paper provides retailers with the opportunity to better understand the behavior of customers of different ages, making their targeting more successful.","[Dabija, Dan-Cristian; Bejan, Brindu.

CDS markets lead to more liquidations, but they also reduce the probability of costly debt renegotiation and reduce costly equity financing. After calibrating the model, we find that firm value increases by 2.9% on average with the introduction of a CDS market. Firms also invest more and increase leverage.

The informal status of many firms substantially reduces the tax basis and therefore impacts the provision of public goods. The literature on encouraging formalisation has predominantly focused on reducing the direct costs of formalisation and has found negligible impacts of such policies. In this paper, we focus on a stick intervention, which to the best of our knowledge is the first one in a developing country setting that deals with the most direct and dominant form of informality, that is registration with the tax authority with a direct link to the country's potential revenue base and thus public goods provision. We implement an experiment in which randomly selected firms are visited by tax representatives who deliver an official letter from the Bangladesh National Tax Authority stating that the firm is not registered and the consequential punishment if the firm fails to register. We find that the intervention increases the rate of registration among treated firms, while firms located in the same market but not treated do not seem to respond significantly. We also find that only larger revenue firms at baseline respond to the threat and register. Our findings have at least two important policy implications: i) the enforcement angle, which could be an important tool to encourage formalisation; and ii) targeting of government resources for formalisation to high-end informal firms. The effects are generally small in levels and this leaves open the question of why many firms still do not register.","[De Giorgi, Giacomo] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, Washington, DC USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats Markets, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Org & Voting Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Innovat Poverty Act, Cambridge, MA USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Ploenzke, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rahman, Aminur] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA",Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Harvard University; The World Bank,"De Giorgi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, GSEM, Blvd du Pont dArve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",giacomo.degiorgi@gmail.com,,,PEDL Initiative [SEED Grant] [168],PEDL Initiative [SEED Grant],This work was supported by the PEDL Initiative [partial funding under the SEED Grant #168].,,31,14,14,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Here, the large number of risk factors rules out traditional PDE-based techniques and allows only a relatively small number of paths for nested Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in large variances of estimators in practice. We propose a novel approach based on Kolmogorov forward and backward PDEs, where we counter the high dimensionality by a generalization of anchored-ANOVA decompositions. By computing only the most significant terms in the decomposition, the dimensionality is reduced effectively, such that a significant computational speed-up arises from the high accuracy of PDE schemes in low dimensions compared to Monte Carlo estimation. Moreover, we show how this truncated decomposition can be used as control variate for the full high-dimensional model, such that any approximation errors can be corrected while a substantial variance reduction is achieved compared to the standard simulation approach. We investigate the accuracy for a realistic portfolio of exchange options, interest rate and cross-currency swaps under a fully calibrated 10-factor model.","[de Graaf, C. S.

Network formation models present difficulties for identification, especially when links can be interdependent, for example, when indirect connections matter. We show how one can use the observed proportions of various local network structures to learn about the underlying preference parameters. The key assumption for our approach restricts individuals to have bounded degree in equilibrium, implying a finite number of payoff-relevant local structures. Our main result provides necessary conditions for parameters to belong to the identified set. We then develop a quadratic programming algorithm that can be used to construct this set. With further restrictions on preferences, we show that our conditions are also sufficient for pairwise stability and therefore characterize the identified set precisely. Overall, the use of both the economic model along with pairwise stability allows us to obtain effective dimension reduction.","[de Paula, Aureo] UCL, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth; Tamer, Elie] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; University College London; Lehigh University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"de Paula, A (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",apaula@ucl.ac.uk; sethrs@lehigh.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448","NSF [SES-1123990]; ERC [338187]; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice [RES-589-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1, ES/I034021/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [338187] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor and five anonymous referees, along with seminar and conference participants at the Conference on Econometric Analysis of Social Interactions at Northwestern University (2010), the ASSA meetings in Chicago (2012), University of Western Ontario (2013), the Stats in Paris: Statistics and Econometrics of Networks (2013) conference, the Recent Advances in Set Identification (2013) conference, the 2nd European Meeting of Network Economics (2014), Heinz College (2015), the INET Econometrics of Networks Workshop at Cambridge University (2015), the Cowles Foundation (2015), Northwestern University (2015), the Chicago Fed (2015), the Econometric Society World Congress (2015), the USC Dornsife INET Conference on Networks (2015), the New York Fed (2016), the University of Pennsylvania (2016), Surrey (2016), Groningen (2016), the Tinbergen Institute (2016), Harvard (2016), Rutgers (2016), and Virginia (2016) for suggestions and comments.

Eight SAARC members and eight observed countries, including the EU, are analysed in capturing the trade effect of observed economies on intra-regional trade in SAARC. This article provides an empirical measure of observers' trade, FDI and Official development assistance (ODA) with SAARC if the exports and imports of observers to/from SAARC have positive or negative signs for intra-regional exports and imports. The results show that the exports and imports of observers to SAARC members have positive effects on bilateral exports among the members. The FDI of observers reduces the bilateral intra-imports in SAARC and ODA also has a negative effect on bilateral exports among the members. These results imply that the imports by SAARC members from observer countries increase intra-regional trade in the region. The FDI and ODA increase and decrease intra-regional trade in SAARC, respectively, implying that the policies for both FDI inflow from observers and efficient aid management are needed to increase regional welfare. The study also recommends that trade between SAARC members and its observers help to increase intra-regional trade in SAARC.","[De Silva, Dakshina G.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England; [Lee, Soon-Cheul] Busan Univ Foreign Studies, Busan, South Korea",Lancaster University; Pusan University Foreign Studies,"Lee, SC (通讯作者)，Busan Univ Foreign Studies, Busan, South Korea.",sclee@bufs.ac.kr,,"LEE, Soon-Cheul/0000-0001-5840-6167; De Silva, Dakshina/0000-0001-8820-1955",,,,,24,1,1,5,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These roles are studied by comparing LGAs in England, Germany and the Netherlands.","[de Widt, Dennis] Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Laffin, Martin] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England",Cardiff University; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"de Widt, D (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",dewidtd@cardiff.ac.uk; m.laffin@qmul.ac.uk,,"De Widt, Dennis/0000-0002-7299-5663",,,,,47,7,7,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Our main theorem is a sampling theorem, similar to those that have been proved for approximate equilibria in normal form games. It states that if an ETR problem has an exact solution, then it has a k-uniform approximate solution, where k depends on various properties of the formula. A consequence of our theorem is that we obtain a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for a fragment of constrained epsilon-ETR.

This paper shows how channels of transmission matter for productivity spillovers from FDI by providing more fuller and nuanced picture of the effects. We analyse a panel of eight sub-Saharan Africa countries spanning the period 2006-2014 and demonstrate the empirical relevance of distinguishing three channels-demonstration, labour mobility, and competition. We provide measures of these effects and also show that the size, significance, and sign of spillover effects depend on the local absorptive capacity, technology levels, geographical proximity, and foreign ownership structure. Overall, results suggest that demonstration spillovers are large and economically significant, whereas the patterns of labour mobility and competition spillovers are not stable across the various specifications and measures. Finally, the analysis involves several measures of further investigations and robustness checks. Results are robust to the construction of spillover and outcome variables, the introduction of additional explanatory variables and an alternative estimation method.","[Demena, Binyam Afewerk; Murshed, Syed Mansoob] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Dev Econ, The Hague, Netherlands; [Murshed, Syed Mansoob] Coventry Univ, Econ Finance & Accounting, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Coventry University,"Demena, BA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Dev Econ, The Hague, Netherlands.",demena@iss.nl,"Demena, Binyam Afewerk/AAF-6961-2021; Murshed, Syed Mansoob/AAY-3622-2020","Demena, Binyam Afewerk/0000-0002-9059-5364; Murshed, Syed Mansoob/0000-0002-8360-033X",,,,,70,23,25,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Promoting international trade in clean energy products (e.g. wind turbines, solar panels) can make an important contribution to this end through business and market expansion effects. If ratified, the landmark Paris COP21 Agreement will commit states to firmer climate actions, this necessarily requiring them to strengthen their promotion of clean energy technologies. Well over a hundred countries already have active policies in this area, many including industrial policy measures that impact on the international competitiveness of their clean energy sector. At the same time, governments have gradually liberalised their clean energy trade regimes, and large producers are negotiating an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). Clean energy trade is expanding and disputes among nations in this sector are growing. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) still has limited policy space' for climate action. Meanwhile, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) still had narrow and infrequent connections with trade matters. Moreover, WTO-UNFCCC engagement on trade-climate issues overall has been largely confined to information sharing and secretariat-level dialogue. This paper explores the extent to which clean energy trade is currently governed, where certain governance gaps and deficiencies exists, and argues why addressing them could help expand trade in clean energy products. It also contends that the most fundamental challenge for the future governance of clean energy trade concerns how to reconcile ramped-up interventionist climate action with an essentially liberal trade order.","[Dent, Christopher M.] Univ Leeds, East Asian Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Dent, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, East Asian Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",c.m.dent@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,93,4,5,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The argument builds on the position that although world-city network analysis deals with a very specific process both functionally and temporally, it can nonetheless be interpreted as a particular example of a generic practice of inter-city relations. Conceptually, this is achieved through discussions about the notion of central flow theory' and the position of the model in quantitative research on city networks. Empirically, this achieved through a comparison of connectivities of cities created by producer services firms, non-governmental organizations, maritime-producer services firms and global media firms. These multiple analyses represent a decomposition of the current global expression of central flow theory, and examining parallels and differences between these networks allows the stress testing of the model's more generic potential for assessing the increased salience of flows for cities across the world economy. Drawing on the observation that various cities are placed on and off the map' in relation to their specific interlocking to the world economy, we engage with two important critiques of the relevance of this research for understanding cities in globalization, i.e., the post-colonial critique formulated by Jennifer Robinson in 2002 and a denunciation for missing out the state by Goran Therborn in 2011. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ways in which our conceptual modelling and results might begin to be theoretically integrated into a wider theoretical framework centred on central flow theory'.","[Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Taylor, Peter J.] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Ghent University; Northumbria University,"Derudder, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium.",ben.derudder@ugent.be; crogfam@gmail.com,"Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020; Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008","Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544",,,,,64,92,107,18,116,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The aim of this study is to produce a value set to support use of EQ-5D-5L data in decision-making. The study design followed an international research protocol. Randomly selected members of the English general public completed 10 time trade-off and 7 discrete choice experiment tasks in face-to-face interviews. A 20-parameter hybrid model was used to combine time trade-off and discrete choice experiment data to generate values for the 3,125 EQ-5D-5L health states. Valuation data are available for 996 respondents. Face validity of the data has been demonstrated, with more severe health states generally given lower values. Problems with pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression received the greatest weight. Compared to the existing EQ-5D-3L value set, there are considerably fewer worse than dead states (5.1%, compared with over one third), and the minimum value is higher. Values range from -0.285 (extreme problems on all dimensions) to 0.950 (for health states 11211 and 21111). Results have important implications for users of the EQ-5D-5L both in England and internationally.

Focal organisations by definition have considerable power in these systems. We combine insights from the innovation studies literature with the sustainable/green supply chain literature to explore how focal organisations exercise this power in pursuit of system-wide sustainability. Through a case study of the milk CPS in the UK, we illustrate different strategies of the focal organisations to stimulate incremental eco-innovation along existing trajectories. We also show how, despite focal organisation support, radical eco-innovation is inhibited by inherent path dependencies and other institutional dimensions of the CPS. By demonstrating the complementarities of positioning the case study findings within two synergistic literatures, this paper contributes theoretically by extending and elaborating eco-innovation studies. It also has a practical utility for policy makers seeking to chart a path to more sustainable CPS by relying on focal organisations. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In other words, what is the 'climate beta'? In this paper we argue using a combination of theory and integrated assessment modelling that the climate beta is positive and close to unity for maturities of up to about one hundred years. This is because the positive effect on the climate beta of uncertainty about exogenous, emissions-neutral technological progress overwhelms the negative effect on the climate beta of uncertainty about the carbon-climate-response, particularly the climate sensitivity, and the damage intensity of warming. Mitigating climate change therefore has no insurance value to hedge the aggregate consumption risk borne by future generations. On the contrary, it increases that risk, which justifies a relatively high discount rate on the expected benefits of emissions reductions. However, the stream of undiscounted expected benefits is also increasing in the climate beta, and this dominates the discounting effect so that overall the net present value of carbon emissions abatement is increasing in the climate beta.

While improving household welfare, formal access to finance increases inter-household inequalities, despite ameliorating the inequality enhancing effect of urban residence and enhancing the inequality ameliorating effect of greater educational attainment. The positive effect of access to formal finance on inequality is smaller than the effect of unobserved household characteristics, indicating that welfare and equality enhancing strategies should follow a holistic approach as opposed to one focusing on one isolated policy variable at a time.","[Dimova, Ralitza; Adebowale, Olabimtan] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Dimova, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Ralitza.Dimova@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,17,18,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Addressing difficulties that the European banking sector struggled during and after the global financial crisis (GFC), the purpose of this paper is to raise important questions about the sustainability of the sector and offers competitive strategy formulations for European policy makers. Empirical findings are accomplished by applying a three phase analysis of SWOT, an integrated model of DEMATEL-ANP (DANP), and fuzzy TOPSIS. Empirical findings from the SWOT analysis suggest a total of twelve factors, which are then incorporated to formulate four strategies. The DANP results illustrate that opportunities dimension has the highest impact and strengths has the lowest among others. The fuzzy TOPSIS results demonstrate that the European Banking Union (EBU) is expected to remove divergence in the Euro area banking sector is the most important strategy, whilst the non-risk based leverage ratio (LR) requirement by Basel III has the weakest importance among the strategy preferences.","[Dincer, Hasan; Hacioglu, Umit] Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Business & Management, TR-34810 Istanbul, Turkey; [Akdeniz, Ozlem Olgu] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",Istanbul Medipol University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Dinçer, H (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medipol Univ, Sch Business & Management, TR-34810 Istanbul, Turkey.",hdincer@medipol.edu.tr; o.olgu.akdeniz@mmu.ac.uk; uhacioglu@medipol.edu.tr,"Dincer, Hasan/GPX-1316-2022; Hacioglu, Umit/O-4311-2015; Hacioglu, Umit/ABE-4247-2020; Yüksel, Serhat/W-1689-2017","Dincer, Hasan/0000-0002-8072-031X; Yüksel, Serhat/0000-0002-9858-1266",,,,,122,2,3,1,18,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We show with an illustration that our proposed practical algorithm reproduces the theoretical results after a savings period of around 30 years by using daily, monthly, weekly or yearly updates of the investment positions. We calculate the percentiles of the final accumulated wealth distribution for the adjusted implementation. In the simulated illustration, we observe that the adjusted values converge to the theoretical values of the percentiles when the frequency of update increases. We conclude that monthly adjustments result in a practical way to implement theoretical results that were obtained under the hypothesis of a continuous process by Donnelly et al. (2015).

We analyse two alternative policy-decision schemes-'decentralization' and 'centralization'- within a two-sided incomplete information principal-agent framework. The quality of communication depends on the conflict of interests between the government levels and on which government level controls the degree of decentralization. We show that the extent of misaligned interests and the relative importance of local and central government knowledge affect the optimal choice of policy-decision schemes. Our empirical analysis confirms that countries' choices depend on the relative importance of private information.

Based on a model that accounts for a subsistence requirement in the consumption of ecosystem services, we provide empirical evidence on substitution elasticities. We find an initial mean elasticity of substitution of two, which declines over time towards complementarity. We subsequently extend the theory of dual discounting by introducing a subsistence requirement. The relative price of ecosystem services is non-constant and grows without bound as the consumption of ecosystem services declines towards the subsistence level. An application suggests that the initial discount rate for ecosystem services is more than a percentage-point lower as compared to manufactured goods. This difference increases by a further half percentage-point over a 300-year time horizon. The results underscore the importance of considering limited substitutability in long-term public project appraisal.","[Drupp, Moritz A.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton, England",University of Kiel; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Drupp, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.;Drupp, MA (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton, England.",Drupp@economics.uni-kiel.de,,"Drupp, Moritz/0000-0001-8981-0496",German National Academic Foundation; DAAD; BMBF [01LA1104C],German National Academic Foundation; DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"I am very grateful to Stefan Baumgartner, Ben Groom and Martin Quaas for their support.

This study adds to the literature by investigating whether race can moderate the relationship between age and labour market outcomes. The results suggest that older people are penalized in the labour market. They have lower access to vacancies and sorting in lower-paid jobs. A minority racial background exacerbates both penalties.

Our iterative estimation approach explicitly analyses the role of time in price determination.

We simulate the impact of a ban and show that the potential health benefits are partially offset by firms lowering prices and by consumer switching to other junk foods.","[Dubois, Pierre] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Griffith, Rachel; O'Connell, Martin] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Griffith, Rachel] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Manchester,"Griffith, R (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Griffith, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",rgriffith@ifs.org.uk,"Griffith, Rachel S/A-2583-2009; Dubois, Pierre/R-8768-2019","Griffith, Rachel S/0000-0002-8616-5820; Dubois, Pierre/0000-0002-9077-6843","European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2009-AdG-249529, ERC-2015-AdG-694822]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) [RES-544-28-0001]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Open Research Area (ORA) [ES/I012222/1]; ANR under Open Research Area (ORA) [ANR-10-ORAR-009-01]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I012222/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/N018788/1, ES/I012222/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Open Research Area (ORA)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ANR under Open Research Area (ORA)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the European Research Council (ERC) under ERC-2009-AdG-249529 and ERC-2015-AdG-694822, from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP), grant number RES-544-28-0001 and under the Open Research Area (ORA) grant number ES/I012222/1 and from ANR under Open Research Area (ORA) grant number ANR-10-ORAR-009-01.",,71,44,47,4,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

There are inherent differences in worker ability and across-firm productivity. Two fundamental questions are whether the exact composition of skills of workers and productivity of firms affects output and how this composition determines the equilibrium allocation of workers within a firm and between firms. There has been a surge of research investigating the causes and consequences of the process of allocation of heterogeneous workers to firms. The focus in this review is on theory that sheds light on open questions in macroeconomics, labor, and industrial organization, with a particular emphasis on the role of firm size. Those models allow us to infer from the observed sorting patterns (who matches with whom) what the underlying technological determinants are and how they have evolved in recent decades. Furthermore, they help us understand the technological origins of important labor market trends, such as the increase in wage inequality and the change in labor market and firm dynamics.","[Eeckhout, Jan] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, ICREA, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Eeckhout, Jan] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England",ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University; University of London; University College London,"Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, ICREA, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England.",jan.eeckhout@upf.edu,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008",,,,,,87,11,12,1,15,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

We propose a unifying theory of production where management resolves a tradeoff between hiring more versus better workers. The span of control or size is therefore intimately intertwined with the sorting pattern. We provide a condition for sorting that captures this tradeoff between the quantity and quality of workers and that generalizes Becker's sorting condition. A system of differential equations determines the equilibrium allocation, the firm size, and wages, and allows us to characterize the allocation of the quality and quantity of labor to firms of different productivity. We show that our model nests a large number of widely used existing models. We also augment the model to incorporate labor market frictions in the presence of sorting with large firms.","[Eeckhout, Jan] UPF ICREA GSE, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Eeckhout, Jan] UCL, London, England; [Kircher, Philipp] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",ICREA; University of London; University College London; University of Edinburgh,"Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，UPF ICREA GSE, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain.;Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",jan.eeckhout@upf.edu; philipp.kircher@ed.ac.uk,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008",,"ERC [339186, 184119]; [ECO2012-36200]; ESRC [ES/L009633/1, ES/R009295/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [339186] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would like to thank numerous colleagues and seminar audiences for insightful discussions and comments, and Diego Restuccia and Tasso Adamopoulos for generously sharing their data.

Yet, expanding an intervention to a global scale, we suggest, is a significant and difficult accomplishment. In this paper we propose to explore the kind of evidential exigencies that this accomplishment involves. To do so, we focus on the field of global health and examine how child immunization against the pneumococcus bacterium has been scaled up in low-income countries. The paper first attends to initial epidemiological scrutiny that revealed the existence of a large-scale public health problem and the possibility of an expandable solution (vaccination). It then describes the set-up of a funding arrangement using overseas aid to purchase vaccine doses manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, before paying attention to various frictions that affect the widespread use of pneumococcal vaccines. In these different moments through which scalability is accomplished, always partially and temporarily, we show that a dual activity can be witnessed, a pivoting between referential work and forward projection. To conclude, we suggest that scalability is more usefully approached as a form of expansion that is always attentive to the possibilities of change.","[Ehrenstein, Vera; Neyland, Daniel] Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Ehrenstein, V (通讯作者)，Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",v.ehrenstein@gold.ac.uk; d.neyland@gold.ac.uk,,,European Research Council (ERC) [313173]; European Research Council (ERC) [313173] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),The research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) [grant no. 313173].,,59,6,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

More precisely, the paper ethnographically traces how the capacity of tropical forests to act as carbon sinks is turned into a matter of global concern. The focus is on a negotiated policy called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and its anchoring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose territory contains the second largest area of rainforest after Brazil. The paper discusses the importance of the promissory in climate actions, the multivalence of what is at stake and the porosity and resilience of national demarcation. To do so, it identifies three moments and sites of geopolitical re-composition: the formulation of international consensus, the work of preparatory agents and the quest for metrological inclusiveness. These moments and sites point to the theatricality and semi-secrecy of United Nations negotiations, the mobilizing activities of expatriate consultants hired with overseas aid funding and the unstable evidential grounds on which emission reduction efforts are based. The paper suggests that, through this series of processes, the carbon stored by tropical forests becomes a matter of global exigency.","[Ehrenstein, Vera] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Ehrenstein, V (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",v.ehrenstein@gold.ac.uk,,,European Research Council [313173]; European Research Council (ERC) [313173] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),The paper has been written thanks to a European Research Council grant [no. 313173] held by Daniel Neyland.,,62,12,12,6,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

There is now a political agreement that these emissions must decrease. So far one way forward has been to design and maintain carbon markets. As part of this process, trees in the tropics have been enrolled in peculiar transactions: actions such as reforesting a land of degraded savannah or preserving a piece of forest can produce tradable emission credits to offset against CO2 emissions in distant locations. Based on a multi-sited investigation of carbon offsetting, including fieldwork in the Congo, the paper presents a journey across different marketization sites where the enrolment of forest carbon into market exchanges can be seen to be at stake. Several operations are foregrounded, from United Nations negotiations and the measurement of carbon stocks, to business venture and legal work. The paper proposes a focus on the mundane that attends to details and frictions.

An optimally inattentive agent chooses both her coarsening and her actions by maximization of an underlying subjective expected utility preference relation, net of a cognitive cost of attention. The main result axiomatically characterizes the conditional choices of actions by an agent that are necessary and sufficient for her behavior to be seen as if it is the result of optimal inattention.

This prevents them from capturing time variation in the parameters of equilibrium asset pricing models. These problems are addressed by combining innovative procedures which allow for testing of multiple break dates on fund-specific parameters along with cross-section bootstraps that remain valid in the presence of time-varying parameters. We find that substantial proportion - 8% - of the estimated versions of the asset pricing model have significant changes in their parameters. The effects of this time variation on the cross-section distribution of the risk-adjusted performance measure are significant and substantially increase centiles of the right tail of this distribution when compared to those produced without time-varying parameters. Our evidence regarding the lack of actively managed US equity mutual funds that generate excess returns is significantly weaker than those of Fama and French but our results do not overturn their pessimistic conclusion regarding the lack of skilled managers.

We report that spatial dependence is a significant determinant of growth and conditional convergence in Vietnamese provinces. We also demonstrate that the rate of convergence decreases as the distance between neighbouring provinces increases. Given these findings, we recommend testing for spatial dependence in growth models for Vietnam and beyond to avoid omitted variable bias and inform evidence-based regional policies that take account of spatial externalities.","[Esiyok, Bulent] Baskent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Ugur, Mehmet] Univ Greenwich, Business Sch, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, London, England",Baskent University; University of Greenwich,"Esiyok, B (通讯作者)，Baskent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",besiyok@baskent.edu.tr,"EŞİYOK, BÜLENT/HTR-6588-2023; Ugur, Mehmet/AAG-5018-2019","Ugur, Mehmet/0000-0003-3891-3641; Esiyok, Bulent/0000-0001-7469-5309",,,,,27,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

In applications the focus of interest is on capturing joint tail behavior rather than a variation around the mean. Quantile and expectile regression are used here as tools of data analysis. When it comes to characterizing tail event curves one faces a dimensionality problem, which is important for CoVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) determination. A projection-based single-index model specification may come to the rescue but for ultrahigh-dimensional regressors one faces yet another dimensionality problem and needs to balance precision versus dimension. Such a balance is achieved by combining semiparametric ideas with variable selection techniques. In particular, we propose a projection-based single-index model specification for very high-dimensional regressors. This model is used for practical CoVaR estimates with a systemically chosen indicator. In simulations we demonstrate the practical side of the semiparametric CoVaR method. The application to the U.S. financial sector shows good backtesting results and indicate market coagulation before the crisis period.

The article relates this question to the historical institutionalist debate surrounding critical junctures, gradual change and the politics of stability and change. It argues that trade policy reform enacted during periods of extraordinary politics is most likely to be durable if it is associated with deeper changes in structural conditions, such as dominant ideas, interests and institutions.","[Feldmann, Magnus] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Feldmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol, Avon, England.",M.Feldmann@bristol.ac.uk,,"Feldmann, Magnus/0000-0002-8481-3193","Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University [Krupp Foundation Dissertation Research Fellowships]; Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University [Justice, Welfare and Economics research fellowship]","Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University [Krupp Foundation Dissertation Research Fellowships]; Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University [Justice, Welfare and Economics research fellowship]","This work was supported by the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University [Krupp Foundation Dissertation Research Fellowships]; Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University [Justice, Welfare and Economics research fellowship].",,78,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30,3,,,,,365,381,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1362097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14631377.2017.1362097,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000432216800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

An international protocol has been developed to guide the collection of stated preference data for this purpose and has been used to generate EQ-5D-5L valuation data for England. The aim of this paper is report the innovative methods used for modelling those data to obtain a value set. Nine hundred and ninety-six members of the English general public completed time trade-off (TTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks. We estimate models, with and without interactions, using DCE data only, TTO data only, and TTO/DCE data combined. TTO data are interpreted as both left and right censored. Heteroskedasticity and preference heterogeneity between individuals are accounted for. We use Bayesian methods in the econometric analysis. The final model is chosen based on the deviance information criterion (DIC). Censoring and taking account of heteroskedasticity have important effects on parameter estimation. For DCE data only, TTO data only, and DCE/TTO data combined, models with parameters for all dimensions and levels perform best, as judged by the DIC. Taking account of heterogeneity improves fit, and the multinomial model reports the lowest DIC. This paper presents approaches that suit observed characteristics of EQ-5D-5L valuation data and recognise respondents' preference heterogeneity. The methods described are potentially relevant to other value set studies.","[Feng, Yan; Devlin, Nancy J.; Shah, Koonal K.] Off Hlth Econ London, London, England; [Devlin, Nancy J.; Mulhern, Brendan; van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sheffield; University of Technology Sydney,"van Hout, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",b.a.vanhout@sheffield.ac.uk,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126; Devlin, Nancy/0000-0002-1561-5361; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",Department of Health Policy Research Programme National Institute for Health Research [PRP 070/0073]; EuroQol Research Foundation,Department of Health Policy Research Programme National Institute for Health Research; EuroQol Research Foundation,"Department of Health Policy Research Programme, Grant/Award Number: National Institute for Health Research PRP 070/0073; EuroQol Research Foundation",,24,54,55,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JAN,2018,27,1,,,,,23,38,,10.1002/hec.3560,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3560,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FV1VI,28833854,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000424352500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

A trading strategy that takes long positions in commodity futures with the most negative skew and shorts those with the most positive skew generates significant excess returns that remain after controlling for exposure to well-known risk factors. A tradeable skewness factor explains the cross-section of commodity futures returns beyond exposures to standard risk premia. The impact that skewness has on future returns is explained by investors' preferences for skewness under cumulative prospect theory and selective hedging practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to existing reviews on long panels, we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects are our main focuses, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p being the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.","[Fernandez-Val, Ivan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Weidner, Martin] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Weidner, Martin] Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 7AE, England",Boston University; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Fernández-Val, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ivanf@bu.edu; m.weidner@ucl.ac.uk,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016","Weidner, Martin/0000-0001-6135-6164",ESRC [ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,121,34,36,3,26,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The results are robust to different specifications of the spatial neighbours and are confirmed by a natural experiment (an earthquake in the Abruzzo region of Italy in 2009) that creates an exogenous variation in the neighbours' spending. Furthermore, there is no evidence of yardstick competition when one considers political effects, while a negative relationship is found between spatial interaction and the size of the municipality.

Focusing on the United States, the article traces the creation of an asset class derived from securitizing the rental income of foreclosed homes turned rental properties. The study strategically combines conceptual agendas often pursued separately. Theories of market formation rooted in science and technology studies inform the method of analysis so as to attend to the work of realizing markets, the role of calculative devices in market formation, and the contingent and conditional aspects of markets. This analysis reveals the single-family rental (SFR) asset class as a practical accomplishment. However, a broader framework rooted in political economy is necessary to attend to the broader significance of the SFR asset class in terms of power, politics, and the dynamics of capital accumulation. The article particularly focuses upon the historical and geographic contingencies making it possible to conceive of a large-scale SFR market, the work of state and capital market actors in reframing repossessed single-family homes as rental properties and the role calculative practices played in this process, and the strategies of issuers and credit rating agencies to frame a novel asset class for institutional investors. The SFR asset class affirms the fundamental role for housing in the ideology of capital, and speaks to new entanglements of financial actors and home life as financial accumulation is adjusted to the postcrisis context. Beyond shedding light on postcrisis housing financialization, the article demonstrates how economic geographers can carefully integrate theoretical perspectives to critically examine both the circumstances of market formation and the social, spatial, and political consequences of markets.","[Fields, Desiree] Univ Sheffield, Western Bank, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Fields, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Western Bank, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",d.fields@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Fields, Desiree/0000-0001-6959-8803",,,,,116,176,192,5,130,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

We explore the impact of gossip accuracy on trust and trustworthiness in a population playing decentralized, two-player trust games. We observed non-trivial levels of spontaneous inaccuracy in gossip, and there was evidence that this was largely due to gossipers' desire to punish untrustworthy players. Although this endogenous inaccuracy did not adversely affect levels of trust and trustworthiness, introducing high levels of exogenous inaccuracy did. Importantly though, we observed greater trust and trustworthiness when highly inaccurate gossip was present than when communication was impossible. This suggests that even inaccurate gossip induces a degree of reputational concern in gossip targets and some willingness among gossip recipients to discriminate between partners on the basis of the gossip they received. Thus, gossip need not be perfectly accurate to effectively induce cooperation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article examines the consequences that this shift has had for East African firms that are part of global value chains (GVCs). Prior work yielded contradictory expectations: firms might benefit from connectivity through increased efficiencies and improved access to markets, although they might also be further marginalized through increasing control of lead firms. Drawing on extensive qualitative research in Kenya and Rwanda, including 264 interviews, we examine 3 sectors (tea, tourism, and business process outsourcing) exploring overarching, cross-cutting themes. The findings support more pessimistic expectations: small African producers are only thinly digitally integrated in GVCs. Moreover, shifting modes of value chain governance, supported by lead firms and facilitated by digital information platforms and data standards are leading to new challenges for firms looking to digitally integrate. Nevertheless, we also find examples in these sectors of opportunities where small firms are able to cater to emerging niche customers, and local or regional markets. Overall, the study shows that improving connectivity does not inherently benefit African firms in GVCs without support for complementary capacity and competitive advantages.","[Foster, Christopher] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Mark; Friederici, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford OX1 3JS, England; [Mann, Laura] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Waema, Timothy] Univ Nairobi, Sch Comp & Informat, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Sheffield; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Nairobi,"Foster, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.",christopher.foster@sheffield.ac.uk; mark.graham@oii.ox.ac.uk; l.e.mann@lse.ac.uk; waema@uonbi.ac.ke; nicolas.friederici@oii.ox.ac.uk,"Waema, Timothy Mwololo/AAW-3446-2021","Waema, Timothy Mwololo/0000-0002-6451-0363; Graham, Mark/0000-0001-8370-9848; Foster, Christopher/0000-0001-7827-2485",ESRC; DFID; ESRC [ES/I033777/1]; ERC [335716]; [RES-167-25-0701]; European Research Council (ERC) [335716] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Alan Turing Institute [TU/B/000042] Funding Source: researchfish; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I033777/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I033777/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DFID; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Alan Turing Institute; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article was based on research funded by the ESRC and DFID.

It emphasises three aspects to a renewed focus on the agency of MNEs, namely: the importance of the variety of relationships within MNEs between parent and subsidiaries; the importance of dynamic capabilities in underpinning corporate change; and, the micropolitics of MNEs and subsidiaries which impact on firm-institutional change within regional economies. The agency exercised by MNEs in these ways influences the 'selection' of investment locations, 'coupling' processes, and the depth and pace of host territorial institutional change. In conclusion, this article argues that future research needs to place greater emphasis on the contribution of dynamics internal to the MNE to understand evolution in regional economies and GPNs.","[Fuller, Crispian] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Phelps, Nicholas A.] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 22 Gordon St, London WC1H0QB, England",Cardiff University; University of London; University College London,"Fuller, C (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",fullerc2@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,88,50,54,5,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

These are two, previously disconnected research areas. The paper explores ways in which innovation in services is increasingly becoming one of social innovation (in terms of social goals, social means, social roles and multi-agent provision) and how social innovation can be understood from a service innovation perspective. A taxonomy is proposed based on the mix between innovation nature and the locus of co-production. The paper additionally puts forward a theoretical framework for understanding social innovation in services, where the co-creation of innovation is the result of an interaction of competences and preferences of multiple providers, users/citizens, and policy-makers. This provides the basis for a discussion of key avenues for future research in theory, measurement, organisation, appropriation, performance measurement and public policy.

The M&A Index is calculated for each takeover deal and is standardized between 0 and 1. An acquisition with a higher index encompasses higher efficiency. We find that takeover bids with higher M&A Indices are more likely to succeed. Moreover, the M&A Index shows a strong and positive relation with the acquirers' post-acquisition stock performance in the short run and operating performance in the long run. After constructing three portfolios under a buy-and-hold strategy, we find that efficient portfolios with the highest indices earn higher equity returns and monthly alphas than inefficient portfolios with the lowest indices.

One overlooked area of research is the impact that cognitive impairment (an early marker of potential dementia onset) has on the healthcare utilization of an ageing population. Based on the theoretical micro-economic foundations of healthcare demand, we study the relationship between cognitive functioning and impairment, measured by word recall and changes thereof, and healthcare utilization among over 50s in nine European countries. The contribution of this article is to produce estimates for cognitive functioning and impairment, as opposed to full dementia, in the context of healthcare utilization.We apply regression models to healthcare utilization data from Waves 1, 2 and 4 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and find that recalling one additional word is associated with a reduction in visits to a medical doctor of 0.32, per year (p<0.01). Even after controlling for self-assessed health, this association is strong at just over 0.1 visits - this is the additional impact, over and above the average number of visits for similar individuals without cognitive impairment.","[Gannon, Brenda] Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Banks, James] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Banks, James] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Nazroo, James] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Sociol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Munford, Luke] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Queensland; University of Manchester; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Gannon, B (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",brenda.gannon@uq.edu.au,"Gannon, Brenda/D-2011-2017; Banks, James/C-2022-2008","Gannon, Brenda/0000-0002-3672-4030; Banks, James/0000-0002-9726-8921","Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing (MICRA); University of Manchester Research Initiative (UMRI), at University of Manchester, UK; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/N015126/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing (MICRA); University of Manchester Research Initiative (UMRI), at University of Manchester, UK; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","It is an internal grant awarded by Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing (MICRA) and University of Manchester Research Initiative (UMRI), at University of Manchester, UK.

Tacit collusion can involve price wars on the equilibrium path. Explicit collusion involves firms secretly sharing their private information to avoid such price wars, but this is illegal and runs the risk of sanctions. We find that, in contrast to the conventional wisdom but consistent with some empirical evidence, illegal cartels are least likely to arise in markets with a few symmetric firms, because tacit collusion is relatively more appealing in such markets. We discuss the implications for anti-cartel enforcement policy. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, concerns may be raised about whether the four components should be constrained to exerting the same influence in a forecasting model of household consumption. Also, in this context, it would seem to be appropriate to permit a role to other information that is obtained from the EU survey. Consequently, in this article, different regression functions are specified in order to assess whether there is any gain to be achieved in predictive accuracy from adopting a more flexible approach towards using the data from the EU questionnaire. With an emphasis upon parsimony, an econometric analysis is performed in conjunction with UK quarterly data on household consumption expenditure. For two categories of spending, it is discovered that the quality of forecasts benefits from having undertaken disaggregation involving survey data beyond those which contribute towards the calculation of the CCI. Indeed, the respective consumption variables (relating to non-durable goods and durable goods excluding vehicles) are seen to be associated with relatively volatile behaviour over the forecast interval, 2008-2013.","[Gausden, Robert] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England; [Hasan, Mohammad S.] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Portsmouth; University of Kent,"Gausden, R (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",Robert.Gausden@port.ac.uk,,"Gausden, Robert/0000-0003-2013-9504",,,,,23,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Nevertheless, there is limited evidence on their longer term costs and health benefits. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of BIs to promote physical activity in primary care and to guide future research priorities using value of information analysis. METHODS: A decision model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of three classes of BIs that have been used, or could be used, to promote physical activity in primary care: 1) pedometer interventions, 2) advice/counseling on physical activity, and (3) action planning interventions. Published risk equations and data from the available literature or routine data sources were used to inform model parameters. Uncertainty was investigated with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and value of information analysis was conducted to estimate the value of undertaking further research. RESULTS: In the base-case, pedometer interventions yielded the highest expected net benefit at a willingness to pay of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. There was, however, a great deal of decision uncertainty: the expected value of perfect information surrounding the decision problem for the National Health Service Health Check population was estimated at 1.85 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the use of pedometer BIs is the most cost-effective strategy to promote physical activity in primary care, and that there is potential value in further research into the cost-effectiveness of brief (i.e., <30 minutes) and very brief (i.e., <5 minutes) pedometer interventions in this setting.

Our theory suggests that population responses may obscure the direct connectivity effects of roads. Indeed, conditional on population size, highway density does not affect productivity in a sample of US metropolitan areas.

We consider first an AK model, and then introduce public capital. Labour supply is exogenous. We find analytically that the presence of wealth positionality always causes distortions ( although a preference for absolute wealth by itself is non-distortionary). Consumption positionality introduces a distortion only if wealth is an argument in the utility function and the marginal degree of positionality in wealth does not match that of consumption. Two corrective tax instruments, a consumption or an income tax, are required for internalization of externalities in an AK set-up; the optimal choice of public investment is an additional instrument when public capital is introduced. Numerical simulations-pointing towards high corrective tax rates and their strong impact on growth and welfare-complement the theoretical analysis.","[Ghosh, Sugata] Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Wendner, Ronald] Harvard Univ, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wendner, Ronald] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria",Brunel University; Harvard University; University of Graz,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",sugata.ghosh@brunel.ac.uk; ronald_wendner@fas.harvard.edu,"Wendner, Ronald/X-3925-2019","Wendner, Ronald/0000-0003-1938-1424",Schumpeter Gesellschaft Wien,Schumpeter Gesellschaft Wien,Financial support by the Schumpeter Gesellschaft Wien is gratefully aknowledged.,,66,3,3,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The paper sets out the potential problems as the market moves to absorb increasing amounts of wind, then characterises the nature of prices, which reveals the importance of a strategy in which power is absorbed into store for a relatively few hours of the day and discharged over a relatively few hours.

Despite the increasing significance of EM OFDI, this particular theme of EM OFDI to a DM host has received relatively little attention from researchers. This paper seeks to address this shortfall. Design/methodology/approach Considering the distinctiveness of EM OFDI in its firm-specific characteristics, given circumstances and motivations, this paper applies adapted Resource-based view (RBV) framework and institutional theory to build a theoretical framework. A range of hypotheses regarding strategic-asset seeking, market seeking and institution seeking motivations of EM OFDI, which reflect both pull factors (advantages in hosts) and push factors (disadvantages at home), were then developed. Using panel data for the years 2003-2012, the research questions were analysed using a sample of the then most important EM source countries which had undertaken Greenfield FDI into the UK. Findings The analysis results supported the hypotheses that strategic-asset seeking and institution seeking motivations were important in determining EM OFDI to the UK, with the coefficients of relevant variables showing statistical significance and expected sign (i.e. positive). However, the hypothesis on market seeking motivation of EM OFDI cannot be supported as the coefficient of the relevant variable, whilst showing the expected sign, had a statistically insignificant coefficient. Amongst the three control variables, the source countries' exports and imports as a percentage of GDP was statistically significant and had the correct sign whilst, the UK's share of intra-EU trade, whilst statistically significant, had the opposite sign to that expected. The third control variable, the exchange rate was not statistically significant, though it had the correct sign. Originality/value This paper provides an adjusted theoretical framework for the analysis of EM OFDI to DM with a novel application of institutional theory and RBV. It also qualifies and extends existing works on EM OFDI by including a wider range of EM source countries and DM hosts with empirical analysis results as well as theoretical suggestions. In addition, the paper offers up a range of policy implications for DM hosts.","[Godwin, Eun Sun] Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Business, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England; [Cook, Mark] Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England",University of Wolverhampton; University of Wolverhampton,"Godwin, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Business, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England.",E.Godwin@wlv.ac.uk; mark.cook@wlv.ac.uk,"Godwin, Eun Sun/HDN-3453-2022","Godwin, Eun Sun/0000-0001-7030-1587",,,,,84,2,3,1,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Methods: Retrospective medical chart review of characteristics, time to progression, level of response, HRU during treatment, and adverse events (AEs). Data collection started on June 1, 2015 and was completed on July 15, 2015. In the 3 months before record abstraction, eligible patients had either disease progression after receiving one of their country's most commonly prescribed regimens or had received the best supportive care and died. Costs were calculated based on HRU and country-specific diagnosis-related group and/or unit reference costs, amongst other standard resources. Results: Physicians provided data for 1,282 patients (387 in the UK, 502 in France, 393 in Italy) who met the inclusion criteria. Mean [median] total healthcare costs associated with a single line of treatment were (sic)51,717 [35,951] in the UK, (sic)37,009 [32,538] for France, and (sic)34,496 [42,342] for Italy, driven largely by anti-myeloma medications costs (contributing 95.0%, 90.0%, and 94.2% of total cost, respectively). During active treatment, the highest costs were associated with lenalidomide- and pomalidomide-based regimens. Mean cost per month was lowest for patients achieving a very good partial response or better. Unscheduled events (i.e. not considered part of routine management, whether or not related to multiple myeloma, such as unscheduled hospitalization, AEs, fractures) accounted for 1-9% of total costs and were highest for bendamustine. Limitations: The use of retrospective data means that clinical practice (e.g. use of medical procedures, evaluation of treatment response) is not standardized across participating countries/centers, and some data (e.g. low-grade AEs) may be incomplete or differently adjudicated/reported. The centers involved may not be fully representative of national practice. Conclusions: Drug costs are the main contributor to total HRU costs associated with multiple myeloma. The duration of active treatment may influence the average total costs, as well as response, associated with a single line of therapy. Improved treatment outcomes, and reductions in unscheduled events and concomitant medication use may, therefore, reduce the overall HRU and related costs of care in multiple myeloma.","[Gonzalez-McQuire, Sebastian; Schoen, Paul; Campioni, Marco] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland; [Yong, Kwee] UCL, Dept Haematol, London, England; [Leleu, Henri] Publ Hlth Expertise, Paris, France; [Mennini, Francesco S.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Ctr Econ & Int Studies, Fac Econ Econ Evaluat & HTA, Rome, Italy; [Mennini, Francesco S.] Kingston Univ, Inst Leadership & Management Hlth, Surrey, England; [Flinois, Alain; Gazzola, Carlotta; Fink, Leah] Kantar Hlth, Paris, France; [DeCosta, Lucy] Amgen Ltd, Uxbridge, Middx, England",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; University of London; University College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Kingston University; Amgen; Amgen Limited,"Gonzalez-McQuire, S (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland.",sebgonza@amgen.com,,,Amgen (Europe) GmbH,Amgen (Europe) GmbH(Amgen),This study was funded by Amgen (Europe) GmbH.,,50,16,16,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This article takes a closer look at four such reform attempts - involving higher education, welfare, housing and regional policy - in an effort to discern broad patterns governing how and when the state succeeds or fails. The evidence suggests that both masses and mid-level elites actively defend informality - usually interpreted in the literature as an agent-led response to deinstitutionalization and the breakdown of structure - creating a strong brake on state power. More than a quarter century into the post-Soviet period, this pattern of aggressive immobility - the purposeful and concerted defense by citizens of a weakly institutionalized state - has in fact become an entrenched, structural element in Russian politics.","[Greene, Samuel A.] Kings Coll London, Kings Russia Inst, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Greene, SA (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Kings Russia Inst, London, England.",samuel.greene@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,16,17,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

By examining the evolution of the Fund's structural conditionalities and the thematic distribution of Bank commitments, it provides evidence for a significant change on the ground: a partial retreat from the post-Washington Consensus (PWC) agenda, which marked a turn-of-the-century upgrade of orthodox neoliberalism. Conceptualising the PWC as a paradigm expansion that followed severe policy failures, the analysis finds that although narrow institutional reforms towards upgrading fiscal and financial regimes remain popular, there is now less emphasis on good governance and broad institutions; meanwhile in social policy the twins increasingly diverge. It is argued that this selective disengagement is driven by extant operational imperatives and constraints, which are further intensified by changes in lending framework and ongoing transformations in development finance. Rather than constitute a paradigm shift, the partial decline of the PWC reflects an adjustment in policy practice towards increased flexibility and discretion in a progressively challenging environment. These findings have implications for the study of the twins. They also highlight the evolving parameters of North-South development cooperation.","[Gueven, Ali Burak] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Int Relat & Int Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Güven, AB (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Int Relat & Int Polit Econ, London, England.",a.guven@bbk.ac.uk,,"Guven, Ali Burak/0000-0001-9335-2790",,,,,95,26,31,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The incumbent government respects the possibility that society's preference may change, and sets taxes to maximize expected social welfare.

In response, policymakers are recognising the need for better access of SMEs to capital markets and are making efforts to remove major impediments to their participation in capital markets. Thus, SMEs listed on stock exchanges benefit from better access to finance and reduced information asymmetry than their unlisted counterparts. This in turn shall lead to lower failure likelihood of listed SMEs. In this study, we empirically test this hypothesis and report that listed SMEs enjoy a lower likelihood of financial distress and bankruptcy than their unlisted counterparts. Although factors affecting financial distress of both listed and unlisted SMEs are almost identical, Average Marginal Effects of respective factors are strikingly higher for their unlisted counterparts. This suggests a higher vulnerability of unlisted SMEs due to changes in financial ratios. Due to the extremely low number of legal bankruptcy events, our hypothesis finds weak support when bankruptcy is used as the dependent variable in the regression analysis. Broadly, our findings support the view that stock exchange listing can relieve SMEs from external financing constraints, thus reducing their failure likelihood.","[Gupta, Jairaj] Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Gregoriou, Andros] Brighton Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England",University of Birmingham; University of Brighton,"Gupta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",J.Gupta@outlook.com; A.Gregoriou@brighton.ac.uk,,"Gregoriou, Andros/0000-0002-7221-0598",,,,,28,28,32,2,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Moreover, hazard models developed using a failure definition based jointly on bankruptcy laws and firms' financial health exhibit superior goodness of fit and classification measures, in comparison to models that employ a failure definition based either on bankruptcy laws or firms' financial health alone.","[Gupta, Jairaj] Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Gregoriou, Andros] Univ Brighton, Dept Finance & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Ebrahimi, Tahera] Birmingham City Univ, Dept Finance, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; University of Brighton; Birmingham City University,"Gupta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",J.Gupta@outlook.com,,"Gregoriou, Andros/0000-0002-7221-0598; EBRAHIMI, TAHERA/0000-0003-3130-9759",,,,,59,31,35,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Given that stock return volatility measures risk, if the gridlock argument holds, stock market volatility should be lower under divided than under a unified government. Using a partisan conflict index (PCI), we empirically confirm this theoretical argument for the U.S. stock market based on quantiles-based regressions. In particular, quantile-on-quantile regressions show that PCI tends to predict reduced volatility, with the effect being stronger at levels of volatility that are moderately low (i.e., below the median, but not at its extreme) for an increase in the predictor, especially with moderately low and high initial values (i.e., when PCI is at quantiles around the median).","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Tunis, Campus Univ,Ave 7 Novembre, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, Pau, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; Helmut Schmidt University; Universite de Tunis; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; c.pierdzioch@hsu-hh.de; s.refk@yahoo.fr; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,25,38,40,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Drawing on the emerging dialogue between cultural economy and heterodox political economy approaches to money and finance, the article argues that a focus on regulation provides a valuable way of developing new understandings of the geographies of market making beyond cultural economy's extant reading of space as context, particularly in the form of the financial trading room. Through an original case study of the making of offshore renminbi markets in London's financial district, the analysis conceptualizes regulation as both a hitherto overlooked relational component of market making and as a set of practices that coconstitute the territoriality of markets. I demonstrate how regulatory changes made in Beijing and London are important in understanding both the growth and potential limitations of London as an offshore renminbi center. This has significant implications empirically, for the wider project of renminbi internationalization, and theoretically, in terms of understanding the geographies of market making.","[Hall, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Sarah.hall@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Hall, sarah/0000-0001-5563-5909",British Academy [MD130065],British Academy,"I am grateful to those interviewed for sharing their insights on RMB internationalization.

However, this evidence has relied on informal tests that may be unable to reliably distinguish multifractal processes from other related classes. The current paper develops a formal statistical testing procedure for determining which class of fractal process is most consistent with the distributional scaling properties in a given sample of data. Our testing methodology consists of a set of test statistics, together with a model-based bootstrap resampling scheme to obtain sample p-values. We demonstrate in Monte Carlo exercises that the proposed testing methodology performs well in a wide range of testing environments relevant for financial applications. Finally, the methodology is applied to study the scaling properties of a data-set of intraday equity index and exchange rate returns. The empirical results suggest that the scaling properties of these return series may be inconsistent with purely multifractal processes.","[Hallam, Mark] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Essex; University of Southampton,"Hallam, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",mark.hallam@essex.ac.uk,"Olmo, Jose/Y-7042-2019","Olmo, Jose/0000-0002-0437-7812",Science Foundation Ireland [08/SRC/FMC1389]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [BIDEB 2216],Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"Mark Hallam would like to thank Science Foundation Ireland (under grant number 08/SRC/FMC1389) and The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (under the BIDEB 2216 Research Fellowship Programme for International Researchers, undertaken at Koc University) for financial support.",,43,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The apparent failure of many international statebuilding interventions has prompted a political economy' turn in development studies. This article critically assesses the key approaches that have emerged to address the interrelations between interveners and recipients, and advances an approach that places the politics of scale at the core of the conflicts shaping the outcomes of international intervention. Different scales privilege different interests, unevenly allocating power, resources and political opportunity structures. Interveners and recipients thus pursue scalar strategies and establish socio-political alliances that reinforce their power and marginalise rivals. This approach is harnessed towards examining the uneven results of the Aceh Government Transformation Programme, financed by the World Bank-managed Multi Donor Trust Fund following the 2005 peace agreement and implemented by the UNDP and the Aceh provincial government.","[Hameiri, Shahar] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Int Polit, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Hameiri, Shahar] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Grad Ctr Governance & Int Affairs, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Scarpello, Fabio] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Sussex,"Hameiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Int Polit, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.;Hameiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Grad Ctr Governance & Int Affairs, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",,,"Hameiri, Shahar/0000-0001-7262-2448",Australian Research Council [DP130102273],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Australian Research Council [grant number DP130102273].,,70,12,15,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In terms of methodologies, it combines three novel features. First, it separates co-movement in monetary policies due to common shocks from spillovers of monetary policies from advanced to peripheral economies. Second, it uses revisions in growth and inflation and the Taylor rule to gauge desired changes in a country's interest rate if it is to focus exclusively on growth, inflation, and real exchange rate stability. Third, it proposes a specification that can work with the quantitative easing episodes when no changes in US interest rates are observed. In terms of empirical findings, we differ from the existing literature and document patterns of 2.5-lemma or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: without capital controls, a flexible exchange rate regime offers some monetary policy autonomy when the center country tightens its monetary policy, yet it fails to do so when the center country lowers its interest rate. Capital controls help to insulate periphery countries from monetary policy shocks from the center country even when the latter lowers its interest rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional method has been Random Utility Maximisation (RUM) and recent interest has focussed on Random Regret Minimisation (RRM), but there are many other possibilities. Decision Field Theory (DFT), a dynamic model popular in mathematical psychology, has recently been put forward as a rival to RUM but has not yet been investigated in detail or compared against other competing models like RRM. This paper considers arguments in favour of using DFT, reviews how it has been used in transport literature so far and provides theoretical improvements to further the mechanisms behind DFT to better represent general decision making. In particular, we demonstrate how the probability of alternatives can be calculated after any number of timesteps in a DFT model. We then look at how to best operationalise DFT using simulated datasets, finding that it can cope with underlying preferences towards alternatives, can include socio-demographic variables and that it performs best when standard score normalisation is applied to the alternative attribute levels. We also present a detailed comparison of DFT and Multinomial Logit (MNL) models using stated preference route choice datasets and find that DFT achieves significantly better fit in estimation as well as forecasting. We also find that our theoretical improvement provides DFT with much greater flexibility and that there are numerous approaches that can be adopted to incorporate heterogeneity within a DFT model. In particular, random parameters vastly improve the model fit. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that domestic firms and firms with dispersed ownership innovate less when business and municipal uncertainty conditions increase. When firms are unsure whether they will be blocked by local bureaucrats from capitalizing on their innovation, they scale down their efforts.

Changes in the stock of reserves play no role in the macroeconomy including in business cycle volatility, trade dynamics or exchange rate volatility. We consider richer supply dynamics and model exploration and depletion. We show that an endogenous supply of reserves is important for capturing the stylised facts associated with commodity price shocks including a commodity currency, the crowding-out of non-commodity activity (Dutch-Disease) and a volatile business cycle. We also consider how exploration and depletion affect the ranking of optimal monetary and taxation policies. When natural resource reserves are held fixed, monetary policy is an efficient tool for stabilising the effects of commodity price shocks. However, when exploration and depletion are accounted for, using interest rates to stabilise the effects of commodity price changes becomes inefficient. Using taxes on the resource sector, specifically an ad valorem royalty, remains efficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our sample consists of male factory workers in a manufacturing facility in a Muslim country. In our between-subjects' design, each worker is asked to allocate an amount of money between himself and a stranger. Specifically, we examine behavior of observants and nonobservants before and after the daily break of the Ramadan fast. We also examine behavior outside of Ramadan, where we treat alimentary abstention as akin to a long fasting period. We hypothesize and confirm that outside Ramadan, decision makers who abstain from any alimentary intake transfer less money to recipients relative to decision makers who do not abstain. Strikingly, this effect is reversed during the month of Ramadan. Specifically, observant workers who are in the midst of their Ramadan fast are far more generous to recipients than workers who have had their evening meal. Interestingly, observant and nonobservant workers after the daily break of the Ramadan fast and workers outside Ramadan that consumed aliments make statistically similar transfers. Our findings suggest that it is the interaction between alimentary abstention and religious observance that amplifies prosocial behavior during Ramadan, where fasting is part of the ritual.","[Haruvy, Ernan E.] Univ Texas Dallas, Mkt Program, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Ioannou, Christos A.] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Golshirazi, Farnoush] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Haruvy, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Mkt Program, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",eharuvy@utdallas.edu; christos.a.ioannou@gmail.com; farnoush.golshirazi@univ.ox.ac.uk,"Haruvy, Ernan/AFM-0896-2022; Ioannou, Christos/AAN-8975-2020; Haruvy, Ernan/AAH-3467-2022","Haruvy, Ernan/0000-0001-8077-1363; Ioannou, Christos/0000-0001-7928-9158",Strategic Research Development Fund of the University of Southampton; University of Texas at Dallas,Strategic Research Development Fund of the University of Southampton; University of Texas at Dallas,"The paper has benefited greatly from the comments of Shai Danziger, Raymond O'Brien, Alexis Antoniades, Manos Mentzakis, Carmine Ornaghi, Miltos Makris, Abbas Zabihzadeh, Mohammad Reza Abedi, Jean-Yves Pitarakis, Hamid Taher Neshat Doost, and Mohammad Ali Mazaheri.

J,"Hearson, M",,,,"Hearson, Martin",,,The Challenges for Developing Countries in International Tax Justice,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Review,,,,,,,TAXATION,"Developing countries face three main challenges in international tax cooperation. The most widely known are the twin problems of tax avoidance by foreign investors and tax evasion by domestic actors, which have become a major focus of debate in international organisations and of civil society activism in recent years. The second problem, tax competition, incorporates a range of issues from the prisoners' dilemma' facing countries competing for inward direct investment through to the harmful tax rules used by tax havens that enable tax avoidance and evasion. This article reviews four recent monographs that analyse these problems at an international level. While they contain much useful discussion of the problems and potential technical solutions, there remains a need for political economy research to understand why certain technical solutions have not been adopted by governments. A third challenge faced by developing countries, barely considered in the tax and development literature up to now, leads to a note of caution: international tax institutions tend to be designed in ways that place disproportionate restrictions on capital-importing countries' ability to tax foreign investors.","[Hearson, Martin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hearson, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",M.Hearson@lse.ac.uk,"Hearson, Martin/N-6854-2017","Hearson, Martin/0000-0002-7108-7372",,,,,11,12,15,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Yet, while transnational tax policy processes are increasingly analyzed through the politics of expertise, national preferences have usually been derived from domestic interest group preferences. We know little about how technical expertise interacts with interest group politics at national level, an important deficit given the sovereignty-preserving, decentralized way in which transnational tax norms become hard law. This article examines the drivers of expansion of the UK's bilateral tax treaty network in the 1970s, which cannot be explained solely through monolithic interest group politics. Evidence from the British national archives demonstrates how tax experts in the civil service and the private sector, members of a transnational policy community, used tax treaties to impose OECD standards for taxing British firms on host countries, at times overruling the preferences of other political, bureaucratic and business actors. Expertise politics and business power may shape the development of norms and focal points within a transnational policy community, but it is often their interaction at domestic level that determines the implementation of transnational norms as hard law.","[Hearson, Martin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Int Relat, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hearson, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Int Relat, London, England.",m.hearson@lse.ac.uk,"Hearson, Martin/N-6854-2017","Hearson, Martin/0000-0002-7108-7372",,,,,104,24,25,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Simultaneously, this process has challenged the conventional view that countries urbanize alongside structural transformation, as urbanization in Africa has occurred despite low productivity gains in agriculture and very limited industrialization. While there are large household income gaps between urban and rural areas that induce migration, most cities have very high agricultural employment, blurring the connection between structural transformation and urbanization. Urban income premiums apply equally to farm and nonfarm families. Looking across the urban hierarchy, we discuss how high urban primacy presents problems for economic growth in Africa, how secondary cities are faltering with a lack of industrialization, and how growth of employment in tradable services may signal a different path to structural transformation.","[Henderson, J.

Macroeconomic theories are incomplete, incorrect and changeable: location shifts invalidate the law of iterated expectations and 'rational expectations' are then systematically biased. Empirical macro-econometric models are non constant and mis-specified in numerous ways, so economic policy often has unexpected effects, and macroeconomic forecasts go awry. In place of using just one of the four main methods of deciding between alternative models, theory, empirical evidence, policy relevance and forecasting, we propose nesting 'theory-driven' and 'data-driven' approaches, where theory-models' parameter estimates are unaffected by selection despite searching over rival candidate variables, longer lags, functional forms, and breaks.

The need for frequent injections with existing rFVIII products may, however, result in poor adherence to prophylaxis, leading to increased bleeding and long-term joint damage. Recombinant FVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is an extended half-life fusion protein which can offer prolonged protection and reduced dosing frequency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc in severe hemophilia A from the perspective of the Swedish health system.Methods: A Markov model was built to estimate lifetime costs and benefits of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc vs rFVIII products. Clinical outcomes were represented by annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and quality of life via disutility applied to bleeding events and injection frequency. Costs included the cost of FVIII for routine prophylaxis and bleed resolution. The pooled comparator was costed by weighting the cost of individual products by their market share.Results: In the base case, rFVIIIFc was dominant vs the pooled comparator. Savings of SEK 9.0 million per patient resulted from lower factor consumption for prophylaxis and bleed resolution. Fewer bleeds and reduced injection frequency yielded an estimated 0.59 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were sensitive to drug dosage and robust to variation in other parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a greater than 85% probability of rFVIIIFc being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY.Limitations: Due to unavailibilty of patient-level data, treatment benefit was based on a non-adjusted indirect comparison. Dosing and treatment outcomes were assumed to persist over the model duration in the absence of long-term outcome data.Conclusion: The results suggest that rFVIIIFc may be a cost-effective option for hemophilia A prophylaxis, generating greater quality of life and reduced costs for the Swedish payer compared to more frequently administered rFVIII alternatives.","[Henry, Nathaniel; Joyanovic, Jelena; Schlueter, Max] IQVIA, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England; [Kritikou, Persefoni; Wilson, Koo; Myren, Karl-Johan] Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden",IQVIA; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum,"Henry, N (通讯作者)，IQVIA, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England.",nathaniel.henry@iqvia.com,,,,,,,38,25,26,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The effects of job quality on health among older European workers",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Job quality; Older workers; Physical health; Mental health; Selection; Panel; Health dynamics,SELF-REPORTED HEALTH; EARLY RETIREMENT; D SCALE; ENVIRONMENT; EMPLOYMENT; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; GENDER; STRAIN; SPAIN,"Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, this study presents new evidence on the effects of job quality on the occurrence of severe acute conditions, the level of cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal disorders, mental health, functional disabilities and self-assessed health among workers aged 50+. By combining intrinsic job quality with job insecurity and pay the study maps out multiple potential pathways through which work may affect health and well-being. Levering longitudinal data and external information on early retirement ages allows for accounting of unobserved heterogeneity, selection bias and reverse causality. The empirical findings suggest that inequities in health correlate with inequities in job quality, though a substantial fraction of these associations reflect time-constant unobserved heterogeneity. Still, there is evidence for genuine protective effects of better jobs on musculoskeletal disorders, mental health and general health. The effect could contribute to a substantial number of avoidable disorders among older workers, despite relatively modest effect sizes at the level of individuals. Mental health, in particular, responds to changes in job quality. Selection bias such as the healthy worker effect does not alter the results. But the influence of job quality on health may be transitional among older workers. An in-depth analysis of health dynamics reveals no evidence for persistence.","[Henseke, Golo] UCL Inst Educ, London, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Henseke, G (通讯作者)，UCL Inst Educ, London, England.",g.henseke@ucl.ac.uk,"Henseke, Golo/AAP-2603-2020","Henseke, Golo/0000-0003-0669-2100","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, RII-CT-2006-062193, CIT5-CT-2005-028857, CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, R21 AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG BSR06-11, OGHA 04-064]; German Ministry of Education and Research; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am indebted to Francis Green, Abi Palmer, Stefanie Gundert and discussants at the 36th annual IWPLMS conference and the 2015 WPEG conference for their invaluable inputs to an earlier version of the paper.
