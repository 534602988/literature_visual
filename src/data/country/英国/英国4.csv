The Association of British Neurologists guidelines currently recommend two infusion therapies, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, to treat high disease activity relapsing remitting MS (HDA-RRMS). This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of cladribine tablets in HDA-RRMS compared with alemtuzumab and natalizumab, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Materials and methods: A cohort-based Markov model with 11 health states (10 Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] plus death) was developed. Transition matrices from the British Columbia registry were used to model the natural history of EDSS. The treatment effect on EDSS was modelled using hazard ratios for 6-month confirmed disability progression from an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Relapses and drug-related adverse events were modeled via annualized relapse rates and event probabilities, with associated costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. Utilities were derived from trials and the literature, and costs from NHS and literature sources. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results: Cladribine tablets were dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) vs alemtuzumab and natalizumab in pairwise comparisons, and the dominant strategy in fully incremental analyses. Incremental cost was driven largely by drug acquisition and administration costs, and incremental QALY gain largely by differences in delayed EDSS progression. Cladribine tablets had a 93% probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY gained, and remained dominant across the scenario analyses tested. The greatest influence on results was the treatment effect on disability progression derived from the ITC. Limitations: Uncertainty over the efficacy of DMT beyond trial durations. In line with other comparative effectiveness analyses, the network meta-analysis informing this cost-effectiveness analysis was associated with a degree of uncertainty. No treatment switching analyses were undertaken. Conclusions: Cladribine tablets are a cost-effective alternative to alemtuzumab and natalizumab in the treatment of HDA-RRMS from the perspective of the NHS in England.","[Hettle, Robert] Parexel Access Consulting, Parexel Int, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Harty, Gerard] MERCK, Feltham, England; [Wong, Schiffon L.] EMD Serono Inc, Billerica, MA USA",Parexel International; Merck & Company; Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.,"Harty, G (通讯作者)，Global Evidence & Value Dev, 45A Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821 USA.",gerard.harty@emdserono.com,,,"EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","Editorial assistance was provided by Jo Whelan (Textpharm Ltd., Oxford, UK) funded by EMD Serono, Inc., a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.",,51,25,25,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: The NICE model, consisting of a decision tree with branches for discrete levels of pain relief and adverse event (AE) severities, was replicated using R, and used to compare a hypothetical neuropathic pain drug to pregabalin. Model parameters were sourced from NICE's clinical guidelines and associated with probability distributions to account for underlying uncertainty. A simulation-based scenario analysis was conducted to assess how uncertainty in efficacy and AEs affected the net monetary benefit (NMB) for the hypothetical treatment at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY. Results: Relative to pregabalin, an increase in efficacy was associated with greater NMB than an improvement in tolerability. A greater NMB was observed when efficacy was marginally higher than that of pregabalin, while maintaining the same level of AEs than when efficacy was equivalent to pregabalin, but with a more substantial reduction in AEs. In the latter scenario, the NMB was only positive at a low cost-effectiveness threshold. Limitations: The replicate model shares the limitations described in the NICE guidelines. There is a lack of support in scientific literature for the assumption that increased efficacy is associated with a greater reduction in tolerability. The replicate model also included a single comparator, unlike the NICE model. Conclusions: Pain relief is a stronger driver of NMB than tolerability, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY. Health technology assessment decisions which are influenced by NICE's model may reward efficacy gains, even if they are associated with more severe AEs. This contrasts with recommendations from clinical guidelines for neuropathic pain, which place more equal weighting on improvements in efficacy and tolerability as value drivers.","[Hirst, Matthew; Dunlop, William C.

There are strong grounds for believing that these stories are largely nonsense, yet they inform policy and are widely believed among mass publics, and have proved almost impossible to refute in everyday political discourse. The answer to this puzzle, we suggest, is that such claims are better thought of as bullshit (as conceptualised by Harry Frankfurt 2005) rather than outright falsehoods: in other words, as speech acts that are indifferent to the truth and proceed without effective concern for the veracity of the claim in question. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of political bullshit applied to economic policy debates since the financial crisis, and seek to explain its hold on the popular imagination. We assess what makes some particular brands of bullshit more successful than others, and argue that in a world of competing realities as well as competing theories, the power of rhetoric is more likely to settle an argument than evidence and logic.","[Hopkin, Jonathan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London, England; [Rosamond, Ben] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Copenhagen,"Hopkin, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London, England.",j.r.hopkin@lse.ac.uk,"Hopkin, Jonathan/C-4396-2017",,,,,,86,47,47,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Since then, fiscal space has shrunk and remains narrow as these economies have taken advantage of historically low interest rates. Second, fiscal policy in emerging and developing economies has become countercyclical (or less procyclical), i.e., graduated, since the 1980s, as most clearly demonstrated during the Great Recession. The move towards graduation is most pronounced for those economies with greater fiscal space, which suggests that fiscal space matters for a government's ability to implement countercyclical fiscal policy.","[Huidrom, Raju; Kose, M.

We show that the spatial dependence in house prices is more pronounced in a rising housing market than in a falling market and can be associated with behavioural biases such as sellers' loss aversion tendency or herding of buyers. Using a spatio-temporal autoregressive model for 30,541 apartment transactions in Seoul, South Korea between 2006 and 2015, we find that spatial dependence in house prices is eight time higher in a boom as opposed to a bust. This shows huge asymmetric spatial effects across apartment transactions which suggests that neighbouring property prices can serve as an appropriate benchmark during a rising market but they may not be suitable to capture the housing market dynamics in a falling market. This implies that behavioural aspects such as sellers' loss aversion should be taken into account in the price formation when house prices are falling.","[Hyun, Dongwoo] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England; [Milcheva, Stanimira] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England",University of Reading; University of London; University College London,"Hyun, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",d.hyun@pgr.reading.ac.uk; s.milcheva@ucl.ac.uk,,"Milcheva, Stanimira/0000-0002-7051-773X",,,,,59,17,18,2,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Particularly unique in this region, is the shared history between Malaysia and Singapore, which was once ruled-under the British empire, has since become economic rivals for the Far East - Europe trade route. This provides a suitable context to investigate whether competition or a strategic alliance should be adopted for ports in terms of its benefit to the industry in the region as a whole. Specifically, this paper analyses the ocean freight traffic demand for the Far East-Europe route among three main transshipment ports located in Malaysia and Singapore: Port of Singapore (PSA), Port Klang (PKL), and Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP). The paper provides a scenario analysis of the 3-way interaction through a game theoretic model. The results suggest that a strategic alliance between PSA and PTP generates greater profitability to the current hub and spoke network, while PKL should not commit to any cooperative strategy with either PSA or PTP.","[Ignatius, Joshua; Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Ignatius, Joshua; Tan, Tian Siang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore, Singapore; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, Logist Inst Asia Pacific, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore, Singapore",University of Warwick; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",j.ignatius@warwick.ac.uk,"goh, mark/AAC-4268-2022; goh, mark/GQO-8860-2022; Tan, Tian Siang/AAR-1442-2020","goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Tan, Tian Siang/0000-0003-3995-1519; Dhamotharan, Lalitha/0000-0001-6367-0819",,,,,47,7,9,15,44,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This paper investigates whether deregulation can be structured through a controlled Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) process by means of government intervention, and how this promotes the performance of the players in the industry. We study this in the context of the Chinese aviation industry as an ideal microcosm of our problem statement. This is because China's civil aviation industry has witnessed many of the above challenges since its deregulation and economic reforms in 1979, which saw the beginning of a transformation from a fully state-owned machinery to a rent-seeking private sector. The post controlled deregulation process through M&As led to three dominant carriers: Air China Limited (AC), China Southern Airlines (CS), and China Eastern Airlines (CE). Using a 3-player non-cooperative perfect information Cournot oligopoly game model, the strategic efficacy of the government intervention to consolidate the industry based on operating expenses, air passenger revenue, and profit data are investigated respectively. All three airlines are better off after the exercise, with the industry facing a more sustainable growth by the intervention.","[Ignatius, Joshua; Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Warwick, WMG, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Ignatius, Joshua; Tan, Tian Siang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town, Malaysia; [Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town, Malaysia; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, Logist Inst Asia Pacific, Singapore, Singapore",University of Warwick; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, WMG, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",joshua_ignatius@hotmail.com,"goh, mark/AAC-4268-2022; Tan, Tian Siang/AAR-1442-2020; goh, mark/GQO-8860-2022","goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Tan, Tian Siang/0000-0003-3995-1519; goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Dhamotharan, Lalitha/0000-0001-6367-0819",,,,,37,4,4,2,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Drawing on two theories with some similar and opposing perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of three components of customer experience (i.e. utilitarian experience, hedonic experience and relational experience) and customers' intention on behavior within the context of the BVN policy implemented by the Nigerian apex bank. Design/methodology/approach Data emerged from one of the most populous districts in south-eastern Nigeria. Participants were recruited by mall-intercept. Out of the 283 participants approached, 246 participated but only 82.9 percent were valid for analysis. After subjecting data to statistical screening to confirm its suitability for parametric statistical analysis and examining data for the potential effects of common method variance as well as sample representativeness, a partial least squares structural equation modelling technique and the Preacher and Hayes bootstrapping procedures were utilized to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings Based on data obtained from Nigerian bank customers, the paper demonstrated that the customer loyalty arising from the implementation of a government policy is determined more by hedonic experience, followed by relational experience and very much less by utilitarian experience. Findings also indicate that the relationship between the components of customer experience and customer loyalty is complementarily mediated by intention to open new account(s). Research limitations/implications Though the theoretical grounding of the paper strongly supports the study design, the authors strongly recommend that future research should examine customer experience-customer behavior models in situations of policy implementation with longitudinal design. Additionally, since intention to open new account(s) is a complementary mediator of the links between the components of customer experience and customer loyalty, there is need for future researchers to integrate other mediators into the conceptual framework that the authors examined in this paper. Practical implications This paper cautions that whilst the research findings play out effectively in situations where the benefits of the introduced policy and the consumers' belief in the good intent of the policy are congruent and customers are susceptible to the manipulations of the social class leading to absence of volitional control; firms should not be deceived into relying too heavily on this kind of loyalty because it is situational and consequently promiscuous. Nevertheless, deploying more resources to seamlessly meet the needs of customers in such situations is counter-productive for service organizations. Social implications Based on the findings, it has come to the fore that consumers will be at the receiving end of a government policy poorly implemented by service organizations. When such policies are rolled out therefore, governments should enforce operational modalities that will forestall potential negative experiences that consumers could possibly encounter. Originality/value By examining the effects of three components of customer experience and intention to open new account(s) on customer loyalty within the context of BVN implementation in an emerging banking sector, the authors contribute to the broad stream of literature that focuses on the effect of customer experience on company bottom-line. The strength of this contribution is based on the premise that this paper draw on the similarities and opposing orientations of two theories to uncover these effects. The authors show that the effects of the three components of customer experience on customer loyalty is different from the results of previous research because of the unique perspective adopted in this paper.","[Izogo, Ernest Emeka] Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Mkt, Abakaliki, Nigeria; [Jayawardhena, Chanaka] Univ Hull, Dept Mkt & Business Strategy, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Kalu, Alexanda Ogbonna Udu] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Mkt, Umuahia, Nigeria",University of Hull,"Izogo, EE (通讯作者)，Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Mkt, Abakaliki, Nigeria.",ernyemmy@gmail.com,"Izogo, Ernest Emeka/AAP-8713-2020; Jayawardhena, Chanaka/ABC-5225-2020","Izogo, Ernest Emeka/0000-0001-6226-8836; Jayawardhena, Chanaka/0000-0003-0928-9835",,,,,84,5,5,2,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

This article develops new tools to address such issues and illustrates their usefulness in applications. The central development is a condition called quasi-concave differences, which implies concavity of the policy function in optimization problems without imposing differentiability or quasi-concavity conditions. The general take-away is that many distributional questions in economics which cannot be solved by direct calculations or the implicit function theorem, can be addressed easily with this article's methods. Several applications demonstrate this: the article shows how increased uncertainty affects the set of equilibria in Bayesian games; it shows how increased dispersion of productivities affects output in the model of Melitz (2003); and it generalizes Carroll and Kimball (1996)'s result on concave consumption functions to the Aiyagari (1994) setting with borrowing constraints.","[Jensen, Martin Kaae] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Jensen, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England.",Mj182@le.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,17,20,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases recommends revaccination for older adults who received primary vaccination >= 5 years earlier. The cost-effectiveness of adding revaccination and/or continuing catch-up vaccination in the NIP was evaluated from the public payer perspective in Japan. Methods: The Markov model included five health states: no pneumococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP), post-meningitis sequelae, and death. Cohorts of adults aged 65-95 were followed until age 100 or death: 2014 cohort (aged 65-95, vaccinated: 2014); 2019 cohort (aged 65: 2019); and 2019 catch-up cohort (aged 70-100: 2019, unvaccinated: 2014). Strategies included: (1) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts; (2) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts and revaccinate both; (3) strategy 1 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; (4) strategy 2 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; and (5) strategy 4 and revaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort. Parameters were retrieved from global and Japanese sources, costs and QALYs discounted at 2%, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated. Results: Strategy 1 had the highest number of IPD and NBPP cases, and strategy 5 the lowest. Strategies 3-5 dominated strategy 1 and strategy 2 was cost-effective compared to strategy 1 (ICER: (sic)1,622,153 per QALY gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of V5 million per QALY gained, strategy 2 was cost-effective and strategies 3-5 were cost-saving compared to strategy 1. Conclusions: Strategies including revaccination, catch-up, or both were cost-effective or cost-saving in comparison to no revaccination and no catch-up.

We run differences-in-differences specifications in which locations that experience a closure are matched to locations with similar pre-treatment employment levels and trends. The results show that when a plant closes, for each job directly lost in the plant closure, only between 0.6 and 0.7 jobs are actually lost in the local affected industry. These effects are driven by employment expansions in local incumbent firms and, to a lesser extent, by the creation of new firms in the local industry.","[Jofre-Monseny, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Jofre-Monseny, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sanchez-Vidal, Maria] Ctr Econ Performance LSE, London WC2A 3PH, England; [Sanchez-Vidal, Maria] Inst Econ Barcelona, London WC2A 3PH, England; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Inst Econ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet] Univ Barcelona, CEPR, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Sánchez-Vidal, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Performance LSE, London WC2A 3PH, England.;Sánchez-Vidal, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Barcelona, London WC2A 3PH, England.",M.Sanchez-Vidal@lse.ac.uk,"Jofre-Monseny, Jordi/F-1182-2016","Viladecans-Marsal, Elisabet/0000-0003-3722-2371","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-41310, ECO2016-75941-R]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR420]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from the Editor, two anonymous referees, Henry Overman, Olmo Silva, Giulia Faggio, Rosa Sanchis-Guarner, and participants at the SERC work in progress seminar, IEB PhD seminar, 2014 SERC Annual Conference, INFER Workshop (Reus), UEA Meeting (Washington, DC), and the 2015 SAE Meeting (Girona).

With the availability of newer agents like ixekizumab and secukinumab, there is a need for cost-effectiveness analyses to better reflect current clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequence of biologic therapies containing first-line ixekizumab vs first-line secukinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK. Materials and methods: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed to compare the cost- effectiveness of ixekizumab and secukinumab treatment sequences: ixekizumab -> ustekinumab -> infliximab -> best supportive care (BSC) vs secukinumab -> ustekinumab -> infliximab -> BSC. The model used monthly cycles, and included four health states: trial period, treatment maintenance, BSC, and death. At the end of the trial period, responders transitioned to maintenance therapy; non-responders transitioned to the next biologic in the sequence. An annual discontinuation rate of 20% was assumed for maintenance therapy. Results: The ixekizumab sequence provided cost savings of 898 pound (.176,203 pound vs 177,101) [year 2015 values] and gained 0.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs: 1.45 vs 1.42) vs the secukinumab sequence over the lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed an 89.8% likelihood that the ixekizumab sequence would be cost-effective at a threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY gained. Limitations: The analysis used list prices for drugs rather than confidential, preferentially priced Patient Access Scheme costs. In addition, efficacy input data were based on a network meta-analysis, as there were no head-to-head trials comparing ixekizumab and secukinumab. Conclusion: First-line treatment with ixekizumab as part of a specific sequential biologic therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK provided slight advantages in cost savings and QALYs gained over a similar treatment sequence initiated with secukinumab. In view of the small magnitude of these differences, factors such as patient preferences (e.g. for number of injections) and long-term safety (e.g. related to time on the market) may also be important for clinical decision-making.","[Johansson, Erin Colleen; Svedbom, Axel] Mapi Grp, Klarabergsviadukten 90,Hus B, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hartz, Susanne; Kiri, Sandeep Himatlal; Kumar, Gayathri] Eli Lilly & Co Ltd, London, England",Eli Lilly,"Johansson, EC (通讯作者)，Mapi Grp, Klarabergsviadukten 90,Hus B, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden.",ejohansson@mapigroup.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,46,5,6,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

It argues that in ECEs these financial transformations, akin to the financialisation phenomena observed in Core Capitalist Economies (CCEs), are fundamentally shaped by their subordinated integration into a financialised and structured world economy. To analyse this subordinated financialisation, the paper draws on the framework of international currency hierarchies. It shows by means of two specific processes how the existence of a hierarchic international monetary system has changed the financial behaviour of domestic economic agents, and with it the structure of the financial system. The first process highlights the phenomenon of reserve accumulation and the changing behaviour of domestic banks. The second points to ECEs' sustained external vulnerability and its impact on the operations of Brazilian non-financial corporations. The paper also shows that not only were these financial transformations shaped by ECEs' subordinated financial integration, but also that it was these financialisation tendencies themselves which contributed to cementing existing hierarchies and further deepened existing asymmetries between ECEs and CCEs.","[Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Painceira, Juan Pablo] Brazilian Cent Bank, Open Mkt Operat Dept DEMAB, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",University of Leeds,"Kaltenbrunner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.kaltenbrunner@leeds.ac.uk,,"Kaltenbrunner, Annina/0000-0003-3519-5197",,,,,174,105,114,5,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This paper identifies groups of retirees that have experienced relatively high price inflation over the last few decades and could thus be considered most vulnerable when income decreases, as has been the case in the Netherlands in recent years. For this we use household budget survey data from 1978 to 2004 supplemented with price information from 1978 to 2012. A methodological contribution to the literature is that an empirical framework based on the theory of consumer demand is used that explicitly makes the link between expenditure patterns and inflation experiences of households. We find that retired couples aged 65-69 have experienced about average inflation over the past few decades. Differences in inflation experiences between households result from relative price increases in goods, such as rent and utilities, on which single, low-income and older households spend relatively more of their budget, and relative price decreases in goods, such as leisure activities (including vacations), on which these households spend relatively less. The estimated differences over the 1978-2012 period in annual inflation experience are about 0.14 percentage points between single and married retirees, 0.06 percentage points between retired couples in the age groups 65-69 and 75-79 and 0.19 percentage points between retirees with low and high expenditures. Although these differences are statistically significant, they could be considered too small to be of economic significance compared with an average household having experienced 2.4% annual inflation.","[Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alessie, Robertus] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Gardner, Jonathan] Willis Towers Watson, London, England; [Ali, Ashik Anwar] European Actuarial Serv, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Groningen,"Kalwij, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.s.kalwij@uu.nl,,"Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753",,,,,18,1,1,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The TYRX Antibacterial Envelope is a polypropylene mesh that stabilizes the CIED and elutes minocycline and rifampin to reduce the risk of post-operative infection. Methods: A decision tree was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TYRX vs standard of care (SOC) following implantation of four CIED device types. The model was parameterized for a UK National Health Service perspective. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration, hospitalization, adverse events, device extraction, and replacement. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Over a 12-month time horizon, TYRX was less costly and more effective than SOC when utilized in patients with an ICD or CRT-D. TYRX was associated with ICERs of 46,548 and 21,768 pound per QALY gained in patients with an IPG or CRT-P, respectively. TYRX was cost-effective at a 30,000 pound threshold at baseline probabilities of infection exceeding 1.65% (CRT-D), 1.95% (CRT-P), 1.87% (IPG), and 1.38% (ICD). Limitations and conclusions: Device-specific infection rates for high-risk patients were not available in the literature and not used in this analysis, potentially under-estimating the impact of TYRX in certain devices. Nevertheless, TYRX is associated with a reduction in post-operative infection risk relative to SOC, resulting in reduced healthcare resource utilization at an initial cost. The ICERs are below the accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds used by UK decision-makers. TYRX, therefore, represents a cost-effective prevention option for CIED patients at high-risk of post-operative infection.","[Kay, Gemma; Kumar, Gayathri; Fenwick, Elisabeth] ICON Hlth Econ & Epidemiol, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Eby, Elizabeth L.] Medtron Plc, Mounds View, MN USA; [Brown, Benedict; Eggington, Simon] Medtron Int Trading Sarl, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [Lyon, Julie] Medtron Ltd, Watford, England; [Sohail, M.

We consider a simple cheap talk game in which a sender who faces an ambiguity averse receiver is able to perform ambiguous randomization, i.e. to randomize according to unknown probabilities. We show that for any standard influential communication equilibrium there exists an equilibrium featuring an ambiguous communication strategy which Pareto-dominates it in terms of consistent planning ex ante utilities. Ambiguity, by triggering worst-case decision-making by the receiver, shifts the latter's response to information towards the sender's ideal action, thus encouraging more information transmission.

This introduction to the special issue lays out key shifts in the contemporary politics of knowledge and describes the collective contribution of the six papers as an articulation of what we describe as a new empiricism', exploring how earlier historical appeals to evidence to defend political power and decision-making both chime with and differ from those of the contemporary era. We outline some emerging empirical frontiers in the study of instruments of calculation, from the evolution of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) to the growing importance of big data, and explore how these methodological transformations intersect with the alleged crisis of expertise in the post-truth' era. In so doing, we suggest that the ambiguity of evidence can be a powerful tool in itself, and we relate this ambiguity to the ideological commitment and moral fervour that is elicited through appeals to, and the performance of, evaluation.","[Kelly, Ann H.] Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England; [McGoey, Linsey] Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Essex,"Kelly, AH (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England.",ann.kelly@kcl.ac.uk; lmcgoey@essex.ac.uk,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018","Kelly, Ann/0000-0003-4658-2133",UK's Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010236/1]; ERSC's Urgency Research Grant Scheme [ES/M009203/1]; Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme [MN090415]; ESRC [ES/M010236/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ERSC's Urgency Research Grant Scheme; Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The paper was further supported by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council's funding of the Human Rights, Big Data and Technology project, based at the University of Essex [grant number ES/M010236/1] as well as an ERSC's Urgency Research Grant Scheme [grant no.

This paper analyses how the tensions between the humanitarian imperatives of disease control and the epistemic conventions of bioscientific inquiry played out in the accelerated development, testing and licensure of Ebola vaccines. Beginning with the epidemiological projections of the disease's spread, the paper develops the notion of evidentiary charisma to capture the power of experimental designs and data packages to marshal public health salience, recruit moral legitimacy and short-circuit scientific contestation. Attention to the charismatic dimensions of Ebola vaccine R&D helps to unpick the simultaneous appeals to exception and convention in the unfolding of a global health crisis, and to trace the normative and technical contours of the emerging paradigm of emergency research.","[Kelly, Ann H.] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Sch Global Affairs, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Kelly, AH (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Sch Global Affairs, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England.",ann.kelly@kcl.ac.uk,,"Kelly, Ann/0000-0003-4658-2133",Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme [MN090415]; U.K. Economic and Social Research Council Urgency Research Grant Scheme [ES/M009203/1]; ESRC [ES/M009203/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme; U.K. Economic and Social Research Council Urgency Research Grant Scheme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper draws insight from research and policy work undertaken in the context of the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform, funded by the Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme, which is managed by Enhancing Learning and Research for Humanitarian Assistance (ELRHA) [grant no.

Using matched employer-employee data for the USA, this paper evaluates this claim, and makes empirical and conceptual contributions to prior work. It addresses the potential bias from unobserved heterogeneity among individuals, work establishments and cities. The paper also identifies diversity impacts at both city and workplace scales, and considers how relationships vary across different segments of the labor market. Findings suggest that urban immigrant diversity produces positive and nontrivial spillovers for U.S. workers.

How does society respond to the collapse of both welfare-state and market mechanisms? I examine these issues through the study of one working class community in Athens over 2012-13. Since the onset of the crisis, my informants experienced a simultaneous drop in living standards, loss of social status, and debasement of their symbolic construction of reality. To respond to these pressures, they relied on a combination of material survival strategies, the reconfiguration of social resources, and the reconstruction of cultural imaginaries. To explain these findings, the article draws on Karl Polanyi's analysis of counter-movements to marketization and commodification. I argue in favour of augmenting the definition of countermovements to capture local-level responses, emphasising cultural aspects of social protection, and tracing the micro-foundations of countermovements that are nonetheless shaped by the macro-institutional context shaping action. This reading of Polanyi's work seeks to integrate many moving-and potentially contradictory-parts into a holistic analysis of societal responses to rapid and radical socioeconomic change.","[Kentikelenis, Alexander E.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Kentikelenis, Alexander E.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; University of Amsterdam,"Kentikelenis, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Kentikelenis, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",alexander.kentikelenis@trinity.ox.ac.uk,,"Kentikelenis, Alexandros/0000-0002-1543-4595",Harvard University; Greek State Scholarships Foundation; Onassis Foundation; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; Centre for Business Research at the Cambridge Judge Business School,Harvard University; Greek State Scholarships Foundation(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); Onassis Foundation; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; Centre for Business Research at the Cambridge Judge Business School,"Financial support by Harvard University, the Greek State Scholarships Foundation, the Onassis Foundation, the Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust, and the Centre for Business Research at the Cambridge Judge Business School is gratefully acknowledged.",,99,11,14,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

More than a hundred businesses and trade practitioners were interviewed in the EU and India to understand the lack of momentum in FTA talks. Our findings indicate that economic and political criteria are predominant FTA determinants, with market access potential (economic) as important factors driving the EU-India FTA talks.

Nonetheless, it is well documented that the Euro/American psychology paradigm is challenged by its tendency to universalise its theories. This raises a challenge for development scholars trying to measure the psychological domain; especially regarding understanding what the psychological domain may mean to people outside the Western liberal tradition. We examine the use of theoretical measures of psychological agency against local concepts of psychological agency from a neighbourhood on the urban fringe of Bamako. We conclude that there is no clear association between local and theoretical measures of psychological agency and therefore there is a need to include local and theoretical measures in the study of agency.","[Klein, Elise] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ballon, Paola] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",University of Melbourne; Melbourne Bioinformatics; University of Oxford,"Klein, E (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",elise.klein@unimelb.edu.au,"Ballon, Paola/I-4851-2015","Ballon, Paola/0000-0002-0373-171X","Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative; Department of International Development, University of Oxford; [JEDC/2015-2]","Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative; Department of International Development, University of Oxford;","Paola Ballon acknowledges financial support from grant JEDC/2015-2 and Elise Klein acknowledges a fieldwork grant given by Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and by the Department of International Development, University of Oxford.",,61,6,6,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In the current paper, we explore (1) the relationship between the symmetry assumption of Klibanoff et al. (KMS) (Econometrica 82:1945-1978, 2014) and alternative symmetry assumptions in the literature, and (2) assuming symmetry, the relationship between the set of relevant measures, shown by KMS (2014) to reflect only perceived ambiguity, and the set of measures (which we will refer to as the Bewley set) developed by Ghirardato et al. (J Econ Theory 118:133-173, 2004), Nehring (Ambiguity in the context of probabilistic beliefs, working paper, 2001, Bernoulli without Bayes: a theory of utility-sophisticated preference, working paper, 2007) and Ghirardato and Siniscalchi (A more robust definition of multiple priors, working paper, 2007, Econometrica 80:2827-2847, 2012). This Bewley set is the main alternative offered in the literature as possibly representing perceived ambiguity. Regarding symmetry assumptions, we show that, under relatively mild conditions, a variety of preference symmetry conditions from the literature [including that in KMS (2014)] are equivalent. In KMS (2014), we showed that, under symmetry, the Bewley set and the set of relevant measures are not always the same. Here, we establish a preference condition, No Half Measures, that is necessary and sufficient for the two to be the same under symmetry. This condition is rather stringent. Only when it is satisfied may the Bewley set be interpreted as reflecting only perceived ambiguity and not also taste aspects such as ambiguity aversion.","[Klibanoff, Peter] Northwestern Univ, Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; [Mukerji, Sujoy] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Seo, Kyoungwon] Seoul Natl Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Northwestern University; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Seoul National University (SNU),"Mukerji, S (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.",peterk@kellogg.northwestern.edu; s.mukerji@qmul.ac.uk; seo8240@snu.ac.kr,"Seo, Kyoungwon/K-8214-2012; Klibanoff, Peter/KDP-2927-2024","Klibanoff, Peter/0000-0001-6948-5649",National Science Foundation [SES-0918248]; KAIST,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); KAIST,We thank the referees and the Editor for helpful comments.

This paper quantifies the magnitude of these behavioral effects using data from an experiment on real product choices together with a structural model of consumer behavior. First, we show that information about external effects (products' embodied carbon emissions) triggers voluntary substitution towards cleaner alternatives, and we estimate that this effect is equivalent to a change in relative prices of GBP30.69-165.15/tCO(2). Second, comparing a Pigovian intervention (GBP19/tCO(2)) with a neutrally-framed price change of the same magnitude, we find a negative behavioral effect associated with regulation. Compensating this bias would require increasing the Pigovian price signal by up to 48.06/tCO(2). Finally, based on a cross-product comparison, we show that the magnitude of behavioral effects declines with substitutability between clean and dirty product alternatives, a measure of effort to reduce emissions.

J,"Lauretta, E",,,,"Lauretta, Eliana",,,d The hidden soul of financial innovation: An agent-based modelling of home mortgage securitization and the finance-growth nexus,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Finance; Growth; Securitization; Financial innovation; Financial crisis; Agent-based simulation,CREDIT; POLICIES; CRISIS; RISKS; DEPTH,"This paper investigates the interaction between financial innovation and securitization. To this end, it introduces the rate of financial innovation (RoFIN) as an endogenous variable in an Agent-Based Model (ABM) set up and studies its interaction with the non-fixed fraction of securitized mortgage loans. RoFIN is able to capture financial agents' business decisions on using financial innovation tools, processes and services, such as the home mortgage securitization process. In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial and economic crisis it has been argued that financial innovation and securitization have increased macro/finance systemic instability via, for example, non-linear two-way spillovers between the financial system and the macroeconomy. The ABM model proposed enables the capture of these dynamics. High values of RoFIN (i.e. exceeding the threshold of 50%) make financial innovation become harmful for the economic system, leading to a switch from a virtuous to an unvirtuous business cycle. When RoFIN reaches 90%, the numerical simulations come close to the macro/finance dynamics observed before and during the financial crisis. Given its potential role in triggering financial and economic instability, RoFIN is of interest for financial regulation and supervision. How this endogenous variable may be influenced by means of operational variables under the control of policymakers remains a subject for future research.","[Lauretta, Eliana] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Finance, Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Lauretta, E (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Finance, Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",e.lauretta@bham.ac.uk,,"Lauretta, Eliana/0000-0002-6624-2286",,,,,64,5,5,0,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Whilst the Coalition government effectively re-established the UK's finance-led' growth model, it simultaneously broke with the legitimation strategy which New Labour had advanced in the pre-crisis conjuncture. The Coalition advanced a distinctive two nations' strategy which sought to secure a limited but durable base of support in a context of fiscal consolidation. This strategy was conditional upon the deep and unprecedented period of real wage decline which took hold in the post-crisis conjuncture. However, the Coalition successfully transformed this potential liability into a political asset, constructing a series of moralised antagonisms' between wage earners and welfare recipients, on the one hand, and private and public sector workers, on the other. Whilst this strategy secured a limited base of popular support, it also re-embedded a series of structural weaknesses within post-crisis UK capitalism. These imbalances are likely to undermine the stability of the UK's finance-led growth model in the future and will condition British politics as the country embarks upon the process of leaving of the EU.","[Lavery, Scott] Univ Sheffield, SPERI, 219 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Lavery, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, SPERI, 219 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.",scott.lavery@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,124,16,18,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We contribute to the existing literature by examining the effects of a non-linear response of firm location decisions to changes in the tax rate. We also show that there are large variations in the sensitivity to tax rates across sectors and firm size groups. In particular, financial sector firms are more than twice as sensitive to changes in corporation tax rates relative to other sectors. Our baseline result is a finding that a 1% increase in the statutory or policy rate of corporation tax would lead to a reduction in the conditional location probability of 0.68%. Using the effective average tax rate, the marginal effect implies a reduction in the location probability of 1.15% following a 1% increase in the tax rate. Although overall tax has the expected negative effect on location probability, the marginal effect of an increase is lower at higher rates of tax.","[Lawless, Martina; McCoy, Daire; Morgenroth, Edgar L.

Given such variation, I argue that the uncritical pursuit of reproducibility as an overarching epistemic value is misleading and potentially damaging to scientific advancement. Requirements for reproducibility, however they are interpreted, are one of many available means to secure reliable research outcomes. Furthermore, there are cases where the focus on enhancing reproducibility turns out not to foster high-quality research. Scientific communities and Open Science advocates should learn from inferential reasoning from irreproducible data, and promote incentives for all researchers to explicitly and publicly discuss (1) their methodological commitments, (2) the ways in which they learn from mistakes and problems in everyday practice, and (3) the strategies they use to choose which research components of any project need to be preserved in the long term, and how.","[Le Onelli, Sabina] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Le Onelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England.",,,"Leonelli, Sabina/0000-0002-7815-6609",European Research Council [335925]; Australian Research Council; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P011489/1]; European Research Council (ERC) [335925] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This chapter - like much of my work over the last 10 years - owes much to Mary Morgan's generous advice, and her ability to identify and probe the core and significance of arguments and questions.

Promoted by international NGOs, SG models are inspired by indigenous savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). SG models however differ in that they prescribe lending the pooled savings to group members for an interest. The interest rate aims to (1) boost capital accumulation, (2) allocate scarce capital efficiently, and (3) remunerate and incentivize savers. This paper builds on a six-month fieldwork conducted in DR Congo consisting of direct observations of SG meetings and interviews with SG participants and practitioners. We study the gaps between SG practitioners' objectives and SG participants' perceptions and practices related to the interest rate. Our research pays particular attention to the local context and local norms that interfere with SG practitioners' objectives. Our analysis highlights three gaps. First, SG participants turn savings into credit for security purposes rather for rapid capital accumulation. Second, credit allocation decisions are guided by fairness and security concerns rather than efficiency. Third, SG participants often regard the accumulated interest as belonging to the group and to active borrowers rather than to passive savers. Our results invite development actors to pay greater attention to the potential risks of the SG approach for its participants. Despite the common appellation savings groups, this microfinance innovation builds upon credit and strongly encourages its members to go into debt. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this conceptual paper, the authors aim to model determinants of customer loyalty and put forward propositions to be empirically tested in further studies. The originality of the paper manifests itself in the theoretical model proposed, which clearly delineates determinants of customer loyalty (i.e., marketing communication channels, perceived service quality and customer satisfaction) and emphasises the importance of strategic decisions about communication channel options to match customer preferences to predict combined effects of customer loyalty across different cultural contexts.","[Lee, Kelvin] Nanyang Technol Univ, 42 Nanyang Ave,Student Serv Ctr Level 1, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Salciuviene, Laura] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Charles Carter Bldg,Room D08, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Nanyang Technological University; Lancaster University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, 42 Nanyang Ave,Student Serv Ctr Level 1, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",cskelvinlee@ntu.edu.sg; l.salciuviene@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,97,0,1,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Deconstructing this neutrality illusion', this work argues that economics is actually a divided and ideologically marked discipline despite its aim at natural-science-type-legitimacy. It argues in a related discussion that such ideological bias also impedes a purely neutral conduct of monetary policy, undermining the very idea of central bank independence. Linking these two arguments, it argues that graduate training in economics is the first place for the formation of biased preferences, because of the substantial ideological sorting that exists across universities. Using a unique database on FOMC members' votes and ideology, the paper tests this idea empirically and despite unavoidable caveats, finds robust evidence of a systematic impact of the ideological features of their alma mater on FOMC members' voting behaviour - impact that we found more important than the other traditional determinants of central bankers' actions.","[Lepers, Etienne] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England; [Lepers, Etienne] Sci Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Lepers, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England.;Lepers, E (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, Paris, France.",etienne.lepers@oecd.org,,"Lepers, Etienne/0000-0002-2500-9066",,,,,70,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The so-called post-industrial trilemma is suggested to allow only two of relative earnings equality, high levels of employment and fiscal balance, and has resulted in the widespread policy belief that greater earnings inequality and welfare state retrenchment are unavoidable. This article challenges the micro foundations of this understanding, that the production of economic value is technologically determined by the physical properties inherent in goods and services. In contrast, we argue theoretically, and demonstrate empirically, that production, allocation and distribution are contingent processes better conceived in terms of power over rents' with associated externalities between sectors. Our analysis suggests that the post-industrial trilemma thesis may have unduly distracted research from the potential for redistributive politics to achieve sustainable levels of productivity growth, fiscal balance and higher levels of earnings equality.","[Lewis, Paul] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,116 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Peng, Fei] Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Songjiang Qu, Shanghai Shi, Peoples R China; [Ryner, Magnus] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England",University of Birmingham; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; University of London; King's College London,"Lewis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,116 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",p.c.lewis@bham.ac.uk,"Lewis, Paul/ACH-8124-2022; Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019","Lewis, Paul/0000-0002-1459-3981; Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Ryner, Magnus/0000-0002-7492-2986",ESRC seminar series award [ES/M002209/1]; LSE; ESRC [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC seminar series award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); LSE; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the ESRC seminar series award ES/M002209/1, 'Understanding the post-crisis landscape: assessing change in economic management, welfare, work and democracy' and the LSE hosted workshop, 'Wages in the EMU' for supporting the discussion of ideas which contributed to this paper.",,94,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

First identified as a promising antimalarial by the US Army in the 1970s, tafenoquine has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the radical cure of vivax malaria - the first product to receive marketing authorization for this indication in more than 65 years. The new drug is the result of a collaboration between the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and the not-for-profit organization Medicines for Malaria Venture, with the financial support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The successful development of tafenoquine, the paper argues, signals an important transition within the global health era: from the chemotherapeutic humanitarianism that characterized pharmaceutical efforts against malaria in the early 2000s, towards a period of drug discovery driven by the promise of global disease eradication. The paper uses the example of tafenoquine to advance a more general argument about the multiple and evolving pharmaceutical conjugations of malaria - the articulation of competing visions of the disease around the capabilities (and limitations) of particular molecules.","[Lezaun, Javier] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England",University of Oxford,"Lezaun, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, 64 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",javier.lezaun@insis.ox.ac.uk,,,European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [263447]; European Research Council (ERC) [263447] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This research was supported by the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (grant agreement no. 263447: BioProperty).,,43,7,8,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using hand-collected subsidy data on Chinese listed companies, we find that firms receiving more subsidies tend to have a lower cost of debt. However, such firms fail to have superior financial performance. Instead, firms with more subsidies tend to be overstaffed, which demonstrates higher social performance. These results are mainly driven by non-tax-based subsidies rather than tax-based subsidies. Overall, our results suggest that the Chinese government uses non-tax-based subsidies to achieve its social policy objectives at the expense of firms' profitability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite commonly held negative perceptions, the available evidence indicates that HFT and algorithmic trading may have several beneficial effects on markets. However, these types of trading may cause instabilities in financial markets in specific circumstances. Carefully chosen regulatory measures are needed to address concerns in the shorter term.

From a US societal perspective, this analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Methods: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises on preventive treatment, off preventive treatment, and death health states across a 10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated. Results: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998. VBP estimates including the placebo effect and excluding work productivity ranged from $7,445-$13,809; increasing to $12,151-$18,589 with onabotulinumtoxinA as a comparator in chronic migraine. Conclusion: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC.","[Lipton, Richard B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Van Etten 3C12, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Brennan, Alan] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England; [Porter, Joshua K.; Villa, Guillermo] Amgen Europe GmbH, Econ Modeling Ctr Excellence, Global Hlth Econ, Zug, Switzerland; [Sapra, Sandhya; Shah, Neel] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Tepper, Stewart] Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Headache Ctr, Dept Neurol, 1 Med Ctr Dr, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA; [Dodick, David] Mayo Clin, Scottsdale, AZ USA",Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; University of Sheffield; University of York - UK; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen; Dartmouth College; Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic Phoenix,"Lipton, RB (通讯作者)，Albert Einstein Coll Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Van Etten 3C12, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",richard.lipton@einstein.yu.edu,"Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009; Lipton, Richard B/B-5060-2011; Lipton, Richard Bruce/AAY-2818-2021","Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),The study was funded by Amgen Inc.,,45,36,36,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

These frameworks include cultural norms, life course effects and material exchange. The paper is based on 19 in-depth qualitative family case studies, which are linked to a wider set of quantitative survey data. Care arrangements and bargaining processes are revealed to be highly gendered, and largely conform to prevailing cultural norms. Rather than neutral and objective, the self-identified role as main carer is found to be subjective and potentially ambiguous. The few men who self-identify as main carers are more likely to play an indirect, organisational role than engage directly in daily care. As such, bargaining mainly relates to which woman performs the main care role, and large family networks mean that there is usually more than one candidate carer. Bargaining can occur inter-generationally and conjugally, but bargaining between siblings is of particular importance. Bargaining is framed by the uncertain trajectory of older people's care needs, and arrangements are sometimes reconfigured in response to changing care needs or family circumstances. Taking the narratives at face value, the influence of life course effects on bargaining and care arrangements is more obvious than material exchange. There are, however, indications that economic considerations, particularly inheritance, still play an important behind the scenes role.","[Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Earlham Rd,Arts Bldg, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mayston, Rosie; Prince, Martin] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Acosta, Alberto; Luisa Sosa, Ana; Montes de Oca, Veronica] Natl Inst Neurol & Neurosurg, Lab Dementias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gallardo, Sara; Guerra, Mariella] Inst Memoria & Desordenes Relacionados, Lima, Peru",University of East Anglia; University of London; King's College London,"Lloyd-Sherlock, P (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Earlham Rd,Arts Bldg, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",p.lloyd-sherlock@uea.ac.uk,"Guerra, Mariella/E-3582-2010; Prince, Martin J/A-9170-2010; Ortiz, Ana Luisa Sosa/AAU-9376-2021; Castillo, Gilberto Isaac Acosta/CAA-2728-2022; Mayston, Rosie/N-2414-2013","Ortiz, Ana Luisa Sosa/0000-0003-3930-3618; Castillo, Gilberto Isaac Acosta/0000-0002-8664-9542; Mayston, Rosie/0000-0002-2758-0194; Guerra, Mariella/0000-0001-8923-349X; Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter/0000-0002-1367-0703",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-167-25- 0]; ESRC [ES/I034331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [RES-167-25- 0];,,75,15,16,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

As HE undergoes a process of marketisation, and the teaching and research activities of academics are increasingly measured and scrutinised, the contemporary academy appears to be suffused with anxiety. Coupled with pressures facing all staff, 34% of academic employees are currently working on a fixed-term contract and so must contend with the multiple forms of uncertainty associated with their so-called 'casualised' positions. While anxiety is often perceived as an individualised affliction for which employees are encouraged to take personal responsibility, the article argues that it should be conceptualised in two ways: firstly, as a symptom of wider processes at work in the neoliberalising sector; and secondly, as a lactic' of what Isin [(2004). The neurotic citizen. Citizenship Studies, 8 (3), 217-235] refers to as 'neuroliberal' governance. The article concludes by proposing that the figure of the 'neurotic academic' is emblematic of the contradictions facing the contemporary academy.","[Loveday, Vik] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Loveday, V (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",v.loveday@gold.ac.uk,,,British Academy [SG142753],British Academy,This work was supported by the British Academy [SG142753].,,71,94,97,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Although there is now some acknowledgment that the search for yield was the major driver of ABS and CDO growth in the United States, the same is not true of the U.S. ABCP market where other factors such as regulatory arbitrage on the part of banks or the safety and liquidity concerns of institutional investors are seen as having been the more important growth driving force. This article argues that the search for yield did play a crucial role in U.S. ABCP growth between 2004 and 2007. To back up this argument, the article points to four variables that were closely correlated with this growth: the federal funds rate; U.S. money market mutual funds asset holdings; the change in the geographical breakdown of the institutions supplying ABCP; and, finally, the change in the program breakdown of the ABCP market.","[Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ London, City Univ Polit Econ Res Ctr CITYPERC, London, England",City University London,,m.shabani@uel.ac.uk,,"Shabani, Mimoza/0000-0002-1601-8032",,,,,13,1,1,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

They include social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication infrastructures, supply chain logistics solutions, and cryptocurrencies. Analysis of platforms and their capitalization should take into account the ways they structure social practice as assets and the constitutive opacity of platforms as configured realities. It explores capitalization by focusing on the problems of counting people and things on platforms. Via a case study of the software repository platform [Github. com] (https://github. com), it analyzes how 'platform numbers' participate in capitalization. It describes attempts to enumerate the elements of the platform by counting, mapping or listing them. The paper shows how attempts to enumerate people and things encounter forms of association, duplication, combination, imitation and configuration that are crucial to the ensemble but remain refractory to capitalization. It proposes configurative enumeration of the platform numbers as a way of conceptualizing these un-enacted excesses. In a configurative enumeration, the composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and commutation, and constant relating, repairing and adjusting of configurations crucial to the ongoing formation of platforms come into view. Configurative enumerations engage the inventive realities of platformization, realities that precede and sometimes overflow their capitalization.","[Mackenzie, Adrian] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Mackenzie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England.",a.mackenzie@lancaster.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007912/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007912/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K007912/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007912/1] for the project 'Metacommuniities of Code'.,,66,16,19,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

We first discuss the foundations of this theory on the basis of the most popular growth models, and then perform a long-run regression analysis of wealth inequality using Piketty and Zucman's data and a new historical data set for the OECD countries covering the period since 1870 onwards. We find that the wealth-to-income ratio, beta, is significantly related to the ratio between the saving rate, alpha, and the rate of income growth, g. The estimated coefficient for the s/g ratio ranges from 0.05 to 0.18, depending on the specification, while the theory predicts a unitary value. It is also shown that the wealth-to-income ratio responds to the variations in income growth much more than to variations in the saving rate.","[Madsen, Jakob B.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Minniti, Antonio] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Venturini, Francesco] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Venturini, Francesco] NIESR, London, England",Monash University; University of Bologna; University of Perugia,"Venturini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.;Venturini, F (通讯作者)，NIESR, London, England.",francesco.venturini@unipg.it,"Minniti, Antonio/HKM-3586-2023; Venturini, Francesco/AFC-0519-2022","Venturini, Francesco/0000-0002-7295-268X; Madsen, Jakob/0000-0002-4952-3043","Australian Research Council [DP170100339, DP150100061]",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council [grant numbers DP170100339 and DP150100061 to J.B.M.].,,40,7,7,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Drawing on extensive fieldwork and 42 key informant interviews sides, we explain this outcome with reference to the logic of competitive influence-seeking: Russia is currently unable to achieve a friendly and stable regime in Kyiv and thus hedges against the consolidation of an unfriendly pro-Western and stable regime by maintaining its control over parts of eastern Ukraine and solidifying the dependence of local regimes there on Russian support. This gives Russia the opportunity to maintain the current status quo or settle for re-integration terms through which Russia can sustain long-term influence over Ukraine's domestic and foreign policy. We conclude by reflecting on the consequences of competitive influence-seeking in the post-Soviet space: the likely persistence of low-intensity conflict in Ukraine; the further consolidation of territorial divisions in other post-Soviet conflicts; and the need for policy-makers in Russia and the West to prioritize the management of the consequent instability.","[Malyarenko, Tatyana] Natl Univ, Odessa Law Acad, Odessa, Ukraine; [Wolff, Stefan] Univ Birmingham, Inst Conflict Cooperat & Secur, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; National University Odesa Law Academy; University of Birmingham,"Wolff, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Inst Conflict Cooperat & Secur, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",S.Wolff@bham.ac.uk,"Malyarenko, Tetyana/AAC-2003-2019; Wolff, Stefan/ABD-5890-2021","Wolff, Stefan/0000-0001-9931-5309; Malyarenko, Tetyana/0000-0002-5346-1180","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M009211/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J020710/1, ES/M009211/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M009211/1, ES/J020710/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M009211/1].,,57,56,58,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Through multilevel logistic models, we find that the coefficient of violence depends on the municipality in where adolescents reside or resided. We conclude that violence promotes the transition to childbearing particularly among rural females.

This decision is affected by the underlying preferences of the husband and wife. We use survey data from a sample of parents in the metropolitan area of Bilbao (Spain) to estimate a bargaining discrete choice model. The collected data set contains hypothetical school choices gathered in the form of a typical discrete choice experiment (stated preferences) and the actual school choice (revealed preferences). Stated preference data are obtained separately for husbands and wives, but the revealed preference choice is taken jointly.

Secondly, the results obtained for the revealed preferences deviate from the stated preferences for some school characteristics.

We develop a new empirical methodology to (i) detect if these markets are integrated, i.e., if all the spatial arbitrage opportunities between the two markets are being exploited, and (ii) decompose the observed spatial price differences into factors such as transportation costs, transportation bottlenecks, and the oligopolistic behavior of the arbitrageurs. Our framework incorporates a new test for the presence of market power and it is thus able to distinguish between physical and strategic behavior constraints on marginal cost pricing. We use the case of the Interconnector pipeline linking Belgium and the UK as an application. Our empirical findings show that all the arbitrage opportunities between the two zones are being exploited but confirm the presence of market power.","[Massol, Olivier] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Av Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Massol, Olivier] IFP Sch, Ctr Econ & Management, 228-232 Av Napoleon Bonaparte, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Massol, Olivier; Banal-Estanol, Albert] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Banal-Estanol, Albert] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",IFP Energies Nouvelles; IFP Energies Nouvelles; City University London; Pompeu Fabra University,"Massol, O (通讯作者)，IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Av Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.;Massol, O (通讯作者)，IFP Sch, Ctr Econ & Management, 228-232 Av Napoleon Bonaparte, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.;Massol, O (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",olivier.massol@ifpen.fr,"Banal-Estanol, Albert/D-7578-2013","MASSOL, Olivier/0000-0002-9611-7312",French Energy Council; Chair The Economics of Natural Gas,French Energy Council; Chair The Economics of Natural Gas,"This paper has greatly benefited from the judicious comments of two anonymous referees and the editors.

We find that large, diversified publicly traded firms increase their scope during times of high external capital market frictions, such as in the recent Great Recession. Moreover, during these times firms diversify their investment needs and cash flow across industries. We also find similar phenomena outside diversified public firms. Examining the mergers and acquisitions activity of stand-alone and diversified private firms, we uncover similar patterns. In aggregate data, we find that the composition of mergers shifts from focused to diversifying and back with changes in external market conditions. Our evidence is broadly consistent with the notion that firms diversify their scope in response to tightening in external capital markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The main effect of this change will be to put more onus on the individual to make sure they have sufficient resources to last for their retirement, but it also removes the obligation to annuitise their funds at any future age. This paper is concerned with how people can best use their pension pots by aligning them to their personal financial objectives and longevity risks. It finds that for most people annuitising is not the best option, except for a few circumstances, and that draw down is preferable, especially where there is a bequest motive and the individual has assets such as property to fall back on. These options are low risk if simple rules are followed but they are not a substitute for professional advice and should only be used in conjunction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The literature has tended to explain this through skill-biased technical change (SBTC). Empirical work has concentrated around two variants: (1) capital-skill complementarity, (2) skill-augmenting technical change. Our purpose is to nest and discriminate between these two explanations. We do so in the framework of multilevel Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function, where factors are disaggregated into skilled and unskilled labor, and capital into structures and equipment capital. Using a five-equation system approach and several nesting alternatives, we retrieve estimates of the substitution elasticities and technical changes. Our estimations can produce results in line with capital-skill-complementarity hypothesis. However, those results are outperformed where the only source of the widening skill premium has been skill-augmenting technical change. We also show that the different explanations for SBTC have different implications for projected developments of the premium.","[McAdam, Peter] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [McAdam, Peter] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Willman, Alpo] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",European Central Bank; University of Surrey; University of Kent,"McAdam, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Sonnemannstr, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,25,13,13,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Not only do the new nobles hold the power of wealth but, through mega-giving, they generate a moral imagery akin to religious figures who ostensibly self-sacrifice for the good of everyone else. This generates a form of charismatic authority that affords the super-rich an influential space from which to spread a theodicy of privilege' - shielding growing wealth concentration from criticism and sanctifying the claim that individual mega-wealth is collectively beneficial. Through its contribution to and facilitation of the inegalitarian status quo, this theodicy engenders various forms of structural violence. Here we explore the mechanisms that enable wealthy donors to position themselves as apparent benefactors of humanity, including a reliance on metrics that appear to justify the claim that targeted philanthropic expenditures can and are reducing global wealth and health inequalities, but which raise unanswered questions surrounding the actual effects of the outcomes claimed.","[McGoey, Linsey; Thiel, Darren] Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"McGoey, L (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",lmcgoey@essex.ac.uk; djthiel@essex.ac.uk,"thiel, darren/GQZ-1552-2022","Thiel, Darren/0000-0003-4531-5420",,,,,89,29,31,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A systematic search of the following online databases was performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Scopus, Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Science. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they described a decision-analytic model evaluating both the costs and benefits associated with an intervention or prevention for atopic eczema. Data were extracted using a standardised form by two independent reviewers, whilst quality was assessed using the model-specific Philips criteria. Twenty-four models were identified, evaluating either preventions (n = 12) or interventions (n = 12): 14 reported using a Markov modelling approach, four utilised decision trees and one a discrete event simulation, whilst five did not specify the approach. The majority, 22 studies, reported that the intervention was dominant or cost effective, given the assumptions and analytical perspective taken. Notably, the models tended to be short-term (16 used a time horizon of <= 1 year), often providing little justification for the limited time horizon chosen. The methodological and reporting quality of the studies was generally weak, with only seven studies fulfilling more than 50% of their applicable Philips criteria.

It contends that current arguments for taxing the informal economy suffer from a Eurocentric understanding of taxation and state formation, and a fiscally essentialist and undifferentiated notion of the informal economy. Drawing on fieldwork in northern Nigeria, this paper shows that history, gender, wealth and ethno-religious identity influence how taxing the informal economy shapes governance outcomes. Evidence from Nigeria suggests an inverse relationship between informal economy taxation and political voice, posing the risk that increased taxation will exacerbate social divisions rather than rebuild the social contract.","[Meagher, Kate] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Meagher, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.meagher@lse.ac.uk,,,"Nigeria Research Network (NRN), University of Oxford; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs","Nigeria Research Network (NRN), University of Oxford; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs","I would like to thank the Nigeria Research Network (NRN), University of Oxford, and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs for organising and funding earlier research carried out through the Islam Research Programme (http://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/research/research-networks/nrn).

In this paper we seek to identify structural properties of instances of stable matching problems which will allow us to design efficient algorithms using elementary techniques. We focus on the setting in which all agents involved in some matching problem can be partitioned into k different types, where the type of an agent determines his or her preferences, and agents have preferences over types (which may be refined by more detailed preferences within a single type). This situation would arise in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small collection of agents' attributes. We also consider a generalisation in which each agent may consider some small collection of other agents to be exceptional, and rank these in a way that is not consistent with their types; this could happen in practice if agents have prior contact with a small number of candidates. We show that (for the case without exceptions), the well-known NP-hard matching problem Max SMTI (that of finding the maximum cardinality stable matching in an instance of stable marriage with ties and incomplete lists) belongs to the parameterised complexity class FPT when parameterised by the number of different types of agents needed to describe the instance. This tractability result can be extended to the setting in which each agent promotes at most one exceptional candidate to the top of his/her list (when preferences within types are not refined), but the problem remains NP-hard if preference lists can contain two or more exceptions and the exceptional candidates can be placed anywhere in the preference lists.","[Meeks, Kitty] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Rastegari, Baharak] Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Glasgow; University of Southampton,"Rastegari, B (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.",kitty.meeks@glasgow.ac.uk; b.rastegari@soton.ac.uk,,"Rastegari, Baharak/0000-0002-0985-573X; Meeks, Kitty/0000-0001-5299-3073",Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Government),Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Government),The first author is supported by a Personal Research Fellowship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh (funded by the Scottish Government).

Commercial attention on ethnic and racial minorities has resulted in products and services specifically developed for them. Here, we focus on this by exploring two empirical examples: US pharmaceutical clinical trials and UK stem cell transplantation. Both use racial taxonomies to discern biological difference and draw conclusions about the economic potential of people's genetic constitutions. They do so by appealing to racialised minorities' sense of responsibility towards their' communities, both buttressing the conflation of social and biological registers of human variation and demonstrating neoliberalism's mobilisation of discourses of community. However, while the inclusion of racialised minorities is hoped to bring economic benefits, it also aims to address healthcare inequalities. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies, we argue that in our examples, economic, social and cultural values cannot be disentangled. This compels us to complement narratives of the commodification of racialised difference in neoliberal (consumer) culture, and focus on the intersections between different economic and ethical values. Ultimately we find that whilst work is being done to ameliorate racial inequities, broader socio-economic and political inequalities minority communities face go unaddressed, likely precluding the realisation of health equality.","[Merz, Sibille] Goldsmiths Univ London, Sociol Dept, London, England; [Williams, Ros] Univ Sheffield, Dept Sociol Studies, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London; University of Sheffield,"Merz, S (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Sociol Dept, London, England.",sibille.merz@gold.ac.uk,,"Williams, Ros/0000-0002-4295-2582",,,,,57,7,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Under all less-than-unanimity rules, expected payoffs are either decreasing or first increasing and then decreasing in disagreement values. We conduct experiments involving three players using majority and unanimity rule,,finding qualitative support for several, but not all, of our main predictions.

The conundrum this paper addresses is the rather limited impact of oil exploitation in Ghana despite the country's strong democratic record and internationally acclaimed oil governance legislation. The reasons for this lie in the nature of elite-based political coalitions and we root our analysis of Ghana's hydrocarbons in the political settlements literature, which moves us beyond the good governance' approaches so often linked to resource curse' thinking. We also move beyond the instrumentalism of political settlements theory to examine the role political ideas play in shaping resource governance.

Alongside compulsory increases in the statutory retirement age, governments have used incentives to encourage workers to postpone voluntarily their exit from employment, deferring their Basic State Pension in exchange for the additional financial reward of an enhanced pension at a later point in time. The impact of pension deferral upon the sustainability of the state pension system is dependent on the interplay of short-term savings from payment delay and increased subsequent longer-term payments to pension recipients. This article presents a model that simulates the financial effect of deferral uptake on the National Insurance Fund over a 40-year projection under alternative scenarios, including current and revised post-2016 deferral incentives. The findings indicate that the recent change in enhancement rate from 10.4 per cent to 5.8 per cent will significantly impact on state pension sustainability while still providing an incentive to defer. We estimate that any reduction below 4 per cent would result in zero uptake of the deferral option, based on a rational financial choice.","[Moizer, Jonathan; Farrar, Sue; Hyde, Mark] Plymouth Univ, Fac Business, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Moizer, J (通讯作者)，Plymouth Univ, Fac Business, Plymouth, Devon, England.",jmoizer@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Moizer, Jonathan/0000-0001-7451-378X",,,,,19,5,5,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While some contemporary developments in pricing draw on understandings of the person that are quite familiar, others are novel and likely to be contested. We argue that many newer pricing techniques make it harder for consumers to identify themselves as part of a recognized group. We conclude that contemporary price personalization should be understood in terms of the intensification of individualization in combination with dividualization, and as such, contributes to novel and consequential forms of classification.","[Moor, Liz] Goldsmiths Univ London, London SE14 6NW, England; [Lury, Celia] Univ Warwick, Ctr Interdisciplinary Methodol, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London; University of Warwick,"Moor, L (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, London SE14 6NW, England.",l.moor@gold.ac.uk,"Lury, Celia/C-2719-2019","Lury, Celia/0000-0001-7630-5597",ESRC [ES/K010689/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,28,28,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Several arguments on the macroeconomic drivers of household debt have been put forward, and most have been empirically tested, albeit in isolation of each other. This article empirically tests 7 competing hypotheses on the macroeconomic determinants of household indebtedness together in one econometric study. Existing arguments suggest that residential house prices, upward movements in the prices of assets demanded by households, the income share of the top 1%, falling wages, the rolling back of the welfare state, the age structure of the population, and the short-term interest rate drive household indebtedness. We formulate these arguments as hypotheses and test them for a panel of 13 OECD countries over the period 1993-2011 using error correction models. We also investigate whether effects differ in boom and bust phases of the debt and house price cycles. The results show that the most robust macroeconomic determinant of household debt is real residential house prices, and that the phase of the debt and house price cycles plays a role in household debt accumulation.","[Moore, Glenn Lauren] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Stockhammer, Engelbert] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of London; King's College London,"Moore, GL (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, London, England.",glenniemoore.gm@gmail.com,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",EPOG programme,EPOG programme,"The authors thank Alexander Guschanski, Rafael Wildauer and two anonymous referees for valuable comments, and acknowledge the support of the EPOG programme.

Instead of being considered a problematic (potentially lethal) means of control, it is re-defined into a life-saving device. The ensuing rescue-through-interdiction'/rescue-without-protection' paradigm alters the nature of human rights, which, rather than functioning as a check on interdiction, end up co-opted as another securitization/humanitarianization tool.","[Moreno-Lax, Violeta] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Moreno-Lax, V (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Law, Law, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.;Moreno-Lax, V (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Law, Immigrat Law Programme, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",v.moreno-lax@qmul.ac.uk,"Moreno-Lax, Violeta/AAB-4604-2021","Moreno-Lax, Violeta/0000-0002-0042-7907",,,,,123,87,90,4,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, observed inequalities of access by socioeconomic status may result from differences in patients' choices. Using data on non-emergency coronary revascularisation procedures in the English National Health Service, we found substantive differences in waiting times within public hospitals between patients with different socioeconomic status: up to 35% difference, or 43 days, between the most and least deprived population quintile groups. Using selection models with differential distances as identification variables, we estimated that only up to 12% of these waiting time inequalities can be attributed to patients' choices of hospital and type of treatment (heart bypass versus stent). Residual inequality, after allowing for choice, was economically significant: patients in the least deprived quintile group benefited from shorter waiting times and the associated health benefits were worth up to 850 per person.

METHODS: We synthesized findings from all cognitive interview and usability studies performed by a contract research organization between 2012 and 2015: 53 studies comprising 68 unique instruments and 101 instrument evaluations. We summarized study findings to make recommendations for best practice and future validation requirements. RESULTS: Five studies (9%) identified minor findings during cognitive interview that may possibly affect instrument measurement properties. All findings could be addressed by application of ePRO best practice, such as eliminating scrolling, ensuring appropriate font size, ensuring suitable thickness of visual analogue scale lines, and providing suitable instructions. Similarly, regarding solution usability, 49 of the 53 studies (92%) recommended no changes in display clarity, navigation, operation, and completion without help. Reported usability findings could be eliminated by following good product design such as the size, location, and responsiveness of navigation buttons. CONCLUSIONS: With the benefit of accumulating evidence, it is possible to relax the need to routinely conduct cognitive interview and usability studies when implementing minor changes during instrument migration. Application of design best practice and selecting vendor solutions with good user interface and user experience properties that have been assessed in a representative group may enable many instrument migrations to be accepted without formal validation studies by instead conducting a structured expert screen review.

To this end, we develop an extended factor augmented vector autoregression (VAR) model that simultaneously allows the estimation of a measure of uncertainty and its time-varying impact on a range of variables. We find that the impact of uncertainty shocks on real activity and financial variables has declined systematically over time. In contrast, the response of inflation and the short-term interest rate to this shock has remained fairly stable. Simulations from a nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model suggest that these empirical results are consistent with an increase in the monetary authorities' antiinflation stance and a flattening of the Phillips curve.

We utilise original archival material to analyse the activities of the German public development bank, the Kreditantstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), in order to shed light on an important, but neglected aspect of German industrial policy. We analyse how the KfW responded to multiple challenges after the rise of economic globalisation, including a funding crisis, international agreements to limit export subsidies and Europeanisation. We argue that KfW successfully managed to navigate these challenges in order to retain, and even increase, its ability to conduct selective industrial policy in the post-1980s era. This was possible because of Germany's hard currency and low sovereign credit risk, large market size, which was augmented by membership in the European Union, and Germany's position as regional hegemon within Europe. More broadly, this shows how, conditional on domestic politics, advanced economies are able to shape and exploit the rules of the international economic system to implement industrial policies to their advantage, even as developing countries are given the opposite policy recommendations.","[Naqvi, Natalya] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England; [Henow, Anne; Chang, Ha-Joon] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Cambridge, England; [Chang, Ha-Joon] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Naqvi, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England.",,,"naqvi, natalya/0000-0003-0821-070X",DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies; German Federal Foreign Office (FFO),DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies; German Federal Foreign Office (FFO),This work was partly funded by the DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies with funds from the German Federal Foreign Office (FFO).,,150,29,30,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Based on the seminal work of Lewis (2014), the author uses it to explain the sectoral specialisation of home countries and their firms and MNEs. Design/methodology/approach The paper is multi-disciplinary and entirely conceptual, with cool ideas but very few numbers and equations. Findings Emerging economies exhibit a duality in their economic structure that reflects itself in two largely different sets of location (L) characteristics. They are simultaneously home to both traditional sectors, which are resource and labour intensive, as well as modern sectors, which are knowledge and capital intensive, each of which can be analysed as having two sub-economies. These different sets of location advantages shape the firm-specific advantages of EMNEs and their FDI. Research limitations/implications This analysis helps to underline what shapes the ability of home countries to emerge, and the ability of their firms to grow and their MNEs to become internationally competitive. Few EMNEs can thrive in international markets without concurrent growth in their domestic markets. Maintaining the appropriate location assets to optimally support both types of sectors is costly. Each type of sub-economy requires different kinds of support sectors, infrastructure and policies, with little overlap. Weaknesses in its home country L advantages hinder the long-term competitiveness of their EMNEs. Practical implications Few EMNEs can thrive in international markets without concurrent growth in their domestic markets. Weaknesses in its home country L advantages hinder the long-term competitiveness of their EMNEs. Originality/value The extension of the Lewisian dual economy model allows a number of interesting new insights because it allows us to consider firms, non-firms, informality and the bottlenecks associated with promoting knowledge-intensive sectors in a globalised world. It emphasises structural change, and the need to manage pathways and effectively channel growth.","[Narula, Rajneesh] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Narula, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England.",r.narula@henley.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,9,9,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

These are of general significance to post Keynesians irrespective of the position they take on the specifics of the ergodicity debate.

The authors then consider some additional ways in which one can go beyond common practice based on the example of Forward Guidance in the United Kingdom and a more institutional approach to post Keynesian analysis.","[Nasir, Muhammad Ali] Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Econ Analyt & Int Business Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Morgan, Jamie] Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University; Leeds Beckett University,"Nasir, MA (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Econ Analyt & Int Business Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Nasir, Muhammad Ali/I-6252-2019","Nasir, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-2779-5854",,,,,62,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Moreover, waste-picking could provide a sustainable solution for solving the waste management crisis that affects the 3 billion people lacking access to waste services. Governmental policies toward waste-pickers in particular, and the informal economy in general, have been fundamentally based on four policy approaches: (1) dualist and voluntarist, which proposes repressive policies against waste-picker activity and the expansion of formal solid waste management systems; (2) structuralist, which argues for weak supporting policies aimed at reinforcing waste-picker associations; (3) legalist, which promotes the competition of waste picking with other recycling alternatives without government intervention; and (4) co-production, which supports waste-picking with local policies as a means of enhancing waste-pickers' productivity. Both qualitative, and particularly quantitative evidence testing the impact of these four approaches is scarce. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by operationalizing concepts, building a waste-picker sustainable performance index, and estimating the impacts of these four competing policy approaches. An exploratory sequential design method is used to analyze data: first, a thematic analysis to examine 40 in-depth interviews, and then multiple linear regressions to analyze a census survey of 100 waste-pickers in four cooperatives in Santiago de Chile. Our empirical results suggest a positive association between the level of government support and waste-pickers' sustainable performance. Consequently, further positive government intervention, particularly in supporting a stronger structural organization for the waste-picker recycling system, is advocated as the primary policy recommendation of this paper.

Markov and discrete event simulation (DES) models were compared to investigate the impact of innovative modeling on the cost-effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Fingolimod was compared to dimethyl fumarate (DMF; in highly active [HA] RRMS), alemtuzumab (in HA RRMS) and natalizumab (in rapidly evolving severe RRMS). Comparator DMTs were chosen to reflect different dosing regimens. Materials and methods: Markov and DES models used have been published previously. Inputs were aligned in all relevant respects, with differences in the modeling of event-triggered attributes, such as relapse-related retreatment, which is inherently difficult with a memoryless Markov approach. Outcomes were compared, with and without different attributes. Results: All results used list prices. For fingolimod and DMF, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were comparable (Markov: 4206 pound/quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained versus DES: 3910 pound/QALY gained). Deviations were observed when long-term adverse events (AEs) were incorporated in the DES (Markov: 25,412 pound saved/QALY lost, versus DES: 34,209 pound saved/QALY lost, fingolimod versus natalizumab; higher ICERs indicate greater cost-effectiveness). For fingolimod versus alemtuzumab, when relapse-triggered retreatment was included in the DES, large cost differences were observed (difference between incremental cost is 35,410 pound and QALY is 0.10). Limitations: UK payer perspective, therefore societal approach was not considered. Resource utilization and utilities for both models were not derived from the subpopulations; as the focus is on model type, input limitations that apply to both models are less relevant. Conclusions: Whilst no model can fully represent a disease, a DES allows an opportunity to include features excluded in a Markov structure. A DES may be more suitable for modeling in RRMS for health technology assessment purposes given the complexity of some DMTs. This analysis highlights the capabilities of different model structures to model event-triggered attributes.","[Noon, Kathleen Mary] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, London, England; [Montgomery, Stephen Maxwell] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, Cambridge, England; [Adlard, Nicholas Edward] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Kroes, Michel Anton] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley Business Pk, Camberley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England",Costello Medical Consulting; Costello Medical Consulting; Novartis; Novartis,"Kroes, MA (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley Business Pk, Camberley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England.",michel.kroes@novartis.com,"; Montgomery, Stephen/B-5683-2011","Kroes, Michel/0000-0002-1381-9184; Adlard, Nicholas/0000-0001-6912-1685; Montgomery, Stephen/0000-0002-8481-5850",Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd.,Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd.,This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd.,,69,4,4,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

To motivate the analyses, we present a simple theoretical model that highlights the special features of interest rate risk. Consistent with the theory, we find that firms that issue more fixed rate debt have higher liquidity ratios and lower operating income ratios. We also document that individual firms actively vary the proportion of their fixed rate debt to a strikingly high extent. There is a debate as to whether such variation should be interpreted as hedging or speculation. We show that the firms more actively varying their debt mix respond to different hedging motives than those with low activity. We then empirically motivate an alternative indicator of speculative activity: co-variation between ex-post profitability of financial decisions and operating results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We identify some striking similarities for Canada, England, the Netherlands, and Spain in terms of (a) the relative importance of the 5 dimensions; (b) the relative utility decrements across the 5 levels; and (c) the scale length. On the basis of the observed similarities across these 4 Western countries, we develop an amalgam model, WePP (western preference pattern), and compare it with these 4 value sets. The values generated by this model show a high degree of concordance with those of England, Canada, and Spain. Patient level data were obtained from the Multi-Instrument Comparison project, which includes participants from 6 countries in 7 disease groups (N=7,933): The WePP values lie within the confidence intervals for the value sets in Canada, England, and Spain across the whole severity distribution.

We discuss an evolving ecology of 'external' research taking place 'between' the academy and commercial consultancy. We then contextualise this as waves of research methodologies and consultancy for the cultural sector. The new model of 'external between' consultancy research for policy is not only placed between the University and the market, but also facilitates discourse between policy sectors, government, the media and the academy. Specifically, it enables seductive but selective arguments for advocacy that claim authority through academic affiliation, yet are not evaluated for robustness. To critically engage with an emergent form of what Stone calls 'causal stories', we replicate a publicly funded externally commissioned SROI model that argues for the value of cultural activities to well-being. We find that the author's operationalisation of participation and well-being are crucial, yet their representation of the relationship problematic, and their estimates questionable. This case study 're-performs' econometric modelling national-level survey data for the cultural sector to reveal practices that create norms of expertise for policy-making that are not rigorous. We conclude that fluid claims to authority allow experimental econometric models and measures to perform across the cultural economy as if ratified. This new model of advocacy research requires closer academic consideration given the changing research funding structures and recent attention to expertise and the contracting out of public services.","[Oman, Susan] Univ Manchester, Dept Sociol, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Taylor, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Methods Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Manchester; University of Sheffield,"Oman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Sociol, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",susan.oman@manchester.ac.uk,,"Taylor, Mark/0000-0001-5943-9796; Oman, Susan/0000-0002-5723-0830",Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Large Project [AH/J005401/1]; AHRC [AH/J005401/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Large Project; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Large Project funding for Understanding Everyday Participation: Articulating Cultural Values, 2012-2017 [grant number AH/J005401/1].",,71,19,19,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Drawing on relational theory, we identify four dimensions of ethnicity that are each important in distinctive ways in Ukraine: individual language preference, language embeddedness, ethnolinguistic identity, and nationality. Using original survey data collected in May 2014, we show that the choice of one over the other can be highly consequential for the conclusions one draws about ethnicity's role in shaping attitudes (e.g. to NATO membership), actions (e.g. participation in the Euromaidan protests), and the anticipation of outgroups' behavior (e.g. expectations of a Russian invasion). Moreover, we call attention to the importance of including the right control variables for precisely interpreting any posited effects of ethnicity, making specific recommendations for future survey research on ethnic identity in Ukraine.","[Onuch, Olga] Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Hale, Henry E.] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Manchester; George Washington University,"Onuch, O (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Polit, Manchester, Lancs, England.",olga.onuch@manchester.ac.uk,"Onuh, Ol'ga/A-2726-2015","Onuh, Ol'ga/0000-0002-6442-035X",National Science Foundation [SES-1445194],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number SES-1445194].,,79,39,43,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Design/methodology/approach - The author uses static and dynamic regression estimation to test for the determinants of bank loan loss provisions. Findings - The author finds that non-performing loans (NPL), loan-to-asset ratio and loan growth are significant non-discretionary drivers of bank provisions in the African region. The author observes that bank provision is a positive function of NPL up to a threshold beyond which bank provisions will no longer increase as NPL increases. Also, bank loan-to-asset ratio is a significant driver of bank provisions when African banks have higher loan-to-asset ratios. The author finds that larger banks in financially developed African countries have fewer loan loss provisions while increase in bank lending leads to fewer bank provisions in countries with strong investor protection. Finally, higher bank lending is associated with higher bank provisions during economic boom. Originality/value - This study is the first to assess the determinants of non-discretionary bank provisions in Africa as part of micro-prudential surveillance of banks in the African region.","[Ozili, Peterson K.] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Ozili, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",petersonkitakogelu@yahoo.com,"Ozili, Peterson/A-8418-2015",,,,,,40,18,18,4,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

By contrast with existing interpretations, the argument is that for Genovesi virtue is a significant ordering device of the polity: virtue mediates between passions and reason, and the human capacity for virtue helps individuals better to realise their different talents. This, in turn, means that virtue is central to the division of labour and the right proportions between different activities, including the balance between consumption and trade.","[Pabst, Adrian] Univ Kent, Rutherford Coll, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Pabst, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Rutherford Coll, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England.",A.Pabst@kent.ac.uk,,"Pabst, Adrian/0000-0002-3153-1598",,,,,69,10,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

I develop a model of imperfect competition where a few oligopolistic firms coexist with a monopolistically competitive fringe. The former have a direct impact on the industry average price level, which depends on the breadth of their product scope. Oligopolists produce higher output per worker, charge higher markups, but also sell at higher prices than monopolistic single-product firms. Under linear demand, trade liberalization triggers the exit of small firms and the entry of foreign large firms, leading to more product variety but also to a higher average price. For a broad class of demand functions, the entry of an oligopolist induced by trade liberalization has a negative impact on consumer surplus. Producer surplus rises, but the total effect on welfare is ambiguous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In India, the number of ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) clinics has more than doubled over the past three years. This expansion has been accompanied by a similarly explosive growth in populist narratives that assert that one of the services offered by such clinics, commercial gestational surrogacy (CGS), is a form of labour that is so exceptional(ly) exploitative it should be banned. Provocative headlines proclaiming that surrogates are Renting their wombs' and Pimping their pregnancies' fuel such assertions, suggesting that surrogates become reduced to mere wombs, vessels for carrying the offspring of entitled and wealthy foreigners. Although superficially compelling, such arguments fail to withstand detailed interrogation. Utilizing insights from anthropology, the history of science and law and bringing to bear the findings of extended fieldwork in Mumbai, Jaipur and Delhi, I critically analyse three assertions made in relation to surrogacy: that it is (i) a particularly intimate or invasive form of bodily exploitation; (ii) a uniquely sacralized form of affective labour and (iii) a uniquely generative form of labour. In arguing against exceptionalism, I contend that such practices cannot be adjudged through application of universal ethical principles and norms, but rather must take account of the complexity of the lived experience of all the participants, placed in their sociological and geographical contexts.","[Parry, Bronwyn] Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Room 4-19 Bush House North East,40 Aldwych, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Parry, B (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Global Affairs, Room 4-19 Bush House North East,40 Aldwych, London, England.",bronwyn.parry@kcl.ac.uk,,"Parry, Bronwyn/0000-0001-8909-5701",Wellcome Trust [097733/B/11/Z]; Wellcome Trust [097733/B/11/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),The project entitled 'Investigating reproductive ethics in context: The Indian experience' was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number 097733/B/11/Z].,,37,14,15,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

When the amounts staked with bookmakers at fixed odds on the win and place are equal, it is called an each-way bet. Each-way bets are apparently popular with punters but inconsistent with prominent models of wagering which assume gamblers are everywhere risk-seeking. In this note, we derive the conditions for win and place bets to be optimal in these three models of risky choice. The mathematical conditions for the each-way wager to be optimal, as opposed to a win and place wager with different stakes, are complicated and appear likely to occur rarely in practice. However, bettors obviously see the attraction in giving themselves two ways to bet on the one horse or two ways to win and betting each way. We suggest part of the each-way' betting attraction is that they are quick and easy to compute - a heuristic - to solve an otherwise complex betting strategy.","[Peel, D.

The Institutional Effects of Services,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CORRUPTION; COUNTRIES; PEOPLE,"Whereas most studies find the poor in Africa to be more vulnerable to bribery because of their lower socio-economic status, this paper proposes institutional differences as an alternative explanation. Because poor people are unable to afford privately provided services, they must use public services. In relying on the state more often, the poor become more vulnerable to bribery. Analyses of Afrobarometer data show that the poor are not more likely to pay bribes for state monopolised services. The poor's disproportionate vulnerability to bribery for choice services is a function of their greater likelihood to have contact with the state.","[Peiffer, Caryn] Univ Birmingham, Int Dev Dept, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Rose, Richard] Univ Strathclyde Glasgow, Ctr Study Publ Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Birmingham; University of Strathclyde,"Peiffer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Int Dev Dept, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",c.peiffer@bham.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03482X/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03482X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I03482X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03482X/1].,,45,28,29,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Specifically, the aim of the paper is to study the relative utility of evidence about purchase intentions found in Google Trends versus those found in Twitter posts, for the problem of forecasting consumer expenditure. Our main findings are that, firstly, the Google Trends indicators and indicators extracted from Twitter are both beneficial for the forecasts: adding them as exogenous variables into regression model produces improvements on the pure AR baseline, consistently across all the forecast horizons. Secondly, we find that the Google Trends variables seem to be more useful predictors than the semantic variables extracted from Twitter posts, the differences in performance are significant, but not very large.","[Pekar, Viktor] Univ Birmingham, Business Sch, Finance Dept, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Pekar, V (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Business Sch, Finance Dept, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,"Pekar, Viktor/0000-0002-9664-1675",,,,,10,0,0,0,11,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,157,165,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8337,http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8337,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000477974500019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on archival research and interviews with bankers, regulators and legislators, we demonstrate how the EU convergence narrative was central in forming optimistic expectations. Fusing the underspecified convergence process with an orientalist geographical imaginary, this narrative and its associated measures translated growing indebtedness as catching up' with Europe, de-emphasized exchange rate risk through a belief in European convergence and precluded crisis scenarios originating in the European Union. Our findings contribute to theories of how economic expectations are formed, stabilized and maintained by developing the concept of spatializing the future', denoting practices that handle uncertainty by charting the future as movement in concrete geographical or abstract space, along externally verifiable pathways.","[Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Management & Org, Via Buffi 6, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Vargha, Zsuzsanna] ESCP Europe Business Sch, Management Control Dept, 79 Ave Republ, F-75543 Paris 11, France; [Vargha, Zsuzsanna] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Eotvos Lorand University; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; University of Leicester,"Pellandini-Simányi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Management & Org, Via Buffi 6, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.;Pellandini-Simányi, L (通讯作者)，Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",pellal@usi.ch; zvargha@escpeurope.eu,"Vargha, Zsuzsanna/ABH-2955-2021","Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena/0000-0002-5426-4103; Vargha, Zsuzsanna/0000-0002-1578-6531",Hungarian Scientific Research Funds [101261]; Bolyai Research grant [BO/00653/15]; Swiss National Science Foundation [171351],Hungarian Scientific Research Funds(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Bolyai Research grant(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Funds under Grant [101261], by the Bolyai Research grant [BO/00653/15] and by the Swiss National Science Foundation [171351].",,91,9,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We employ a dense class of distributions that we denominate Erlangized scale mixtures (ESM) that correspond to nonnegative and absolutely continuous distributions which can be written as a Mellin-Stieltjes convolution Pi * G of a nonnegative distribution 17 with an Erlang distribution G. A distinctive feature of such a class is that it contains heavy-tailed distributions. We suggest a simple methodology for constructing a sequence of distributions having the form Pi * G with the purpose of approximating the integrated tail distribution of the claim sizes. Then we adapt a recent result which delivers an explicit expression for the probability of ruin in the case that the claim size distribution is modeled as an Erlangized scale mixture. We provide simplified expressions for the approximation of the probability of ruin and construct explicit bounds for the error of approximation. We complement our results with a classical example where the claim sizes are heavy-tailed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to characterize health utilities in ACS patients to aid development of future economic models estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year impact of ACS events and potential treatments. Methods: Multi-center, non-interventional, longitudinal evaluation of health utility in patients experiencing ACS or stroke events. EuroQol-5 dimension 3 level (EQ-5D-3L) surveys were sent to patients (>= 18 years) from three UK centers, 1 month after hospital discharge for myocardial infarction (MD, unstable angina (UA), or stroke. Patient demographics, lifestyle, and baseline utility score were collected in the first survey. Follow-up surveys were sent at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months to prospectively capture utility and subsequent health events. Two methods of patient identification were adopted-prospective, where the patient's qualifying events occurred after the study index date, and retrospective, where the patient's qualifying event occurred prior to the study index date. General healthy population utility values were assumed for pre-event HRQoL. Results: Between January 2011 and March 2014, 2,103 prospectively (n=1,350)/retrospectively (n = 753) identified patients (mean age = 68.3 years; 67.9% male) responded: MI = 55.9% (n = 1 ,17 6), UA = 42.7% (n = 898), stroke =1.4% (n = 29); 24% had type 2 diabetes. Post-event utility values were lower than general healthy population values, although significant differences in utility between subsequent 6 (n = 1,031, change = -0.002), 12 (n = 1,096, change = -0.008), 18 (n =1,246, change = -0.007), and 24 (n = 1,277, change = -0.004) month timepoints were not detected. Through multivariate regression analyses, wheelchair use, current smoking, and secondary mental and joint health events were associated with the greatest statistically significant utility decrements. Conclusions: This study indicates that health utility decreases following a cardiovascular event and, although some improvement occurs over the subsequent 24 months, general healthy population utility is not necessarily attained.","[Pockett, Rhys D.] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Ray, Joshua; Shutler, Simon] F Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland; [Tran, Irwin] Roche Prod Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, England; [Martin, Steven] Peterborough & Stamford Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Peterborough, Cambs, England; [Yousef, Zaheer] Univ Hosp Wales, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Bakhai, Ameet] Royal Free London NHS Fdn Trust, Barnet, England",Swansea University; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; Roche Holding; Roche Holding; Cardiff University; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust,"Pockett, RD (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Coll Human & Hlth Sci, Swansea Ctr Hlth Econ, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",r.d.pockett@swansea.ac.uk,"Pockett, Rhys/F-1703-2018","Pockett, Rhys/0000-0003-4135-7383",Roche Products Ltd.,Roche Products Ltd.,This study was sponsored by Roche Products Ltd.

In the real world, however, arbitrage possibilities are often severely restricted and this may lead to substantial price heterogeneity. Here we focus on frictions that can be modeled as the bargaining constraints induced by an incomplete trading network. In this context, the interplay among the architecture of the trading network, the buyers' valuations, and the sellers' costs shapes the effective arbitrage possibilities of the economy. We characterize the configurations that, at an intertemporal bargaining equilibrium, lead to a uniform price. Conceptually, this characterization involves studying how the network positions and valuations/costs of any given set of buyers and sellers affect their collective bargaining power relative to a notional or benchmark situation in which the connectivity is complete. Mathematically, the characterizing conditions can be understood as price-based counterparts of those identified by the celebrated Marriage Theorem in matching theory.","[Polanski, Arnold] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Lombardia, Italy; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] IGIER, Milan, Lombardia, Italy",University of East Anglia; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Polanski, A (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",A.Polanski@uea.ac.uk,,"Polanski, Arnold/0000-0001-9146-6364",,,,,17,1,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

In particular, the monetary valuation and commodification of ecosystem services in form of payments for ecosystem services schemes and the development of new markets for ecosystem services has appreciated large popularity. However, who is behind this strong momentum towards ecosystem services and especially why is less well known. In this paper I aim to shed light on this by looking specifically at advocates of the concept of ecosystem services, using forestry in the United Kingdom (UK) as an example. I explore the motivations for accommodating or actively pursuing ecosystem services thinking in this important sector through interviews with forestry and conservation experts. Four prominent groups with a specific interest in the ecosystem services concept in the context of UK forestry are governmental organisations, non-governmental conservation organisations, private forest owners, and the timber and forest industry. These stakeholder groups are interested in this new perspective, chiefly, but not exclusively, because (1) it is required under international obligations; (2) it is in line with dominant market political philosophy; (3) it holds the promise to include the environment more fully into prevailing economic decision -making processes; (4) it can help to draw more attention to biodiversity conservation; (5) it holds the promise of new sources of income from both public and private sources; and (6) it can be used as a convenient argument to promote further tree planting. However, these groups have different, but frequently overlapping reasons for pursuing this new perspective. The results provide a baseline and important insights into who was embracing ecosystem services thinking and why during the early years of the adoption of this approach in the UK.

The analysis reaffirms that gender employment gaps in the UK respond to the business cycle, and it evaluates to what extent these short-term changes in the employment gap can be explained by the industry sectors and occupations where women and men work. A counterfactual analysis accounts for the specific role of combined gender segregation across industry sectors and occupations that existed at the onset of the Great Recession. The results contradict the existing narrative that men's employment was more harshly affected than women's employment; segregation accounts for over two and a half times the actual fall in the gender gap between 2007 and 2011.","[Razzu, Giovanni] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Singleton, Carl] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 30 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Reading; University of Edinburgh,"Razzu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",g.razzu@reading.ac.uk; carl.singleton@ed.ac.uk,,"Singleton, Carl/0000-0001-8247-8830",Economic and Social Research Council (UK) [ES/J500136/1],Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Drawing on feminist critiques of biopolitics, the paper proposes reproduction as a missing link that ties Becker's homo economicus to the aggregate question of population. It argues that Becker's work challenged macroeconomic theories of fertility by figuring reproduction, and hence population patterns, as governed by the personal utility-maximizing decisions of individuals. It further examines how his approach to fertility inaugurated reproductive decision-making as a regulatory node of population quality, one also tied to a particular sex, race and class politics. Finally, the paper briefly analyses the relationship between Becker's contribution and today's focus on women's reproductive and productive decision-making in population governance in the context of development.","[Repo, Jemima] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Repo, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",jemima.repo@ncl.ac.uk,,"Repo, Jemima/0000-0001-7598-6589","Academy of Finland [285830, 268181]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [285830, 268181] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This research was supported by the Academy of Finland [grant numbers 285830 and 268181].,,81,12,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In contrast, I argue that while the private turn might have led to a decline in democratic or public accountability, it did not bring an end to all forms of accountability. Specifically, I suggest that philanthropists' involvement in global health has led to the spread of another, new form of accountability: epidemiological accountability. The latter is a combination of two regimes of expertise and practices hitherto kept separate: audit and epidemiology. To substantiate this argument, I draw on my research on the Bloomberg Initiative - a global effort to reduce tobacco use spearheaded by the Bloomberg and Gates foundations.","[Reubi, David] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Room 2-4,East Wing Bldg, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Reubi, D (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Room 2-4,East Wing Bldg, London WC2R 2LS, England.",david.reubi@kcl.ac.uk,,"Reubi, David/0000-0001-7314-4978",Wellcome Trust Society & Ethics Research Fellowship [100556/B/12/Z],Wellcome Trust Society & Ethics Research Fellowship(Wellcome Trust),This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Society & Ethics Research Fellowship [grant number 100556/B/12/Z].,,77,20,26,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In spite of these allowances, the GMM estimator considered is shown to be asymptotically unbiased, root N-consistent, and asymptotically normal for all values of the autoregressive (AR) coefficient, rho, including unity, making it a natural candidate for unit root inference.

Public debates in countries like Britain, Australia and the US have subsequently focused on the ostensible coming of age of generation rent', constituted of younger individuals excluded from home buying and traditional routes to housing asset accumulation. While the focus of this paper is the significance of access to housing assets as a means to offset potential economic and welfare precarity, our concern is landlords rather than tenants. Drawing on British survey data, we show that the rental boom has been accompanied by increasing multiple property ownership among classes of largely middle-aged and relatively affluent households. Over one-million small-time landlords have emerged in the last decade alone, who, we argue, are part product of historic developments in housing markets and welfare states. Generations of British have not only been orientated towards their homes as commodity assets, they have also begun to mobilise around multi-property accumulation in a context of shifting welfare and pension expectations.","[Ronald, Richard; Kadi, Justin] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Ctr Urban Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ronald, Richard] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Social Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Kadi, Justin] Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Inst European Urban Studies, Weimar, Germany",University of Amsterdam; University of Birmingham; Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar,"Ronald, R (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Ctr Urban Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Ronald, R (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Social Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",r.ronald@uva.nl,"Ronald, Richard/A-3412-2011","Ronald, Richard/0000-0003-3263-8204",European Research Council [StG Grant HOUWEL] [283881],European Research Council [StG Grant HOUWEL],"This research was supported through the European Research Council [StG Grant HOUWEL, No. 283881].",,82,82,83,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A sizeable minority of 37% of dual-users reported viewing electronic and conventional cigarettes primarily as complements. Of those who had never smoked or used electronic cigarettes, only 27% thought the complementarity motive would be primary. Dual-user motivations were associated with quit-attempt, cessation methods, gender and age. 1 year on, there was a positive relationship between the level of complementarity in the dual-user's motives and their change in self-reported traditional cigarette consumption.

We make four main contributions to the existing literature. First, our characterisation of knowledge context provides the basis for a more specific identification of which elements of firms' knowledge environment are important for innovation, discriminating between spatial, sectoral and network influences. Second, we reflect the role of innovation ambition in shaping firms' knowledge search strategies. Third, we differentiate between firms' interactive and non-interactive knowledge search activities and recognise that these may be complemented by unanticipated and serendipitous knowledge spillovers. Finally, we employ the notion of encoding capacity to reflect firms' internal ability to assimilate and apply external knowledge, and clarify its distinctiveness from the more general concept of absorptive capacity. Our framework provides an integrating mechanism for existing empirical studies, and suggests a number of new research directions related to the determinants of innovation performance and the heterogeneity of innovation outcomes.","[Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Enterprise Res Ctr, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Love, James H.] Univ Leeds, Enterprise Res Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Love, James H.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Roper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Enterprise Res Ctr, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Roper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",stephen.roper@wbs.ac.uk,"ALTUN, Emin/ITV-0133-2023",,"Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) [ES/K006614/1]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); Innovate UK; British Business Bank","Enterprise Research Centre (ERC); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); British Business Bank","This work has been supported by the Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) [grant number ES/K006614/1].

METHODS: A large online survey was conducted using DCE with cost on UK respondents from the general population (n = 1497) and individuals with diabetes (n = 405). The data were modeled using a conditional logit model with robust standard errors. The marginal rate of substitution was used to generate willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates for every state defined by the classification system. Robustness of results was assessed by including interaction effects for household income. RESULTS: There were some logical inconsistencies and insignificant coefficients for the milder levels of some attributes. There were some differences in the rank ordering of different attributes for the general population and diabetic patients. The WTP to avoid the most severe state was 1118.53 per month for the general population and 2356.02 per month for the diabetic patient population. The results were largely robust. CONCLUSIONS: Health and self-management can be valued in a single classification system using DCE with cost. The marginal rate of substitution for key attributes can be used to inform cost-benefit analysis of self-management interventions in diabetes using results from clinical studies in which this new classification system has been applied. The method shows promise, but found large WTP estimates exceeding the cost levels used in the survey. Copyright (c) 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

These regulations misallocate labor across firms and hence reduce aggregate productivity. The author then considers a case study of labor laws in France, where firms with 50 employees or more face substantially more regulation than firms with fewer than 50. The size distribution of firms is visibly distorted by these regulations: There are many firms with exactly 49 employees. A quantitative model is developed with a payroll tax of 0.15 percent that applies only to firms with more than 50 employees. Removing the regulation while holding total employment constant leads to an increase in output of around 0.3 percent.","[Roys, Nicolas] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA; [Roys, Nicolas] Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Roys, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA.;Roys, N (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England.",,"Roys, Nicolas/K-6863-2016",,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

These quantiles can be difficult to estimate in practice. This article uses a minimum distance approach to estimate them that is easy to compute. A version of our estimator is a solution to a nonlinear least-square problem that can be straightforwardly programmed on softwares such as STATA. We show our estimator is consistent and has an asymptotic normal distribution. Its distribution can be consistently estimated by a bootstrap. Our estimator can be used to estimate the cost distribution nonparametrically on a larger support when prices from heterogenous markets are available. We propose a two-step sieve estimator for that case. The first step estimates quantiles from each market. They are used in the second step as generated variables to perform nonparametric sieve estimation. We derive the uniform rate of convergence of the sieve estimator that can be used to quantify the errors incurred from interpolating data across markets. To illustrate we use online bookmaking odds for English football leagues' matches (as prices) and find evidence that suggests search costs for consumers have fallen following a change in the British law that allows gambling operators to advertise more widely.

This paper traces the political identities of the inhabitants of a region at war - the Donbas - on the basis of original survey data that cover the four parts of the population that once made up this region: the population of the Kyiv-controlled Donbas, the population of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, the internally displaced, and those who fled to the Russian Federation. The survey data map the parallel processes of a self-reported polarization of identities and the preservation or strengthening of civic identities. Language categories matter for current self-identification, but they are not cast in narrow ethnolinguistic terms, and feeling more Ukrainian and Ukrainian citizenship include mono- and bilingual conceptions of native language (i.e. Ukrainian and Russian).","[Sasse, Gwendolyn] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Sasse, Gwendolyn; Lackner, Alice] Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOiS, Berlin, Germany; [Lackner, Alice] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Sociol, Berlin, Germany",University of Oxford; Free University of Berlin,"Sasse, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.;Sasse, G (通讯作者)，Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOiS, Berlin, Germany.",gwendolyn.sasse@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS),Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS),The survey on which this paper is based was funded by the Centre for East European and International Studies (ZOiS).,,55,62,62,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Contesting the claims of neo-liberal theorists and politicians as to its post-racial' character, it seeks to both historise the significance of racism within neo-liberalism through its connections to liberal political thought and practice over the longue duree and examine the relationship between neo-liberalism and far right politics. It does this through (1) highlighting the political significance of the far right in securing the electoral-political hegemony of neo-liberalism within Britain and the United States since the early 1980s; and (2) the way in which the socio-economic insecurities produced by neo-liberalism have helped to provoke far right responses as an alternative form of racialised moral economy. Consequently, while the relationship between the far right and neo-liberalism is contradictory, racial signifiers and racism have provided an important means through which such contradictions have been eased.","[Saull, Richard] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Saull, R (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London E1 4NS, England.",r.g.saull@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,119,11,11,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Since then, the growth of intermediated asset management and consolidation in the asset management sector has led to more pronounced common-ownership links at the level at which corporate control is exercised. Recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature's prediction that common-ownership concentration (CoOCo) can affect product market outcomes. The resulting antitrust concerns have received worldwide attention. However, because CoOCo can change the objective function of a firm, the potential implications span all fields of economics that involve corporate conduct, including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and financial economics.

Perspectives of Bangladeshi Women,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RURAL CREDIT PROGRAMS; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PHYSICAL VIOLENCE; GENDER; RISK; RESOURCES; MARRIAGE; AUTONOMY,"Studies addressing the relationship between women's empowerment and intimate partner violence (IPV) have yielded conflicting findings. Some suggest that women's economic and social empowerment is associated with an increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), arguably because men use often IPV to enforce their dominance and reassert inegalitarian gender norms when patriarchal norms are challenged; other studies suggest the converse. It is important to understand why these findings are contradictory to create a more sound basis for designing both women's empowerment interventions and anti-violence interventions. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between women's empowerment and IPV in a setting where gender roles are rapidly changing and IPV rates are high. We examine some of the ways in which the nature of women's empowerment evolved in six villages in rural Bangladesh during a 12-year period in which surveys have documented a decline of 11 points in the percentage of married women experiencing IPV in the prior year. The paper is.based on data from 74 life history narratives elicited from 2011 to 2013 with recently married Bangladeshi women from the six villages, whom other community residents identified as empowered. Our findings suggest that women's empowerment has evolved in several ways that may be contributing to reductions in IPV: in its magnitude (for example, many women are earning more income than they previously did), in women's perceived exit options from abusive marriages, in the propensity of community members to intervene when IPV occurs, and in the normative status of empowerment (it is less likely to be seen as transgressive of gender norms). The finding that community-level perceptions of empowered women can evolve over time may go a long way in explaining the discrepant results in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It expands an economic model of regional unemployment from labour economics and an autoregressive model from econometrics by employing port potentials separately estimated in a Tobit model. The result indicates that port activities significantly reduce regional unemployment rates relative to the national level. The role of population, gross domestic product (GDP) and household income on unemployment rate was highlighted, whilst various determinants of port potentials were investigated about whether they stimulate port potentials.","[Seo, Young-Joon] Plymouth Univ, Plymouth Grad Sch Management, Fac Business, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Park, Jin Suk] Coventry Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Accounting, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Plymouth; Coventry University,"Park, JS (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Accounting, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",y.seo@plymouth.ac.uk; jin.park@coventry.ac.uk,"Park, Jin Suk/AAD-8661-2020; Park, Jin Suk/IUQ-1364-2023; Seo, Young-Joon/AAY-6105-2021","Park, Jin Suk/0000-0001-5317-0378; Park, Jin Suk/0000-0001-5317-0378; Seo, Young-Joon/0000-0002-9981-8106",,,,,39,14,14,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Boundary tightening was shown to significantly improve the quality of the finally balanced SUTs well beyond that of existing techniques. Most notably, improvements occurred when boundary tightening was applied prior to the balancing process - showing that it can be used as a valuable preliminary to other approaches. It also multiplied the improvement in SUTs quality when more accurate updated information was added to the SUTs. The findings of this paper strongly suggest that this boundary tightening algorithm will improve the quality of the output of the balancing process and it is equally likely to be useful when applied to other processes that handle uncertain data.","[Serpell, Martin C.] Univ West England, Dept Comp Sci & Creat Technol, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Serpell, MC (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Dept Comp Sci & Creat Technol, Bristol, Avon, England.",martin2.serpell@uwe.ac.uk,"Kolisnyk, Mykyta/HTT-4095-2023",,University of the West of England,University of the West of England,This work was supported by the University of the West of England.,,30,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

However, stock market performance does not appear to have a positive impact on executive compensation. We further find that ownership concentration is positively related with CEO compensation, indicating some kind of collusion between management and largest shareholder to get personal benefits. Inconsistent with agency theory, CEO duality appears to have a negative influence, while board size and board independence have no convincing relationship with CEO compensation, indicating board ineffectiveness in reducing CEO entrenchment.

This study is the first to comprehensively and at a large scale (14 European countries) measure the social inequalities in the number of natural teeth (an informative oral health marker) in the over 50-year-old population and to investigate the extent to which such inequalities are attributable to dental service use. Using Wave 5 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, which included internationally harmonized information on over 50,000 individuals across 14 European countries, we calculated Gini and Concentration indices (CI) as well as the decompositions of CIs by socioeconomic factors. Sweden consistently performed the best with the lowest inequalities as measured by Gini (0.1078), CI by income (0.0392), CI by education (0.0407), and CI by wealth (0.0296). No country performed the worst in all inequality measures. However, unexpectedly, some wealthier countries (e.g., the Netherlands and Denmark) had higher degrees of inequalities than less-wealthy countries (e.g., Estonia and Slovenia). Decomposition analysis showed that income, education, and wealth contributed substantially to the inequalities, and dental service use was an important contributor even after controlling for income and wealth. The study highlighted the importance of comprehensively investigating oral health inequalities. The results are informative to policymakers to derive country-specific health policy recommendations to reduce oral health inequalities in the older population and also have implications for oral health improvement of the future generations.","[Shen, Jing] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Listl, Stefan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Qual & Safety Oral Care, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Listl, Stefan] Heidelberg Univ, Translat Hlth Econ, Heidelberg, Germany",Newcastle University - UK; Radboud University Nijmegen; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Shen, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",jing.shen@newcastle.ac.uk,"Listl, Stefan/S-7600-2017","Listl, Stefan/0000-0002-8176-3397",Wellcome Trust [2014/16],Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust),"The work was conceived during Dr. Jing Shen's research visit to Heidelberg University, Germany.

Unlike the existing measures, ours are able to detect and quantify nonlinear causal effects. The new measures are based on nonparametric regressions and defined as logarithmic functions of restricted and unrestricted mean square forecast errors. They are easily and consistently estimated by replacing the unknown mean square forecast errors by their nonparametric kernel estimates. We derive the asymptotic normality of nonparametric estimator of causality measures, which we use to build tests for their statistical significance. We establish the validity of smoothed local bootstrap that one can use in finite sample settings to perform statistical tests. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed test has good finite sample size and power properties for a variety of data-generating processes and different sample sizes. Finally, the empirical importance of measuring nonlinear causality in mean is also illustrated. We quantify the degree of nonlinear predictability of equity risk premium using variance risk premium. Our empirical results show that the variance risk premium is a very good predictor of risk premium at horizons less than 6 months. We also find that there is a high degree of predictability at the 1-month horizon, that can be attributed to a nonlinear causal effect.

High-risk women included those with locally advanced (including inflammatory) breast cancer and women with high-risk early-stage breast cancer (classified as T2/3 or N1). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the Evidence Review Group and the outcome of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. The clinical data were mainly taken from a phase II, randomised, open-label, active controlled study (NeoSphere), which reported a significant advantage in terms of pathological complete response rates of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, compared with trastuzumab alone with chemotherapy (45.8 vs. 29.0%, p = 0.0141). The company did not make any indirect comparisons. A meta-analysis of 12 neoadjuvant studies investigating the relationship between pathological complete response and event-free survival was used to extrapolate the outcomes reported in the NeoSphere study. A cardiac safety study (TRYPHAENA) demonstrated the safety of pertuzumab. The company undertook a model-based economic evaluation of neoadjuvant pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel over a lifetime horizon from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be A 20,104 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained for pertuzumab alongside trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with trastuzumab and docetaxel, which was revised to A 21,869 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained following the clarification process. The Evidence Review Group corrected an error in the digitisation of the survivor functions and modified the clinically inappropriate assumption that recurrence is zero after 7 years. The Evidence Review Group's probabilistic base case was A 23,962 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained. During the appraisal, to mitigate the uncertainties associated with the evidence, the company offered a patient access scheme, which led to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee recommending pertuzumab in this patient group, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the patient access scheme.","[Squires, Hazel; Pandor, Abdullah; Thokala, Praveen; Stevens, John W.; Kaltenthaler, Eva; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Coleman, Robert; Wyld, Lynda] Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol & Metab, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Squires, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",h.squires@sheffield.ac.uk,"Coleman, Robert/E-4346-2019; Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022; Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/69/11 STA]; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-1209-10071] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 15/69/11 STA).

For instance, by allowing expectations about the future to become more harmonized and orderly, they act as stabilizers for the provision of liquidity. Conventions might, of course, change at any time. Nonetheless, by being attached to the daily trading routine and/or integrated within the institutional structure, the confidence in their relevance and validity can be long-lasting. In the foreign exchange market, in particular, where prices are quoted to end-users on demand, market-making banks rely on a convention to quote prices to each other to maintain liquidity. However, the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency trading poses a practical as well as a theoretical challenge to such conventions. By reacting ultra-fast to new information, including to new limit orders submitted by others, markets largely populated with algorithmic traders have become susceptible to a withdrawal of liquidity at an unprecedented speed and scale. Using a high-frequency dataset provided by Electronic Broking Services (EBS), we investigate the process of liquidity withdrawal from the foreign exchange spot market. By doing so, we consider the crowding out of conventions associated with liquidity provision, traditionally upheld through mutual understanding among financial institutions - in other words, reciprocity and trust among humans.","[Stenfors, Alexis] Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Susai, Masayuki] Nagasaki Univ, Int Finance, Nagasaki, Japan",University of Portsmouth; Nagasaki University,"Stenfors, A (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",,,"Stenfors, Alexis/0000-0002-1266-7051",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285070] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,26,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

A well-known consequence for US antitrust of their scholarship was for greater determinations of legality through the ad hoc, conduct-specific analysis of the rule of reason standard, inspiring advocacy for a similarly more economic approach to EU competition law. But although supporting the substantive economic outcomes of overturning rules of per se illegality, Bork, Posner, Easterbrook, and other Chicagoans routinely and consistently rejected this form of market intervention for determining legality. Rather than ex post effects-based analysis, the Chicagoan approach was to incorporate economics ex ante into the design of generalized norms (rules, presumptions, structured tests) to thereby foster legal certainty and administrability, virtues associated with the formal rule of law. The overlooked importance of the formal rule of law ideal can be discerned from Bork and Easterbrook's antitrust writing, Posner's economic analysis of law, and even traced back to the foundational scholarship of the Chicago School of economics. Reemphasizing the importance of legal form in Chicagoan writing challenges their common contemporary portrayal, supporters of a particular version of more economic European enforcement, and the supposedly neo-Chicago approach.","[Stones, Ryan R.] City Univ London, Law, London, England",City University London,"Stones, RR (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Law, London, England.",Ryan.Stones@city.ac.uk,,"Stones, Ryan/0000-0003-4422-181X",LSE,LSE,"This article is drawn from my PhD thesis undertaken at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Regional Studies. An extensive literature has emerged in regional studies linking organization-based measures of entrepreneurship (e.g., self-employment, new start-ups) to regional economic performance. A limitation of the extant literature is that the measurement of entrepreneurship is not able to incorporate broader conceptual views, such as behaviour, of what actually constitutes entrepreneurship. This paper fills this gap by linking the underlying and also more fundamental and encompassing entrepreneurship culture of regions to regional economic performance. The empirical evidence suggests that those regions exhibiting higher levels of entrepreneurship culture tend to have higher employment growth. Robustness checks using causal methods confirm this finding. ,Regional Studies. ,(),,,,,, RESUMECulture de entrepreneuriat, retombees du savoir, et l'expansion des regions. Regional Studies.

La presente communication comble cette lacune, en etablissant un lien entre la culture sous-jacente, mais aussi plus fondamentale et globale, de l'entrepreneuriat, et les performances economiques regionales.

It has been observed that typical CAT bond premiums have changed since the recent financial crisis, which has been attributed to market participants being increasingly risk averse. In this work, we first propose a new premium principle, the financial loss premium principle, which includes a term measuring losses in the financial market that we represent here by the Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE) of the negative daily log-return of the S&P 500 index. Our analysis of empirical evidence suggests indeed that in the post-crisis market, instead of simply increasing the fixed level of risk load universally, the increased risk aversion should be modeled jointly by a fixed level of risk load and a financial loss factor to reflect trends in the financial market. This new premium principle is shown to be flexible with respect to the confidence/exceedance level of CTE. In the second part, we focus on the particular example of extreme wildfire risk. The distribution of the amount of precipitation in Fort McMurray, Canada, which is a very important factor in the occurrence of wildfires, is analyzed using extreme value modeling techniques. A wildfire bond with parametric trigger of precipitation is then designed to mitigate extreme wildfire risk, and its premium is predicted using an extreme value analysis of its expected loss. With an application to the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, we demonstrate that the extreme value model is sensible, and we further analyze how our results and construction can be used to provide a design framework for CAT bonds which may appeal to (re) insurers and investors alike.","[Stupfler, Gilles] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Yang, Fan] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Nottingham; University of Waterloo,"Yang, F (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",gilles.stupfler@nottingham.ac.uk; fan.yang@uwaterloo.ca,"Stupfler, Gilles/AAA-2283-2021","Stupfler, Gilles/0000-0003-2497-9412",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [04242],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees for their constructive and helpful remarks which resulted in significant improvements to this paper.

The cartel overcharge is larger the lower the entry cost and the larger the market size, and is independent of the degree of product differentiation. These theoretical results are consistent with evidence from a natural experiment of policy reform, the introduction of cartel law in the UK in the late 1950s. Price-cost margins declined after the breakdown of cartels in low-capital and larger-sized industries relative to capital intensive and smaller-sized ones. There is weaker evidence of a fall in price-cost margins in consumer good and advertising-intensive relative to producer good and low-advertising industries. Crucially, these effects are not observed for industries that were not affected by the cartel law. A comparison of these findings with evidence on the incidence of collusion suggests that the welfare loss from collusive pricing may often be smaller in industries where cartels tend to form than in those where collusion is more difficult to sustain.

This occurs through two sorting mechanisms. First, availability of public goods leads to higher population densities. Second, population groups sort according to their preferences for public goods. We develop a structural spatial general equilibrium model that accounts for these effects. The model is estimated using data on transport infrastructure, commuting behaviour, land use and land rents for some 3000 ZIP-codes in the Netherlands and for three levels of education. Welfare benefits of investments in public transport infrastructure are shown to differ sharply by workers' educational attainment. Welfare gains from changes in land use account for up to 30% of the total benefits of a transport investment.","[Teulings, Coen N.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Teulings, Coen N.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Teulings, Coen N.; de Groot, Henri L.

However, policy choices, such as Germany's decision to open its borders for Syrian refugees in 2015, can also have a significant impact on the number of arrivals and constitute a puzzle that traditional approaches struggle to explain. This paper demonstrates that viewing refugee burden-sharing through the lens of public goods theory can provide significant insights about refugee protection dynamics in the EU, in particular in the context of a sudden mass influx of migrants that threatens internal security. By highlighting how free-riding and burden-shifting dynamics can undermine the provision of collective goods during a refugee crisis, a public goods approach can advance our understanding of why countries sometimes accept disproportionate responsibilities for forced migrants and how the effectiveness of EU refugee burden-sharing instruments can, and should, be strengthened.","[Thielemann, Eiko] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Thielemann, E (通讯作者)，LSE, London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Polit & Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.thielemann@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,63,75,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Based on a large data-set of ultra-high-frequency transaction prices time-stamped to the millisecond of the S&P500 index and its two most liquid tracking ETFs, we find that their lead-lag relationship is affected by the rate of information arrival whose proxy is the unexpected trading volume of these instruments. Specifically, when information arrives, the leadership of the leading instrument may strengthen or weaken depending on whether the leading or lagging instrument responds to that information. An increase in the unexpected volume of the leader strengthens its leadership whereas an increase in the unexpected volume of the lagger weakens this leadership. In addition to the strength of leadership, an increase in the unexpected volume in response to information arrival may also have opposite effects on the lead-lag correlation coefficient depending on whether that volume increase belongs to the leader or the lagger. Finally, we find that sophisticated investors have a more significant effect on the lead-lag relationship than non-sophisticated ones.","[Thong Minh Dao; McGroarty, Frank; Urquhart, Andrew] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Solent University; University of Southampton,"Dao, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",tmd2g13@soton.ac.uk,,"McGroarty, Frank/0000-0003-2962-0927; URQUHART, ANDREW/0000-0001-8834-4243; Dao, Thong/0000-0002-1926-495X",,,,,48,7,7,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), critically reviewed the company's submission. Clinical effectiveness evidence for the company's analysis was derived from an open-label, randomised controlled trial, JGDG. The analysis was based on a partitioned survival model with a time horizon of 25 years, and the perspective was of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year. Given the available evidence, olaratumab is likely to meet NICE's end-of-life criteria. To improve the cost effectiveness of olaratumab, the company offered a discount through a Commercial Access Agreement (CAA) with the NHS England. When the discount was applied, the mean base-case and probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus the standard-of-care doxorubicin were A 46,076 pound and A 47,127 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively; the probability of this treatment being cost effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of A 50,000 pound per QALY gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments, was 0.54. The respective ICERs from the ERG's analysis were approximately A 60,000 pound/QALY gained, and the probability of the treatment being cost effective was 0.21. In August 2017, the NICE Appraisal Committee recommended olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin for this indication for use via the UK Cancer Drugs Fund under the agreed CAA until further evidence being collected in the ongoing phase III trial-ANNOUNCE-becomes available in December 2020.","[Tikhonova, Irina A.; Jones-Hughes, Tracey; Dunham, James; Warren, Fiona C.; Robinson, Sophie; Hoyle, Martin] Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Exeter, Devon, England; [Stephens, Peter] Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Fdn Trust, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Tikhonova, IA (通讯作者)，Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp PenTAG, Exeter, Devon, England.",I.Tikhonova@exeter.ac.uk,"Robinson, Sophie/IWU-5135-2023; Warren, Fiona/AGE-5194-2022","Warren, Fiona/0000-0002-3833-0182; Tikhonova, Irina/0000-0003-2723-0802; Hoyle, Martin/0000-0001-5593-9777; Robinson, Sophie/0000-0003-0463-875X",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [16/54/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project Number 16/54/11).

Since that original workshop, and against a consolidated neoliberal capitalist context, the political rise of fascistic movements has intensified across the globe. Our collective provocation here is that this current conjuncture cannot be explained with reference to the exceptional intrusion of racism, nor the epiphenomenal status of race in relation to political economy. Instead we attend to how race functions in structural and agential ways, integrally reproducing raced markets and social conditions. Our Introduction opens this conversation for New Political Economy readers, positioning neoliberalism and the current conjuncture as the present political economic moment to be understood through a raced market frame of analysis. Our hope is that this special issue will be read as a timely intervention, referencing a long tradition of (often marginalised) thought which attends to race as productive and material, rather than confined to the ideological realm.","[Tilley, Lisa] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London, England; Queen Mary Univ London, Int Relat, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Tilley, L (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London, England.",l.tilley@qmul.ac.uk,,"Tilley, Lisa/0000-0001-8805-2398",Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2017-683],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),This work was supported by The Leverhulme Trust [grant number ECF-2017-683].,,43,101,104,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy in the context of the United Kingdom (UK) healthcare system. Methods: A Markov cohort model consisting of four health states (Stable after index stroke, Post-Minor Recurrent Stroke, Post-Moderate Recurrent Stroke, and Death) was developed to simulate the economic outcomes of device-based PFO closure compared to medical therapy. Recurrent stroke event rates were extracted from a randomized clinical trial (RESPECT) with a median of 5.9-year follow-up. Health utilities and costs were obtained from published sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess robustness. The model was discounted at 3.5% and reported in 2016 Pounds Sterling. Results: Compared with medical therapy alone and using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 20,000 pound, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness at 4.2 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at 4, 10, and 20 years were 20,951 pound, 6,887 pound, and 2,158 pound, respectively. PFO closure was cost-effective for 89% of PSA iterations at year 10. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust. Conclusions: Considering the UK healthcare system perspective, percutaneous PFO closure in cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients is a cost-effective stroke prevention strategy compared to medical therapy alone. Its cost-effectiveness was driven by substantial reduction in recurrent strokes and patients' improved health-related quality-of-life.","[Tirschwell, David L.] Harborview Med Ctr, UW Med Stroke Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359775, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Turner, Mark] Univ Hosp Bristol, Bristol Heart Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Thaler, David] Tufts Med Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Choulerton, James] Royal United Hosp, Bath, Avon, England; [Marks, David] Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Carroll, John] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Aurora, CO USA; [MacDonald, Lee] South Denver Cardiol Associates PC, Littleton, CO USA; [Smalling, Richard W.] UT Hlth McGovern Med Sch, Mem Hermann Heart & Vasc Inst, Houston, TX USA; [Koullick, Maria; Gu, Ning Yan] Abbott, Abbott Pk, IL USA; [Saver, Jeffrey L.] Reed Neurol Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA",Harborview Medical Center; University of Bristol; Tufts Medical Center; Medical College of Wisconsin; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Vascular,"Tirschwell, DL (通讯作者)，Harborview Med Ctr, UW Med Stroke Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359775, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",tirsch@uw.edu,"Turner, Mark S/L-3798-2013; Roquer, Jaume/D-9483-2011","Tirschwell, David/0000-0002-8059-2901",Abbott,Abbott(Abbott Laboratories),This manuscript was funded by Abbott.,,37,14,14,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

By analyzing the output of Russia's two main television channels during Putin's third presidential term, we identify a range of distinctly new features that amount to a new media strategy. This involves a significant increase in the coverage of political issues through the replacement of infotainment with what we term agitainmentan ideologically inflected content that, through adapting global media formats to local needs, attempts to appeal to less engaged and even sceptical viewers. Despite the tightening of political control over the media following the annexation of Crimea, the new strategy paradoxically has strengthened the constitutive role played by the state-controlled broadcasters in the articulation of official discourse.","[Tolz, Vera] Univ Manchester, Russian & East European Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Teper, Yuri] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel",University of Manchester; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Tolz, V (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Russian & East European Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England.",VeraTolz@manchester.ac.uk,,,"UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/HO18964/1, AH/P00508X/1]; AHRC [AH/H018964/1, AH/P00508X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This article emanates from two research projects: Mediating Post - Soviet Difference: An Analysis of Russian Television Representations of Inter - Ethnic Cohesion Issues, which was funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council [project code AH/HO18964/1]; and Reframing Russia: From Cold War to Information War?, which is funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council [project code AH/P00508X/1].",,90,47,48,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

This paper examines London's development as the first Western offshore RMB centre established in 2013, drawing on original research conducted between 2013 and 2015 in London and China. The longitudinal analysis reveals that the development of RMB finance in London is characterized by selective adaptation in which state-private bargaining dynamics have shifted from strategic alignment to a bifurcation of interests. Understanding these state-finance relations has important implications for research and policy-making concerned with (offshore) financial centres and RMB internationalization.","[Topfer, Laura-Marie] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford, England; [Hall, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham, England",University of Oxford; University of Nottingham,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham, England.",Laura-Marie.Topfer@ouce.ox.ac.uk; Sarah.hall@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Topfer, Laura-Marie/0000-0002-0680-4515; Hall, sarah/0000-0001-5563-5909",British Academy Mid Career Fellowship [MD130065]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES-J500112-1]; Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG Research Award]; Oxford Clarendon Fund [OUCF-2013]; Hertford College (Mann Senior Scholarship) of the University of Oxford [HC-MSS-2015],British Academy Mid Career Fellowship; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG Research Award]; Oxford Clarendon Fund; Hertford College (Mann Senior Scholarship) of the University of Oxford,"This work was supported by a British Academy Mid Career Fellowship awarded to Sarah Hall [grant number MD130065], and by grants awarded to Laura-Marie Topfer by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES-J500112-1], the Royal Geographical Society [RGS-IBG Research Award] as well as the Oxford Clarendon Fund [grant number OUCF-2013] and Hertford College (Mann Senior Scholarship) of the University of Oxford [grant number HC-MSS-2015].",,43,31,34,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The data provide evidence on modest levels of bunching, despite several frictions working against it.

This postulate has been a main conceptual concern for 'old' institutional economics (OIE) and has lately also been tested through neoclassically inspired econometric techniques. This conceptual foundation has been confirmed in several quantitative studies on developed countries, in particular cases from the USA, Germany, and Italy. In less developed regions with a wealth of cultural heritage, particularly in South-East Europe, this postulate is still an underexplored issue from the perspective of advanced econometric approaches. Our goal is to examine the impact of the so-called South-East European cultural corridors on welfare and especially on total employment at the local or regional level. Accounting for gross value added and sectoral specialization, we examine the effect of such corridors by considering the distance to a cultural corridor: namely, the East Trans-Balkan Road (crossing Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece) as an explanatory factor for regional development, particularly employment. Using the European University Institute (EUI) European Regional Dataset (ERD), as well as the geo-data from the Cultural Corridors of the South-East Europe website, we estimate a regression model using a 2SLS instrumental variable (IV) approach, with a pooled dataset at the NUTS 3 level (Eurostat) from 1980 to 2011. We then triangulate the results by using the distance to the cultural corridor concerned as a treatment effect in a propensity-score-matching and difference-in-differences exploratory analysis. The findings confirm the importance of distance to the cultural corridor under investigation as a strong predictor for local socio-economic development. The results further suggest that the slow evolution of culture over time is likely to lead to the gradual emergence of new geographical cultural centers and a new cultural path-dependence build-up of persistence chains.","[Tubadji, Annie] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst Amsterdam, Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Poznan, Poland",University of West England; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Tubadji, A (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England.",,"Tubadji, Annie/IUP-4828-2023","Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X; Tubadji, Annie/0000-0002-6134-3520",,,,,109,8,9,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In this article, we examine the impact of major legislative changes which were designed to induce competition in the energy sector: the three liberalization packages. Competition was expected to benefit the industry by phasing out inefficient firms. EU citizens were also expected to benefit as competition was likely to promote a more efficient energy sector and more consumer choice of energy products and services. However, this legislative change occurred during a period of extreme market turmoil. We examine the impact of all these changes on the risk profile of the sector. Our results show that the liberalization legislation significantly increased systematic risk exposure of the sector, reducing its role as a defensive investment asset. We also show that commodities had relatively little impact on sector returns, but this was expected as utilities can offset commodity risk in hedging markets. We compare our results to those obtained in neighbouring EU sectors and find the impacts are isolated to the energy sector. This article makes a major contribution to energy policy by empirically showing the change in risk as a result of sector liberalization.","[Tulloch, Daniel J.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Diaz-Rainey, Ivan; Premachandra, I.

Our models control for a comprehensive set of demographic, socioeconomic, health, and work-related sickness characteristics. We run separate models for women and men, and stratify by type of occupation and by area obesity prevalence. Our results indicate that weight-related discrimination in work settings in Spain is concentrated among women with morbid obesity, particularly among those working in customer-facing jobs and living in areas with low-obesity prevalence. These findings emphasize the persistence of the gendered nature of obesity-related discrimination, and provide evidence of a form of induced statistical discrimination. Employers' expectations of lower returns from obese workers in customer facing jobs might be driven by customers' preferences caused by social stigma.

It shows that economic spaces are shaped by notions of particular space-time held by historical actors and by imaginations of their past and future fictional spaces. The case study of colonial period South Asia examines how financial accounting and other measurements were co-opted to give form to future fictional expectations. South Asian economic spaces are shown to be the locus for control and dominance of future economic relationships, which were visualized in particular ways by the colonial rulers. A conclusion reached is that economic spaces are not just enclosed spaces within borders where economic activity occurs shaped by the dominant culture and economy of a state. The economic spaces in colonial India were sites of economic conflict and violence, where contesting notions of economic time collided, and where widely contrasting economic futures were imagined. Indian nationalists looked into the past to spur their imagination of a different future for India. In fact, the conflict or violence that was part of the recasting of India's national economic space was not entirely between racial groups (European colonists and native Indians) or strictly between economic classes (bourgeoisie upper castes and proletariat lower castes). Contrary expectations amongst the nationalists themselves are apparent. The process of imagination reveals the ensemble of cultural, social, and technical practices that actors used to give form to fictional expectations of the future and the spatialisation of economic spaces.","[Velkar, Aashish] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Velkar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,"Velkar, Aashish/0000-0003-3885-8558",,,,,47,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0743-4154,,978-1-78756-423-7; 978-1-78756-424-4,RES HIST ECON THOUGH,,,2018,36,,B,,,,109,128,,10.1108/S0743-41542018000036B008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S0743-41542018000036B008,,,20,Economics; History Of Social Sciences; Philosophy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Philosophy,BQ3WW,,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-26,WOS:000588194300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regularization is a statistical approach for avoiding over-parameterization, and it can reduce estimation and predictive variances compared to MLE. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, regularization is accomplished by the use of mean-zero priors, and the degree of parsimony can be optimized by numerically efficient out-of-sample cross-validation. This provides a consistent framework for comparing a variety of regularized MCMC models, such as those built with cubic splines, linear splines (as ours is), and the limiting case of non-regularized estimation.

Using quasi experimental variation created by a tax reform, which increased taxation of partnerships substantially relative to firms of other legal form, and the population of income tax returns filed in Pakistan in 2006-11, I document that treated firms report significantly lower earnings, migrate into informality, and switch business form in response to the increase in tax rate. The revenue loss caused by these behavioral responses is so large that by the third year after the reform the government was collecting less revenue than it would have without the tax increase. This implies that the new tax rate was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve and would not have been optimal under any social preferences. The richness of the data and tax variation permits me to decompose the observed responses into real and evasion margins and to identify fiscal externalities created by the reform on other tax bases. The welfare cost of the reform increases by around 40% once these externalities are taken into account.","[Waseem, Mazhar] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Waseem, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester, Lancs, England.",mazhar.waseem@manchester.ac.uk,"Waseem, Mazhar/AAI-3230-2020","Waseem, Mazhar/0000-0002-0115-842X","International Growth Centre (IGC), Pakistan Program","International Growth Centre (IGC), Pakistan Program","I thank the Editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Economics textbooks are perhaps the sole remaining medium to simply wish away their resulting relations of power. These are the teaching aids that inspire students analytically to think of markets as pristine economic institutions and persuade them politically that they should want to will such institutions into being. Yet they all-too-often rely on the pedagogical device of the so-called Robinson Crusoe Economy, where the main characters from Defoe's most famous novel are required to instinctively recognise their equality within voluntary contracting agreements so that each can act as the neoclassical homo economicus. In other words, economists' Crusoe and Friday figures must behave antithetically to what has historically been implied by the Crusoe' and Friday' signifiers. But how can this be so, given how commonplace it was when Defoe's characters were first introduced into economic theory in the 1850s to justify white settler colonialism on the grounds that savage' societies lacked the capacity to be self-governing? The raced market frame that emerged in practice from this assumption continues to be reproduced uncritically today by Crusoe's and Friday's presence in the textbook explanation of the most basic model of market exchange.","[Watson, Matthew] Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Watson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",matthew.g.watson@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship [ES/K010697/1]; ESRC [ES/K010697/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article was written with financial assistance from an Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship.

To date, however, there has been limited exploration into whether long-run evolutionary growth paths or trajectories influence regional economic resilience and what types of trajectories might be more associated with resilience. This article explores the connections between regional economic resilience and regional and national growth trajectories by utilizing a novel set of methods to group regions according to the similarity of their growth paths, identifying the relative importance of national growth for regional growth, and categorizing regions according to their resilience to the 2007-2008 economic crisis. The results suggest that regions have empirically identifiable long-run and path-dependent development trajectories that are significantly associated with industrial employment shares and observed resilience outcomes. Critically, however, these regional growth paths are significantly shaped by national trajectories. Furthermore, regions with greater employment shares in sectors that are less susceptible to demand fluctuations are likely to experience more stable growth rates and be more resilient to economic downturns. This has implications for understanding the importance of evolutionary trends and specifically the role of national contexts and industrial legacies in shaping regional resilience.","[Webber, Don J.] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England; [Healy, Adrian; Bristow, Gillian] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of West England; Cardiff University,"Webber, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England.",Don.Webber@uwe.ac.uk; HealyA2@cardiff.ac.uk; BristowG1@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,49,53,21,159,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Evidence from Emerging Markets,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,inward FDI; corruption; emerging markets; propensity score matching,JOINT VENTURE; DIRECT-INVESTMENT; CORRUPTION; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; SUBSIDIARIES; DETERMINANTS; CHOICE; COSTS; FDI,"An extensive literature exists on the adverse effects of corruption on inward FDI and the impact this may have on economic development but the reverse causality has not been fully explored. Legislation in the US and the EU prohibits firms from engaging in corrupt practices in foreign countries and this suggests that foreign-owned firms might be less likely to pay bribes. However, such legislation may be ineffective because foreign firms have to adapt to local market conditions or risk being uncompetitive. Using firm level data for 41 emerging countries, a probit model estimates the probability that a firm pays bribes. To allow for possible endogeneity this probit analysis is repeated with an instrument to proxy for endogenous foreign ownership. Then, a propensity score matching technique tests for differences in the propensity to pay bribes by domestic and foreign firms. The paper finds no difference in the behavior of foreign owned and domestic firms with respect to corrupt practices. Results are robust to different levels of foreign ownership and support the view that foreign-owned firms adapt to local practices and are neither more nor less likely to pay bribes than comparable domestic firms. The paper finds that other variables including bureaucracy, government contracts, and perceived difficulties with civil society (legal and political) do have statistically significant effects on increasing bribery and that some others, such as per capita GDP, tend to reduce bribery. The study concludes that there is no evidence that foreign ownership, after investment has occurred, tends to reduce bribery but it does support the view that foreign owned firms adopt local behavioral norms.

SPLD enables differentiating between effects stemming from specific parts in the technology matrix, e.g. trade blocks vs. domestic blocks, while still allowing to link the various effects to the total region footprint. Using the carbon footprint of the EU-28 in 2011 as an example, we analyse the differences between EXIOBASE, Eora, GTAP and WIOD. Identical environmental data are used across all MRIO databases.

This views informal payments by patients to healthcare professionals as arising when formal institutional failures lead to an asymmetry between the laws and regulations of formal institutions and the unwritten rules of informal institutions. Reporting a 2013 Eurobarometer survey of the prevalence of informal payments by patients in Central and Eastern European countries, a strong association is revealed between the level of asymmetry between the formal and informal institutions, and the propensity to make informal payments. The association between informal payments and various formal institutional imperfections is then explored to evaluate which structural conditions might reduce this institutional asymmetry, and thus the propensity to make informal payments. The paper concludes by exploring the implications for tackling such informal practices.","[Williams, Colin C.] Univ Sheffield, SUMS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Horodnic, Adrian V.] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm, Fac Med, Iasi, Romania",University of Sheffield; Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,"Williams, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, SUMS, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",C.C.Williams@sheffield.ac.uk,"Williams, Colin C/B-1198-2016; Horodnic, Adrian V./AAN-8021-2020","Williams, Colin C/0000-0002-3610-1933; Horodnic, Adrian V./0000-0001-6274-5049",,,,,76,16,16,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30,4,,,,,440,458,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442051,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14631377.2018.1442051,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GH9MR,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-26,WOS:000433994000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a viewpoint based on analysis of the successful international expansion of a sample of Chinese EMNEs where success is measured their ability win share in overseas markets. This allows us to identify their ownership advantages, the antecedents of these advantages and how they were built using dynamic capabilities. Findings EMNEs have non-traditional ownership advantages that have been built by finding innovative ways to leverage the locational advantages of their home countries. The conversion of locational advantages into ownership advantages requires that firms build dynamic capabilities that enable them to innovate in the use of the locational advantages they enjoy. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to a small sample of EMNEs from China who have succeeded in winning market share in the initial phases of their international expansion. In the light of these limitations, the authors discuss the question the sustainability of their competitive advantage as well as the likely applicability of our findings to EMNEs from other EMNEs. Originality/value The authors revisit the paradox that despite the growth and success of multinationals from EMNEs in the past decade they are assumed to lack ownership advantages. The authors show that EMNEs' ownership advantages differ from the traditional advantages such proprietary technologies and brand equity that are enjoyed by incumbent multinationals.","[Williamson, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Int Management, Cambridge, England; [Wan, Feng] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of Cambridge; University of East Anglia,"Williamson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Int Management, Cambridge, England.",p.williamson@jbs.cam.ac.uk; f.wan@uea.ac.uk,,"Williamson, Peter/0000-0003-4894-6180",,,,,51,23,28,1,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Patient-centred education in diabetes is a radical social innovation that alters the social and medical relationship between patients and medics. This paper discusses the ways in which institutional work conducted by national and international professional associations has shaped development and diffusion of this social innovation within the Austrian health system. The case study contributes to our understanding of social innovation and institutional change in two respects. First, it highlights the need for purposive institutional work in order to disrupt pre-existing institutions and, thereby, ensure the development and diffusion of a social innovation amongst a community of medical practitioners. Second, the case shows the overtly political work, policing and educating work that professional associations undertook with funding bodies and key policy-makers in order to develop a national programme for diabetes education.","[Windrum, Paul; Waring, Justin] Univ Nottingham, CHILL, Sch Business, Nottingham, England; [Schartinger, Doris] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna, Austria",University of Nottingham; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Windrum, P (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, CHILL, Sch Business, Nottingham, England.",paul.windrum@nottingham.ac.uk,"; Waring, Justin/C-5436-2015","Schartinger, Doris/0000-0002-3460-0704; Waring, Justin/0000-0003-1459-5896",,,,,90,4,5,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We found nine main types of business systems: Highly Coordinated, Coordinated Market, Liberal Market, European Peripheral, Advanced Emerging, Advanced City, Arab Oil-Based, Emerging, and Socialist Economies. Our findings illustrate the need to go beyond the Varieties of Capitalism and Business Systems frameworks; provide empirical support for the CME versus LME dichotomy for part of the OECD; identify some of the business systems proposed recently as sub-types of larger clusters; indicate that institutional diversity may increase with development level; and cast doubt on the notions of state-led and family-led capitalism as types of business systems.

Contemplating over meat and fish delights on restaurant menus, hunting for sport and leisure purposes, and the presence of safaris and zoos have aspects in common, significantly animals are central to their existence and tourists are key consumers. Importantly, these pastimes, social activates, and leisurely pursuits have their ancestral roots that pre-date modern society. Humans have long been associated with eating meat, hunting animals and holding animals in some form of captivity for recreation and education. Distinctively, this paper explores animal cloning and how it could support the extension and existence of these tourism pursuits in the future, focusing on the year 2070. The paper applies a scenario planning approach as its methodological approach to research. The study contributes innovative and original concepts to the future tourism landscape. Through rigorous analysis and discussions in the fields of animal cloning and its relationship with tourism and tourists in potential future settings, a gap in the future market is presented. This research paper presents three scenarios in which cloning could support future tourism markets, Food tourism 2070: A Japanese restaurant perspective, Sport Hunting and tourism 2070: Designated hunting reserves in South Africa; and Safari-zoo tourism 2070: Into the Wild, cloning for education & conservation in the U.S.A.

CLSC management allows companies to manage their recovery and recycling activities of end products. Due to the latest developments in the world, producers are responsible for the collection, refurbishing, repairing and disassembly of end products at the end of their lives. This paper develops a mixed-integer CLSC model that is inspired by the automotive industry. In this model, we consider three Decision Makers (DM): Plant, Dismantler Center and Customer. Each DM has individual objectives and is responsible for only its own objective function under same constraints.

Regional Studies. Sustainability transitions in cities in emerging economic contexts are rarely addressed. The paper addresses this issue by investigating the drivers and barriers in the diffusion of solar thermal energy in two Chinese cities: Dezhou and Beijing. The findings suggest that latecomer cities such as Dezhou demonstrate several advantages over developed cities in environmental transitions. In particular they can leapfrog' to environmentally friendly technologies as they are less locked in by existing technological regimes.

Some traditionally influential Member States in EU asylum politics, such as Germany, Austria and Sweden, received large numbers of refugees and faced strong domestic pressures to engage other Member States in responsibility-sharing. Yet, governments of Member States with small application numbers (among whom several Eastern European governments were particularly vocal) had incentives to undercut responsibility-sharing to avoid similar pressures. Having a better alternative to the potentially negotiated agreement, these governments successfully blocked the introduction of permanent refugee quotas. Besides explaining the absence of an effective response to one of the root causes of the asylum crisis (unequal strains) through asymmetrical interdependence, the article further develops Liberal Intergovernmentalist arguments and shows how national electorates influence positions taken by governments at the EU level when they are mobilized by right-wing populist parties.","[Zaun, Natascha] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Zaun, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.v.zaun@lse.ac.uk,,"Zaun, Natascha/0000-0002-0436-6275",,,,,70,104,114,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In order to achieve that, three NNs, namely the Multi-Layer Perceptron, Recurrent Neural Network and the Psi Sigma Network (PSN), are applied to the task of forecasting the daily returns of three Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The statistical and trading performance of the NNs is benchmarked with the traditional Autoregressive Moving Average models. Next, a novel dynamic asymmetric copula model (NNC) is introduced in order to capture the dependence structure across ETF returns. Based on the above, weekly re-balanced portfolios are obtained and compared using the traditional mean-variance and the mean-CVaR portfolio optimization approach. In terms of the results, PSN outperforms all models in statistical and trading terms. Additionally, the asymmetric skewed t copula statistically outperforms symmetric copulas when it comes to modelling ETF returns dependence. The proposed NNC model leads to significant improvements in the portfolio optimization process, while forecasting covariance accounting for asymmetric dependence between the ETFs also improves the performance of obtained portfolios.","[Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Stasinakis, Charalampos; Sermpinis, Georgios] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Shi, Yukun] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Ken Edwards Bldg, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; University of Glasgow; University of Leicester,"Stasinakis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Charalampos.Stasinakis@glas-gow.ac.uk,,"Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657; Sermpinis, Georgios/0000-0002-7341-8913",,,,,57,9,9,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved in many countries for ADHD treatment in children, adolescents, and adults. Estimate the cost-effectiveness of LDX as a first- or second-line treatment for adults with ADHD from the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) perspective compared with methylphenidate extended release (MPH-ER) and atomoxetine (ATX). A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed. Health outcomes included response, non-response and inability to tolerate. Efficacy data were obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). Response was a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates due to adverse events. Utilities were identified via a systematic literature review. Health care resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were estimated from mean doses reported in the trials used in the MTC. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. LDX dominated MPH-ER and ATX; reducing mean per-patient annual cost by A 5 pound and A 200 pound, and increasing mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. In the PSA, the probability of cost-effectiveness for LDX vs. MPH-ER and ATX at a threshold of A 20,000 pound per QALY was 61% and 80%, respectively. From the perspective of the UK NHS, LDX is likely to provide a cost-effective treatment for adults with ADHD. This conclusion may be drawn with more certainty in comparison with ATX than with MPH-ER.","[Zimovetz, Evelina A.] RTI Hlth Solut, 2nd Floor,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England; [Joseph, Alain] Shire, Zahlerweg 10, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Ayyagari, Rajeev] Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Mauskopf, Josephine A.] RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Off Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Shire Pharmaceuticals Limited; Analysis Group Inc.; Research Triangle Institute,"Zimovetz, EA (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 2nd Floor,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England.",ezimovetz@rti.org,,"ZIMOVETZ, EVELINA/0000-0002-8939-7838; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548","Shire International GmbH, Switzerland; Shire International GmbH","Shire International GmbH, Switzerland; Shire International GmbH","All authors contributed to the study design and coordination.
